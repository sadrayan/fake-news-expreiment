Ben Carson riles up Whoopi with welfare truth; has conservatives cheering on ‘The View’
This is what America sounds like, even if libs don’t want to hear it.

Dr. Benjamin Carson made a book-promotion stop on “The View” on Tuesday, spreading the conservative gospel to a panel of co-hosts – and a viewing audience – generally more worshipful of the liberal in the White House than the liberties America was founded on.

And as he fielded occasionally unfriendly questions about his presidential aspiration and his bedrock, common-sense opposition to Obamacare and its expansion of soul-destroying welfare, Carson might not have made any converts, but he definitely planted the seeds.

“We have to help re-educate people about what America is,” he said. “America is a land for, of and by the people. It was a place where people were supposed to come to have dreams, to be able to realize their dreams. We weren’t supposed to be people who were managed.

“What we really want to do is create, or recreate, that ‘can-do’ attitude that propelled us to the top, and not that ‘what-can-you-do-for-me’ attitude that will propel us to the bottom.”

Carson concluded the eight-minute appearance with a simple statement that demolished the premise of the American welfare state – and the Obamacare leviathan emerging from it.

“When you rob someone of their incentive to go out there and improve themselves, you are not doing them any favors,” Carson said, both drawing applause and causing visible discomfort on the panel led by star and former welfare mother Whoopi Goldberg.

“What would be much more empowering is to use our intellect and our resources to give those people a way up and out.”

He might or might not run for president, but there isn’t a better spokesman for conservative values in America today.

Do yourself a favor and take a few minutes to watch the appearance here. It’s time well spent.
