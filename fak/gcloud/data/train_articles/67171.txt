“It's all a scam started by Democrats at the White House,” Boehner said at the weekly House GOP leadership press conference.

“This whole talk about impeachment is coming from the president's own staff and coming from Democrats on Capitol Hill. Why? Because they're trying to rally their own people to give money and show up in this year's elections,” Boehner said.

Boehner said the GOP does not intend to begin impeachment proceedings against Obama.

“We have no plans to impeach the president. We have no future plans,” Boehner said.

The comments went further than Boehner has previously gone in knocking down an impeachment trial balloon.

Earlier this month, asked about 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s argument that Obama should be impeached, Boehner twice said, “I disagree.”

Several House Republicans, such as Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Steve Stockman (R-Texas) and Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), have suggested that Obama deserves to be impeached.

The House is set to vote later this week on a resolution authorizing the GOP lawsuit against Obama for his use of executive action, primarily on the employer mandate delay.
