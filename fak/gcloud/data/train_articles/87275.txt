City Club transportation report corrects Sellwood Bridge info
The statistic jumped out of the Portland City Club report earlier this month detailing the snarled mess that is the region’s transportation planning and funding system.

According to the report, the proposed funding structure for a new Sellwood Bridge would require the residents of Multnomah County and the city of Portland to pay more than 10 times as much as the residents of Clackamas County, even though Clackamas County accounted for three times as many trips across the bridge.

It was a startling statistic, played up prominently in The Oregonian story and editorial about the report.



Unfortunately, it was wrong.

Apparently, researchers misread projections provided by Metro, said Tony Iaccarino, the club’s research and policy director.

What Metro projections actually show is that by 2030, 79 percent of trips across the bridge will start or end in Multnomah County and 76 percent of trips will begin or end in Clackamas County. This totals more that 100 percent because trips can begin or end in either county.

When county officials informed Iaccarino of the error, he looked into it, and the committee that prepared the report agreed to change the wording in the report to say that Portland and Multnomah County residents would pay 10 times as much to replace the bridge, even though Clackamas County accounts for almost as many trips.

“Fortunately, although our own numbers were incorrect in this instance, our larger point still stands,” Iaccarno said.
