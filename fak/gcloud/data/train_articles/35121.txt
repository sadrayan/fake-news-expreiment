Dean Heller for US Senate
Las Vegas, NV – Jacky Rosen sided with her progressive San Francisco boss earlier today and voted against a bipartisan Balanced Budget Amendment that would bring fiscal responsibility and force Congress to live within its means – something Nevada families do on a daily basis.

Rosen proved to Nevadans once again that she will always have Nancy Pelosi’s back, and this time it has come at the expense of future generations.

Sen. Dean Heller has championed a Balanced Budget Amendment, and has worked tirelessly to rein in out-of-control government spending that has exploded the national debt and hindered economic growth. And while Congress has continuously failed to pass a budget, Heller has fought to pass his No Budget, No Pay Act to withhold members’ pay until they did so.

Instead of showing fiscal discipline, Rosen would rather balance the budget on the backs of hardworking Nevada families by repealing the recently passed middle-class tax cut.

“Jacky Rosen may talk tough about being responsible with our tax dollars, but she didn’t hesitate to appease her progressive bosses and vote against Congress living within its means,” Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said. “Once again, while Sen. Heller leads on an important issue, Jacky Rosen has shown she is nothing more empty words and broken promises.”
