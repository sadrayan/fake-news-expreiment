Claim: According to the CNN transcripts, Patrick twice said that in lieu of the manufacturer bailouts, the federal government should send $5,000 vouchers to families to be applicable to vehicle purchases.

Response: In the same interview, Dan stated that he was against all the bailouts. He was suggesting that if you really wanted to move cars off the lot to stimulate economy and help the middle class it would be better to just send each family a voucher for $5000 that could only be used to buy a car instead of bailing out the industry. It was not a proposal or something he would support, but rather making the point that if the Federal Government felt they had to do something to save the auto industry, this would be a better and cheaper idea.

Again read what Dan said - "I'm not in favor of any of these bailouts"

Here is a direct quote from the script of the Dobbs show:

I'm not in favor of any of these bailouts but I would rather see let's bail out the middle class that you had a story earlier in the show that's being hammered. Give each family a voucher for $5,000 that can only be used if they buy a new truck or automobile.
