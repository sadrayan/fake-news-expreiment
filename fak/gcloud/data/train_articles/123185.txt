Most stimulus jobs in education so far: Oregon State University
When the state reported this morning how federal stimulus money has been spent so far, I expected the state's largest school district -- Portland Public Schools -- to have gotten the most money and created the most jobs of any education outlet in the state.But I was wrong. According to the state's figures, Oregon State University has preserved or created the equivalent of 394 full-time jobs by spending $17.8 million of state fiscal stabilization funds.

Portland schools, for their part, have created or saved 324 full-time jobs, many in special education, with $10.2 million of their stimulus money, the state says.

Portland State University comes in next, with 320 jobs created or saved. Mike Green, Oregon's associate vice chancellor for finance, explains that the university system ranked high in job preservation because it spent all its general-purpose stimulus money -- some $52 million so far -- on faculty salaries and benefits, so every dime saved or created a teaching or research job.

Beaverton schools, the state's third-biggest school district, report they saved or created 281 jobs with stimulus money, primarily with general purpose fiscal stabilization money.

Education sector jobs figured huge in today's stimulus report. Nearly two of every three jobs paid for by stimulus spending in Oregon since February were education jobs, primarily for teachers and professors, the state reported.

The state's way of reporting the numbers is hard to follow. I'll use that as my excuse for getting some of my facts mixed up in my earlier post, including understating the jobs created or saved at Portland Public Schools. Read Tuesday's Oregonian for a definitive take by my colleague Harry Esteve.
