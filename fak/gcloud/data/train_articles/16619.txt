Here is a chart that I thought you’d find useful. Fyi, I didn’t receive your emails because you had the wrong email address for me. Information like this can be accessed from the National Seizure System (NSS) housed by the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC). We don’t have the stats for 2017 yet. I hope this helps.

200% increase since when. (See chart below)

DSS information maintained by EPIC

Border seizure data usually falls under the custom and border patrol, DEA processes seizures made by the aforementioned agency and sends the drugs to DEA labs to be analyzed.

The DEA 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment might have information you can use for this project as well.
