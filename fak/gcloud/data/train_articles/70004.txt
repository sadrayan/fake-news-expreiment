Healthcare Bill Threatens Older Americans with Preexisting Conditions
Congressional leaders have brought back the terrible healthcare bill, and it's even worse than before!

Unless we do something, they could pass an age tax that could cost you up to $13,000 per year, weaken Medicare, give billions away to special interests, and end protections for 25 million Americans between 50-64 with preexisting conditions like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.

Oh, and did we mention – Congress is exempting themselves from any change to the preexisting conditions protections. Outrageous and unacceptable.

The vote could happen as soon as Friday – and we need each and every one of you to speak up. Call 1-844-259-9352 today and tell your Representative to kill this terrible bill, once and for all.

It's no surprise that special interests and their allies in Congress aren't giving up on this terrible bill. But neither will AARP's 38 million members. Let's remind them that they work for us, and that we're ready to hold them accountable.

Tell your representative to stand firm
