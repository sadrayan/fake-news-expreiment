[1966] "Black Friday" (day after Thanksgiving)

Because it's never too early to be thinking about Thanksgiving and Black Friday, I submit what follows as a nail in the coffin of that "from red ink to black ink" explanation for how this particular Friday got its name. By the way, Google Books provided a not-very-helpful snippet view of the following advertisement, which appeared in the January 1966 issue (Volume 79, No. 4, p. 239) of *The American Philatelist*. Thanks go to Ellen Peachey of the American Philatelic Research Library (Bellefonte, Pennsylvania); she came to the rescue, locating the text in question and sending the appropriate PDF to me, all with good humor. -- Bonnie ----------------------------------------------------------- [This advertisement is in the form of a column written by Martin L. Apfelbaum, Executive Vice President of Earl P.L. Apfelbaum, Inc., of Philadelphia. PDF available upon request.] *Philadelphia's "Black Friday"* JANUARY 1966 -- "Black Friday" is the name which the Philadelphia Police Department has given to the Friday following Thanksgiving Day. It is not a term of endearment to them. "Black Friday" officially opens the Christmas shopping season in center city, and it usually brings massive traffic jams and over-crowded sidewalks as the downtown stores are mobbed from opening to closing. This year proved to be no exception -- especially at Apfelbaum's. The pace was hectic and the traffic was heavy. Here's a capsule report of how Apfelbaum's weathered "Black Friday." [...] All in all, "Black Friday" certainly lived-up to its reputation. In fact it lasted for two days, with more of the same traffic and congestion the Saturday which followed. Is this activity unusual? A little. But just stop in on any day of the week and you will see more action at Apfelbaum's than at any stamp shop in the world. ------------------------------------------------------------ The American Dialect Society - http://www.americandialect.org
