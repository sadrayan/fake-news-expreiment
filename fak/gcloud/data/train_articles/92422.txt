Car Congestion Increases With Light Rail
One major claimed benefit of the Greenlight Pinellas proponents is that the train will decrease congestion on our local roads and highways. However, this claim is entirely false and data from a variety of cities prove that rail systems are associated with increased congestion. Furthermore, when rail lines are constructed, they are known to take actual paved lanes away from cars and money away from roads, both of which increase congestions. The recent No Tax for Tracks TV commercial urging a “No Vote” on Greenlight Pinellas pointed out that it was “FALSE” that rail will decrease congestion. Here is data that supports that assertion. (Can Greenlight Pinellas show any facts that prove that traffic congestion decreases with rail? We are all waiting.)
