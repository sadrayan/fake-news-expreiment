Good morning. I write seeking Attorney General Ken Paxton’s factual backup for the claim shown in this Fox News interview about crimes committed by illegal aliens, as specified by Paxton. We’re also interested in when the interview took place. Email or call?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks,

g.

Good morning,

Thank you for reaching out.

The statistics cited in the linked interview are provided to the public by Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). You can find this information and more on the DPS website here: https://www.dps.texas.gov/administration/crime_records/pages/txCriminalAlienStatistics.htm

Also, this interview took place on Sunday, August 26, as stated in the link you included below – that date is correct.

Best,

I am not spotting the 600,000 or 1,200 figures in what’s posted by the DPS. How did the attorney general arrive at those figures?

Thanks again,

G.

My apologies if the breakdown of those numbers is difficult to read. In each section on that page (separated by those identified through PEP and through TDCJ) is a description of the number of persons incarcerated and how many criminal offenses were recorded. Breakdowns of how many charges for each crime are also included.

If you’d like a breakdown that is simpler to read, the U.S. Department of Justice released this on June 7, 2018:

Immigration Status of All Convicted Aliens Incarcerated in State Prisons and Local Detention Centers Throughout the United States

Some state and local jurisdictions already take proactive measures to make this data available to the public. For example, the Texas Department of Public Safety publishes data online regarding criminal alien arrests and convictions. These data do not account for all aliens in the Texas criminal justice system, as they are limited to criminal alien arrestees who have had prior interaction with DHS resulting in the collection of their fingerprints.

As reported by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), 251,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and April 30, 2018, according to DHS status indicators. These criminal aliens were charged with:

More than 663,000 criminal offenses;

1,351 homicides;

7,156 sexual assaults;

9,938 weapons charges;

79,049 assaults;

18,685 burglaries;

79,900 drug charges;

815 kidnappings;

44,882 thefts;

4,292 robberies.

Additional conviction data can be found in the report.
