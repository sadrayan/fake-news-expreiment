The showdown between the governor and the auditor over JobsOhio is over - for now. But the controversy over the non-profit job creating entity continues. A proposal to increase Ohio's speed limit to 70 mph on rural interstate highways is part of the $7.6 billion transportation bill, which is now on its way to the Governor after clearing the House and Senate this week. The Ohio House has approved two bills that make election law changes, including one that would restrict the time groups have to collect extra signatures needed to ensure their ballot issues get before voters. With the high-profile Steubenville rape case still in the headlines, the attorney general says he wants to provide grant money for new regional coordinators to oversee comprehensive services for victims of sexual assault. And the 2014 campaign is underway, with Cuyahoga County executive Ed FitzGerald and Gov. John Kasich both making the rounds.



Gov. Kasich doesn't often do one-on-one interviews on any subject. But this week, he reached out for an opportunity to talk about the budget, which has opponents in both parties and from major groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, which testified against it. The Governor talked about the income tax cut, the sales tax expansion, the severance tax on big oil and natural gas drillers, and about his school funding plan. He also answered questions about JobsOhio.



A few hours later, House Speaker Bill Batchelder was asked about the Governor's comments and about the budget's chances of passing, which he says aren't good. The budget needs to be in place by the end of June.
