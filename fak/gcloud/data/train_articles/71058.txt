Legislative

â€‹The APA was very successful in the 2019 legislative session. The 54th Arizona State Legislature passed several bills introduced by the APA that expand and clarify officer due process rights, protects officers from bodily fluid exposures, protects police K9 officers, and raised the monetary threshold on traffic accidents.



The APA also worked to support/oppose many other bills introduced by others that impacted public safety. We are grateful for the competent and professional services of our lobbyist team of Willetta Partners, Tom Farley and Brian Tassinari.
