Apple is ditching the standard headphone jack to screw consumers and the planet
Apple is about to rip off every one of its customers. Again.

Forbes and FastCompany are reporting that Apple plans to ditch the standard 3.5mm headphone jack when it releases the iPhone 7 later this year. Only a massive international campaign can force Apple to change course now.

Not only will this force iPhone users to dole out additional cash to replace their hi-fi headphones, it will singlehandedly create mountains of electronic waste -- that likely won't get recycled. According to the United Nations, up to 90% of the world's electronic waste is illegally traded or dumped each year.

Tell Apple to respect its customers and our planet. Keep the standard headphone jack.



This is right out of the Apple corporate playbook. A few years ago it swapped out the original iPod-dock connector with a new one, making countless cords, cables and chargers obsolete.

Apple plays up its green credentials, but the truth is that Apple only invested in renewable energy, and began phasing out toxic chemicals when public pressure became too strong to ignore. People power did it before, and we can do it again.

Tell Apple to keep the standard headphone jack and ditch planned obsolescence!
