'Hocus Pocus' Sequel Rumors Are Unfounded, Disney Says
If you're a child of the 90s, a Bette Midler fan or a creepily over-enthusiastic admirer of young Omri Katz, you might want to sit down. We have some bad news. Disney is not -- despite rumors that have flown faster than Sarah Jessica Parker on a broomstick -- planning to revisit its classic 1993 Halloween musical.

"The studio is not developing a sequel to 'Hocus Pocus,'" a rep told The Huffington Post.

For those who initially missed the news debunked by this email, Moviehole reported on Friday that Disney was "quietly developing" a follow-up to "Hocus Pocus." Moviehole even claimed that the movie had a title: "Hocus Pocus 2: Rise of the Elderwitch," which instantly brought to mind spectacular visions of Betty White joining the cast as Bette Midler's slightly older sister.

Moviehole's report cast a spell over a large swath of the blogosphere over the past few days. It was picked up by Perez Hlton, MTV, NME and many others.

So unless Disney changes its mind after seeing how surprisingly popular a 19-year-old movie about soul-sucking songstresses remains, there are going to be a lot of disappointed fans out there.
