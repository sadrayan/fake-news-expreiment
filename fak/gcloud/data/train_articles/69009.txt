Governor Walker Provides Update on 2020 Vision Project Listening Sessions
Madison – Governor Scott Walker announced today that 50 listening sessions have been held throughout the state so far as a part of his 2020 Vision Project. The listening sessions bring the people of Wisconsin together for candid discussions about the issues facing their communities and the state.

“Today’s visit to Cornell marks the 50th listening session we’ve held in Wisconsin,” Governor Walker said. “Thus far, our conversations with the people of Wisconsin have been incredibly constructive. Our goal is to create a forum for our citizens to give feedback about what they think is working in Wisconsin, what our focus should be as we approach the next budget, and what the role of state government should be.”

The listening sessions are constructed to be small gatherings that enable everyone’s voice to be heard during the discussion. To date, over 1,500 people have attended the 50 sessions.

“Before every listening session, we’re in contact with area state legislators, no matter what party they represent, as well as community leaders to help us reach out and invite a good cross-section of people with different experiences and opinions,” Governor Walker added. “We also focus on ensuring those from a particular community are the primary attendees.”

Advance notice of participation is intended to ensure that there are no threatening criminal backgrounds and to avoid people whose intent is to be disruptive.

While listening sessions are closed to members of the press to encourage an honest and candid conversation between attendees, local members of the media are given the opportunity to sit down for one-on-one interviews following the listening session in the interest of transparency.
