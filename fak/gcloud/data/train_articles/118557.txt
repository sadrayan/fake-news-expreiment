Forever New's pulled a stack of iPhone cases off the shelves both here and in New Zealand, after a woman claimed she was burned by leaking liquid.

Erin Nelson wrote on the company's Facebook page saying that a 'SOPHIA SPARKLE' iPhone 5 case she bought from one of the company's NZ stores had a small crack in it and she woke up the next day to a broken phone and burns on her bum.

Hi, last week I brought an iPhone 5 case of you guys, the one with the glitter that moves around anyway on Saturday... Posted by Erin Nelson on Sunday, November 15, 2015

The post attracted thousands of comments in just a few hours, including from dozens of other people claiming their case had also broken... a couple of them even claiming they were also burned. The company also replied -

Erin says she's happy with the company's response, and says they'll be covering the cost of her phone (now ruined) and medical expenses.
