Items left behind by refugees and migrants are seen in a room at an unfinished resort complex, used by refugees and migrants while waiting for smugglers boats to take them to the greek Island of Chios on January 12, 2016 in Cesme, Turkey. The unfinished resort bungalows situated on the top of a cliff on the Cesme peninsula became the waiting point for refugees and migrants who had organised smugglers to take them to Chios island in Greece. Many of the refugees and migrants, predominantly from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq would often have to wait days or weeks on the cliff top for the smugglers to arrive with a boat and the right weather conditions for the dangerous trip. Turkish authorities earlier this week cleared the site of all people and are now forbidding anyone from accessing the area in an attempt to stop the flow of refugees and migrants to Greece. Show more
