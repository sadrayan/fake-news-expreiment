North Country Congresswoman Stefanik disappointed with president's veto of Keystone XL pipeline bill
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-Willsboro) says she is disappointed that Pres. Barack Obama has vetoed the Keystone XL pipeline authorization legislation that she voted for.

“I am incredibly disappointed that President Obama would veto this commonsense, bipartisan energy project,” said Stefanik.

Obama vetoed the legislation Tuesday, just the third bill he has vetoed during his presidency, saying the legislation was counter to established practice.

“Through this bill the United States Congress attempts to circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether or not building and operating a cross-border pipeline serves the national interest,” Obama said in his veto statement.

“This project would create as many as 42,000 jobs and help lower energy prices for hard working North Country families, which is why I supported passage of this legislation in the House. Not only is this project supported by bipartisan majorities in Congress, but it is strongly supported by the American public as well. Furthermore, this project is supported by organizations ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO. I hope President Obama’s decision to veto this bipartisan legislation is not a sign of things to come over the next two years, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House to find ways to advance this important project.”

The proposed pipeline would carry oil from Canadian tar sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Opponents in the environmental movement say the extracting the tar sands oil is more damaging than other oil production.
