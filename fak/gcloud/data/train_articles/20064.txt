JUST IN: Judge’s New Ruling in Manafort Trial May Be a Death Blow to Mueller’s Scheme
A new ruling by Federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Wednesday has barred Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team may not discuss “Russian collusion” during the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Manafort, who faces charges of bank and tax fraud stemming from Mueller’s investigation, is set for trial later in September.

The trial has received substantial attention from the mainstream media and political opponents of President Trump, who have continued to insinuate that Manafort’s criminal behavior could somehow be used to hurt the current administration.

The decision comes shortly after the defense’s motion to have the trial relocated outside of Washington, was denied.

From The Hill:

A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign cannot be discussed at the upcoming trial of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

Reuters reports that the judge ruled in a pre-trial hearing that Mueller’s Russia investigation could not be discussed in Manafort’s second criminal trial, which is slated to begin later this month in Washington, D.C.

Manafort faces seven charges, including illegal foreign lobbying and conspiracy to launder money. The charges have no direct links to the Russia-oriented accusations against Trump.

Manafort was convicted last month on eight counts of bank and tax fraud.

Opening statements for Manafort’s second trial are scheduled for Sept. 24, a week after jury selection begins.
