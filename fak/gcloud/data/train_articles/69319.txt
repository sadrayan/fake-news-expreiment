Companies Can Sit on Public Lands for Less Than a Cup of Coffee

Oil companies are sitting on nearly 22 million acres of American lands without producing oil and gas from them. It costs only $1.50 per year to keep public lands idle, which provides little incentive to generate oil and gas or avoid land speculation. Adjusting the rental rate up to just $3.00 for the first five years of a lease and $5.00 thereafter would have generated an additional $56 million for taxpayers over the course of one year.
