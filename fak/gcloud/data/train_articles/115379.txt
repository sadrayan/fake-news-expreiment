José Vasconcelos | Mexican educator
José Vasconcelos, (born Feb. 28, 1882, Oaxaca, Mex.—died June 30, 1959, Mexico City), Mexican educator, politician, essayist, and philosopher, whose five-volume autobiography, Ulises Criollo (1935; “A Creole Ulysses”), La tormenta (1936; “The Torment”), El desastre (1938; “The Disaster”), El proconsulado (1939; “The Proconsulship”), and La flama (1959; “The Flame”), is one of the finest sociocultural studies of 20th-century Mexico. A Mexican Ulysses (1962) is an abridgment.

A lawyer, Vasconcelos campaigned for the revolutionary presidential candidates Madero and Villa. After serving as rector of the National University of Mexico, he was appointed by President Álvaro Obregón as minister of public education (1921–24), during which time he initiated major reforms in the school system, especially expanding the rural school program. He was a staunch supporter of the muralist movement in Mexican art, and under his direction leading artists were commissioned to fill the walls of public buildings with didactic murals. In 1929 he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of Mexico. Because of his political activism, he was forced to spend several periods of his life living in exile.

His philosophy, which he called “aesthetic monism,” essentially an attempt to deal with the world as a cosmic unity, is set forth in Todología (1952). He carried over his philosophy into his writings on Mexico, calling for a synthesis of Mexican life based upon the indigenous culture of the Indians, which transcended what he saw as the narrow limits of Western culture. He is most famous for his autobiography. Among his other principal works are La raza cósmica (1925; “The Cosmic Race”) and Bolivarismo y Monroismo (1934; “Bolivarism and Monroism”).
