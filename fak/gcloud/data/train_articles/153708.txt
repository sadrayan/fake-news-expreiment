The photograph was originally posted to the image sharing web site Imgur on 11 January 2016, along with a caption that referenced the deaths of both musicians. Lemmy passed away on 28 December 2015, and Bowie passed a short time later on 10 January 2016:

The photograph went viral as fans of Motorhead and David Bowie mourned the loss of the two rock legends. Unfortunately, the above-displayed image is fake.

The fake image of David Bowie and Lemmy is a combination of two photographs: A 1972 photo of Lemmy and an unidentified girlfriend, and another image of David Bowie and singer Claudia Lennear:

It’s possible that David Bowie and Lemmy Kilmister met at some point during their careers, but the above-displayed photo is not proof of such a meeting.
