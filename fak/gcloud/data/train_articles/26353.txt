Wetumpka T.E.A. Party "TOP-THREE" U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE FORUM 7 31 2017 on Vimeo
Moderated By Montgomery's News Talk 93.1Radio Personality Dan Morris

Dozens of forums have been held across Alabama for the ten Republican Senate candidates running for the Aug. 15th special election. Our Forum focuses on the "Top-Three" candidates for three reasons:

POLLING: Rep. Brooks, Judge Moore, and Sen. Strange are the only candidates polling over 20%. The next closest candidate is barley at 5%. The reality is that it would be a miracle for anyone other than these three to win outright or get enough for a run-off. This is why they are our focus.

MORE TIME TO HEAR POLICY POSITIONS: This forum is designed for the candidates to be able to expound on their policy positions and their past experiences serving Alabamians with more than just one minute answers. We believe you will walk away having a better understanding of their beliefs and their solutions to the complex issues facing our nation.

RESPECT FOR YOUR TIME: We always respect our audiences' time and we end our meetings by 8:00pm. It would be impossible to hold a forum that allowed for detailed answers for 10 candidates and remain within our time limits.

This event is for educational purposes and is not an endorsement of any candidate.
