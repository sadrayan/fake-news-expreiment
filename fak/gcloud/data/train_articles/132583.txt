J.J. MacNab is one of the nation’s leading experts on Sovereign Citizens, Tax Protesters, U.S. paramilitary militia groups, and related anti-government extremist organizations.

MacNab received her Bachelors in International Relations from the University of California at Berkeley. She has testified before the U.S. Senate and other governmental agencies on subjects ranging from the growth of extremists groups to the financial scams used to recruit new members to these groups.

MacNab writes a regular column on the subject of anti-government extremism at Forbes. She has appeared as an expert on CBS 60 Minutes, CNN, NBC Nightly News, ABC World News, NPR, and on numerous other television news and radio shows. In 2005 The Wall Street Journal published a front-page profile on her tax protest movement research. She has been featured in three documentaries on the subject of domestic terrorism in the United States and Canada.

MacNab is the author of the forthcoming book, “The Seditionists: Inside the Explosive World of Anti-Government Extremism in America,” scheduled to be published in late 2015 by Palgrave Macmillan. The book takes readers deep into the movement, including its racist history, recent growth, and factors that drive members towards violence.

In addition to her research and writing, MacNab works as a consultant for various federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement agencies. She travels around the United States and Canada, teaching at law enforcement, judicial, and legal conferences.

McNabb’s work with the Program on Extremism at George Washington University explores current trends in and public policy responses to homegrown anti-government extremism.
