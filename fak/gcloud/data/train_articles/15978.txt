Subject: URGENT inquiry, Texas reporter, fact check of Sen. Ted Cruz

Good afternoon. I write with urgency hoping to tap your expertise as we check a claim by Sen. Ted Cruz that the Iran agreement announced in mid-July “trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves.”

Thoughts? Guidance? What evidence would you recommend we consider?

11:45 a.m.

To this end, we are missing facts. In my view, sen. Cruz raises an important question, but we do not yet know the details of the agreement between the IAEA and Iran. I think that the Senator should ask his Government to get a copy of the side letter. The U.S. GOV. can ask for it under the rules of the IAEA. board and provisions of the safeguards agreement between the IAEA and Iran. By having such facts on the table, we can assess the IAEA approach on this issue.

Cheers

Olli

I would guess you're referring to the Parchin agreement which has been described differently in news accounts. Is there any other indication the Iran agreement lets Iran inspect itself?

12:15 p.m.

We should still the details before calling it explicitly to a self- inspection. There is also another side letter to the Road Map, which had not been made available to the IAEA Board.

Thanks. How do we know about the other side deal and what do we know? Feel free to point me.

12:55 p.m.

Just get the IAEA Iran Road Map by googling. It mentions the other letter as well.
