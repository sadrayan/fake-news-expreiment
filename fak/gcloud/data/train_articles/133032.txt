The transition to Christianity
In 826 Harald Klak consented to be baptised and thus became the first Danish Christian Viking king. Apparently he did not agree to this out of a strong commitment to Christianity. At this point in time Harald was in exile, after having been granted refuge by the Frankish king Louis the Pious (814-840). This exile had resulted from various disputes over the royal rule of Denmark, which arose in the wake of King Godfrey’s death in 810. Subsequently Harald became king, together with his brother in 812-13, and with Godfrey’s sons in the period 819-27.

However, dividing up the land with Godfrey’s sons was not without its conflicts. Therefore Harald twice sought the support of the Frankish king, Louis the Pious. This support was offered on the condition that Harald agreed to be baptised. Harald must have believed that the prize of Denmark was worth taking part in a ceremony for. He agreed to be baptised at a great ceremony at Ingelheim on the Rhine, at which he swore allegiance to the emperor. Louis the Pious was present and rewarded Harald with an estate in Friesland.

Now with the backing of the Frankish king, Harald Klak could make another attempt to seize the Danish throne. Accompanying him on this expedition was the Frankish monk Ansgar (801-865). At the request of the Frankish king, Ansgar was to undertake missionary activity in Denmark under Harald’s protection. Little came of this though, as the year after Harald was driven out of Denmark again, and Ansgar was forced to follow him.

It soon became clear that Harald Klak had been a poor choice to rely upon. Using his estate in Friesland as a base, he now began to undertake acts of piracy, to the great annoyance of the Franks. He does not appear to have taken his Christian faith very seriously.
