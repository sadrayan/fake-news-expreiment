Annual Report on Economic Development

The intent of this Annual Report on Economic Development is to provide transparency and guide fiscal and programmatic management toward measurable and reportable results. Wisconsin’s economic development programs are designed to retain and attract businesses, create jobs and encourage economic growth. Recognizing the importance of measuring these programs, the Legislature crafted 2007 Wisconsin Act 125, requiring specified state agencies to report annually by October 1 on the economic development programs they administered during the prior fiscal year.

This report includes program information current at each agency as of June 30, 2015. WEDC’s online data will be updated quarterly. It is currently updated through Dec. 31, 2015.
