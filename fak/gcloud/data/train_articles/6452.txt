Will Continue to Advise Gov. Perry

AUSTIN – Deirdre Delisi, long time advisor and current chief of staff to Gov. Rick Perry, today announced that she was resigning her position effective July 1st. For the better part of a decade, Delisi has served as a policy and political advisor to Gov. Perry for three statewide elections and five regular legislative sessions. She is the longest serving Chief of Staff for Gov. Perry and is the first woman to serve as Chief of Staff under a Republican Governor.

“Deirdre Delisi is one of the most loyal and intelligent people that I have come to know in my time in office. She has been a valuable and trusted member of my staff and though she is leaving her current role, I will continue to count on her insightful advice in the future,” Perry said.

Delisi began working for Rick Perry during his 1998 campaign for Lt. Governor as policy and research director. She served as Perry’s campaign manager in 2002, helping Gov. Perry win the largest margin of victory for a newly elected Governor in over 40 years. She has served as Deputy Chief of Staff and his Chief of Staff since September 2004. Delisi was also a policy advisor for George W. Bush’s first presidential campaign.

“Serving Gov. Perry has been a high-water mark in my career. Gov. Perry has and will continue to make numerous, positive advances for Texas, and I am proud to have been a part of those efforts,” said Delisi.

She and her husband, Ted, are new parents to twin boys, Will and David, born on June 6th. Delisi, a graduate of Duke University, received a master’s degree in international policy studies from Stanford University.

Delisi’s replacement has not been named.
