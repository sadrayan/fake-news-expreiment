Pat Robertson claims Notre Dame Cathedral fire the result of “Hell bubbling over with burning homosexuals”
Moments after reports came in that the famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was burning, televangelist Pat Robertson took to the CBN airwaves to advance a theory to viewers that the fire that engulfed the legendary parish was a result of “Hellfire spilling over from all the gays burning in it’s darkest recesses.”

“It was bound to happen. This is all written in the Bible. We as a society just let everything be gay this and gay that,” lamented the minister. “Soon enough, there’s just too many homosexuals, and when all those surplus homosexuals started to die, Hell commenced with a burning so bright, so intense, there was bound to be some that would spill over to the Earth.”

“It’s all going down as prophesied,” Robertson told his audience this morning. “Just as sure as the Lord rained fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Lord lent Lucifer the flames that torture the souls of the damned, that’s what we’re witnessing in Paris today. Paris has encouraged these behaviors. Paris encourages the men there to wear light, airy fabrics and to kiss full on the mouth. Paris has gone against the Lord’s word and the Lord’s wishes, and now the fire and brimstone has bubbled over the nestle right in their holiest of houses.”

Robertson continued on to notify watchers of ways they could contribute to save Regent University and other Roberston-affiliated Christian locations in the US to “bolster the fire protection needed to save these beautiful houses of worship from the queerfires that rage on as we speak in Paris, France.”

“What’s a few dollars when it goes to saving our places of worship? The places where we seek God and truth?” the evangelist pleaded with viewers.

In 1982, Robertson blamed a fire at the same cathedral on “Bosom Buddies and Billy Crystal and Tony Randall.”
