Financing Global Health 2015: Development assistance steady on the path to new Global Goals
Financing Global Health 2015 is the seventh edition of IHMEâ€™s annual series on global health financing. This report captures trends in development assistance for health (DAH) and government health expenditure as source (GHE-S) in low- and middle-income countries. Annually updated GHE-S and DAH estimates are produced to aid decision-makers and other global health stakeholders in identifying funding gaps and invesment opportunities vital to improving population health. This year, IHME made a number of improvements to the data collection and methods implemented to generate Financing Global Health estimates. More information about these data and methods are found in the online methods annex.
