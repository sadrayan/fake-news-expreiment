Notice to Canada Post Customers – SPAM with a Possible Virus
Friday December 5, 2014

New emails using Canada Post’s name or brand are circulating, inviting customers to either click a link or open a document to obtain their tracking information. We wish to remind customers to not click on any links or open documents. These fraudulent messages are known as "phishing" and may contain viruses.

If you are not expecting a package, delete the email. If you are, please do not click on the hyperlink. Instead, enter your tracking number directly on the canadapost.ca site to find out about delivery status.
