Infrasound

I nfra sou nd has been defin ed as:

“ Acou st ic oscil lat ions who se f re-

quency is b elow the low frequency

limit of audible sound (about 16 Hz). ”

(IEC 1994)

How ever, sound remain s audi ble a t

frequ encies well below 16 Hz. For exam-

ple, me asur emen ts of hearing thresho ld

hav e been made down to 4Hz for expo-

sure i n an acoust ic chamber (W atanab e

and M øller 1990) and do wn to 1.5 Hz fo r

earph one liste ning (Y eo wart et al. 1 967).

The limit o f 16 Hz, o r more com-

monl y co nsidered as 20 H z, arises from the lowe r frequen cy

limi t for which the standa rdized equal loud ness hearin g con-

tour s have been measured , not f rom t he lower l imit of hea ring.

Fro m the subje ctive point of v iew, th ere is no lo gical reaso n for

termi nati ng a contin uous process of h earing a t an arbitra ry fre-

quen cy , so th at fro m abou t 10Hz to 10 0Hz could be t aken as the

low f requ ency ra nge. I t may also be ar gued th at there is no log-

ical reason for termin atin g at 100 Hz, and the range is some-

times extended to about 200Hz and down to 5Hz. How ever,

objec tors to wi nd turb ine dev elopmen ts are no w requ esting

that measu reme nts a re mad e down to bel ow 1H z.

Atmospheric infrasound

This is a well-established discipline, studying f requencies

from about o ne c ycle in 1000 seconds u p to, say , 2Hz and

higher (Bedard and George 2000). Atmospheric infrasounds

are caused by weather va riations, turbulence, meteori tes, dis-

tant explosions, ocean waves in teracting (microbaroms) or

waves breaking on the s hore, practically any occurrence

which puts energy into the a tmosphere over a relatively short

period of time a nd any process with a low repetition rate. The

attenuatio n with distance is small and propagation can be

complex. Monito r ing of atmospheric infrasound is an essen-

tial part of ensuring the success of the Nuclear T est Ban

T reaty, since explosions in the air generate inf rasound, and

there are about 60 monitoring stations around the world.

Of course, it is important to realise that our evol ution has

been in the presence of na turally occurring atmospheric

infrasound, which overlaps t he lo wer end o f wind turb ine

infrasound.

The Apollo Space Programme

Early work on low frequency noise an d its sub jective

effects was stimulated by the Apollo space p rogramme. I t was

known tha t large la unch vehicles p roduce their maxim um

noise energy in the inf rasound region. Furthermore, as the

vehicle accelerates, the crew com partment is subjected to

boundary layer turbulence noise for a

few minu tes after lift-off. Experiments

were carried out in low frequency noise

chambers on short term subjective to l-

erance to bands of noise at levels of

140dB to 150dB in the range up to

100Hz (Mohr, Cole et al. 1965). I t was

concluded that subjects who were expe-

rienced in noise exposure, and who

were wearing ear protection, could t ol-

erate both broad¬band and discrete fre-

quency noise in the range 1Hz to 100Hz

at sound pres sure levels up to 150dB.

Later work suggests that, for 24 hour

exposure, levels of 120-130dB are tolerable below 20Hz (von

Gierke 1973, von Gierke and Nixon 1976). These high, long-

term limits were set to prevent direct physiological damage.

It was not suggested that the exposure is pleasant, or subjec-

tively acceptable, for anybody except those whose occupation

requires them to be expos ed to the noise.

W ork was also in progress in the UK (Y eowart, Bryan et

al. 1969, H o od and Leventhall 1971) and France (Gavreau,

Condat et al. 1966, Gavreau 1968) from the 1960s and in

Japan and Scandina vi a from the 1970s (Møller 1980, Y amada

1980). Japan and Scandinavia are now the main centres for

work on infrasound and lo w frequency noise. A review of

studies of low f requency noise has been given by Leventhall

(Leventhall, Benton et al. 2003)

Origins of the Concerns

The e arly American work was published from the mid-

dle 1960s and did not attract public a ttention, but a few years

later infrasound entered u p on its “ mythologi cal” phase,

echoes of which still occur, currently in relation to wind tur-

bines. The main name associ ated with the early phase is that

of Gavreau from CNRS Marseille, whose work was in

progress at the same time as t hat of the Apollo space pro-

gramme. (Gavreau, Condat et al. 1966, Gavrea u 1968).

Infrasound at 7H z from a defective industrial fan, which ma y

have been operating at an unstable point on its characteristic,

led to investigations o f the problem and to the design of high

intensity low frequency s ound sources. The frequencies and

levels reported in Gavreau (1968) were:

340 155dB

“It appea rs that concerns over

infrasou nd and low frequency

noise have found a place deep

in the national psyc he of a

number of coun tries and lie

waiti ng for a trigger to bring

them to the surface. ”
