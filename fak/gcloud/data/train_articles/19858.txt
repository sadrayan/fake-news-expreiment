Leah Vukmir: I Won’t Let Baldwin Hide on ICE Elimination

Brookfield, Wis. — Military mom and U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir called on the media Thursday to ask Sen. Tammy Baldwin whether she supports the elimination of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement:

“Sen. Baldwin’s radical successor Mark Pocan has been calling for the incredibly dangerous elimination of ICE — and effectively eliminating our border. We deserve to know if Sen. Baldwin agrees. The entire nation is discussing this, yet she remains silent. I want to know why the media isn’t calling her office asking for an answer. In the meantime, I will not stay quiet and let her hide her extreme agenda from the people of Wisconsin. We need to stop criminals and the flow of illegal drugs at the border.

“Sen. Baldwin, where do you stand? Do you believe we should eliminate border enforcement? Americans deserve to know.”

Leah Vukmir is a nurse, military mom and conservative with a proven record who has stood with Gov. Walker in cutting taxes and implementing bold reforms. Endorsed by the Republican Party of Wisconsin, Leah is running for the U.S. Senate to bring the Wisconsin Way to Washington.
