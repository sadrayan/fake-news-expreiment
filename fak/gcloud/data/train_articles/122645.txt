KING: As violence erupts at Super Tuesday Trump rally, it’s only a matter of time before someone gets killed at future events
What we now know from the full video, particularly starting at around 28:00 in this video, is that the crowd was taking their cues from Trump — who repeatedly barked, "get them out of here" without giving anyone in particular a clue as to who he expected to do such a thing. So flippant in his directive, it appears that attendees simply began taking it upon themselves to manhandle protesters and force them out of the rally. Apparently wanting to have the feeling that they were doing what their Supreme Leader told them to do, everybody began to chip in. A random teenage boy shoved the young girl to one side until she is pushed again by someone else. A man wearing a military hat repeatedly shoved and yelled at her as well.
