Faculty & Staff Directory
I am historian of the 20th century United States, with particular interests in the relationships between race and class. I have published books on African American industrial workers in the Jim Crow South and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, and am currently writing on the history of race and inequality in public employment. Before coming to the University of Minnesota in 2016, I taught at the University of Wisconsin and Rutgers University.
