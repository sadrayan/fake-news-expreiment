Subject: Texas reporter, urgent inquiry for a fact check

Dr. Haukos:

I write seeking an interview for a fact check.

For starters, I am trying to determine if a study of the Kaput feral hog lure has been submitted to the journal you edit, the Wildlife Society Bulletin, and if it’s been accepted or not. I’m told the study is titled "Field efficacy of a warfarin bait used to control feral hog populations.” Authors: Greg Franckowiak, Lindsay Briley, Daniel Somers, Larisa Polyakova, Batchimeg Tseveenjav, Gates Lane, Daniel Hartman, David Poche, and Richard Poche.

Past that, we are checking a claim that the product hasn’t been covered by a public study, any study that’s been made public. Would that be factually correct? Why or why not?

Of course, I’d be happy to hear back by phone. I seek your on-the-record responses as soon as it works for you.

Dear Mr. Selby

The subject manuscript "Field efficacy of a warfarin bait used to control feral hog populations" was submitted to the Wildlife Society Bulletin - a scientific journal of The Wildlife Society. The manuscript is currently undergoing peer-review; therefore, no decision has been made concerning publication. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide any additional details.

Sincerely,

David Haukos

Editor-in-Chief, Wildlife Society Bulleti
