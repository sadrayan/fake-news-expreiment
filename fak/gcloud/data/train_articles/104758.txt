AWFUL: Top Democrats Refuse To Stand, Clap For Navy SEAL Widow Honored By Trump

February 28, 2017

On Tuesday evening, President Trump spoke to a joint session of Congress – and gave what was obviously the best speech of his career. The best moment was obvious, too: his tribute to the widow of Navy SEAL William ‘Ryan’ Owens:

Trump stated:

We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero — battling against terrorism and securing our nation. I just spoke to General [Jim] Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.” Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom — we will never forget him.

Democrats initially stood for the widow. But then they sat.

Trump didn't.

As his widow wept and mouthed to heaven, “I love you, baby,” Trump led a round of applause that lasted two minutes.

And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) apparently sat there and didn’t cheer as the incredible moment progressed, along with Senator Bernie Sanders and others – see this video at approximately three minutes in, as the cameras pan the crowd. Look at the right hand side of this screenshot:

Here's another screenshot a few moments later:

Maybe it was more important for Democrats not to cheer in Trump’s presence than to cheer a hero.

No wonder Democrats aren’t connecting with Americans. Their hatred for Trump is stronger than their love of country.
