Registering for VAT Generally, if you are a self-employed business owner, you need to register your business for VAT. You register for VAT at www.virk.dk. Once you have registered, you will be given a CVR no. (business registration no.)/SE no. (VAT no.) and a registration certificate. Revenue of less than DKK 50,000 If you are self-employed and your business's sales subject to VAT are less than DKK 50,000 over a 12-month period, it is up to you if you want to register for VAT. If you register for VAT, you need to charge, declare and pay VAT even if your sales subject to VAT are less then DKK 50,000. Revenue of more than DKK 50,000 You need to register for VAT if your business's sales subject to VAT exceeds DKK 50,000 over a 12-month period. If you know that your sales will exceed DKK 50,000, you need to register no later than 8 days before you start your business. Register your business at www.indberet.virk.dk (link in Danish) See your registration certificate (link in Danish) Services exempt from VAT If you sell certain services, you are exempt from VAT. As a general rule, you pay payroll tax instead of VAT. Services that are exempt from VAT include certain types of healthcare treatment services or teaching services. You can have both sales that are subject to VAT and sales that are exempt from VAT, for example if you sell goods such as lotions and provide VAT-exempt healthcare treatment services. You only have to pay VAT on the sales subject to VAT. Services exempt from VAT Special registration Be aware that in some cases your business needs a special registration in addition to the ordinary VAT registration. This applies, for example, when: Your business imports goods from countries outside the EU. In that case, you must register as an importer at virk.dk. Your business rents out commercial property and charges VAT on the rent. In that case you need to complete form no. 31.001. Please note that the form is only available in Danish. Form no. 31.001 'Frivillig registrering på udlejning af fast ejendom' (Optional registration of renting out property) (form in Danish) Change your VAT settlement period At Virk.dk you can apply for a shorter VAT settlement period, for example quarterly settlement periods instead of half-yearly settlement periods. It is not possible to apply for a longer settlement period than what you already have. Apply for a shorter VAT settlement period (link in Danish) Revenue threshold for VAT settlement Annual revenue (DKK) Settlement period Small businesses 0-5 million Half-yearly Medium-sized businesses 5-50 million Quarterly Large businesses More than 50 million Monthly SKAT can change your VAT settlement period Each November, SKAT assesses whether your VAT settlement period is appropriate based on your VAT declarations for the most recent period from 1 July the year before until 30 June. SKAT can only grant you longer settlement periods if you have declared and paid VAT throughout the 12-month period. If SKAT changes your settlement period, you will be advised of the change in your digital mailbox. The change will take effect on 1 January the following year. If your business has purchased electronic equipment (PC, mobile phone, etc.) from a wholesaler in the period of 1 July last year until 30 June this year and you have calculated your output VAT according to the rules on reverse charge, such purchases are included in the calculation of your revenue. And this revenue is the basis for changing the settlement period. However, such purchase may not be included in the revenue. SKAT does not know the amount of such purchase and therefore we ask you to contact us if your settlement period has been changed to a shorter settlement period due to the amount of output VAT including reverse charge. Please contact SKAT by email via E-tax for businesses (TastSelv Erhverv) under the tab ‘Kontakt' (Contact) and select ‘Send besked til SKAT' (Send an email to SKAT). Search by VAT number Check to see if the Danish businesses you deal with are registered for VAT. If you are selling goods or services exempt of VAT to businesses in other EU countries, you must be able to document that the buyer is a business. Search VAT numbers in Denmark (link in Danish) Search VAT numbers in Denmark (Website of the European Commission) You can also use SKAT's app to search VAT numbers. Download the app in App Store or Google Play. Please note that the app is in Danish. New rules for telephone and electronic services from 1 January 2015 From 1 January 2015, new VAT regulation apply if your business provides telephone services, electronic services or radio or TV broadcast services.
