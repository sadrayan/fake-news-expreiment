Factbox: Largest U.S. electric companies by megawatts, customers
(Reuters) - Privately held Energy Future Holdings, the biggest power company in Texas, has filed for bankruptcy with more than $40 billion in debt to myriad classes of bondholders and lenders.

Formerly known as TXU Corp, Energy Future was formed in 2007 in a leveraged buyout that loaded the company with more than $40 billion in debt. The deal was a gamble on continued high natural gas prices just before the cost of gas collapsed as shale output surged.

Two EFH units, generator Luminant and distributor Oncor, are among the top 20 generation and distribution companies in the United States.

Though tiny, Optim Energy LLC of Texas filed for creditor protection in February, analysts say it is unlikely other power companies will follow Energy Future Holdings into bankruptcy in the near future and consumers are not expected to suffer power disruptions.

Still, the power industry is no stranger to high-profile bankruptcies.

Enron, the biggest energy trader, collapsed in 2001 following the California energy crisis of 2000-2001 and an accounting scandal.

PG&E; Corp (PCG.N) put its Pacific Gas and Electric utility unit, the biggest power company in California, into bankruptcy in 2001 to halt losses during the state’s energy crisis.

After the California crisis, several merchant power companies failed due to the collapse of trading and weaker electric prices, including NRG Energy Inc (NRG.N) in 2003, Mirant in 2003, PG&E;’s merchant generating unit National Energy Group in 2003 and Calpine Corp CPN.N in 2005.

In 2012, Dynegy Inc DYN.N and Edison International’s (EIX.N) merchant generating unit, Edison Mission Energy, filed for protection due to the slump in gas prices, which in turn depressed power prices.

In Texas, one megawatt can supply about 500 homes during mild weather, but only 200 homes in the summer when demand is highest.
