Gary Cobb is airing a TV spot in which he says:

“You trusted me to take on Tom DeLay, and we won.”

But Tom Delay was eventually acquitted:

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted the prosecution's petition for discretionary review on March 19, 2013, agreeing to review the decision of the Texas Court of Appeals Third District.[39][40][41] In an 8–1 decision, DeLay's acquittal became final on October 1, 2014.

It's true Cobb convinced a jury to convict DeLay, but is it accurate to say "we won" after DeLay was acquitted?
