Safety Center – Safety on Snapchat – Snap Inc.
Since the beginning, Snapchat has been about empowering people to express themselves with their camera. We didn’t want to create a social network where you automatically friend everyone you know, or where you only see what’s most popular. Instead, we wanted to make it easier for people, publishers, and brands to tell their stories — their way!

Snapchat is for personal communication, not broadcasting. Snaps are made for quick and easy communication, which is why they can disappear! Friends will only see the things that you send them directly, or choose to post publicly to your Story.
