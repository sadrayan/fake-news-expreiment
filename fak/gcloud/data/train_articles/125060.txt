‘The Goonies 2’ Still Isn’t Happening
NEWS: Director Richard Donner announced that a sequel to the movie The Goonies was in the works during a brief interview in 2014.

What’s True: Back in 2014, director Richard Donner indicated that he was working on a sequel to the The Goonies. What’s False: Richard Donner did not make these comments recently. As of 13 July 2015, The Goonies 2 does not have a script and has not started production.

An old rumor began recirculating online around 10 July 2015 when the web site Skyllar.com posted an old video of director Richard Donner talking about a possible sequel to the 1985 film The Goonies on Facebook:

While this may seem like exciting news, the above-displayed video was more than a year old when it was posted by Skylarr.

Since then, there’s been a lot of non-news about The Goonies 2. While several people involved with the original production, including Sean Austin, Christopher Columbus, and Frank Marshall, have expressed interest in making a sequel, The Goonies 2 is no closer to reality nowthan it was a year ago:

Last year, Richard Donner started generating some real buzz about Goonies 2. Is there real heat behind that now? MARSHALL: It’s in discussion. He’s talked to us about it, and we’ve talked to him. It’s all about the story. We don’t just do sequels to do them. The story has to be there. So, there isn’t a new script? MARSHALL: Not yet.

Rumors about The Goonies 2 have been circulating for more than a decade. While actors Josh Brolin, Sean Astin, and Corey Feldman have all expressed interest in the sequel, no one has yet come up with an idea good enough to justify The Goonies 2:

We’ve been talking about it for years, we haven’t solved it yet,” (writer Christopher) Columbus said when asked about Goonies 2. “I don’t know that we’ll ever solve it. Discussions have been going on for, it feels like centuries.”

In short, The Goonies 2 is still stuck in development limbo.
