A Graffiti Artist Painted A Road Runner Tunnel On A Wall And Somebody Tried To Drive Through It
And he suffered the same fate as Wile E. Coyote did every time he tried to drive through those damn things.According to Mirror , a man attempting to drive his Fiat through what he was thought was a tunnel instead crashed his car because it turned out to be a painting of a tunnel on a wall.The accident happened a few months ago despite the fact that the graffiti artist also painted a large depiction of the Looney Tunes Road Runner next to the tunnel.Even funnier than somebody thinking that was actually a real tunnel? You guessed it: The comments left on Imgur after one "rburn" posted the photos."Nice to see that Wile E. Coyote finally got his driver's license," said EvilGenomic."This is why we can't have nice things," added CoalCuts.And of course our favorite: "He's lucky, a train could've come out of there," courtesy of Greub.
