The family of Michael Brown on Thursday condemned the shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, as "senseless" and called for restraint among demonstrators.

The officers were shot outside police headquarters just after midnight. Demonstrators had gathered after the city's police chief resigned in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report that found a pattern racial bias in the police force.

Brown was killed by a police officer last August, setting off weeks of unrest in the St. Louis suburb. In a statement, his parents called for the community to come together again in peace:

The family of Michael Brown, Jr. condemns this morning's senseless shooting of two Ferguson police officers.We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot and will not be tolerated.We specifically denounce the actions of stand-alone agitators who unsuccessfully attempt to derail the otherwise peaceful and non-violent movement that has emerged throughout this nation to confront police brutality and to forward the cause of equality under the law for all.We must work together to bring peace to our communities.Our thoughts and prayers remain with the officers injured during this morning's shooting and their families.
