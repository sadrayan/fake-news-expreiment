Turkish TV Channel used a scene from Medal of Honor as real clashes in Afrin

Turkish TV channel Haberturk used a scene from Medal of Honor Game as if it was from real clashes in Afrin Syria.

The used video excerpt that claims the clashes in Sheikh El Hadid in Afrin is not real. The video was from Medal of Honor game that launched in 2010 states Teyit.org

Videonun Afrin Harekatı sırasında çekilen sıcak görüntüleri gösterdiği iddiası doğru değil. Video, 2010 yapımı Medal of Honor isimli bilgisayarın oyunundan. https://t.co/j3SdVqM7dG pic.twitter.com/2o2pSP6xwx — teyit (@teyitorg) January 24, 2018
