Tower Lighting Request
Thank you for your interest in becoming an Empire State Building Lighting Partner. The Empire State Building receives far more lighting applications from organizations around the world than it is able to accommodate. All lighting requests must be made through www.empirestatebuilding.com. Lighting requests made via, or including, petitions and/or social media campaigns will not be considered. Please note that while your application will be received immediately, the Empire State Building does not provide a decision regarding your tower lighting request more than 3 months in advance of the requested lighting date.
