Employees that perform work in San Francisco, including part-time and temporary employees, must be paid no less than the San Francisco minimum wage, currently $15.00 per hour.



On July 1, 2019, the San Francisco minimum wage will increase to $15.59. This increase is based on Section 12R.4 of the San Francisco Administrative Code. This section requires that on July 1, 2019, and each year thereafter, the minimum wage rate will be adjusted based on the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index.

Note: A small number of "Government Supported Employees" are subject to a minimum wage rate of $13.27. That rate will increase to 13.79 on July 1, 2019. Click here for more information.
