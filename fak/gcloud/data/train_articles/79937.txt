Biographical Statement:

My research focuses on how public policies affect the economic behavior and well-being of vulnerable populations, e.g., older persons, people with disabilities, and low-income households as well as how levels and trends in income and income inequality have changed in the USA and other countries. I have published widely on these topics in journals of demography, economics, gerontology, as well as public policy. Teaching and Advising Statement:

I taught my last ECON 1110 Introduction to MIcroeconomics class in Fall 2015. I taught my last PAM 4460/ECON 3840 Economics of Social Security class in Fall 2015. Current Professional Activities:

Richard V. Burkhauser joined PAM in 1998. In 2012 he began a joint appointment as a Professorial Research Fellow at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research (University of Melbourne). He spent January through June at the University of Melbourne and July through December at Cornell University through 2015. In 2016 he spent part of the year at the University of Melbourne, part at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, and part at Cornell. His professional career has focused on how public policies affect the economic behavior and well-being of vulnerable populations, e.g., older persons, people with disabilities, low-skilled workers as well as how levels and trends in income and income inequality have changed in the USA and other countries. He is now at the LBJ School at the University of Texas and will return to Melbourne in March and April 2017. Current Research Activities:

Richard V. Burkhauser has ongoing research projects focusing on: 1) Factors accounting for changes in the economic well-being of the working-age population with disabilities; 2) The sensitivity of measures of income and income inequality to alternative specifications of income including accrued vs. realized capital gains; 3) Changes in income inequality in Australia, Great Britain, and the United States as part of a research team funded by the Australian Research Council (2015-2017. Current Public Engagement Activities:

Burkhauser regularly presents his research findings on the consequences of disability policy to Congressional committees, government agencies, and consumer groups. Education:
