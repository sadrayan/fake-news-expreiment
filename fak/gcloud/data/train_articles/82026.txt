He once held the job as a Republican, but now Steve Poizner is making a no-party bid for California insurance commissioner
Politically speaking, Poizner is part of the answer to a lingering piece of California electoral trivia. Poizner and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger were the last two Republicans to win a statewide race. In the 12 years since those victories, the GOP's share of the state's registered electorate has plummeted. Party loyalists have largely embraced statewide candidates with positions that polls find are to the political right of a majority of California voters.
