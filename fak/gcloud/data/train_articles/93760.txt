Obama Declares November Muslim Appreciation Month
How dare Obama declare November, the month when we give thanks to God for our blessings and great nation, National Muslim Appreciation Month! I will never appreciate any "religion" that sheds blood and spreads hatred everywhere they go. This is America, Barry, not some eastern country, where women and children are used as sex toys and a country where we can worship -- or chose to NOT worship -- as we please without the threat of physical harm. You are so out of touch with the American people that you would dare declare November as the month to appreciate Muslims? This is tooooo much!

President Barack Obama held a press conference to announce that he is declaring the month of November ‘National Muslim Appreciation Month’.

“The Muslim community deserves our full acceptance and respect,�? Obama told reporters. “We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. They are not all bad. In fact most of them are good. So from now on, November will be a month to celebrate the Muslim community, the Sunnah and the Quran.�?

Khaled Matei who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood‘s Freedom and Justice Party told CNN he is pleased with Obama and his actions. “I spoke with President Obama by telephone yesterday and personally thanked him for what he is doing for the Muslim community,�? Matei said. “This is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.�?
