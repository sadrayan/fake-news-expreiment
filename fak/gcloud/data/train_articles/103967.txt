Cola Pork Chops
I can't believe this was so good! I would normally have passed this up, but after reading the reviews, I just had to try it. I used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and equal amounts of the Coke and ketchup (a little more than a cup)and added a few slices of onion on top of the chops. I took the chops out at the end and thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and water. It was not too ketchupy for us and tasted great over rice. This was so quick to throw together and then fix the side dishes while it cooked. How simple! Thanks for sharing this recipe - I will definitely make it again...and again..
