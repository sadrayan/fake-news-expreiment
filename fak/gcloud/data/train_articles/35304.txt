2014 Southwest Border Encounters: Three-Year Cohort Outcomes Analysis
Congress has directed the DHS Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans to report on the end-to-end enforcement lifecycle. This Office of Immigration Statistics report utilizes a new methodology to link person-level records across 19 DHS and Department of Justice data systems and to connect initial enforcement actions (apprehensions, inadmissibility determinations) to final or most-current enforcement outcomes (repatriations, relief from removal, and cases with pending proceedings or unexecuted removal orders). Three-plus years after their initial enforcement actions, the report finds that DHS has repatriated the vast majority of Mexican nationals and of persons with previous criminal convictions, but that most non-Mexican family units, unaccompanied children, and asylum-seekers remain in proceedings or have unexecuted removal orders.
