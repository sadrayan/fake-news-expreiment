When the Government Takes Your Children
Night has fallen in McAllen, Texas, a bordertown of about 130,000 people, flanked by the Rio Grande River. A Honduran asylum seeker — all of 2 years old and dressed in a bright pink sweater — cries as her mother is searched by U.S. Border Patrol agents. The next stop on their arduous journey — one that began one month and some 1,500 miles earlier — will be a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing center where they will be forcibly separated in keeping with President Trump's new zero-tolerance immigration policy.

John Moore, a Pulitzer Prize winner and photographer for Getty Images (which owns FOTO), has bore witness to the struggles of illegal immigrants for the past decade, collecting his often heartbreaking pictures into the book "Undocumented: Immigration and the Militarization of the United States-Mexico Border." But nothing could prepare Moore for this administration's inhumane tactics of separating children from their parents while their cases are adjudicated — a process that can take months or even years.



"As a father myself, it was very difficult for me to see these families detained, knowing that they would soon be split up," Moore tells FOTO of his recent ride-along with the Border Patrol, documented here. "I could see on their faces that they had no idea what was about to happen."



During the course of his June 12th visit, Moore photographed everything from asylum-seekers rafting over the border from Mexico to agents chasing immigrants through sugar cane fields. Here, he tells FOTO what he saw on the ground.

ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY

On April 6, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new policy for an "escalated effort to prosecute those who choose to illegally cross our border." He also directed federal prosecutors to prioritize immigration cases. And though the policy does not explicitly call for the separation of parent and child, in practice, it does precisely that: While parents are taken to be prosecuted, their children are left with a sponsor or shelter. "I doubt many of these families knew about the Trump administration's recent policy on separating parents from children at the border," Moore tells FOTO.

FAMILIES TORN APART

During a two-week period in May alone, some 650 children were separated from their parents as a direct result of the policy.

A NEW RULING

Many, if not all, of the immigrants Moore photographed during his ride-along were asylum seekers from Central America, fleeing their home country due to fear of violence or even death. But a new ruling this week from Attorney General Sessions suddenly makes many previously valid asylum claims invalid.

PRIMAL FEAR

"Most of these families were scared, to various degrees," says Moore. "I doubt any of them had ever done anything like this before – flee their home countries with their children, traveling thousands of miles through dangerous conditions to seek political asylum in the United States, many arriving in the dead of night." Here, a Border Patrol agent shines a spotlight on a terrified mother and son found in the woods.

BROKEN PROMISES

"Late at the end of my visit with the Border Patrol this week, I stood in a secluded spot photographing rafts of immigrants coming across the Rio Grande, dropping off families on the U.S. side. As people made their way up the riverbank into the woods, I could hear branches breaking as they tried to find a pathway out," Moore tells FOTO. "A child, who sounded like a baby, started crying, as the group pushed through the underbrush. Later, when the agent and I made our way out, we found them walking along a dirt road. It wasn't a baby after all, but rather a 10-year-old Honduran boy with special needs. He was terrified. To try and calm him, I showed him some pictures of the river, which I displayed on the back of my camera. I then told him something that was natural to say in the moment, but that I immediately regretted. 'No te preocupas, todo va a estar bien,' I said. I told him not to worry, everything will be alright. I really wish I hadn't said that, because I'm not sure it's true."

THE JOB

How do the Border Patrol agents feel about the new policy? Moore describes their mood as the same as it ever was, one of "resignation." "Generally speaking, agents find the bureaucracy of processing so many asylum seekers tedious," explains Moore. "Once families cross the Rio Grande from Mexico into Texas, they seek out Border Patrol agents and then turn themselves in. I'd say that many agents do have some compassion for them, but they don't think that the U.S. should be responsible for accepting them."

LAST LOOKS

"In the case of the 2-year-old Honduran girl, the mother told me they had been traveling for a full month and were exhausted. They were taken into custody with a group of about 20 immigrants, mostly women and children at about 11p.m.," Moore tells FOTO. "Before transporting them to a processing center, transportation officers body searched everyone and the mother was one of the last. She was told to set the child down, while she was searched. The little girl immediately started crying. While it's not uncommon for toddlers to feel separation anxiety, this would have been stressful for any child. I took only a few photographs and was almost overcome with emotion myself. Then very quickly, they were in the van, and I stopped to take a few deep breaths."
