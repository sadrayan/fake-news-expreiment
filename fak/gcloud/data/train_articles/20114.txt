Immigration
Marco has consistently advocated fixing America’s immigration system, beginning with securing our border, enforcing immigration laws in the workplace, and implementing effective visa tracking systems.

Every sovereign nation has the right to set its immigration laws and enforce them, and Marco knows first-hand that enforcing our immigration laws is not anti-immigrant.

Marco’s Priorities:

Cancel President Obama’s unconstitutional executive orders

Eliminate federal funding for sanctuary cities

Deport criminal illegal aliens

Hire 20,000 new Border Patrol agents

Finish all 700 miles of walls on our southern border

Implement an entry-exit visa tracking system

Implement a mandatory eVerify system

Install $4 billion in new cameras and sensors on the border

These priorities have only become more important in light of the threat from sophisticated terrorist groups such as ISIS attempting to exploit our legal immigrant system or cross our borders illegally. That means, for instance, that the U.S. cannot and should not accept refugees from Syria unless it is possible to vet them.

That principle will govern Marco’s approach to immigration security more generally: if we do not know who you are and why you are coming, you are not getting into America.

Of course, fixing America’s immigration system goes beyond just a serious, tough approach to border security.
