You Really Have to Listen to Donald Trump Talk About Iraq
Donald Trump is now tied for first with Mike Huckabee for the GOP nomination, according to a national CNN poll. But because Trump’s birtherism advocacy has soaked up so much attention, his oil-crazy, unabashedly imperialistic foreign policy has flown somewhat under the radar. Trump has said before that we should be in Libya only if we get to “keep the oil,” and that we should stay in Iraq to “take the oil.” But you really need to listen to him ramble about this at length to truly appreciate how twisted Trump’s priorities as commander-in-chief would be. Luckily, Trump does just that in an extended chat with The Wall Street Journal. The relevant part starts at 7:54:

In case you don’t want to sit through all that, let’s extract the best parts:



That sounds smart. Yes, blood for oil! Yes, blood for oil!



What is so hard to understand about this plan, lady? Just take it. Take the oil. Take it, and bring it home. I’m not sure it’s possible to really get more detailed than that.



Wrong. What could be more comforting to the parents of a dead soldier than the knowledge that their child was sacrificed to give America access to more oil? That’s the dream of every parent.

Finally:



No American soldiers have been killed in Libya. The military announced yesterday that the war has cost $608 million to date.

So, to sum up Trump’s foreign policy: Stay in Iraq forever. Take the oil. Make stuff up about Libya. Take more oil.

It’s going to be very interesting when Republican voters start paying attention to the non-birther part of Trump’s platform.
