I had two Pyrex dishes explode in one night. I have never experienced this before. I took the first one out of the oven and put it on the flat surface area that was room temperature and it immediately shattered throwing shards of glass and small pieces into the air onto the counter and onto the floor. I took the second one out which was a meatloaf type pan and put it on a towel first thinking that maybe the counter surface was too cold. I then realized itâ€™s probably too hot to leave on a towel, so because it had not exploded yet, I rested it on the counter and about a minute later it exploded throwing shards of glass into the sink and on the floor and several feet from where it had exploded.
