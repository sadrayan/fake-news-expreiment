Media Alert: Adobe Data Shows Cyber Monday Largest Online Sales Day in History With $3.39 Billion
SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) today released its 2016 online shopping data for Cyber Monday and the holiday weekend overall. Cyber Monday is on track to hit a new record with $3.39 billion spent online, a 10.2 percent increase year-over-year (YoY). This will mark the largest online sales day in history, surpassing Black Friday ($3.34 billion) by a narrow margin. Cyber Monday is expected to generate slightly less mobile revenue than Black Friday at $1.19 billion, a 48 percent YoY increase. The holiday shopping season so far (November 1-28) is expected to drive a total of $39.9 billion in online revenue, a 7.4 percent increase YoY, with 27 out of 28 days this holiday season generating over $1 billion.

The five best-selling toys in terms of quantity sold on Cyber Monday were Lego sets, Shopkins, Nerf, Barbie and Little Live Pets, and the five best-selling electronic products were Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox, Samsung 4K TVs, Apple iPads and Amazon Fire. Mobile continues to drive the majority of visits to retail websites on Cyber Monday at 53 percent (44 percent coming from smartphones, 9 percent from tablets), while accounting for 35 percent of sales (25 percent smartphones, 10 percent tablets).

Adobe’s Cyber Monday report is based on aggregated and anonymous data from 23 billion visits to retail websites. Adobe measures 80 percent of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers, more than any other technology company*, and uses its proven, predictive model powered by Adobe Sensei to calculate the remaining hours of the day. Seven dollars and fifty cents out of every 10 dollars spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers goes through Adobe Marketing Cloud. The tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census-based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends.

“Cyber Monday is on track to be the biggest online shopping day ever, surpassing our forecast by almost $27 million or 0.8 percent,” said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “This indicates that consumers still had more appetite for online shopping despite the incredible volume of online sales on Black Friday. Prices are expected to start climbing after today as retailers shift attention to extend the season late into December with quick shipping deals and the option to click and collect in store.”
