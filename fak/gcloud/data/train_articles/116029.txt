Although breast cancer receives the most attention during Breast Cancer Awareness month each October, charities work all year long to raise funds for the prevention, treatment, and cure of this devastating disease. Throughout the year, people participate in walks, runs, and other special events to raise money to fight breast cancer. The pink ribbon has become the symbol for awareness of the disease and can be found adorning everything from soda cans to sneakers. But how many of us stop to examine those pink ribbon charities soliciting our support?
