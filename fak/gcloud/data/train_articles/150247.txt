A sexuality expert has said parents should ask babies for their permission before changing their nappies in order to set up a culture of consent from birth.

Deanne Carson, who describes herself on Twitter as a 'sexuality educator, speaker and author,' made the claim while speaking on ABC in footage above.

She said she works with children from three years old on issues surrounding consent, but added that parents are advised to introduce ideas much earlier.

Deanne recognised that babies are unable to give an answer, but said it's important to use eye contact to teach them their response matters.

On a segment aired on consent laws, she said: "We work with children from three years old.

"We work from parents from birth."

The reporter seems confused and asks "from birth?"

"Yes, just about how to set up a culture of consent in their homes so 'I'm going to change your nappy now, is that OK,' Deanne responded.

"Of course a baby is not going to respond 'yes mum that's awesome, I'd love to have my nappy changed'.

"But if you leave a space, and wait for body language and wait to make eye contact then you're letting that child know that their response matters."

Many viewers seemed confused by her suggestion with Twitter users saying "I'm not hearing this right surely" and "I'm dumbfounded."

One wrote: "If this doesn't qualify for Lefty Lunacy..."

Another agreed, adding: "Absolute lunacy. The world has gone completely mad."
