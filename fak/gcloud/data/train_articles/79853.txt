Lindsey Graham Wants Republicans To Unendorse Donald Trump
Speaking to Trump’s rhetoric regarding Curiel, Graham told Jackson: “I don’t think that Donald Trump personally is a racist person … but he is playing the race card.”

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told Newsradio WGAN that Trump's comments made supporting the candidate "very difficult."

“Those kinds of comments are very serious to me," she said. "They are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate — which is why I think this is so serious — is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.”

But while many have condemned Trump's remarks, some -- including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) -- are still supporting the candidate.
