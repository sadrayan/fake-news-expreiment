Good Morning,

You're comparing estimates from two different surveys, which is never advisable. The link you provided actually references the Current Population Survey (CPS), whereas the single year PUMS file is from the American Community Survey (ACS).

The differences between these two surveys in terms of design and sampling frame are myriad, but if you're simply interested in the best estimate of Hispanics citizens in Texas, use the ACS. If, however, you're referencing other numbers from our 2008 voting survey, use the CPS estimate for comparative purposes.

Additional methodology/background available here:
