Kids' Choice Awards 2018 Kids' Choice Awards

The 2018 Kids' Choice Awards was slime-tastic! Superstar host John Cena returned for the second year in a row and brought all of Cenation with him! That includes the Cena family, from Joan and Bichon to Don and Baby Sean. The audience was on their feet all night thanks to incredible performances from JoJo Siwa and N.E.R.D, and as always, the night was full of blimps, stars, and slime!
