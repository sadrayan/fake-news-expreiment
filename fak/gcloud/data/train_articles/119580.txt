Urban Outfitters' 'Eat Less' T-Shirt PULLED From Website, But Still In Stores
Yesterday, we reported on Urban Outfitters' newest statement t-shirt: a gray v-neck with the words "Eat Less" printed on it. The item was pulled from the chain's website by last night, but it turns out that you can still find it in stores.

We called several Manhattan Urban Outfitters locations and one sales associates confirmed that the store had the t-shirts in stock, but only in larger sizes. However, a sales associate at another store said they hadn't yet received their shipment of "Eat Less" t-shirts.

Urban Outfitters' public relations did not return the Huffington Post's phone calls regarding the matter.
