What Do People Do?

Islamic educational institutions in the United States often hold lectures or classes on Muhammed's (or Mohammad's) life and how Muslims can live an honorable life. They may also invite non-Muslims to communal meals and lectures or discussions on Islam. These events usually aim to increase the understanding of Islam in the non-Muslim community, rather than to convert people to Islam.

Some communities hold open-air celebrations or parades. People attending the parades may carry green banners and men and boys wear green clothing or headgear. Girls often wear pink and white clothes. A communal meal may be held or birthday cake may be distributed at the end of the celebrations. The food is often also shared with non-Muslims.

Public Life

Eid Milad ul-Nabi is not a federal public holiday in the United States. However, some Muslim businesses and organizations may be closed for part or all of the day or offer a reduced level of service. Parades or outdoor celebrations may cause some local disruption to traffic.

Note: Regional customs or moon sightings may cause a variation of the date for Islamic holidays, which begin at sundown the day before the date specified for the holiday. The Islamic calendar is lunar and the days begin at sunset, so there may be one-day error depending on when the New Moon is first seen.
