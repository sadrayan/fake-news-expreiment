BREAKING: Trey Gowdy’s Son Found In A Dumpster In DC – Americas Last …
Terrence Vaughan Martin Gowdy, Trey Gowdy’s 8-year-old son, was found dead in a dumpster in DC. The dumpster happened to belong to the new Trump Hotel, which is either a feeble attempt to frame the President or a message to him and his family. Little Trey, who went missing earlier today from the Capitol building, didn’t make it far before his tender young life was cut short by forces of globalist evil looking to keep the most righteous congressman in Washington silent.

Congressman Gowdy and his family weren’t available for comment and are taking some family time to deal with the loss of their son and brother. They ask for privacy. They are also under heavy protection at a high-security safehouse in an undisclosed location.

Two suspects in the murder, Hamil Lalahafa and Sanjay Gemtrapa, are being questioned as we speak. US attorney David Morrisey is prosecuting the case. We’ll have updates as they come in.
