Crackdown Proposed to Prevent Illegal Immigrants From Obtaining Medicare
WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is planning new steps to prevent people in the country illegally from obtaining Medicare after finding that tens of thousands were improperly receiving benefits.

In President Obama’s budget for 2015, to be unveiled on Tuesday, and in new regulations, the administration proposes to remove illegal immigrants from the Medicare rolls and explicitly require citizenship or lawful presence in the United States as a condition of getting Medicare.

Under a 1996 law, the administration said, immigrants are generally ineligible to receive federal benefits if they are “unlawfully present in the United States.” But, officials said, many illegal immigrants have received benefits because the Medicare agency did not update its rules or policies to carry out the restrictions imposed by Congress.

In his budget, expected to total roughly $3.8 trillion, Mr. Obama steers clear of structural changes in social welfare programs, which make up about 60 percent of the budget. But he proposes substantial savings in Medicare, including cuts in payments for nursing homes and home health agencies.
