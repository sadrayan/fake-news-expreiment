Bag ban basics

The city of Austin’s long-anticipated ban on disposable bags begins Friday. Here’s what you need to know about it:

What is banned: Retailers can no longer offer thin, so-called single-use plastic and paper bags at checkout counters. (Customers who have such bags at home can still bring and use them at stores.)

Retailers can offer: Fabric bags or thicker paper or plastic bags with handles, which the city considers reusable. Businesses, not the city, will decide whether to charge for those bags.

Customers should: Remember to bring reusable bags with them to the store. Also, wash those bags regularly — studies have shown that many customers don’t, and high levels of bacteria can grow inside them.

What is exempt: Thin bags for dry cleaning, newspaper delivery, meat, poultry, fish, produce, bulk goods and pharmaceuticals, and some types of restaurant takeout bags. Also, some businesses have gotten the city’s permission to comply with the ban in alternative ways, such as charging high fees for single-use bags for a limited time.

Enforcement: Will be driven by complaints from the public. People can call the city’s nonemergency 311 line to report businesses violating the ban.

Penalties: The city will first work with businesses to help them comply. In extreme cases, the city could cite businesses for Class C misdemeanors, which carry fines of up to $2,000 a day.
