' Havana Broadcast Spurs Optimism WASHINGTON iffl - U.S. officials are very encouraged by a strong Cuban signal on opening negotiations toward ending aircraft hijacking, but they emphatically deny this could lead to a normalization in relations. ,' The Cuban signal came yesterday in a broadcast from Havana, saying "the government of Cuba is willing, and without delay, to take such steps which might lead to the adoption of a broad agreement" on hijacking. Even before this broadcast was monitored in Washington, State Department spokesman Charles W. Bray told news-m'en , "We do have the irripression now that there may now be a basis for reopening negotiations" on the issue. ' BRAY described the impression as based on unspecified i'straws in the wind" as seen in previous actions and state-m e n t s by Premier Fidel Castro's government following two recent hijackings of U.S. U.D.

' ; been organized but not yet in business include Friendly Inns JOHN Lesure of Orlando, Fla., partner in Laventhol, By LEROY POPE NEW YORK , (UPI) - A wave of construction of budget motels, charging less than $10 a night for single occupancy and sometimes as little as $11 for a couple, is cutting the cost ' of travel in the United States. . Day's Inns of Atlanta, which operates 28 budget hotels, says in newspaper advertisments "Mr. salesman, if you paid" more than $8 for your room tonight, you paid too much! Laventhol, Kreksten, Hor-wath & Horwath, statisticians of the lodging industry, named eight chains of budget motels in operation with a total of 206 motels and seven other chains 1 organized to operate, budget motels that haven't yet built any. Lowest cost of those already In operation are Motel' 6 of Santa Barbara, Calif., with 96 units at-$6.60 a" night and Scottish Inns of America, Kin- if there is no bar or nojes-taurant in the motel. Jft-his 1972 report on motel industry trends, Lesure pointed outjhat, the operating costs of motels' without restaurants or-bars are usually at least 20 percent below those of the full service motels. ; Lesure told United Press International - the big JWotel chains provoked the budget hotel movement in two ways. They built too many fancy tels and, when occupancy began to fall off two years ago, they tried to compensate by raising room prices sharply. THE $18 and $20 a night rale for double occupancy was already common two years' ago. But during 1971, this rate was puslhed up to $22 and even as high as $27 including sales taxes. Single occupancy rates' at the more elaborate motels have ranged from $14 up this year. Lesure said a 2-per-cent increase in occupancy rates the first four months of 1972 helped the standard motels somewhat but that competi Less Than $10 a Night For Single Occupancy Greater Dover Nov. 15: 12:10 a.m. Caravan Motel, 383 N.

Delaware Supreme Court Krekstein, Horwath & Horwath and the company.'s motel expert, said the budget motel .is the greatest competitive threat the motel and hotel industry faces. He said the budget motels appeal primarily to salesmen and "to the family en route to a destination, including campers."

Only the standard engine and transmission have been replaced in a series of 80 wor-k a d a y Renault R4s that Electricite de France, the state-owned utility monopoly, is modifying to serve as repair and customer relations cars. IT wants to push the idea that autos that don't make smoke or noise have grown out of the futureland sections of amusement parks and into something solid enough that is repairmen can start driving in June. "As far as we know, there's no other experimentation with electronic cars on this scale. Obviously, it's costing us, but we feel we are getting in right at - the beginning of something that will have tremendous growth," said Pierre Wolf, the monopoly's research director, in introducing the cars in Dijon. Turning the starter key in - THIS omission was seen by some U.S. experts as indicating the seriousness of the Cuban proposal. - Cuba, one official said, doesn't want to be known as a haven for criminals and is willing to deal with the United ' States on that basis. This is particularly true, he said, because the two most recent hijackings involved accused murderers, bank robbers and rapists. But the American experts say there is no sign Castro wants a better relationship with Washington and they say President Nixon is not in the mood for a change either.

Sales through Sept. 30 totaled $106,299,000, about 8 per cent more than the sales of $98,462,000 during the same period last year. Net income through Sept. 30 was $7,324,000 (including a nonrecurring gain of $134,000), a decline of about 12 per cent from the net income of $8,318,000 during the same period last year. Remington said the figures reflect higher operating costs and expenses associated with the opening of a new plant in Lonoke, Ark. Per-share earnings for the first nine months of this year were $1.02 (including 2 cents a share from the nonrecurring gain), compared with $1.13, (including 6 cents a share from the nonrecurring gain), for the comparable nine months of 1971.
