McCain Shifts Position on More US Troops to Afghanistan

While Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, was seeming defensive on Iraq today, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was changing his position on Afghanistan.

Just last week, McCain was calling for the U.S.'s NATO allies to increase their troop presence in Afghanistan and was resisting calls for more U.S. troops there. “I would like to have our allies make a bigger commitment, both in personnel and other ways,” McCain said in Portsmouth, Ohio. “I’d like to hear from our military leaders, our chairman of the joint chiefs, as well as the military commanders there.”

McCain foreign policy aide Randy Scheunemann told the Boston Globe that there needed to be more NATO troops, and "there is no easy answer, but clearly Pakistan needs to do more to crack down there."

This was quite a contrast from Obama, who since August 2007 has been calling for at least two additional U.S. brigades in Afghanistan.

A contrast, that is…until today.

"Our commanders on the ground in Afghanistan say that they need at least three additional brigades," McCain said today at a town hall in Albuquerque. "Thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available, and our commanders in Afghanistan must get them."

During a trip to Afghanistan in 2006, McCain resisted such a call, saying when asked if more US troops were needed, "If it's necessary, we will, and I'm sure we would be agreeable, but the focus here is more on training the Afghan National Army and the police, as opposed to the increased U.S. troop presence."

Speaking to reporters on his bus today after his speech, McCain rejected the notion that he and Obama have similar plans for the region.

"He's just said we need more troops," McCain said. "There is a dramatic difference. He's never been to Afghanistan, he's never been briefed on Afghanistan personally by the commanders." Moreover, McCain asserted, Obama doesn't see the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as connected, as does McCain.

"If we fail in Iraq, it would have meant enormous encouragement to the Taliban in Afghanistan and other anti-American elements and jihadists throughout the region," McCain said. "And so to say, we could have let Iraq fail, as Senator Obama said,...that would have had a devastating effect in my view on our reliability in the region, that the willingness of our allies to cooperate with us in Afghanistan, and so they are connected. In life and warfare, failure breeds failure, success breeds success. That is just a lesson of history, and Senator Obama obviously does not understand those lessons."

McCain also repeated a charge first made by Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-NY, against Obama -- that he chairs a Foreign Affairs subcommittee with oversight over NATO operations and yet "he's never had a hearing. He's never had a hearing. So I am not surprised that all he has done is said, 'Well, we need more troops.'"

Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del, rejected that accusation in a statement to ABC News. "The reason Senator Obama didn’t chair a NATO and Afghanistan subcommittee hearing is because I did, as Chairman of the Committee….when it comes to the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq, we hold those hearings at the full committee level,” he said.
