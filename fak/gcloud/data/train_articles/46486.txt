Florida Advances Tuition Aid for Children Brought to U.S. Illegally
The amended bill will now move to the House, which has already passed it once, and then head to Gov. Rick Scott for his signature, making Florida the 20th state to offer some kind of in-state tuition to students brought to the country illegally.

The legislation’s passage in the Florida Senate on Thursday, despite deep divisions among state Republicans, is the latest sign that the state’s conservative Legislature and Mr. Scott, a Republican, plan to intensify their courtship of Hispanic voters. Mr. Scott is running for re-election this year against former Gov. Charlie Crist, now a Democrat. Most polls show him trailing Mr. Crist.

Mr. Scott, who in 2010 pushed for an Arizona-style crackdown on illegal immigration and last year vetoed a driver’s license bill for children brought to the country illegally, is already trying to reach Hispanics in Spanish-language commercials. Earlier this year, Mr. Scott selected a Cuban-American former state lawmaker, Carlos Lopez-Cantera, as his running mate. Hispanics make up about 14 percent of the state’s electorate.

“You still have the extreme views within the party that believe that we have to take a more hard-line position,” said Rudy Fernandez, a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and the White House. “What you are seeing in Florida and nationally is that there is growing momentum within the Republican Party to support comprehensive immigration reform and the Dreamers.”

So critical was the legislation’s underlying message to Hispanics in Florida that former Gov. Jeb Bush and former Gov. Bob Martinez, both Republican advocates for immigration overhaul, joined with Mr. Scott in a statement two weeks ago to pressure Senate leaders to support the bill. In taking that stand, Mr. Scott risked upsetting conservatives and the Tea Party Republicans, who were his most loyal supporters when he was elected in 2010.
