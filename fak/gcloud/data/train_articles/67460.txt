Obama-Biden campaign response to McCain campaign attacks on coal

“This is yet another false attack from a dishonorable campaign. Senator McCain knows that Senator Obama and Senator Biden support clean coal technology. Senator Biden’s point is that China is building coal plants with outdated technology every day, and the United States needs to lead by developing clean coal technologies. The Obama-Biden comprehensive energy plan will invest $150 billion over 10 years in clean energy technologies, including incentives to accelerate private sector investment in commercial scale zero-carbon coal facilities. The Obama-Biden Department of Energy is committed to developing 5 ‘first-of-a-kind’ commercial scale coal-fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration here in the United States. Last year, Senator Obama passed a bipartisan amendment to triple federal funding towards clean coal. In the White House, they will continue that commitment. If Senator McCain is so committed to clean coal, then why hasn’t he joined Senators Obama and Biden in announcing their support for the bipartisan energy proposal before the Senate today that would offer tax credits for clean coal projects? He should explain why his support for tax breaks for big oil outweighs his support for clean coal,” said Obama-Biden campaign spokesman David Wade.
