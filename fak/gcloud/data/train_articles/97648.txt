Transferring spouse or common-law partner

For the purposes of the joint election to split pension income, the transferring spouse or common-law partner is the individual who receives eligible pension income and who elects to allocate part of that income to his or her spouse or common-law partner (the receiving spouse or common-law partner).

Receiving spouse or common-law partner

For the purposes of the joint election to split pension income, the receiving spouse or common-law partner is the individual to whom is allocated part of the eligible pension income of his spouse or common-law partner (the transferring spouse or common-law partner).

Note Only one joint election can be made for a tax year. If both you and your spouse or common-law partner have eligible pension income, you will have to decide who will act as the transferring spouse or common-law partner and elect to allocate part of their eligible pension income to his or her spouse or common-law partner (the receiving spouse or common-law partner).
