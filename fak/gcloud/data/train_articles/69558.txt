Wisconsin Right to Life PAC Endorses Senator Ron Johnson

The Wisconsin Right to Life Political Action Committee has enthusiastically endorsed Senator Ron Johnson’s re-election to the United States Senate.

Senator Ron Johnson has supported key legislative measures such as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36) that would restore protection to the lives of the most vulnerable members of the human family. In addition, he has vigorously opposed measures that would demean the sanctity of human life such as the abortion-expanding and healthcare rationing effects of Obamacare.

Wisconsin Right to Life extends our heartfelt thanks for all Senator Ron Johnson has done, and all he will continue to do, to protect the most vulnerable members of our human family.
