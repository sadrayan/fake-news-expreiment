Stop Early Release of Violent Criminals

Gov. Jerry Brown’s response to factual criticism of his favorite November ballot measure — Proposition 57 — isn’t helping its cause.

In its original incarnation, what became Proposition 57 was a simple measure to reverse language included in a 2000 ballot measure that gave prosecutors, not judges, the authority to decide whether to try teenagers as adults.

But with the blessing of Attorney General Kamala Harris, which a Sacramento County Superior Court judge later equated to Harris abusing her discretion, Brown rewrote the measure as a much broader reform: an amendment to the California Constitution making it easier for convicts the governor described as “nonviolent” felons to win parole and try to rebuild their lives. Critics called the revised initiative illegal because it wouldn’t get scrutiny accorded prospective measures, and the Superior Court judge agreed. But in February, the state Supreme Court voted 6-1 to allow Brown to proceed with signature gathering for the measure.

We think there’s ample reason to question the court’s decision. Thorough vetting of ballot initiatives is essential. But we share the governor’s concerns about an excessively punitive criminal justice system that warehouses thousands of prisoners without good reason. That needs to change.

Unfortunately, whether by haste, error or misjudgment, the measure on the Nov. 8 ballot doesn’t only affect “nonviolent” felons. The measure doesn’t define “nonviolent” crime so it would apply to felonies not classified “violent” in state law.
