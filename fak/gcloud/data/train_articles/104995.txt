Its all pressure. I have noticed with beer in freezers - apparantly the amount of liquid varies slightly and so does the bottling pressure. The higher pressures keep the crystals from forming. This happens only with crystaline solids. Water fortunately is one of the few. If it was a non crystaline solid - and took up less space when solidified (molecules closer together) - we would have to learn to skate at the bottom of the ponds.



Hydro - that's interesting. I would have thought that the tap water would be "purer" or at least lower bacteria - due to the chlorine. This is why,when we do buy the bottled waters, we try to get the city water source stuff like aqua and disanti. Is that true in general - or does it vary with source brand and batch? Also, does the spring water last as long? Is there any purification or such done to those brands?



A guy named Hydro has to know this stuff, you know...



I don't have any idea how or if spring water companies process their water before bottling, but i have to believe at least some disinfection would be required on the bottling equipment, if nothing else.



When our staff take water samples for volatile organic compounds (benzene, chlorinated solvents, etc.) a "trip blank" has to accompany those samples in order to make sure the samples haven't been contaminated during shipping and handling. We try to use ultra-pure distilled water from the lab, but sometimes that is not available, so the lab tested some of the commonly available bottled waters for VOCs. I can't say which one was the best, but Captain Sid may be on to something.I don't have any idea how or if spring water companies process their water before bottling, but i have to believe at least some disinfection would be required on the bottling equipment, if nothing else.
