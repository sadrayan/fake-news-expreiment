The many and varied cost estimates of Trump’s border wall
Donald Trump’s proposed wall along the US-Mexico border has emerged as a key topic in contentious federal budget negotiations in the US Congress.

The US president had initially insisted that the spending bill, which must be passed by the end of April 28 to avoid a government shutdown, include funding for the wall. He appears to have somewhat backed down from that position. However, he has in no unequivocal terms said he will build the barrier, whether he gets the funding now or later.

How much it will cost is very much an unsettled matter. Here’s the history of how the wall’s price tag has fluctuated among experts, politicians and Trump himself.

Even the highest among those estimates don’t come near what Late Show host Stephen Colbert calculated with the help of some experts, including an engineer, an architect, and a concrete-business owner. They estimated it would take $2 trillion to meet Trump’s superlative specs. (The wallpaper suggested by the interior designer to make the wall beautiful was not accounted for.)

It was an exercise meant for laughs, but it hints at the double folly of spending billions to build a 2,000-mile barrier and expecting it will keep everyone and everything out.
