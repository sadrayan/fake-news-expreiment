New List Reveals Top States, Cities that Produce AmeriCorps Members
WASHINGTON, D.C. – As part of its annual recruitment effort, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the federal agency that administers the AmeriCorps program, today released its annual rankings of the states and cities that generate the most AmeriCorps members.

West Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Minnesota take the top three spots in the states category. Baltimore, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and New Orleans claim the highest slots in the large-cities listing, with Provo, Utah, Lowell, Mass., and Providence, R.I. ranking highest among small cities.

“AmeriCorps is America at its best – people putting compassion into action,” said Barbara Stewart, CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the federal agency that administers the national service program. “Whether they come from big cities or small towns, all AmeriCorps members take the same pledge: to get things done for America. In thousands of communities across the country, organizations are looking for dedicated Americans to make the same commitment. With their service, we will continue to create a safer, stronger, more united nation.”

Every year, 75,000 AmeriCorps members serve through 21,600 schools, nonprofits, and community and faith-based organizations across the country. These citizens have played a critical role in the recovery of communities affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. They also tutor and mentor young people, connect veterans to jobs, care for seniors, reduce crime and revive cities, fight the opioid epidemic, and meet other critical needs.

Since 1994, more than 1 million AmeriCorps members have provided more than 1.4 billion hours of service and earned more than $3.6 billion in education scholarships, more than $1 billion of which has been used to pay back student debt.

“Congratulations to all our 2018 AmeriStates and AmeriCities” said Chester Spellman, director of AmeriCorps. “By taking the AmeriCorps pledge, citizens from these communities are building a brighter tomorrow. Their service as AmeriCorps members exemplifies what it means to be an American. I salute every AmeriCorps member for their dedication and determination to ‘get things done’ and encourage other Americans to make the same commitment.”

A growing body of research shows that service has an effect on more than just the communities served, but also on the members themselves. AmeriCorps alumni credit their year of service for developing leadership skills that bridges divides solves problems, and opens doors to opportunities that advance their careers and education. In addition, research shows that alumni gain skills and are exposed to experiences that communities and employers find valuable.

Public, private, and nonprofit sector employers have demonstrated their commitment to hiring AmeriCorps alumni, signing on to be an Employer of National Service. Launched by CNCS in 2014, the initiative builds a talent pipeline connecting AmeriCorps and Peace Corps alumni with more than 500 leading employers including Disney; Farmers Insurance; MasterCard; United Way Worldwide; the City of Philadelphia, the State of Montana, and NASA.

The rankings were determined by associating the permanent address of AmeriCorps members’ to a U.S. designated place and state, including the District of Columbia. The analysis looked exclusively at members who served in program year 2016. For this analysis, a small city was defined as any place with a population greater than or equal to 100,000 people and less than 250,000 people. A large-sized city was defined as any place with a population greater than or equal to 250,000. States and cities listed produce the highest number of AmeriCorps members per capita.
