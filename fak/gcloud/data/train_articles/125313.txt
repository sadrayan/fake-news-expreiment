FALSE: 8 Mile 2 Confirmed
In early February 2016, a September 2015 article from The Portly Gazelle began re-circulating on social media. The article reported that a sequel to the Eminem film 8 Mile would be released later that year:

At a press conference in Eminem’s native Detroit this morning, Eminem made this announcement: “Hey everyone, I’m excited to tell you about a new movie coming up. Working title is “8 Mile 2″ and it will be about my life after I came up and will follow basically my whole career. I’m really looking forward to seeing this movie with y’all and I hope you like it as much as I’ve liked filming it.” Surprisingly, the flick is being directed by none other than Clint Eastwood, a man you don’t normally think of when you think of rap. Eastwood had his own comments about the upcoming film: “This movie was a big challenge for me, not only because of the subject matter, but also because it’s hard to dramatize a man’s entire career like we set out to do. Nevertheless I am very pleased with how things are going and I think we’re really coming up with a multi-dimensional, well rounded story about Eminem’s career, both the bright and the dark parts.”

However, no such press release was issued in September 2015, or at any other time. A disclaimer at the bottom of every page on The Portly Gazelle explained:

While The Portly Gazelle isn’t one of the most prolific fake news sites, the outlet similarly duped social media users with claims of a Forrest Gump remake and Scarface reboot. Around the same time, Facebook and Twitter users mistakenly got their hopes up for a non-existent Hocus Pocus 2, based on a fan-generated movie poster.
