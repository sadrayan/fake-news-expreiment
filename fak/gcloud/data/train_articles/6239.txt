Colorado Springs City Council extends ban on medical marijuana businesses

With its six-month moratorium on medical marijuana businesses about to expire, the Colorado Springs City Council enacted a 12-month moratorium Tuesday, despite its promise last fall not to extend the ban.

The moratorium bars new medical marijuana businesses from opening in the city and forbids existing ones to expand or move. Yet the council has changed its zoning requirements for such businesses, leading one citizen to question why it wouldn't let those enterprises move from residential to industrial zones.

"When the original moratorium was passed, you said you wouldn't extend it," said attorney Charles Houghton, who served on the city's original Medical Marijuana Task Force six years ago to draft rules and regulations.

"Secondly, with the changes suggested, a limit on plants (grown in homes) and the zoning, we've already solved the problem.

"Third, if you do a moratorium, allow them to move locations without showing a hardship. It just means the licensed people could move."

The council passed the ordinance without amendment on a 7-1 vote.

Councilwoman Helen Collins said she couldn't support a ban after promising the businesses that the six-month moratorium would be the final one. Councilman Andres Pico was absent.

The council also passed other marijuana regulations on its consent agenda, after an initial vote two weeks ago. Several people testified against those rules as well Tuesday, though they had been passed at the beginning of the meeting.

Those rules are:

- A limit of 12 plants to be grown in any home no matter how many residents live in the house.

- A requirement separating marijuana-infused product manufacturers that are hazardous and nonhazardous, requiring the former to be in light or heavy industrial zones and the latter in planned industrial parks, with some conditional uses allowed after review.

- A rule for medical marijuana facilities to prevent odors through ventilation and filtration systems and be 1,000 feet from any schools, child-care centers or substance abuse treatment centers.

- Revocable licensing for all medical marijuana facilities.

In other business, the council:

- Was advised that it will be sued unless it delays any vote on a proposed land swap with The Broadmoor. When voters approved the purchase of 640 acres of Cheyenne Ca√±on in 1885, including the 189-acre Strawberry Hill parcel at issue, the state passed a statute and the city an ordinance that preclude disposing of the land without a vote of the people, said Save Cheyenne attorney Bill Louis.

- Unanimously approved the appointments of three new Municipal Court judges. The judges, nominated by Mayor John Suthers, are Matthew Ramirez, Kristen Hoffecker and Joseph Dirscherl.
