This is what happened when P. Diddy tried to buy the Twitter handle @SeanCombs...

Although this exchange took place a couple of years ago, P. Diddy's attempt to buy the handle @SeanCombs has resurfaced on Twitter much to everyone's amusement.

In many ways, this is the greatest thing ever to happen on social media.

Just think of the guy behind @SeanCombs, waiting for the moment when notorious name-changer Diddy came calling.

And when that happened, he kept his cool superbly - leaving the singer-songwriter so confused that he ended up trying to buy more combs than he could ever need...
