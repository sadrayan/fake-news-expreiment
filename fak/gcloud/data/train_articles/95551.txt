Grants—federal, college & VT state grants
Grants are financial aid that you do not need to pay back. That’s why they’re often called “gift aid.” Grants are awarded based on financial need.

There are 3 kinds of grants you can use for your education or training:

Vermont need-based grants that VSAC administers on behalf of the State of Vermont—the Incentive Grant (full-time enrollment), the Part-Time Grant (part-time enrollment), and the Non-Degree Grant (for programs to improve your ability to get a job or to explore college). Eligible students received from $1,000 to $12,200 during the 2018–2019 academic year. Don't miss out! Learn more & Apply

during the 2018–2019 academic year. Don't miss out! Federal grants from the U.S. Department of Education—Pell grants, FSEOG grants, TEACH grants, Iraq & Afghanistan service grants
