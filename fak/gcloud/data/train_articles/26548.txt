By the Numbers: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Delivers Tax Cuts for Families in Every Congressional District

Today, Congress officially sent the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) to President Trump, who will soon sign pro-growth tax reform into law for the first time in 31 years.

This historic legislation will deliver tax relief to middle-income families across the country who take the new, larger standard deduction – from districts in Connecticut to California, Minnesota to New Mexico, and every state in between. For the typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000, with this bill they will receive a tax cut of $2,059.

As House Ways and Means Committee Chairman and lead author of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Kevin Brady (R-TX) said this week:

“That $2,000 is real money. It’s real money these families worked hard to earn. But, until now, they’ve had to send it to Washington instead of being able to use it for their own needs – whether that’s paying bills, saving for the future, or putting new tires on the car.”
