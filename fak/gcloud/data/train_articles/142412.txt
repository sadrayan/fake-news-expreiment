TAURINE

Taurine is a conditionally essential amino acid which is naturally occurring in the human body. “Conditionally essential” means that in some situations or under certain conditions, as for example, in situations of high stress or physical exertion, increased amounts of taurine are eliminated from the body and cannot be replaced by the body in sufficient amounts.

Taurine is involved in vital functions of the human body. Taurine acts as an antioxidant and has been shown to promote detoxification by binding together with harmful substances and thereby accelerating their excretion from the body.

Taurine is also contained in different foodstuffs like e.g. scallops, fish or poultry and is added to most baby food.

GLUCURONOLACTONE

Glucuronolactone is a carbohydrate.

It is naturally occurring in the human body where it is involved in detoxification processes, supporting the body in eliminating waste substances from the body.

Glucuronolactone is also present in different foodstuffs such as grain or red wine.

CAFFEINE

Caffeine is known for its beneficial effects on mental and physical functions. It has been shown to improve e.g. reaction speed, alertness and concentration. Caffeine also stimulates fat-burning during endurance activities and thereby helps to use fat stores in the body which results in a more efficient supply of energy.

Caffeine is contained in many foodstuffs such as coffee tea or chocolate. One can of Red Bull Energy Drink contains approximately the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee.
