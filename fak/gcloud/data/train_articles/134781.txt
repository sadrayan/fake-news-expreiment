Question to the Minister of Basic Education - NW2278
What (a) amount in funding did her department allocate to eradicate pit latrine toilets at schools in each province (i) in each of the past three financial years and (ii) since 1 April 2018 and (b) number of schools in each province still make use of pit latrine toilets as at the latest specified date for which information is available?

Reply:

(a)(i)(ii). The DBE does not allocate funding for specific sub programmes on the provincial infrastructure programme funded through the Education Infrastructure Grant and the equitable share. Provinces are allocated funding based on approved User Asset Management Plans and PED’s allocate funding to sub programmes. On the ASIDI programme, the table below indicates the budget allocated to sanitation projects per province.
