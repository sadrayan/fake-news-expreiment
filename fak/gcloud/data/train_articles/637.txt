Paul Ryan is a hypocrite
BREAKING: Rep. Paul Ryan is running for Speaker of the House--but ONLY if Republicans give him an incredibly hypocritical demand: he wants paid family leave for himself.

Seriously. The same Rep. Ryan who repeatedly voted against giving four weeks of paid family leave to workers is demanding that he gets it every week. And that's only one part of his hypocritical, anti-woman record.

It's important everyone knows Rep. Ryan's hypocrisy. If the future Speaker gets paid family leave, so should the rest of American families. Will you share this list with your friends and family?
