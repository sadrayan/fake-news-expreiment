Austin school district board approves $1.46 billion budget
The Austin school board on Monday night approved the district’s nearly $1.5 billion budget for 2017-18.

Trustees Ted Gordon and Geronimo Rodriguez both abstained from the vote.

The budget plan includes an across-the-board employee salary increases of 1.5 percent, totalling more than $8.5 million.

The district’s recapture payment — required from property-wealthy districts to subsidize property-poor districts under the state’s school finance system — this year is expected to be $534 million, an increase of 32 percent, or $127.8 million, over 2016-17. Austin is the largest payer of recapture.

More than $54 million will come out of reserves to cover the district’s costs, leaving the district an operating budget of $914.1 million. New expenses include $725 million to place a Montessori program at Winn Elementary, expanding the early college high school programs to more schools and creating a dyslexia school. The district also had multiple operating expense increases, including a nearly $7 million increase for health insurance.

“Our financial team worked with a multitude of constraints to build a budget that will ultimately help our students achieve success,” Chief Financial Officer Nicole Conley said. “While we anticipate paying more than $1 billion in recapture payments during the next two years, we will continue to thoughtfully fund programs to support our students and team members in alignment with our district’s values of excellence.”
