Republicans Make Historic Gains

Republicans have added over 675 seats to their ranks in this election, dramatically surpassing 1994 gains. This number could go even higher as the tallies in the undecided races are determined. The chamber switches thus far are all Democratic to Republican except for Montana House which was tied and is now Republican, and the Oregon House which was Democratic and is now tied. Changes are:

GOP gains

Alabama - House and Senate

Colorado - House

Indiana - House

Iowa - House

Louisiana - House

Maine â€“ House and Senate

Michigan - House

Minnesota - House and Senate

Montana - House

New Hampshire - House and Senate

New York - Senate

North Carolina - House and Senate

One chamber still has undecided seats: New York House

This is the first time in Alabama that Republicans have controlled the legislature since reconstruction. The North Carolina Senate has not been Republican since 1870. And Republicans have reportedly taken over 100 seats in the New Hampshire House. The Minnesota Senate will be controlled by the GOP for the first time since Minnesota switched back to partisan elections in 1974.
