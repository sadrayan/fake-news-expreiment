Bill Clinton pokes fun at Mario Batali’s style choices
Bill Clinton poked fun at chef Mario Batali’s idiosyncratic dress sense when he turned up as a surprise guest at the Food Bank for NYC’s Can Do Awards.

“I knew it was cold today,” Clinton said. “I thought this might be the only chance I have in my advanced years to see Mario Batali in long pants and at least wearing socks with his Crocs. I love this guy.”

Clinton, who popped in at Cipriani Wall Street on Wednesday as a guest of Batali also spoke about the importance of feeding children in need in front of a crowd that included Michael J. Fox, Lauren Bush Lauren and Billy Crudup.

The crowd gave Clinton a standing ovation.
