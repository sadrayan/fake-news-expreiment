Judge throws out outstanding Capitol protest case
Madison â€” A Dane County judge Wednesday struck down permitting rules being used to prosecute the outstanding tickets against statehouse protesters.

In the decision, Circuit Court Judge John Markson dismissed a ticket against Michael W. Crute, saying that state rules requiring small groups of protesters in the Capitol to obtain a permit were unconstitutional.

"The rule Mr. Crute is charged with violating is not narrowly tailored to the legitimate governmental interests it seeks to promote. It is not a valid time, place and manner requirement," Markson wrote.

The ruling has a limited effect, however, because of a settlement in a prior case.

To settle a federal free speech lawsuit brought by a protester and the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker's administration agreed in October to pay more than $88,000 in attorneys fees and drop its hard-and-fast requirement that larger groups protesting in the Capitol receive a permit.

However, the administration and the state Department of Justice have continued to pursue outstanding citations issued before the settlement. A state Justice Department spokeswoman said Wednesday that her agency was reviewing the ruling before determining any next steps.
