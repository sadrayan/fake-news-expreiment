Russia about to send its 66th 'humanitarian' convoy to occupied Donbas
"A convoy of trucks with humanitarian freight for residents of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Ukraine's southeast [this geographical term is widely used by the Russian authorities and propaganda â€“ the translator's note] has been formed in territory of the Donskoy Rescue Center of the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry," the Russian ministry's press service told the UNIAN correspondent.

"The freight includes children's food kits and medications," the ministry assured.

The convoy is to depart on June 15.

Since August 2014, Russia has been sending the so-called "humanitarian" convoys to the hostility zone in Ukraine's east. Ukrainian border guards and customs officers are not allowed to inspect the cargo.

The Ukrainian authorities insist that they have proof that such trucks transport weapons and ammunition along with goods for civilians.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly demanded that Russia stop violating Ukraine's sovereignty by sending the so-called "humanitarian" aid.
