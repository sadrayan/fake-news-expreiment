Mexico Reiterates Its Position on the Bilateral Relationship with the United States
1. As the Mexican government has stated repeatedly, our country will not pay in any way or under any circumstances for a wall or physical barrier built on U.S. territory along the Mexican border. This statement is not part of a Mexican negotiating strategy, but rather a principle of national sovereignty and dignity.

2. While Mexico has a significant problem of violence, it is manifestly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world. According to UN figures for 2014 (the most recent international report), Mexico is far from being one of the most violent countries. In Latin America alone, other countries have homicide rates higher than Mexico's (16.4), which is far below several countries in the region.

3. With regard to the violence created in Mexico by the illicit trafficking in drugs, weapons and money between our countries, we reiterate that it is a shared problem that will only end if its root causes are addressed: the high demand for drugs in the United States and supply from Mexico (and other countries). International criminal organizations have caused the deaths of thousands of Mexicans, including members of the Armed Forces and police officers, and thousands of Americans. Only on the basis of the principles of shared responsibility, teamwork and mutual trust will we be able to overcome this challenge.

4. Mexico's position at the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation table will continue to be a responsible and constructive one, while always putting our national interests first and seeking an outcome whereby the three North American countries win.

5. Mexico will not negotiate NAFTA or any other aspect of the bilateral relationship through social media or any other news platform.
