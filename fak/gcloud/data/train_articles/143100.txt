Young Women at the World Scout Jamboree
So what is your final message to anyone looking to attend?

The point is your Scouting world has been “Unlocked.” I truly believe that this opportunity gives the young women of this country more exciting choices and paths to discover. I wish I could go back in time and see my capacity in the BSA begin at a younger age, but I am excited that everyone will now have the chance to join this great organization that I credit for so much in my life and my growth into a young adult. What better way is there to start or continue your Scouting career than attending this unique event? World Scout Jamborees only occur every four years and there has not been one in the U.S. since 1967!

So, you should join! See why your brother or dad was involved. See what kind of a woman you can become! Have an adventure! Do something bold and be a girl in Scouts, like me. Come see me at the 2019 WSJ!
