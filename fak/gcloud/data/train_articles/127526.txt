Hoax London terror attack message causes panic
The Metropolitan police has been forced to quash rumours of an imminent terror attack on London after a hoax message was distributed.

The text, which was widely shared on social media, warned that police were preparing for a major attack on the Underground this week.

The message read: "They think there's a terror threat and that it will happen on the tubes tomorrow around the west end area. So don't go travelling on tubes!! It's better to be safe than sorry. Please share."

It also falsely claimed that "every single police officer in the met has been called into work from 4am onwards".

A Metropolitan police spokesman confirmed the message was a "definite hoax", saying “these rumours are not uncommon. The only thing that gives them any credence is people re-tweeting them and circulating them."

Chief Superintendent Paul Brogden of the British Transport police tweeted: "Social media contains lots of rumours regarding threats to tube network tomorrow. There is no specific threat so keep calm & carry on."

David Cameron said the public could expect to see an increase in high-profile police patrols, including the greater use of armed officers, particularly at airports and major railway stations.
