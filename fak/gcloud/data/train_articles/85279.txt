Business Income Taxes

As states slowly recover from the Great Recession, many lawmakers are looking for ways to lower business income tax burdens as a way of growing and attracting new jobs.

he majority of states levy the corporation income tax at a flat rate, although 13 states impose a graduated corporate income tax. In the states with flat rates, rates range from a low of 4.63 percent in Colorado (Kansas has a flat rate of 4 percent, plus a surcharge of 3 percent on taxable income over $50,000) to a high of 9.99 percent in Pennsylvania. In states with graduated rates, the range is from a low of 1 percent of taxable income below $3,000 in Arkansas to 12 percent of income above $250,000 in Iowa. Most states with a corporation income tax levy a minimum tax at a fixed dollar amount, ranging from $20 in Idaho to $800 in California (New Jersey’s minimum tax is $2,000 for groups with total payroll of $5 million or more).

A few states use gross receipts as the basis for taxing corporations. Ohio phased out the corporation franchise (income) tax over five years, beginning in 2006, at a rate of 20 percent per year and adopted a gross receipts tax, known as the Commercial Activity Tax (CAT). It is equal to$150 for gross receipts greater than $150,000 and up to $1 million. For amounts greater than $1 million, the tax is 0.26 percent. Washington also imposes a business and occupancy tax on gross receipts. The tax rates vary by industry as follows: Retailing (generally)—0.471 percent of gross proceeds of sales; Wholesaling—0.484 percent of gross proceeds of sales; Manufacturing—0.484 percent of value of products manufactured; Services and other activities—1.5 percent of gross income.

New Hampshire taxes corporations using a modified value-added tax. A tax is levied at 0.75 percent on the taxable enterprise value tax base, plus a 8.5 percent tax on business profits.

State Apportionment of Corporate Income Formulas for Tax Year 2013

States also offer a wide variety of tax credits and deductions that are designed to provide incentives for business expenditures in certain areas. Common credits include investment in machinery and equipment, research and development, employee training and investments in designated economic zones.

Corporations that conduct business in more than one state must apportion their incomes and assets among those states. Until recently, most states followed a method developed in the 1950s that deploys a formula that gives equal weight to sales, payroll and property. States calculate the percentage of sales, payroll and property attributable to each state and apply the aggregate percentage to their total income. However more states are moving to procedures that give additional weight to the sales factor. Increasing the sales factor portion of the apportionment percentage tends to favor businesses who use a large amount of property, plant, and equipment and/or who employ a lot of labor in the state in relation to the amount of sales to customers in the state. This method also favors firms that export products for sale in other states. Table 2 shows state apportionment formulas.

(1) Ohio has no corporate income tax. A three-factor formula with triple weighted sales factor is used to determine corporate franchise tax. Source: Compiled by NCSL from various sources, 2013.

State reliance on corporate income taxes as a revenue source is declining. Reliance peaked at 9.7 percent of state tax collections in the late 1970s and has steadily dropped since then. It is now the smallest source of state revenues of all the major tax categories, providing just 5 percent of state own-source revenues in fiscal year 2012.

Several factors may be responsible for the decline in the share of state revenues from corporation income taxes. First, as mentioned above, more states are using apportionment formulas that weight sales more heavily. This allows interstate firms to legally avoid taxation on some income. Second, states have expanded the use of credits, incentives and abatements to lure businesses and create jobs. The cumulative effect of these provisions may be eroding overall corporation income tax collections in relation to other taxes. Finally, is the popularity of pass-through entities. Sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations and LLCs are considered pass-through, or flow-through, entities because the income of the entity flows through the business to owners or investors. As such, profits from these entities are taxed as ordinary income of owners (through the personal income tax) instead of as a corporate entity.

Pass-through structures also alleviate one of the long-standing criticisms of corporate taxation, which is the notion of double taxation. This occurs when profits of the corporation are taxed and then the dividends that flow to shareholders is taxed again as personal income. However, only businesses structured as corporations are subject to double taxation of income.

The future of the state corporate income tax is unclear. There have been a lot of attempts in state legislatures over the past few years to further reduce or eliminate corporate income taxes and they seem likely to continue. Businesses contend that state corporate income taxes do not pose as big of a burden on them as other state and local taxes, such as personal property taxes and sales taxes levied on business inputs. Yet, the costs are far too great for most states to even contemplate changing those taxes. As a result, state corporate income taxes may remain on the chopping block for a while longer.State reliance on corporate income taxes as a revenue source is declining.
