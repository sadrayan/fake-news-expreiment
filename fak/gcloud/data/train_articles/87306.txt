Pulse first responder to be guest at State of the Union address
Orlando Police Officer Adam Gruler —the first officer at the scene of the Pulse nightclub massacre — will join Rep. Val Demings as a guest to the State of the Union address on Tuesday.

Gruler, a 17-year veteran of the force, was working security at the club and was the first officer to encounter the gunman that morning. He’ll be joined by his wife Jaimi, a teacher with Florida Virtual School.

Since the shooting, the Grulers have been focused on growing their family. Last year, on National Adoption Day, the couple adopted three children, growing their family from six to nine.

“Public service is extremely important to our family and our faith,” the couple said in a statement. “We’ve tried to live those values, and to teach our growing family the same.”

Demings, who has known Gruler since her time as Orlando’s police chief, in a statement said she is “deeply proud of the courage he showed” during the mass shooting at Pulse, which claimed 49 lives June 12, 2016.

“And as Jaimi and Adam’s representative, I am overjoyed by the love and kindness they’ve shown as they grow their family in the wake of tragedy,” Demings said. “Like so many others in our community, Adam and Jaimi prove that in the end, love triumphs over hate.”
