Additional Trend Information

Sample and Methodology detail



The United States will be able to resolve the situation with North Korea diplomatically, 65 percent of American voters say in a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today, while 16 percent say the U.S. will need to use military force, the highest level of confidence measured on this question.





But only 46 percent of voters have confidence in President Donald Trump to handle the situation with North Korea, while 51 percent do not have confidence, still negative but the highest confidence level measured by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University Poll.





Voters approve 66 - 24 percent of President Trump's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Trump is not prepared for negotiations with Kim, voters say 49 - 44 percent. And voters say 65 - 26 percent that North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons.





American voters disapprove 53 - 40 percent of the job Trump is doing as president and say 57 - 34 percent that he has damaged rather than improved the U.S. reputation around the world.





Trump does not have a sense of decency, voters say 55 - 42 percent. He is not a good role model for children, voters say 67 - 29 percent.





"Should President Donald Trump meet Kim Jung-Un eyeball to eyeball? 'Absolutely,' say American voters," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





"Will a deal be struck? 'Looks good,' voters say.





"But is the president equipped to handle negotiations? That's where the doubt creeps in.





"Americans say President Trump is damaging the country's image globally; flunking the decency test and setting a bad example for kids. There's no way to spin or sugarcoat it. The optics are ugly. "





American voters say 57 - 38 percent that President Trump is not honest. Looking at other qualities, voters say:

56 - 41 percent that he does not have good leadership skills;

53 - 43 percent that he does not care about average Americans;

64 - 32 percent that he is not level headed;

62 - 35 percent that he is a strong person;

57 - 38 percent that he is intelligent;

59 - 37 percent that he does not share their values.

Only 30 percent of voters are proud to have Trump as president, while 50 percent are embarrassed.





Trump and the Media





American voters disapprove 59 - 35 percent of the way the media covers Trump. Voters disapprove by a similar 58 - 38 percent of the way Trump talks about the media.





2018 Mid-Term Elections





American voters disapprove 68 - 25 percent of the way Republicans in Congress are doing their job and disapprove 63 - 28 percent of Democrats in Congress.





Republicans are narrowing the gap with Democrats in the so-called generic ballot for the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate elections this year:

49 percent of voters want the Democratic Party to win control of the U.S. House of Representatives, as 43 percent want Republicans to control the House. Independent voters are divided as 44 percent back Democrats and 41 percent go Republican.

Democrats should win control of the U.S. Senate, voters say by a narrow 49 - 43 percent. Independent voters are split with 44 percent for Democrats and 43 percent for Republicans.

Health care is the most important issue in the 2018 mid-term elections, 23 percent of American voters say, with 22 percent for the economy, 21 percent for gun policy and 19 percent for immigration.





From March 16 - 20, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,291 voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, including the design effect. Live interviewers call landlines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts nationwide public opinion surveys, and statewide polls in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa and Colorado as a public service and for research.
