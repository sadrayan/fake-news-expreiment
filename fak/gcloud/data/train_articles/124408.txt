"How do you help young people address issues of poor self-esteem, managing eating disorders, addiction, self-harm and suicide," Gaga asked the Dalai Lama. The spiritual leader explained that it's important in these times to not be swept up in materialism and that "compassion is part of our life." "Your mental attitude is [a] key factor," the Lama said. "Your mental attitude is sound with self-confidence and foresightedness."

"So what you're saying is, caring for others and having compassion, it gives you a sense of purpose, so it helps you to feel less alone and alienated so you know we all belong together," Gaga added.

Lama also relayed a message for the Facebook Live-watching youth, nearly 3 million of which have watched the Gaga interview since its broadcast. "Future depends on our younger generations â€¦ Past, nobody can change. Future, yet to come. So there is possibility to change," he said. "The younger generation has to create more healthy environment."
