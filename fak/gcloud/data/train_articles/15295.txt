Hi Gardner,

Most European Union countries don't use the military to secure their borders. In fact, within the Schengen Zone, all border checks have been (almost completely) abolished

Is there an authoritative website or other resource we should point readers to as additional backup for this?

On the flip side, could you tell me if you know of specific countries that employ the military for border security?

This page at the European Commission website provides some background (and can serve as reference):

"The Schengen Area is one of the greatest achievements of the EU. It is an area without internal borders, an area within which citizens, many non-EU nationals, business people and tourists can freely circulate without being subjected to border checks. Since 1985, it has gradually grown and encompasses today almost all EU States and a few associated non-EU countries."

As a European myself, I can confirm that there are no obstacles of any sort for anyone driving from, say, Denmark to France via Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. If you cross over to the UK, however, you are again subjected to border checks, because the UK is outside of the Schengen Zone. But even there, the passport checks on the British side are done by Her Majesty's Border Force, which is not a military force, but an agency of the Home Office (Ministry of the Interior). Coming back to 'Schengenland', you have to pass through the French douane, which also isn't a military unit, but a part of the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service.

As for counter-examples: Israel? South/North Korea?

Cheers,
