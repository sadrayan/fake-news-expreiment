Senator Clinton Secures $200,000 for the Mid-Hudson Children's Museum
Washington, DC -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that Congress has approved $200,000 for The Mid-Hudson Children's Museum. The funds were included in the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations section of the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill which passed Congress this weekend. It is expected that the bill will be sent to the President in the coming weeks for his signature.

"The Mid-Hudson Children's Museum is a unique and wonderful place for children to learn and grow," Senator Clinton said. "I am so pleased to have secured this funding for such a worthwhile place. Everything we can do to stir a child's imagination or increase their knowledge of the world is a positive thing and I hope that with these funds, the Museum will be able to give the gift of learning to more children and families than ever before."

Funding will go towards a Comprehensive Technology Enrichment Program (CTEP), which will enhance the innovative offerings in our new permanent home on the banks of the majestic Hudson River. State of the art technology will allow the Museum to flourish as an Educational Resource Center for the entire Region. MHCM's interactive educational exhibits and programs promote the national significance of this area as we present the "1788 Ratification of the Constitution local History Exhibit", IBM's TryScience International museum network kiosk, and the Hudson River Valley Heritage and Estuary Conservation themes. The new central location will be within walking distance of seven elementary schools within the free lunch program. The overall improved technology will help to establish the museum as a family destination and tourist attraction, thereby strengthening the museum's role as a catalyst for economic development and revitalization of Poughkeepsie's historic downtown and waterfront district.
