Nigel Farage: 'Malmo Is Now The Rape Capital Of Europe'

Nigel Farage passionately defends President Trump's allegations that immigration in Sweden is something to worry about.

Nigel Farage has defended President Donald Trump's claims that immigration in Sweden had caused "problems like they never though possible".

Mr. Trump made the comments at the a rally in Florida and has since sparked outrage and confusion as people failed to understand what exactly he was referring to.

However, Farage believes that although there wasn't a specific incident that occurred in Sweden, what Mr Trump was saying was "valid".

He said: "Sweden has taken in more young male migrants than any other country in Europe and there has been a dramatic rise in sexual crime in Sweden.

"So much so, that Malmo is now the rape capital of Europe, and some argue that perhaps it is the rape capital of the world.

"And there is a Swedish media who frankly just don't report it."
