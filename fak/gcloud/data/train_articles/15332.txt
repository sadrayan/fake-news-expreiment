Torrie:

Good afternoon.

I write because I am trying to check Rep. Sessions’ claim in his oped article in the Dallas Morning News that federal law related to Obamacare navigators "does not bar — or even require screening for — convicted felons, including individuals convicted of identity theft or fraud.” Can you provide backup information today?

Thanks.

Thanks. Of the Navigator grant recipients in Texas, how many independently run criminal background checks on individuals working as navigators?

The federal government does not require navigator grant recipients to run criminal background checks and we have no way of knowing how many have actually done so.
