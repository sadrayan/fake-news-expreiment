Democratic senator Puckett resigns, adding to state budget turmoil
REPUBLICANS take a 20-19 majority in the state Senate – a blow to Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s plan to expand Medicaid within the budget.

SENATORS will need 20 of the 39 votes to pass a budget. Democrats hope to keep a working majority with the votes of three Republicans who want to expand health coverage.

REPUBLICANS could try to reorganize the Senate, giving themselves majorities on committees.

DEMOCRATS could have trouble holding Puckett’s Southwest Virginia seat when McAuliffe sets a special election.
