Galveston County Republican Party: “Oust Straus”
It seems like every day another county’s Republican Party executive committee joins the coalition of committees calling for a new speaker, and the latest addition is Galveston County.

“The Galveston Co. GOP Executive committee has no confidence in Speaker Straus supporting core principles of the Republican Party of Texas Platform,” reads their resolution.

The party is following the lead of Texas House Speaker Joe Straus’ home county, Bexar, which was the first to publicly condemn him through a vote of their executive body.

“There should be few roadblocks for advancing the party’s platform, with a near super-majority of Republicans, yet it is constantly obstructed by the leadership of the Speaker, resulting in a vast and deep disappointment among conservative grassroots voters.”

GCRP is right; activists and party members have long seen their efforts stymied in the House simply because the speaker refused to give them a vote, refer them to a committee, or used one of his many other parliamentary tricks that he has at his disposal.

State Rep. Wayne Faircloth (R-Dickinson) has long been involved in Straus’ coalition. With this being a county Faircloth represents it’ll be interesting to see how he explains his “go along to get along” legislative style, which has contributed to killing conservative legislation, to primary voters. Faircloth maintains a failing grade on the Fiscal Responsibility Index.

The group passed the resolution by a vote of 14-2 and will send a copy to the Galveston Daily News, all county precinct chairs, and the Texas Legislature.
