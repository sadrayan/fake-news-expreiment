Zoo Animals on the Loose in Tbilisi After Flooding
MOSCOW — Residents of Tbilisi, Georgia, were warned to stay off the streets on Sunday lest they encounter one of the lions, tigers, bears or other beasts set free from the city zoo after floodwaters devastated the center of the capital.

At least 12 people died in the floods and 24 were reported missing, according to Davit Narmania, the mayor of Tbilisi. “Not all the animals that fled from the zoo have been caught yet,” the mayor was quoted as saying by Russia’s Interfax news agency. “Therefore I would ask the population to avoid moving around the city except in cases of acute need.”

It was not immediately clear how many animals remained on the loose and how many had been killed in the floods. A burbling stream that feeds through a narrow gorge in parts of downtown Tbilisi turned into a raging torrent and burst its banks after heavy rains on Saturday night, local news reports said.

Images from the city underscored the anarchy. One showed people herding a hippopotamus along a street choked with mud, after it had been hit by a tranquilizer dart. Others revealed the corpses of animals amid the debris of wrecked cars and buildings. And a bear was pictured perched above the roiling waters on an air-conditioning unit.
