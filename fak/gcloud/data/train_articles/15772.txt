Kristian:

Good evening. I write because we’re fact-checking projections based in part, it appears, on statements by the ceo of the New Orleans bureau. This study says “the City of New Orleans, frequently ranked in the top 5 of best cities to travel to, predicted that Gov. Jindal’s actions would result in 85 percent of the city’s top conventions not returning to the city.” It looks to me like this language was based on the ceo’s remarks as recapped here.

From the ceo’s perspective, is the study solid on what he said and the associated figures? Why or why not? We seek your on-the-record analysis as we gauge the accuracy of the Texas study.

I spoke to Stephen briefly about this. He wanted me to convey to you that Bobby Jindal is no longer governor. In addition to it being the morally right thing to do… New Orleans tourism led the fight against the potentially negative LGBTQ bill referenced in the article because our industry had approximately $1 billion/year in corporate convention and special event business at stake that would have been put at risk by our state government passing an anti LGBTQ bill and executive order. Since then, the NFL, NBA and NCAA have adopted terms that ban them bringing their events to locations that have passed anti LGBTQ legislation.

Thanks,

Kristian
