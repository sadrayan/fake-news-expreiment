McCAIN DENOUNCES ANTI-CATHOLICISM; CITES HAGEES ROLE

It was reported over the weekend that Sen. John McCain denounced anti-Catholicism and explicitly mentioned Rev. John Hagees role. McCain said that I repudiate any comments that are made, including Pastor Hagees, if they are anti-Catholic or offensive to Catholics.

Catholic League president Bill Donohue commented as follows:

Sen. McCain has done the right thing and we salute him for doing so. As far as the Catholic League is concerned, this case is closed.
