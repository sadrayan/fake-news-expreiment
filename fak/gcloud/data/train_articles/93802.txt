Donald Trump signed off deal designed to deprive US of tens of millions of dollars in tax
A source at FL Group - which went bankrupt in the Icelandic banking crisis in 2008 – separately stated that “whether it was structured as a loan or an equity investment we were always buying an interest in certain projects.”

Mr Trump’s lawyer said the tax implications of the deal were not relevant to Mr Trump because he was not a “party” to the transaction. “Our interests are protecting our rights,” he said.

Bayrock described the allegations in the legal complaint by Jody Kriss, its former finance director, as “baseless”.

The company said the deal was “vetted and approved by outside accountants and tax counsel". It claimed that the deal's “tax treatment” was subject to an “extensive field audit … conducted over many months” by the IRS, which “concluded that it was entirely appropriate”.

However it refused to provide proof of the audit or answer a series of questions about what information had been made available to officials. Following publication, Bayrock said its reason for not providing "further comment" about the audit was that the former finance director's allegations about the FL deal are "a matter of ongoing litigation".

Frederick Oberlander, the tax lawyer who has represented Mr Kriss in his complaint against the company, said: “Being audited only means they didn’t catch anything. It doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to catch.”

Even by Donald Trump’s standards it had been a busy week.

It began with the finale of season six of The Apprentice, his famed show, and continued in a style that was trademark Trump.
