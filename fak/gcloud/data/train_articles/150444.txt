NATO news:NATO launches Intensified Dialogue
A first round of consultations at staff level opened the Intensified Dialogue between NATO and Montenegro on 24 June 2008.

The talks covered a broad range of issues, from the Intensified Dialogue process to the expectations NATO has for aspiring countries regarding foreign and domestic policy as well as NATO's current political agenda.

Montenegro's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ms Dragana Radulović and Deputy Minister for Defence Mr. Drasko Jovanović met with NATO's Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Security Cooperation and Partnership Robert F. Simmons Jr. Deputy Minister Radulović handed over Montenegro's Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) on the occasion. Further expert-level meetings are envisaged for the coming period.

Montenegro is one of the newest members of the NATO Partnership for Peace, joining in December 2006. At the Bucharest Summit in April 2008, the country was invited by NATO Heads of State and Government to begin an Intensified Dialogue on its membership aspirations and related reforms.
