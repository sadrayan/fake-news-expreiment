Maternal and Child Health
The Problem

The health of women and children is vital to creating a healthy world. Despite great progress, there are still too many mothers and children dying—mostly from causes that could have been prevented. Every day, approximately 800 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. 99% of these deaths occur in developing countries. In 2012, 6.6 million children died before age 5—5 million of them in the first year of life.

Improvements in maternal and child (MCH) are a major focus of the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs 4, 5, and 6), which still need substantial work to achieve 2015 targets, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
