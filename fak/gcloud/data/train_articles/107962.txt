Super Bowl LI: Will the Lady go Gaga on Trump at halftime?
Story highlights Lady Gaga to perform Super Bowl halftime show

Activist supported Hillary Clinton in election

Has been publicly critical of Donald Trump

(CNN) Considering she will command one of the biggest TV audiences of the year, speculation is brewing on whether Lady Gaga will use her performance at the Super Bowl halftime show to call out President Donald Trump.

The 30-year-old pop star will take center stage for 13-minutes during Sunday's showdown between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons, and bookmakers are not convinced she won't use it to make a statement against the 45th President.

Lady Gaga, who stumped for Hillary Clinton in last year's election, is as politically active as they come in the pop world. The New Yorker, born Stefani Germanotta, is a vocal supporter of gay rights , and launched an anti-bullying foundation in 2012.

Days before the election, she lashed out at Melania Trump in a tweet, calling the president "one of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed."

.@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for "anti-bullying" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed. â€” xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) November 6, 2016

Both the NFL and the singer's representatives have denied reports that the league has contractually prohibited Lady Gaga from making a political statement at halftime. "This is unsourced nonsense from people trying to stir up controversy where there is none," NFL spokesperson Natalie Ravitz told CNN in January.
