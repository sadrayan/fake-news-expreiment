Health Care Spending in US, Other High-Income Countries
The Big Picture

The study demonstrates that overall health system performance in the United States does not compare well with that in other wealthy nations, particularly given high U.S. spending — a finding consistent with the Commonwealth Fund’s most recent health system rankings. The health care spending gap with other countries appears to be driven by the high prices the U.S. pays for health care services — particularly doctors, pharmaceuticals, and administration. Compared to its peers, the U.S. has similar levels of spending for social services (including both public and private spending) and similar health care use, neither of which appear to be major causes of the spending gap. To reduce spending, the authors say that U.S. policymakers should focus on lowering prices and administrative costs, rather than just reducing use of health care services.

About the Study

The researchers analyzed data on health care spending, performance, and utilization made available by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Commonwealth Fund from 11 high-income countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the U.S.

The Bottom Line

The United States spends more on health care than other countries do because it pays more for health care services and administration.
