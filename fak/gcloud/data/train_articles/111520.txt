Tilapia
In the U.S., tilapia are grown in closed tank systems, where escapes and pollution can be closely managed.

However, most tilapia sold in the U.S. is imported from Latin America and Asia, where fish are raised in outdoor freshwater farms.

In Ecuador, tilapia are grown at low densities alongside shrimp to reduce water pollution. The result is less disease and chemical use.

In China and Taiwan, problems with escaped fish and water pollution have been greatly reduced, however chemical use is still a concern
