ESSA, Title IV, Part A, Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) Program

The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was signed into law in December 2015. It reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Newly authorized under subpart 1 of Title IV, Part A of the ESEA is the Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) program. The SSAE program is intended to improve studentsâ€™ academic achievement by increasing the capacity of State educational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), and local communities to provide all students with access to a well-rounded education; improve school conditions for student learning; and improve the use of technology to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students.
