Subject: Hoping for your analysis for a PolitiFact Texas fact-check

Thank you for the phone interview.

As you know, we’re fact-checking candidate Scott Milder’s claim: "In the 1980s, the state funded 68% of school expenses, and now the state’s share is 38%."

Milder told us that he got his 1980s figure from this Mark White obituary which says: “At the end of White’s term,” which ran through 1986, “the state paid 67 percent of all education costs in Texas.”

The writer of that story told us he drew on a 1985 report on HB 72’s effects by students at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. The report says that under HB 72, each district’s local share of education costs is calculated “so that the state funds 70 percent of the statewide costs” with that share “falling to 67.7 percent in 1985-86 and thereafter.” The fiscal note for the final version of HB 72 includes the passages I am pasting below my signature in this email.

Meantime, we heard back from R.J. DeSilva of the LBB staff; he provided an LBB chart listing state and local shares of public education funding from 1985 through 2016 plus estimates for 2017 through 2019. In 1985, the chart says, the state covered 52.2 percent of the Foundation School Program, the primary way that schools get state aid. In 2016, the state share was 43.7 percent, the chart says, and that share was estimated to slide to 38 percent in 2019.

What’s the rub regarding the percentages for 1985? Why the differences? By phone, Joe Wisnoski told me today that the differences likely trace to changing definitions of what makes up the FSP.

I am hoping you’re familiar with this element and can explain why the contrasting figures/percentages.

More broadly, how do you typically explain fluctuations in the state-local shares?

Any other recommended resources?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our fact-checks.

I’d be happy to hear back by email or phone. I am hoping to draft our story this week.

Thanks,

g.

Here are the real numbers. I know they are complicated, so if you need to call me to hash it out, please do (not too early, please, I work late into the night). Regarding your new "aspect", you have it almost exactly right. Local tax revenue increases from local value increases benefit the state, not the local districts (except that there is a one-year lag because the state uses prior-year values in the FSP, but the benefit from the gains is reaped the following year). The only way districts get increased local revenue is from raising tax rates.

Here is the explanation of Milder's numbers vs. the LBB's:

As we discussed, the Foundation School Program used to cover only part of district taxes and expenditures. So, when we set the local share of the FSP at 1/3 in 1984 (for the 1985/86 school year), that was 1/3 of an FSP that covered only 75 – 80% of the total amount of state and local funds (none of these analyses include federal or “other local” – non-tax local revenues). So, there was a big chunk of local money not included in the fiscal note from 1985 that you copied. If you compare the FY1985 numbers in the LBB chart ($4.169 B local vs. $4.555 B state) to the fiscal note for that year numbers of $1.606 B and $3.992 B state. What is not clear is why there is $563 M in state funds in the LBB chart that is not in the fiscal note, although that could be from the difference between estimates that may have been based on prior tax rates vs. what the actual tax rates ended up producing in both local and state aid.

In Edgewood II, the Supreme Court said you can’t have any local funds outside the system (in response to HB1 in 1990 that left (theoretically) 5% of local revenue outside. So, in addition to resulting in recapture, subsequent analyses of state vs. local “shares” have looked at all state revenues vs. all local revenues. That is what the LBB chart attempts to do. It has its own problems, though. If you look at the Statewide Summary of Finances for 2016, it shows local revenues of $27.758 B while the LBB chart shows $25.607 B. The reason is largely because the LBB chart is assigning the recapture money – $1.581 B of local tax dollars – to the state share, presumably because it is part of the money that finances state aid. However, if you are comparing how much comes from state revenue sources to how much is from local revenue sources (the state constitution forbids a state property tax, after all), you would need to shift those moneys out of state and into local. The rest of the difference may be the result of when the LBB chart was put together – TEA and the LBB almost always initially underestimate the eventual amount of local revenue, particularly in I&S. If you take the FY2016 (the 2015-16 school year) Summary of Finances final numbers, the local amount would be the $27.758 B and the state money from state revenue sources (not including recapture) would be $19.929 B. That would be a state share of 41.8% vs. local 58.2%. Those are “final” numbers.

For FY2018 (2017-18 school year), the SoF has preliminary estimates of $31.321 B in local tax collections (of which $2.088 B is to be sent to the state in recapture) and $18.809 in state-sourced revenue, or a 37.5% state share. However, in 1985, there were no charter schools, for which the state pays 100% of the cost (they do not collect local taxes). So, if you are comparing what the state was doing for traditional, tax-levying ISD’s in 1985 to what they are doing for them now, you would need to subtract out the $2.551 B estimated state aid for charters, meaning the state is only projecting to give $16.258 B in state-sourced aid to traditional ISD’s, paying only 34.2% of their state+local total revenue.

So, while Milder’s claim that the state was paying 2/3 of the FSP in 1985 is true but doesn’t tell the whole story, the LBB’s counter-explanation is also true but doesn’t tell the whole story. Compared to 1985, the state share of support for traditional school districts has gone down from 52.2% of total state+local revenue to an estimated 34.2% for the current school year and if normal patterns hold, it will drop even further for the 2018-19 school year, which will start before the Legislature reconvenes next year.

Two caveats: As mentioned, the state usually underestimates local revenues, so this year’s preliminary estimates would normally be presumed to over-represent the state share. However, the impact of Hurricane Harvey is likely to both decrease local revenues and increase state spending, so you might see a temporary rise in the state’s share over this year and next. After that, absent action by the 86th Legislature to put more into the system, the state share will slide way back down.

Gardner...on his third paragraph analysis of what's in the local revenue column in the LBB chart:

The "Local" column in the chart shows all local property tax revenue that is used in the FSP, and that includes recapture revenue from school districts. The "State" column in the chart shows state funds used in the FSP, it does not include recapture revenue.

Also, the LBB's local share column contains I&S collections that are statutorily eligible for participation in the school finance system formulas. TEA shows all local I&S collections in its Summary of Finances, including amounts that are not eligible for FSP formulas.

The numbers in the chart are the final FSP numbers for each fiscal year except where noted as estimates (fiscal years 2017-19).

I looked over what I sent you before and the part about the LBB assigning recapture to the state share was from an earlier draft, which I forgot to delete it in the final. The state share number I gave for 2015-16 $19.929 B, which is actually slightly higher than the LBB chart's $19.873 B. So, the incorrect reference to recapture being counted on the state side doesn't impact the actual calculation that shows the state share of all state/local revenue being 41.8% for that year when you include all local revenues, not just the money from districts so poor that they qualify for the miserably low IFA/EDA assistance. If you leave the I&S revenue that is not "local share" out there, then you have to leave all local revenue that is not "local share" out in 1985, 1986, etc. The local share then was statutorily defined at 30% for 1985 and 33.3% for 1986 and after. That would make the percentages in early years of the LBB chart impossible.



It also doesn't impact the calculations for 2017-18. In that example, I also drilled down to what the state is doing for local school districts that local property taxes support, to show what we are doing for them now vs. 1985. That involves subtracting out the state aid for charter schools. That's what local property tax payers want to know: "How much of the burden am I shouldering compared to what the state is doing for schools like the one I'm supporting? Is that more or less than it used to be?"

When we talk about counting I&S collections that are eligible for participation in the state funding formulas, this doesn't mean we count only I&S collections that actually generate state aid in the EDA/IFA programs at the current guaranteed yield. It means we count I&S collections that could generate state aid (at any guaranteed yield level), even if they don't at $35/ADA, but exclude collections that are statutorily ineligible from being considered for the state aid programs.

The chart shows funding reflective of statutory parameters in place at the time. For example, while there was a 30-33% FSP local share in the mid to late '80s, the Education Code allowed for M&O funds in excess of those amounts to be expended for any lawful school purpose (I sent that explanation to you last week). And after the state facilities programs were adopted in the late '90s and became part of the FSP, the calculation of the FSP state share was based on those changes of the FSP.

I think you’re telling me that the percentages from the 1980s and the most recent years are comparable – apples to apples – though both leave out some education funding?

The chart shows state and local share of the FSP for a given year. You can compare shares across years.

So "the Education Code allowed for M&O funds in excess of those amounts to be expended for any lawful school purpose" allows them to include the rest of the M&O funds that were part of the FSP? The current Education Code says "a district may levy a bond tax at a rate higher than the maximum rate for which it may receive state assistance", a district "may levy, pledge, assess, and collect annual ad valorem taxes sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as or before the principal and interest become due" and "Before issuing bonds described by Section 45.001, a school district must demonstrate to the attorney general under Subsection (b) or (c) that, with respect to the proposed issuance, the district has a projected ability to pay the principal of and interest on the proposed bonds and all previously issued bonds". In addition, virtually all school bonds are guaranteed by the PSF under the school bond guarantee program (under the Education Code) and the district's I&S taxes are not only allowed, they are pledged to the payment of those bonds.

This is all sophistry. Either you use only local funds that are part of the FSP, in which case Milder is correct in his 67%/70% state share statement for 1985-89 and the LBB's percentages for 2016 (43%), et al, are correct, or you use all state and local revenues, in which case the LBB's percentages for 1985-89 are correct but their percentages of state share for recent years are too high because they leave out several billion dollars in local funds. Using all state and local funds is the much more accurate description of the real world of who is paying for what -- using only "FSP" funds -- and particularly the absurdly broad definition that includes non-FSP funds merely because they were "allowed", but not applying that same standard to funds that are now "allowed", provides a distorted view of the actual funding of public schools.

There is still the point about comparing the state/local support only for locally supported (ISDs) school districts in 1985-86 vs. now. Any response on that?
