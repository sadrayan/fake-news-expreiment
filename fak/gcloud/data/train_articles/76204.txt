What makes an economist?
WHAT exactly qualifies someone to refer to himself or herself as an economist? Having suffered through many years of graduate school, I, like many others with my training, consider someone an economist only if they too have received a PhD in the subject. I can rationalise this by believing I received special and select training; privy to the secrets of the trade imparted to me by my advisor who, in turn, also learned from the great masters. My take on the economy reeks of the university I attended and the professors with whom I worked. But then, someone, like former colleague Megan McArdle, comes along with no graduate economics work, but a terrific understanding of the field.

To refer to oneself as a medical doctor or be a member of the American Medical Association there exists clear education requirements. This prevents people from taking medical advice from someone unqualified and inflicting harm upon them. No such conditions are required to be called an economist or join the American Economic Association. This results in people who enjoy thinking about the economy, but may lack even undergraduate understanding of the field, representing themselves as experts on issues pertaining to the labour market, trade, and development. Often you have to do some digging to find out they are actually ... sociologists.

The years of graduate-school seminars and rigorous mathematical training empowers PhD economists to converse with each other in a language all our own. This allows us to continue to believe that our years of education were worthwhile because we can recognize each other and sneer at the impostors. In the mean time, the rest of the world takes thoughtful advice and opinions from people who sometimes, while not having our illustrious pedigree, also have some very good ideasâ€”and sometimes better ones.
