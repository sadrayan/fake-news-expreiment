From Foe to Friend: The Kit Carson Scout Program in the Vietnam War
The Chieu Hoi program (from this point on labeled CHP) was designed to call on the Vietcong fighters to desert from the ranks of their organization and return to the bosom of the Vietnamese nation. The program promised a general amnesty as well as monetary inducements, family reunion, a plot of land or professional job training, and assistance in finding gainful employment.

See, for instance, AAR, which surveys the activity of Second Battalion First Marines Regiment, during the last third of September 1966. The report highlights the contribution of the scouts in locating Vietcong hiding places in those villages entered by the Battalion’s units. The scouts assisted in the visual identification of suspects, and as a result, twelve Vietcong soldiers were captured. Similarly, cave hideouts and other places used for the warehousing of supplies also were uncovered with the aid of the scouts. Major John Ozaki to Lt. Col. Pat K.

Ozaki was an intelligence officer (G-2), and management of psychological warfare of the III Marine Amphibious Force (MAF) was his responsibility. Elliot was the Battalion’s intelligence officer. This AAR also was sent to intelligence and operations officers (G-5) of the III MAF as well as to the intelligence officer of MR-I.

American naval units operated on a number of fronts throughout the Vietnam War. The first front was the attempt to seal off hermetically the routes for the flow of men and military hardware from the North to the South by way of the sea (Operation Market Time). A second front was associated with the placement of infantry forces on boats along the length of the rivers of South Vietnam, and likewise, in the Mekong Delta as part of search-and-destroy operations (Operation Game Warden). In addition to this, battleships of the Seventh Fleet carried out shore bombardment of enemy targets and provided artillery support, and the Fleet’s air wing carried out thousands of bombing missions in both North and South Vietnam. For the first two missions, outlined above, the assistance of Vietnamese scouts was sought—former Vietcong members who were intimately familiar with the waterway smuggling routes and the hiding locations of the Vietcong units along the length of the rivers. Regarding the function of the scouts in the naval operations, see, for instance, Thomas J. Culter , Brown Water, Black Berets—Coastal and Riverine Warfare in Vietnam ( Annapolis : Naval Institute Press , 1988 ), 315 - 315 , 321 - 321 .

The primary mission of the Fourth Infantry Division was to block the Cambodian border so as to interdict incoming units of the Army of North Vietnam. The primary operations area was the central highlands of MR-II. The character of a KCS’ duties in the framework of divisional missions obligated him to have an expert knowledge of the area’s physical features, transportation routes, and hiding and gathering places.

The discussions surrounding the name change began at CORDS already in July of 1967. Colby, as the general director of CORDS, tried to find a name of a mythological Vietnamese hero that could be used instead of the name Kit Carson—the mythological hero of the American frontier. See, for instance: Memorandum from Colby to AC of S Jacobsen (6/23/69) MACCORDS Files RG 472. After many discussions, it was decided in August 1969 to use the name Luc Luong 66. It is difficult to explain the reasons for these in-depth discussions and ongoing attempts to find a suitable name for the program amid the top brass in CORDS deliberations, which occupied their time for two whole months. The most plausible explanation is their desire to bequeath a Vietnamese character to the program and to remove all responsibility for it from the United States Army.

On becoming Commander of United States Forces in Vietnam in June 1964, General Westmoreland defined three missions designed to return order and security throughout all the areas of South Vietnam. The first was called “clearing.” It involved the destruction or expulsion of the enemy forces so that the civilian agencies would be able to begin to function among the village population. The second mission was labeled “securing.” It dealt with the effective maintenance of the area that had been cleared through continual scouting missions sent out into the surrounding area from small military encampments, known as fire bases. The third mission involved the search-and-destroy operations. See William Westmoreland , A Soldier Report (in Hebrew, Hayal Medaveah), trans. Moshe Bremer ( Tel Aviv : Maarachot , 1979 ), 74 - 75 .
