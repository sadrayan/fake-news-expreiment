Standing Against the Crowd in Washington
Jim feels strongly that we as a nation must live up to our ideals and that means ensuring all who live in this country, including women, are treated justly and fairly, as espoused by Eleanor Roosevelt in the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”

We cannot continue to have women paid fractions compared to their male counterparts. In Georgia, women earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men1, and for women of color the disparities are even more stark. The wage gap is a real economic crisis and has to be addressed by our elected leaders in Washington.

In Georgia, 562,000 households are headed by women.1 Eliminating an unfair wage gap would give a much needed boost to Georgian families who need to pay rent, buy a car to get to work, save for retirement and educate their children.

The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not provide paid family and medical leave and paid sick days, meaning that women are forced out of the workplace whenever they chose to start a family or whenever their child is ill.

While the Affordable Care Act made strides to make women’s health care more affordable, more has to be done to ensure that all women have access to comprehensive reproductive health care.

Jim has always sought to ensure the business he started is family friendly and flexible for all his employees.

As a U.S. Senator, Jim will be a vote for equal pay for equal work, paid family and medical leave, paid sick days and comprehensive reproductive health care services.
