SANTA MONICA, Calif. – Bernie Sanders on Thursday sent an email to his national fundraising list to support Russ Feingold’s bid to unseat Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin’s Senate race.

“We are going to have to elect candidates up and down the ballot who recognize that it is too late for establishment politics and economics,” Sanders wrote. “Candidates like my friend, former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. Russ led the fight with me to make the Affordable Care Act much stronger in 2009. He voted against the USA Patriot Act and the war in Iraq. He authored and passed landmark campaign finance reform legislation and his campaign is powered by small-dollar contributions like ours.”

Sanders has previously used his unprecedented small-dollar fundraising operation to benefit congressional candidates in Nevada, New York, Washington and Florida. On Tuesday, he raised money for eight progressive candidates running for seats in statehouses around the country.

“Bernie has always said this movement is about something bigger than him,” said Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ campaign manager. “Electing more candidates like Russ Feingold means progressives in the Senate can ensure the debates in Washington put working families ahead of corporate profits.”
