The rules for 'franked' mail

Wedding congratulations banned, but Eagle Scouts can get honors

In the House, messages about birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, births, retirements, condolences and holiday greetings are prohibited, according to the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards â€” informally the "Franking Commission." But certain congratulatory messages are acceptable, including those to Eagle Scouts, high school graduates and nominees to service academies.

The House and Senate have their own franking rules.

The term "franked mail" applies to the official correspondence sent by members of Congress using their signatures, rather than stamps. Members pay the equivalent of postage out of annual office budgets.

Lawmakers may not use the frank to ask for money or political support. Other rules limit the number and size of photographs of the lawmaker included in newsletters.

Lawmakers are not allowed to use partisan language or disparage a colleague or political party in their mailings. For example, you won't find the word "Obamacare" in a taxpayer-paid mailing after Democratic objections, said Salley Wood, spokeswoman for the Committee on House Administration. But other phrases, such as the "president's health care plan," pass muster, she said.

Mass mailings must carry a notice: "This mailing was prepared, published and mailed at taxpayer expense."

According to the Congressional Research Service, franking dates to 17th century England, and the First Continental Congress passed franking legislation here in 1775. Because of abuses, Congress lost franking privileges for a time in the 1800s, and reforms have been enacted since.

In a March report, the research service related an old story about a lawmaker "franking" his horse to send it home, claiming it was a public document; but the report said the horse's tale may be apocryphal.
