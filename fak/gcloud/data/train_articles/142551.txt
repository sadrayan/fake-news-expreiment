Joaquin Guzman, ‘El Chapo,’ threatens ISIS: ‘My men will destroy you’
Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the fugitive Mexican drug trafficker, reportedly issued a threat in an encrypted email to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terror group, saying: “Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.”

Apparently, one of the drug kingpin’s shipments was destroyed by the Islamic State, the U.K. Mirror reported Thursday.

“My men will destroy you. The world is not yours to dictate. I pity the next son of a whore that tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa Cartel. I will have their heart and tongue torn from them,” Guzman said in an email, cartelblog.com reported.

Guzman has been a fugitive since he dug his way out of a Mexican maximum security prison and fled in an underground tunnel on July 11. This was his second escape. In 2001, he had escaped another maximum security prison in Mexico, but he was later recaptured in 2014.

Mexican officials said they thought Guzman had injured his leg and face during the latest escape through the tunnel.
