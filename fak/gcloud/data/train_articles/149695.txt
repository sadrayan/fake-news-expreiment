Middendorp appointed as new coach
Following the departure of Giovanni Solinas, Kaizer Chiefs can confirm the appointment of Ernst Middendorp as the new head coach on a deal for two and a half years.

The German coach was in charge of Amakhosi from 2005 to 2007.

During that period, Middendorp led Chiefs to win several trophies, including the 2006 Absa Cup and the 2006 SAA Supa 8.

“We were looking for a coach who is experienced and who has an understanding of the club’s footballing culture,” commented Chairman Kaizer Motaung. “That’s certainly the case with Middendorp, who won trophies during his previous stint in charge of Kaizer Chiefs.

“Middendorp also understands South African football well, having a vast knowledge and experience of our local football. We are looking forward to working together.”

“We need stability and the coach will start working with the team on Saturday.”

The targeted assistant coach will be announced soon. Arthur Zwane will assist Middendorp for the upcoming three games.
