National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning

Holding: The Recess Appointments Clause authorizes the president to fill any existing vacancy during any recess – whether occurring during or between sessions of Congress – of sufficient length. However, for purposes of the clause, the Senate is in session whenever it indicates that it is, as long as – under its own rules – it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.

Judgment: Affirmed, 9-0, in an opinion by Justice Breyer on June 26, 2014. Justice Scalia filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, which Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito joined.
