Melania Trump Wore a $5,500 Erdem Dress on New Year's Eve
President Donald Trump and his family held a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago, their private residence in Palm Beach, Florida (which is sometimes referred to as the "Winter White House"). For the occasion, First Lady Melania Trump opted for an embroidered midlength dress from British label Erdem .

The pale-pink Emery dress, from the brand's Pre-Fall 2017 collection , is covered in paillettes from its high neck to the midcalf hem. Clusters of embroidered flowers are scattered throughout the forties-inspired silhouette. The style originally retailed for $5,500 at luxury retailer Browns . (It's sold out on Erdem's website .)

Though Erdem released the dress with a periwinkle-color belt, Melania removed it for the New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago. The resulting look, then, was more eighties than its original iteration. She finished the look off with pointed-toe stilettos in a matching shade of pink.

This Erdem style is in line with the First Lady's penchant for dramatic sleeves. (There were the equally draped, bell-shaped ones that made an appearance in that weird viral video of her watching ballerinas , and the puffy sculpted ones affixed to a $2,950 neon-fuschia dress by Delpozo that she wore to give a speech at the United Nations.) What's more, another member of the First Family wore the designer earlier this year: Ivanka Trump chose a midi dress from the brand's Fall 2017 collection to give a speech in India, per Footwear News .

Trump's Erdem gown, with its four-figure price tag, is now sold out at Browns as well.
