SPEAKER OLIVER: REPUBLICAN ANTI-WORKER BILL 'DEAD ON ARRIVAL'



(TRENTON) - Assembly Speaker Sheila Y. Oliver (D-Essex/Passaic) released the following statement Friday on recently introduced Republican legislation (A-4223) that would destroy the labor movement in New Jersey:



"This legislation is dead on arrival. It's that simple. Dead on arrival.

"Radical conservative ideology such as this has no place in New Jersey.

"This type of move may play elsewhere, but, quite simply, this anti-worker bill will never see the light of day.

"Not only is this legislation an atrocious assault on worker rights, but it's terrible economic policy. It would set back any chance we have under Gov. Christie of a strong recovery.

"Numerous studies have shown that these so-called right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth. In fact, these laws have been found to suppress wages and have had no impact on employment and business growth.

"Democrats and Republicans can work together for the common good and when appropriate to improve our economy and protect worker benefits, but this wage-cutting, anti-business bill is a line in the sand that cannot be crossed."
