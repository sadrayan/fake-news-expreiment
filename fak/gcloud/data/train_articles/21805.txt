Trend Information

Sample and Methodology detail



New York City voters give Mayor Bill de Blasio an anemic 42 - 44 percent job approval rating, with the wide racial gap that has marked every measure of the mayor since he took office in 2014, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released today.





Mayor de Blasio's approval rating is 66 - 23 percent among black voters. Hispanic voters are divided 40 - 40 percent. White voters disapprove 58 - 31 percent.





Today's results compare to a 43 - 40 percent approval rating in a December 5, 2018 survey by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University Poll.





Approval for the mayor today ranges from a negative 30 - 64 percent in Staten Island to a positive 50 - 38 percent in The Bronx. Approval is 53 - 34 percent among Democrats. Disapproval is 70 - 22 percent among Republicans and 52 - 34 percent among independent voters.





Voters approve 43 - 31 percent, with 27 percent undecided, of the job First Lady Chirlane McCray is doing.





De Blasio should not run for president, New York City voters say 76 - 18 percent. Every listed party, gender, racial, borough and age group agrees that the mayor should not hit the campaign trail.





It would be bad for New York City if de Blasio runs for president, voters say 47 - 32 percent, including 43 - 35 percent among Democrats.





"Mayor Bill de Blasio's flirtation with a 2020 White House bid is prompting a rare moment of unity among New Yorkers. Three-quarters of them say, 'Mr. Mayor: Don't do it,'" said Mary Snow, polling analyst for the Quinnipiac University Poll.





"As New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray's mental health program comes under scrutiny, she too is getting an anemic job approval rating similar to Mayor de Blasio's score."





New York City voters approve 51 - 34 percent of the job U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing. Approval ranges from a negative 39 - 57 percent in Staten Island to a positive 66 - 26 percent in The Bronx. Democrats approve 70 - 18 percent, as Republicans disapprove 71 - 11 percent. Independent voters are divided, as 42 percent approve and 44 percent disapprove.





"Another New Yorker in the national spotlight, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is proving less polarizing on her home turf of New York City. She only represents one district in the city, but slightly more than half of New Yorkers approve of the job she's doing," Snow said.





Gov. Andrew Cuomo gets a 51 - 42 percent job approval rating among New York City voters. Approval ratings for other citywide leaders are:

44 - 17 percent for Public Advocate Jumaane Williams;

48 - 21 percent for City Comptroller Scott Stringer;

47 - 20 percent for City Council Speaker Corey Johnson;

47 - 21 percent for Police Commissioner James O'Neill;

33 percent approve of the job Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza is doing, as 35 percent disapprove.

New York City voters disapprove 71 - 26 percent of the job President Donald Trump is doing. Republicans approve 81 - 19 percent, while every other listed group disapproves.





From March 27 - April 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,077 New York City voters with a margin of error of +/- 3.8 percentage points, including the design effect.
