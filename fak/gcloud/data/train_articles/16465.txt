Dr. Kerr:

I write because weâ€™re trying to check a claim that the Texas Capitol faces south to honor what happened at Goliad.

I am hoping you have researched why the Capitol faces south or have other suggestions.

Thanks.

I have never heard that. When the city was founded, Edwin Waller planned to place the capitol in the center of town until he actually got here. When he saw the landscape he realized the best spot was north (15th was the north boundary) so as to overlook the city from the hill on which it sits. The choice was geographic; facing it north would have faced it away from town. The current capitol merely carried on that tradition as far as I know. When it was designed in the 1880s most of the city (certainly the business part of town and government buildings) still lay toward the river. I cannot state that honoring Goliad was not a consideration; I've just never seen that mentioned anywhere.
