UFO SIGHTINGS DAILY: Alien Creature Found On Mars, Similar To Hairy Sâ€¦
Date of discovery: Dec 29, 2016

Location of discovery: Mars, MSL 1276-M34 SDS





I found this four legged alien creature on Mars and it looks like a hairy spider monkey. The longer upper arms are holding it up as well as its shorter lower legs. If you add light to the face, you can easily make out two eyes. As you can see, this animal is watching the Mars rover.





I also found some other anomalies that are all signs of life on Mars. Some houses, some faces, a human like figure sitting down, and decorative foundation corners. All are interesting so I included them below.





We the public no longer need to depend on the US government to drop feed us information about life on Mars and other celestial bodies. We are taking the initiative and we have proven on this site that life exists a thousand times over. Somewhere along the line, Americans got lost and began depending on the government for all their important information...but some information is a threat to national security...such as UFO technology and alien intelligence, so they can't announce it. What would happen if Taiwan found out about aliens and got some of their DNA and began cloning aliens so that they could help taiwan become a more powerful nation. That would be a game changer. Tilting the scale of power from the big countries to the smallest. We no longer need to depend on our governments for knowledge. We have each other, and that gives us more hard working people and more in depth research results.
