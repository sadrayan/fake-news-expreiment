Today All hail the foremost representative of fashion royalty! A British magazine created this image of Michelle Obama as a queen to promote its best-dressed list.

Michelle Obama has been crowned fashion royalty by Britain’s Sunday Times Style Magazine, which ranked the first lady at the top of its best-dressed list.

To promote the issue, the magazine released an ad featuring a profile of Mrs. Obama wearing a crown on a British first-class postage stamp, a spot traditionally reserved for the Queen of England.

In her home country, the 49-year-old first lady graces the current cover of Vogue magazine in a photograph highlighting her now-famous bangs, her signature toned arms and a blue and purple Reed Krakoff sleeveless dress.

“I always say that women should wear whatever makes them feel good about themselves,” she told the magazine. “That’s what I always try to do.”
