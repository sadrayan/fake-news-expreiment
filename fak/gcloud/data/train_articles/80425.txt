Trump Gains On Clinton, But Both Have Sky-High Negatives: IBD/TIPP Poll
Riding on a string of big victories in the presidential primaries, Donald Trump has not only extended his lead against his GOP rivals, but also he has gained ground against Hillary Clinton, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Poll.

The poll finds that Trump now leads Ted Cruz by 19 points -- 48% to 29% -- which is more than double his lead last month. At the same time, Hillary’s lead over Trump is now just seven points (47% to 40%), down from 12 points last month.

What’s more, 65% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now pick Trump as either their first or second choice for the GOP nomination compared with just 49% last month. Cruz dropped from 63% to 57%.

Among Democrats, Clinton beats Bernie Sanders 49% to 43%.

The poll, taken from April 22 and April 28, also shows that Trump has some glaring vulnerabilities should he be the Republican nominee.

Despite Trump’s supposed appeal with blue collar voters, Clinton does better among those who earn less than $35,000 a year (53% to 38%), while Trump ties Clinton among those making more than $75,000. Trump does, however, do better than Clinton among the less educated, beating her 48% to 43% with those who have only a high school education.

Trump also faces an enormous gender gap with Clinton. While he gets more male votes than Clinton (45% to 43%), Clinton gets 51% of the female vote to Trump’s 36%.

And his support among Republicans remains weak. Even as the primary season winds down, his support among Republicans and GOP leaners is still below 50%. Romney was polling much better than this in late March 2012, and John McCain was over 60% by the end of February 2008.

Trump’s negative ratings are also sky-high, with 62% of the public saying they have an unfavorable view of the likely GOP nominee, while just 36% view him favorably. Far more independents dislike Trump than like him -- 60% vs. 37%.

Hillary Clinton’s negatives are high, as well, but not as high as Trump’s. Forty-three percent view Clinton favorably compared with 56% who view her unfavorably. She gets identical low marks among independents, however.

More alarming for Trump supporters is the fact that 51% say they have a “very unfavorable” view of Trump compared with just 16% who say they have a “very favorable” view of him.

Even among Republicans, 1-in-5 have a “very unfavorable” view of Trump, while only 31% view him very favorably. And conservatives are likelier to have a very unfavorable view of Trump than very favorable, 33% to 23%.

Far fewer people have a “very unfavorable” opinion of Clinton than Trump -- 40% to Trump’s 51% -- and she scores much better among Democrats than Trump does among Republicans

However, Clinton’s ongoing email scandal makes her vulnerable. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of those following the scandal say Clinton likely compromised national security by using a private email server for government-related work while secretary of state. More than a third of Democrats (38%) believe this.

And 70% say she should drop out of the race if the FBI investigation finds she broke the law. Almost half of Democrats (44%) would want her to do so.

Other IBD/TIPP Poll Findings:

Obama’s approval rating ticked up to 49% this month, while 44% disapprove. That’s up from 46% approval in February.

Just 31% say Obama has done a good job handing ISIS.

62% say the country is headed in the wrong direction.

50% say the economy is not improving, while 47% say it is getting better.

55% say they are not satisfied with current federal economic policies.
