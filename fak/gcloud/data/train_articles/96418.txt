WEBVTT AND ALAN MORRIS IS A REPORTER FOR THE CONCORD MONITOR. FIRST QUESTION IS GOING TO GO TO STEVE MARCH AND BUT IT WILL BE DIRECTED TO ALL OF YOU AT ONE POINT. ROUGHLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE ELECTORATE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE CANDIDATES ON STAGE TONIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION. WITH THAT IN MIND, TELL US ABOUT PERSONAL SACRIFICE THAT HAS HELPED YOU BECOME WHO YOU ARE. STEVE MARCHAND: I AM A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN. A BANKRUPTCY FROM A HEALTH CARE CRISIS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, IT HELPS INFORM PUBLIC POLICY. IF IT WASN'T FOR GREAT PUBLIC EDUCATION AT COST FOR CLARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, I WOULDN'T YOU HERE TODAY. IF WE HAD MEDICAID EXPANSION BACK THEN, WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE CRISIS. REALIZE YOU CAN'T DO IT ALL BY YOURSELF NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY. THAT'S THE SPIRIT IN WHICH I CONDUCT MY CAMPAIGN. WE INCLUDE FOLKS THAT MAY BE DON'T START AT THE TOP ON DAY ONE.

MARK CONNOLLY: I CAN TELL YOU I'M A NEW HAMPSHIRE NATIVE AND MY PARENTS DIVORCED WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD. BROTHER AND MYSELF, WE MOVED EVERY YEAR. AND WAS TOLD I WAS A REMEDIAL LEARNER. AND A GREAT SCHOOLTEACHER PICKED UP THE FACT THAT SO MANY KIDS, I WENT FROM THE REMEDIAL LAST TO THE ADVANCED CLASS. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WH IT LIKE NOT TO HAVE MUCH. I REMEMBER ONE TIME WE WERE LIVING WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD INSIDE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. WE HAD TO HIDE THE CAR IN THE WOODS BECAUSE THE MOTHER COULD NOT MAKE HER CAR PAYMENT. THESE OF THE KIND OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY TODAY WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A LOT. WANT TO GIVE BACK TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE DONE SO MUCH FOR ME. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN
