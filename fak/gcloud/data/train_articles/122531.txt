Mojave National Preserve (U.S. National Park Service)
Desert solitude in Southern California Singing sand dunes, volcanic cinder cones, Joshua tree forests, and carpets of wildflowers are all found at this 1.6 million acre park. A visit to its canyons, mountains and mesas will reveal long-abandoned mines, homesteads, and rock-walled military outposts. Located between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Mojave provides serenity and solitude from major metropolitan areas. Desert Light Gallery at Kelso Depot Visitor Center Mojave National Preserve invites desert travelers to experience Face to Face: Mojave's Belly Flowers, a photography exhibit by Terry Ellis at the Desert Light Gallery in Kelso Depot Visitor Center. October 2, 2010 - January 3, 2011.
