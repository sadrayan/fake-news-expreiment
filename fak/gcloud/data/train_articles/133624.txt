CIA Undergraduate Internship Program
Interested in foreign affairs? Looking for a career where you can make a difference? We invite you to participate in our Undergraduate Internship Program. This unique program is designed to give promising undergraduate students, particularly minorities and people with disabilities, the opportunity to gain practical work experience that complements their academic studies.



You will be given the opportunity to work with highly-skilled professionals and see first-hand the role the CIA plays in supporting US officials who make our country's foreign policy. We are interested in students majoring in engineering, computer science, mathematics, economics, physical sciences, foreign languages, area studies, business administration, accounting, international relations, finance, logistics, human resources, geography, national security studies, military and foreign affairs, political science and graphic design.



Interns are required to work either a combination of one semester and one summer internship, or two 90-day summer internships.
