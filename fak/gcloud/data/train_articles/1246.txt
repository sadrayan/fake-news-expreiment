Denver Post Wins Pulitzer Prize for Public Service
The Denver Post was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for meritorious public service today for its "in-depth study of missing children, which revealed that most are involved in custody disputes or are runaways, and which helped mitigate national fears stirred by exaggerated statistics."

The public service award, which carries a gold medal award but no cash and is awarded to a newspaper rather than to individual journalists, has traditionally been the most coveted of the journalism Pulitzers since the awards were first made in 1917. The other awards carry a prize of $1,000 each.

The Pulitzer Prize for fiction was awarded this year to "Lonesome Dove" by Larry McMurtry. Two awards were given in general nonfiction--to "Move Your Shadow: South Africa, Black and White" by Joseph Lelyveld and to "Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families" by J. Anthony Lukas.

Other arts and letters awards included:

--History: " . . . The Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age" by Walter A. McDougall.
