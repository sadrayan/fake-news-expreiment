Mississippi and the 19th Amendment (U.S. National Park Service)
State of Mississippi colored gray, indicating it was not one of the initial 36 states to ratify the 19th Amendment. CC0

Women first organized and collectively fought for suffrage at the national level in July of 1848. Suffragists such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott convened a meeting of over 300 people in Seneca Falls, New York. In the following decades, women marched, protested, lobbied, and even went to jail. By the 1870s, women pressured Congress to vote on an amendment that would recognize their suffrage rights. This amendment became known as the 19th Amendment.

After decades of arguments for and against women's suffrage, Congress finally voted in favor of the 19th Amendment in 1919. After Congress passed the 19th Amendment, at least 36 states needed to vote in favor of it for it to become law.



On March 29, 1920 Mississippi voted against ratifying the 19th Amendment. By August of 1920, however, 36 states ratified the 19th Amendment, recognizing women's voting rights -- including in Mississippi.
