Congratulations! You get a NEW HOUSE! 🏠
Today, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduced her “Green New Deal” – a socialist wish list that nearly every leading 2020 Democrat supports.

Here’s what we know:

Demands a 100% transition to renewable energy within 10 years, but doesn’t explain how.

Upgrades or replaces every building in the U.S. (Congrats on your new house!)

Eliminates fossil fuels completely, putting about 1 million Americans out of work.

Requires government-provided health care, jobs, wages, paid vacations, retirement benefits, housing, food, college, “access to nature,” and the list goes on and on

Aims to “get rid of farting cows and airplanes.” Seriously.

Lacks a funding mechanism. Shocking.

And it’s already being widely mocked as radical and totally unserious:

Any proposal to radically reduce US carbon emissions in the near term *while also* completely phasing out nuclear power is not a serious proposal https://t.co/8t2oexrpmO — Lachlan Markay (@lachlan) February 7, 2019

The green New Deal: "Upgrade or replace every building in US for state-of-the-art energy

efficiency."

This isn’t just radical environmentalism, it’s a massive taxpayer boondoggle that would give government control over nearly every aspect of our lives.

Reminder: This isn’t just some fringe idea, either. It’s more likely than not Democrats will choose a nominee in 2020 who supports it.
