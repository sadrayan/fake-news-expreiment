Conclusions Our findings suggest that standing and walking at work during the second trimester may present a particular risk for preterm delivery, and workplace guidelines are justified. Further research is needed to address the specific mechanisms by which physical exertion, including standing and walking, might cause preterm delivery.

Results After adjustment for confounders, women standing more than five hours per work day had an odds ratio (OR) for preterm delivery of 1.2 (95% CI 0.6 to 2.4) compared with women standing two hours or less. For walking, the OR was 1.4 (95% CI 0.7 to 2.5). Many women were unable to separate periods of standing from periods of walking; a combined measure of these two exposures was created to reflect exposure intensity. Women who reported more than five hours of both standing and walking had an adjusted OR of 3.3 (95% CI 1.4 to 8.0) compared with women who reported two hours or less on either of the exposures. No adverse effects were seen for lifting or other types of physical exertion.

Subjects and design A prospective cohort of 8711 women with singleton pregnancies was established during 1989 through 1991. Information was collected during the 16th week of pregnancy about medical and obstetrical history, general lifestyle factors and exposures at work. The analyses were restricted to 4259 respondents who worked at the 16th week. Potential confounders and effect modifiers were evaluated by stratification and multivariate analyses.

Objective Guidelines in some European countries and the United States suggest that pregnant women should avoid prolonged standing and heavy lifting in the workplace during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. However, results from epidemiological studies on this topic are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of standing and walking at work in the second trimester on preterm delivery in a population with a low frequency of other workplace hazards.

Subjects and methods All pregnant women attending routine antenatal care at the Department of Obstetrics at Aarhus University Hospital from August 1 1989 through September 30 1991 were invited to participate in the study. The department is the only maternity ward in the city and serves a geographical area of approximately 250000 inhabitants. Compliance with the antenatal care programme in Denmark is almost 100%. Women unable to communicate in Danish, pregnancies with more than a single fetus, and women with fetal death before 28 completed weeks of gestation were excluded (n= 964); 8711 women remained eligible for the study. The project was approved by the regional committee for ethics in science. At the first antenatal visit around the 16th week of gestation women were asked to fill in two questionnaires, Q basic and Q 16 . The first questionnaire was used in generating the women's medical record and as the study entry questionnaire. It provided women's medical and obstetrical history, menstrual data, and data on smoking and alcohol consumption. Data obtained by the more extensive Q 16 included psychosocial factors (e.g., life events, psychological distress, and social support), marital status, education and occupational status, social class based on their partner's education and job and scored from high (1) to low social class (3–5), leisure time activities, and domestic obligations. Q 16 contained quantitative as well as qualitative questions about the women's work history around the time of the visit. Quantitative questions included weekly hours at work, mean and peak exposures of hours working in the standing, walking and sitting position each day, and mean and peak exposures of loads lifted in kg/day and kg/h, respectively (see Appendix). Qualitative questions included changes in body position during the workday, whether it was possible to have rest periods or not (see Appendix), the extent to which women felt that the job was physically demanding, and whether the job required lifting or moving heavy loads. Information on chemical and radiological exposures, noise, vibrations, extreme ambient temperatures, humidity, and psychosocial job strain were also collected by Q 16 . A reminder was mailed twice to nonresponders. Prior to the routine antenatal visit in the 30th week of gestation, all women who responded to Q basic and Q 16 received a third questionnaire (Q 30 which was substantially the same as Q 16 . For Q 30 , a reminder was mailed once to nonresponders. All three questionnaires were completed at home, and they were typically returned at the routine antenatal visits. None of the medical staff taking care of the pregnant women had access to Q 16 or Q 30 . Immediately after delivery the tending midwife made a structured report on the obstetric and medical complications during pregnancy, the course of delivery, and the condition of the newborn, including weight, length, sex, and Apgar score. These data were cross‐validated by a research midwife by review of hospital records. Q basic was returned by 8546 (98%) of the women in the cohort, Q 16 by 7007 (80%), and Q 30 by 5875 (67%). Due to very early preterm delivery or complications related to preterm delivery some women did not return Q 30 , therefore the principal analyses were conducted within the group of women who responded to Q basic and Q 16 . Information from Q 30 was used only to estimate changes in exposures, including sick leave between the 16th and 30th week of pregnancy that might have modified the associations of interest. The analyses were restricted to the 4407 women who reported to have paid work and were not students at the 16th week of pregnancy. Women with cardiovascular, pulmonary or kidney diseases, diabetes or other metabolic diseases, or epilepsy diagnosed prior to pregnancy were excluded (n= 141). In seven cases gestational age was missing, leaving the ultimate study cohort with 4259 women. Standing and walking at work were evaluated both as continuous (hours/day) and as categorised variables in order to explore doseresponse relations. The categories were ≤ 2, > 2 to 5, and > 5 hours/day. The cutoff levels were chosen so that the highest exposure category was as high as possible while still having a sufficient number of cases to be informative. Also, in order to evaluate the recommendations from the American Medical Association (Council on Scientific Affairs 1984), the number of uninterrupted hours standing and walking was dichotomised at < 4 and ≥ 4 hours. Hours walking and hours standing were not independent: women were often not able to distinguish long periods of walking from long periods of standing and stated the same number of hours for standing and walking. Therefore, these exposures were evaluated in three ways: 1 Hours standing per workday (without taking into account hours of walking);

2 Hours walking per workday (without taking into account hours of standing);

3 A combined measure of periods of walking and standing based on the three categories for both standing and walking. By this latter procedure three categories of exposure were created. Exact specifications for these categories are provided in Table 1. Table 1.

In women without an early ultrascan gestational age was estimated from the last menstrual period (LMP), adjusted for the women's usual cycle length to a length of 28 days. In 386 cases (9.1%) in which neither early ultrascan nor menstrual cycle length was obtained the gestational age from the birth certificate was used. This gestational age was the midwives' estimate based on their knowledge of ultrasound measurements at 21 completed weeks or later, the LMP, the clinical estimates during pregnancy, and the clinical examination of the newborn. Preterm delivery was defined as delivery before 37 completed weeks (WHO 1977). Statistical methods Associations between the potential risk factors and preterm delivery were evaluated by χ2 tests for independence within contingency tables, including the test for trend when appropriate. Multiple variables were taken into account using multiple logistic regression (Hosmer & Lemeshow 1989). Mean values are presented with one standard deviation (mean ± SD). Odds ratios (ORs) are presented with 95% coniidence intervals (CI); statistical significance was defined as a two‐sided P value less than 0.05. Potential confounding variables were tested in the multivariate analyses as dummy variables: if they changed the estimate of association of interest, they remained in the final model (Greenland 1989). Missing data on variables controlled in the multivariate analyses were tested by giving them the values most likely to distort the result. If this procedure did not change the estimate of interest, missing values were imputed on the basis of nonmissing values of associated variables (Little & Rubin 1987).

Results Among the 4259 women who had paid employment during at least the first 16 weeks of pregnancy the mean duration of pregnancy was 281±7 (±12±2) days. The incidence of preterm delivery was 3±7%. The rate of preterm deliveries by obstetrical, medical and socio‐economical variables are shown in Table 2. Risk of preterm delivery was lowest for women in the highest social class and for those giving birth to their second child. The risk was highest among women with previous preterm delivery or spontaneous abortion, women who had had either an extremely high or extremely low pre‐pregnant weight, and those who smoked, were unmarried, or less educated.

Table 1 also shows physical exertion from domestic obligations and leisure time activities. Women standing and walking at work more than 5 h per day had an increased rate of preterm deliveries: the longer hours of standing or walking the more preterm deliveries. This was true for both mean and peak exposures. The rate of preterm deliveries was also increased in cases with no change in posture during the workday and in cases with long weekly hours at work. In contrast, the rate of preterm deliveries was decreased with increasing physical activities during leisure time. Most of the women with prolonged standing and walking were nursing aides, shopkeepers, nurses, cleaners and childminders. No association between exposure to noise, night or shift work, organic solvents or anaesthetic gases, or extreme ambient temperatures and preterm delivery was found (data not shown). Each of these exposures was present in less than 5% of the pregnancies. The number of hours standing at work was associated with other factors related to preterm delivery. The influence of these factors was evaluated by stratification and multivariate analyses. Five of the variables listed in Table 1 and Table 2 affected the estimates of the association between hours standing and preterm delivery; adjusted estimates are presented in Table 3. Table 3.

Walking and standing, analysed as continuous exposures, were not significantly associated with preterm delivery, although all risk estimates were above 1. This was also true for peak exposures (data not shown). When the exposures were analysed as categorised in relation to preterm delivery, a homogenous picture of the estimated associations could be seen: there was a tendency among all women with more than 2h standing or walking towards higher risks for preterm delivery, compared with women walking or standing 2 h or less. Walking had higher risk estimates, as did the corresponding exposure to standing. Moreover, women who reported high exposure on both variables (i.e., they were not able to separate the two exposures) had higher estimates than women who reported merely walking. Compared with women who reported walking or standing two hours or less per day, women who reported more than 5 h of both had more than three times the risk of delivering preterm (OR = 3.3, CI 1.4 to 8.0). In each of the three mean exposures, a dose response pattern was found: the more hours of standing or walking or both, the higher the risk of preterm delivery. Interactions Several variables were analysed by stratification as potential effect modifiers. No differences among the observed associations were found across the different levels of the following variables (Table 1): change in body position, rest periods at work, leisure time activity, partner's social class, or physical work at home. When women with less than 30 weekly work hours were excluded, the estimated risks for preterm delivery were slightly increased. Furthermore, there was a tendency towards a stronger association among primiparous women than among women who had previously given birth. The finding was most pronounced among primiparous women who reported standing and walking for more than 5 h per day. Restriction of the analyses to women with no experience of previous preterm delivery or previous miscarriage (n = 3385) did not change the estimates of the associations nor the levels of significance presented in Table 3. The same was true when women who experiencedvaginal bleeding prior to filling in Q 16 , as well as when women with induced labour, were excluded, leaving 3658 and 3737 cases in the analyses, respectively. Changes of exposures throughout pregnancy Of the 4259 women in the study, 3647 (86%) returned Q 30 . Women who did not fill in this questionnaire had more preterm deliveries. Relatively fewer women with standing work at the 16th week of gestation filled in Q 30 . Still, it was possible to examine the changes in exposures that occurred from the 16th to the 30th gestational weeks: of the 3647 women, 2683 (74%) were still working at 30 weeks gestation, 18 % were on sick leave, and 8 % were no longer employed. More women who reported jobs involving long hours of standing and walking at 16 gestational weeks were out of work in the 30th week. These women who had left jobs involving long hours of standing or walking prior to 30 gestational weeks had the same risk of preterm deliveries as women with the same exposures in the 16th week who kept working through the third trimester. Among women who worked in the third trimester, the mean weekly work hours were slightly shorter than in the second trimester. Furthermore, the number of hours standing at work had decreased, although the correlations between the reported mean hours walking and standing in the 16th week with the mean hours in the 30th week were quite high (r = 0.60, P < 0.01 and r = 0.64, P 0.01, respectively). Women working in the 30th week of gestation had the same tendency as reported previously towards reduced gestational age with increasing hours worked in the standing position. Physical workloads at home, and physical activities during leisure time were also reduced among women in the third trimester, compared with the second.
