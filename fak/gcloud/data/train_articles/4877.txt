Date: 07/14/2015

Location: Dunwoody, GA

On Tuesday, July 13, 2015 the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police recognized the Dunwoody Police Department with the department’s initial State Certification for meeting more than 100 professional police standards. The award was presented to the police department during the Dunwoody City Council Meeting.

“The Certification process opened our department up to intense scrutiny by an outside organization to determine if the department’s policies and procedures are patterned after nationally accepted best practices. After a thorough review, the Dunwoody Police Department was awarded State Certification through the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police. This certification is validation that the high standards we hold our staff to is aligned with national best practices. Members of the Dunwoody Police Department have faithfully served Dunwoody for over six years and I hope this achievement will instill even greater public confidence in our agency and staff.” - Chief Billy Grogan

The Dunwoody Police Department met 129 standards set forth by the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police. These standards cover eight critical areas essential to effective law enforcement and provide a blueprint for professional law enforcement to follow. There are more than 700 law enforcement agencies in Georgia and fewer than 20 percent of those agencies have achieved this status. Sergeant Andrew Fondas was designated as the Certification Manager and was given the task of and bore the responsibility of guiding our department through the process.
