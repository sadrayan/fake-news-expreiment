Eligibility is based on the financial situation of all members in a household. Everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares food together is considered a member of the same household group.

In general, DHS will review your expenses, assets, and income to determine what, if any, benefits for which you may be eligible. For questions about the Food Assistance Program, call 1-855-275-6424.
