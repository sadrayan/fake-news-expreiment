Subject: Re: Texas reporter seeking quick help

The closest number I can get is "more than ten million." This is sourced by both the Air Force and Fox News. Audience counts during WWII were sporadically reported, so there is some ambiguity in making an estimation. He did, however, routinely do 150 shows during a single tour. Hope this is helpful.

My best,

Jim
