Eclipse Ballooning Project
We believe strongly in making the most of this rare astronomical event, in the realms of the general public, education, and creating meaningful long-lasting partnerships. We also believe strongly in giving the student participants career-making opportunities. This means there will be no black boxes and we will endeavor to use the most cutting edge tools, resources, and communication.

Students have conducted high altitude balloon (HAB) flights from over 25 locations across the 8/21/2017 total eclipse path, from Oregon to South Carolina, sending live video and images from near space to the NASA website. Video and images of a total eclipse from near space are fascinating â€“ and this is the first time it has been done live from a high altitude balloon with network coverage across a continent.
