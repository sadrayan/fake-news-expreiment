Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change
A more prosperous future for all Canadians

The Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change is our plan – developed with the provinces and territories and through engagement with Indigenous peoples – to meet our emissions reduction targets, grow the economy, and build resilience to a changing climate. Our plan includes a pan-Canadian approach to pricing carbon pollution, and measures to achieve reductions across all sectors of the economy. It aims to drive innovation and growth by increasing technology development and adoption to ensure Canadian businesses are competitive in the global low-carbon economy. It also includes actions to advance climate change adaptation and build resilience to climate impacts across the country.
