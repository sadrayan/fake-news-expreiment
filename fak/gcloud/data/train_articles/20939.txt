AOC opposes Daylight Savings Time because “the extra hour of sunlight drastically speeds up climate change”
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez showed her ecological genius once again on Saturday when she announced to congress her opposition to Daylight Savings Time. Despite the criticisms she receives on a regular basis from clueless conservatives who can’t see past the barrels of their AR15s, she continues to press onward, driving progressive ideology where it belongs – in the the hearts and minds of all Americans (and foreign born Americans living overseas).

In congress today, she spoke for a record three 3 hours and 58 minutes covering a variety of topics – all in a response to being asked “how will we pay for the Green New Deal?” Her monologue of an answer consisted of a myriad of reasons to vote for the Green New Deal as well as an explanation as to why we must immediately do away with Daylight Savings Time.

If we change our times with the sole intent of increasing the amount of daylight we receive, that’s an extra hour of sun shine that will warm the planet. That’s one extra hour per day of extra heat warming our already unstable planet. We need to repeal Daylight Savings Time as a primary measure to decrease the rate of climate change. Less hours of sun shine equal less heat hitting Earth’s surface. We’re running out of time! Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

It’s shocking that no one has thought of this before. Once again, AOC proves to be a master of economic and ecologic ingenuity as she so effortlessly explains solutions to our planet’s problems.We need more forward thinking progressives like her in congress in order to have even a fighting chance for Earth to prosper.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the saving grace for America.
