Senate Republicans late Tuesday were unable to pass the latest version of their plan to overhaul the US healthcare system, paving the way for what appears to be a more modest attempt at undoing the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law better known as Obamacare.

An amended version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act failed 57-43, as nine Republican senators joined all Democrats in opposing it. It needed 60 votes to advance.

The latest version of the BCRA — which Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon nicknamed "Trumpcare 3.0" — reinserted an amendment that experts argued could have had a big impact on people with preexisting medical conditions.

The revised version of the bill proposed that more funds would be set aside for the opioid crisis and that people would be able to pay for premiums using a health savings account. It also proposed deep cuts to Medicaid.

Here's the quick summary of what was in the new bill:

The Consumer Freedom Amendment, proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.

The Portman Amendment, which provided $100 billion in funding designed to stabilize states.

It also changed a section that would have made out-of-pocket maximums technically higher than what's allowed by the law.
