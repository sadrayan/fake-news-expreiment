Statement, Rep. Matt Schaefer, Feb. 22, 2016 (received by email, Alisha J. Jackson, chief of staff to Schaefer)

2:59 p.m.

Below is Rep. Schaefer's statement regarding your earlier question on the reason House Bill 2308 never made it out of committee in the 83rd session:

"Byron Cook was the reason my abortion reporting bill never left committee in the 83rd. Chairman Cook later voted to kill the same measure when I presented it as an amendment to the HHSC sunset bill in the 84th."

Thanks for contacting us about this--please let us know if we can be of further assistance.
