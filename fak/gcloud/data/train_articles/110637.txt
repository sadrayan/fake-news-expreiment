‘GONG’ ASSAULT HATE CRIME: DA
The Brooklyn DA is seeking hate-crime charges against a Chinatown man who attacked a Falun Gong practitioner with a steering-wheel locking device.

Victor Yau, 60, is accused of smashing software engineer John Yu, a devotee of the controversial Chinese spiritual movement, in the hand on June 15 in Sunset Park.

The clash followed weeks of simmering unrest between Falun Gong practitioners and critics in the city’s Chinese-American communities.
