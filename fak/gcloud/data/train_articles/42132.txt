Best Babies Zone, a national initiative to reduce racial disparities in infant death rates, announced that it has added Milwaukee's Westlawn neighborhood to its list of communities that will receive its support.

While no funding is associated with the initiative, Westlawn will join communities in nine other cities that, through the Best Babies Zone program, work with national experts to develop new strategies to address the seemingly intransigent disparity in the rate at which white and black babies die in Milwaukee.

The Milwaukee Health Department reported in May that though the city has succeeded in reducing its overall infant mortality rate, black babies die at nearly three times the rate of white babies.

Babies in the Westlawn ZIP code die at a rate that is 25% higher than the rest of the city.

The United Way of Greater Milwaukee & Waukesha County, working with Mayor Tom Barrett's office, will lead the Best Babies Zone initiative.
