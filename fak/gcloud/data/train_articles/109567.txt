What drew you to the law?

I’ve always been drawn to helping others. And I love reading, writing and solving puzzles. These characteristics fit naturally with the practice of law. Happily, they also fit well with teaching others to practice law. Plus, I hate blood. So between “doctor or lawyer,” it wasn’t even close.

What do you enjoy most about teaching?

I enjoy getting to know my students and helping them to develop skills that allow them to succeed. I love learning what drives them to come to law school and seeing the passion they bring with them. Lawyers are often portrayed negatively in society, but I’ve found my students and colleagues to be among the most generous people I know.

What do you hope students gain from your courses?

Is “everything they need to practice law” too ambitious an answer? I hope my students will learn to identify legal issues effectively, to locate governing standards efficiently, to apply those standards logically and to communicate their analysis clearly. I also hope that students leave my courses feeling more confident that they can do all of these things.

What did you do prior to entering academia?

I practiced at large law firms in Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas. My primary practice areas included complex litigation, insurance coverage and appellate law.

What are you passionate about outside of the law?

I am passionate about my family. I have an amazing husband, and we have three smart, funny children. I enjoy traveling and exploring with them.

What are your research interests?

My research focuses on complex litigation issues. Recently I have been exploring various challenges presented in effectively managing aggregate litigation.
