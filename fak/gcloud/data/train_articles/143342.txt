This was definitely a heart-breaking story during which most of the time I was so angry with Bobby's mother that, if I could have, I would have taken her children and raised them myself. It didn't matter that she suffered from some form of mental illness; I just saw two suffering children and wanted to shelter them.



Largely left on their own as their mother tried to put food on the table, Bobby and his sister became the closest of friends - enjoying their imaginations and even daring to play games with their landlord, at one point, and watching a movie at a theater on another occasion, in spite of their mother's admonition to not interact with anyone, nor to go out.



In spite of everything, though, the two survived but Bobby's life came to a crashing halt when his house went up in flames, killing his mother and sister, especially since he was blamed for setting the fire. On the verge of becoming independent and following his dreams, it seemed that Bobby could never catch a break.



Even so, as the story unfolds, the story becomes inspirational and offers a measure of hope to others who may find themselves in similar circumstances as Bobby. It goes to show that, with the proper outlook on life, anything is possible.
