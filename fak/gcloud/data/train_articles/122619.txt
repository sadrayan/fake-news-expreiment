Judge Judy is not a Supreme Court justice
The verdict is in â€” American kids are clueless.

An alarming one in 10 college graduates believe that Judge Judith Sheindlin, better known as Judge Judy, is actually a Supreme Court justice, according to a recent study from the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA).

Sheindlin, of course, has been the star of television show "Judge Judy" since 1996. Although she's not a Supreme Court justice, Sheindlin has been a judge in New York City for over 30 years, according to her biography on the show's website.

10% of college graduates answered on the Constitution Day Survey that they thought Judge Judy served on the U.S. Supreme Court. (www.goacta.org)

The survey asked participants to answer multiple choice questions about constitutional knowledge.

Besides the Judge Judy gaffe, an embarrassing nearly 40% of people did not know that Congress can declare war and almost 50% weren't aware that the Senate handles presidential impeachments.
