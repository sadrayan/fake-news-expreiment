Leadership for All People, therefore I’ve made the decision to represent San Juan County.

Most have known me as a parent, an educator, school administrator, and community member who supports youth, elders, veterans, women, educational equity, and economic development.

I firmly believe that a good leader must be a great servant. It is important to have a strong educational background in Navajo culture, especially in this 21st century a college degree is necessary to make appropriate decisions for everyone.

I hold a bachelor’s degree from Fort Lewis College. My master’s degree is in Educational Leadership from Brigham Young University. Currently, I have a Doctorate of Education, All But Dissertation.

My civic duties included:

*Serving on the San Juan County Mental Health Board

*San Juan Blue Ribbon Committee

*Navajo Nation Board of Education

*Navajo Nation Advisory Council for People with Disabilities

*American Indian Higher Education Consortium

*National Congress of American Indians

*National Associations of Elementary School Principals

*National Indian Education Association

*Tribal College Committee
