The Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops does not take positions in elections and is not responding to comment on the candidates for U.S. Senate. In response to questions about HB 3859, our support of it, and our work since its passage, I offer you the following statement for attribution:

HB 3859 was intended to ensure a diverse and broad range of foster care providers and parents, which Texas foster children need. It does not exclude any one. Instead, the bill is defensive. It is intended to protect faith-based providers who place children in loving, safe and stable homes led by a married mother and father who practice the faith of the birth mother or child, and foster parents who wish to practice their faith while fostering a child. It does NOT affect state entities or secular organizations who may have different beliefs on family, marriage and faith. Today, three-fourths of all providers in Texas are not faith-based.

By allowing faithful engagement for those who are motivated to serve because of their religious convictions, the bill expands the diversity of competent providers and loving, stable families who can help the children of Texas. For example, the Texas Bishops launched a major parish based foster care recruitment and retention ministry, The St. Joseph Ministry, in March of 2018. A bilingual parish toolkit has been sent to all 1300 Catholic parishes in Texas to encourage parishes and parishioners to engage in the important work of serving those involved with the foster care system in Texas.

Fundamentally, this bill supported religious diversity and engagement and we are seeing positive outcomes from its passage through renewed engagement in collaborative efforts to serve the children of Texas.

In His Peace,

Jennifer Allmon
