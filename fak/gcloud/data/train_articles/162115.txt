sudden attack of derive and I ended up in some bar.)))

This year’s speakers include Ward Churchill (recently much in the news for his inflammatory remarks on 9/11), Chris Carlsson (editor of “Processed World” and originator of Critical Mass bike rides), Peter Werbe (radical radio commentator and editor of “Fifth Estate”) and Barry Pateman (editor, Emma Goldman Papers).

(((Imagine these guys all clustered around the hot



dogs and pork chops in a backyard barbecue.)))
