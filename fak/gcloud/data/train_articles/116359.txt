Burial plan to deter suicide bombs

JERUSALEM -- Burying Palestinian suicide bombers with pig skin or pig blood could deter potential attackers, an Israeli official says.

Deputy Israeli police minister Gideon Esra made the suggestion in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot.

According to Muslim belief, being buried in pig skin or blood could make the body ineligible for martyr status, the newspaper said.

Although the Koran teaches against suicide, Palestinian suicide bombers targeting Israelis are seen by supporters as martyrs and are said to be living in the heavens.

Their likenesses have been painted on walls, even though in some cases the bombers killed only themselves.

Eleven suicide bombs since October 2001 have killed more than 30 Israelis, including 21 outside a Tel Aviv disco in June.

Several dozen young Palestinian men have died in suicide bombings in the past eight months.

Esra, of the right-wing Likud party, also suggested close relatives of suicide bombers should be detained in the future as an additional deterrent.
