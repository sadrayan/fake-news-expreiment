Washington Post "forgot" to tell you about this: http://i.imgur.com/4og64Y4.png

Her memorial service was streamed live and recording is available: https://www.facebook.com/humantraffickingcenter/videos/10154126938121395/

Her boss/professor Claude d'Estree said (beginning 39:30 mark of the stream):

"(She) decided to take on one of the demagogues in the field of human trafficking."

"Produced a 110-page analysis of human trafficking in Haiti - 2 years of research."

"We were looking for someone who was smart enough and maybe brave enough to publish her work"

"I will continue to seek out and publish it for her"

"We are in a state of shock. We may never know what exactly happened to her"

Based on all the information I have so far, I believe her 110-page report was specifically on the Restavek system in Haiti.
