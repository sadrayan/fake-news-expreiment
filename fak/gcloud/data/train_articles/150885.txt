Super Bowl 2019: Tom Brady and Robert Kraft kiss after Patriots win over Rams
After all their success, you’d think the New England Patriots would have the celebrations down pat by now.

A 13-3 win over the LA Rams in Monday’s Super Bowl was the team’s sixth as the Patriots incredible dynasty continued.

But moments after creating history, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady didn’t seek out his supermodel wife, rather planting a wet one on New England owner Robert Kraft.

They’re an affectionate bunch in New England with the kiss going down as the latest in the long line of awkward kiss moments the Patriots have given the world.

The internet erupted at the Patriots legend’s choice of celebrations.

That looked like a lips on lips kiss to me. https://t.co/NxFMeYE4Fz — Brayton J. Wilson (@BJWilsonWGR) February 4, 2019

y'all are really mocking Tom Brady and acting like you've never kissed the owner of your football team on the mouth after winning a championship — Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) February 4, 2019

Did the owner just kiss Tom Brady on the lips 🤦🏽‍♂️😂#Superbowl #Patriots — Yalee "HollyHood" 🎵🎥 OUT NOW (@YaleeWorld) February 4, 2019

Brady does have some form with the kiss on the lips.

The superstar quarterback sparked a furore ahead of last year’s Super Bowl, when he shared a kiss on the mouth with his 10-year-old son John “Jack” Edward Thomas.

It led to a discussion about the appropriateness of the gesture.

Back in 2015, after a Super Bowl XLIX victory over the Seattle Seahawks, Patriots coach Bill Belichick was thrilled with his victory and let everyone know it.

The normally gruff coach may have kicked off the kiss trend, planting a huge kiss on his daughter Amanda.

The Patriots’ Super Bowl LIII victory will be remembered for a lot of things with the ageless Brady putting in another huge performance.

The 41-year-old broke a ton of records, including becoming the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl and the winner of the most Super Bowls of any player of all-time, adding to the imposing mountain of records he already holds.

The Patriots did not allow any 1st half points for the 2nd straight game...

Brady was pumped after the game, immediately saying he’ll be back again next year, in a statement sure to send chills down the spines of every other team in the NFL.

“How could this not motivate you, this is what it’s all about,” Brady said to raucous cheers.

Belichick said the win was especially sweet after they were “counted out all year”.

“This is just a great day for our football team,” Belichick said. “Mr Kraft put this all together but it’s all about the players. These guys work so hard all year, they competed every week and they competed again today. They played like champions.”

It is a stunning result in the context of records but fans may have needed to be woken up after social media erupted over the “most boring” Super Bowl in history.

The match was the lowest scoring Super Bowl in history with Sony Michel’s two-yard score after piggybacking down the field on the back of two passes to Rob Gronkowski.

No Super Bowl had previously gone into the fourth quarter without a touchdown.

Even the commentators found it difficult to put a positive spin on the game calling the game “offensively challenged”.

Fans savaged the dour match on social media.

What a boring, anti-climactic Super Bowl. One of the worst I can remember when you consider the whole package. — Jason Patt (@Bulls_Jay) February 4, 2019

Don’t ever tell me baseball is boring again. #superbowl — Steven C Miller (@stevencmiller) February 4, 2019

the super bowl is so boring my tv wants to turn off pic.twitter.com/DkxWcbb79m — Tim Marcin (@TimMarcin) February 4, 2019

It was a horrendously boring game but at least we got the feel good story of those long suffering Patriots fans finally getting a Championship. #SuperBowl — Titus O'Reily (@TitusOReily) February 4, 2019

The commentators had their work cut out trying to make the game interesting calling it a defensive win.

“That was the formula Bill Belichick had,” ESPN commentator Jason Witten said.

“He knew if he made Jared Goff one-dimensional and took away that play-action attack, he felt confident in his team.

“This is how he expected to win this football game. Just play really good defence and if we score one touchdown, we’re going to win this.”

Some fans backed the defensive game.

Hot take artists will tell you that this game was boring and sloppy. Don’t believe them. This was an all-time Super Bowl performance by the #Patriots defense. — Erik Frenz (@ErikFrenz) February 4, 2019

Rams quarterback Jared Goff, 24, was outplayed on the day. “He’s a young quarterback who’s dependant on the running game and the play-action game to have success,” Booger McFarland said. “He hasn’t quite graduated to the level of Tom Brady.”

Witten added: “Every young player, there’s a time where you have to make a jump as a quarterback, but he wasn’t ready to make that jump.

“When Bill Belichick takes away what you do best, you have to put the team on your back as a quarterback and Jared Goff wasn’t ready to do that.”
