Uniformed officer says he was told to leave Outback because he had a gun
A Tennessee uniformed officer says he was told to leave an Outback steakhouse because he had his gun with him.

Andrew Ward posted on Facebook on Friday that he had gone to the restaurant with his wife and was approached by the manager, who asked him if he could leave his weapon in his vehicle.

Ward told the manager that since he was in uniform, he had to have his gun with him.

The manager then left to make a call, then returned and asked him to leave because the restaurant was a gun-free zone.

"She said police are shooting people and she could have gotten shot in the parking lot and the manager had to walked her and her husband to their vehicle," the post said. " Seriously she was scared for her life ? We were joking and laughing with our server as we ordered then prayed . What was scary about that??"

Ward posted Outback had called him and apologized, and he said he accepted the apology.
