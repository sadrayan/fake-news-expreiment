Club 33 members sue Disneyland, saying they were booted for speaking out on harassment
Walt Disney dreamed up Club 33 as a place to entertain dignitaries, investors and other VIPs. Members get perks such as passes to the park and exclusive tours, but it doesnâ€™t come cheap: The initiation fee is $50,000, and dues cost $15,000 a year, according to former members. Disney officials refuse to divulge how many members the club can have, but Disney experts say the waiting list is probably several years long.
