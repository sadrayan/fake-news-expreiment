U.S. GDP by year is a good overview of economic growth in the United States. Below, find a table of the nation's gross domestic product for each year since 1929 compared to major economic events. It begins with the stock market crash of 1929 and goes through the subsequent Great Depression. It includes five wars and several serious recessions. These extreme swings in the business cycle put today's crises in perspective.

Compare GDP by year to fiscal and monetary policies to get a complete picture of what works and what doesn't.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis compiles the data. Keep in mind when reviewing this history that the BEA measures GDP in two ways. Nominal GDP is the total U.S. economic output for that year. Experts use nominal GDP to compare GDP to the U.S. debt, which is also not adjusted for inflation. To see the debt to GDP ratio since 1929, go to "National Debt by Year."

Real GDP takes out the effect of inflation. The BEA uses it to calculate the GDP growth rate and GDP per capita.
