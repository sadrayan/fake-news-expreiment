What We Do Â« DIGDEEP
Education & Advocacy Programs In places that already have access to water, DIGDEEP designs experiences that help Americans form a deep and lasting connection to the water we often take for granted. We invest in curricula, brand partnerships, events and digital activations to help people better understand and care for our water resources, making them last.
