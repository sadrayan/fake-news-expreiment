FALSE: #WasteHisTime Inspires Murder in Denver
In early January 2016, the hashtag #WasteHisTime or #WasteHisTime2016 unified a tongue-in-cheek conversation (primarily on Black Twitter) about creative ways to mislead men with whom users weren’t interested pursuing romantically; on 9 January 2016, the web site NotAllowedTo published an article titled “Man Kills His Date After She, Inspired By Twitter ‘#WasteHisTime2016’ Trend, Wasted His Time.”

It held:

DENVER – Fabian Suarez, age 23, has been reportedly arrested after killing a 22 year old woman for allegedly “wasting his time on purpose”, which she apparently gained inspiration from by a popular Twitter trend: #WasteHisTime2016 … Suarez reportedly stabbed Lina Johnson to death Thursday night on the 5200 Block of N Monroe St. after she allegedly “wasted his time” According to authorities, Lina, who was an avid twitter user, was influenced by the “#WasteHisTime2016” trend. Investigators say Lina asked Fabian to take her on a date, as she reportedly knew that Fabian liked her. Lina then allowed Fabian to pay for dinner, take her shopping at Victoria’s Secret, to only then have him drop her off at her new boyfriends house. After arriving outside Lina’s boyfriends house, Fabian reportedly asked “this is where you live?”, at which point Lina replied with “No, this is my new boyfriends house. these panties you bought me are for him to see”.

The nature of the #WasteHisTime2016 tweets were clearly humorous and didn’t involve actual devious plans to lead men on; typical tweets from the Twitter fad were obviously satirical:
