F.D.A. Says It Will Resume Inspections of Some High-Risk Foods
In an interview, Dr. Gottlieb said he hoped several hundred workers — not just food inspectors but also other employees — would return despite being unpaid. “I can’t tell you that they are not feeling personal hardship, but they are dedicated and want to come back,” he said.

The Agriculture Department oversees meat and poultry, and its workers have continued inspections without pay. The F.D.A. oversees about 80 percent of the nation’s food supply, as well as imports of foods shipped to the United States.

In a series of tweets, Dr. Gottlieb said the agency began sampling some high-risk imported produce in the Northeast on Monday. He said workers would begin inspections as early as Tuesday at sites with food considered “high risk” — soft cheeses, seafood, custard-filled bakery products, some fruits and vegetables or baby formula.

While there are an estimated 80,000 food plants in the United States, the F.D.A. inspects about one-tenth of those in a year, according to various reports.

Dr. Gottlieb said that few inspections had been conducted since the shutdown began Dec. 22 because of the holidays, and only a handful had been scheduled for last week so the shutdown had not affected that many visits by inspectors.
