NBC's Andrea Mitchell: Iran an American Ally Before Bush Blew It
Andrea Mitchell is the Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent for NBC News and the host of Andrea Mitchell Reports every weekday on MSNBC. Tuesday, during a segment with NBC’s Chuck Todd and the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza (that largely focused on blaming Obama’s woes on everything but his failed policies), Mitchell appeared to have something of an “episode” where she blamed George W. Bush for turning our War on Terror ally Iran into a foe:

MITCHELL: [Bush’s 2002 State of the Union] words “Axis of Evil” … With all due respect, Colin Powell and the State Department did not focus enough on those words and get them taken out of the State of the Union. Because up until that moment, Iran was cooperating with the United States on the border of Afghanistan. It was post 9-11 – Iran was more or less an American ally. By being included in the “Axis of Evil” it turned the Iranian government in a completely different direction. It was a turning point in American politics and in foreign policy.

As you can see, no one is playing gotcha with Mitchell. She wholeheartedly believes this.

Mitchell then attributed the quote “The era of big government is over” to Ronald Reagan. In reality, it was Bill Clinton who said it.

It is not very comforting to know that the Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent for a major television news network was and is under the delusion that Iran was an American ally in the War on Terror for a period of time.

MSNBC is going even further off the rails. You have their serious people blaming Obama’s problems on unicorns named “Washington” and “cynicism,” as opposed to “no” and “jobs,” and Andrea Mitchell just making stuff up.

A fun exercise would be for Sarah Palin to tweet something out about Iran being our one-time War on Terror ally and then watch MSNBC lose its mind pounding her over it.
