affordable health coverage under any federally run health benefit

exchange, while helping consumers in this state.

performing the activities and duties of a navigator as described by

42 U.S.C. Section 18031 or any regulation enacted under that

section.

Sec. 4154.003. APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAW. Notwithstanding

Section 101.051, 101.102, 4001.051, or 4001.101 or any other law, a

necessary to implement this chapter and to meet the minimum

requirements of 42 U.S.C. Section 18031, including regulations.

Sec. 4154.006. EXPIRATION OF CHAPTER. This chapter expires

September 1, 2017.

SUBCHAPTER B. STANDARDS AND QUALIFICATIONS FOR NAVIGATORS

Sec. 4154.051. SUFFICIENCY OF FEDERAL QUALIFICATIONS.

(a) The commissioner shall determine whether the standards and

qualifications for navigators provided by 42 U.S.C. Section 18031

and any regulations enacted under that section are sufficient to

ensure that navigators can perform the required duties, including:

(1) assisting consumers in completing the uniform

application for health coverage affordability programs available

through a health benefit exchange;

(2) explaining how health coverage affordability

programs work and interact, including Medicaid, the children's

health insurance program, and advance premium tax credits and

cost-sharing assistance;

qualified health plans, including premiums, cost-sharing,

networks, and essential health benefits;

(4) providing culturally and linguistically

appropriate information;

(5) avoiding conflicts of interest; and

(6) establishing standards and processes relating to

privacy and data security.

(b) If the commissioner determines that the standards

provided by regulations enacted under 42 U.S.C. Section 18031 are

insufficient to ensure that navigators can perform the required

duties, the commissioner shall make a good faith effort to work in

cooperation with the United States Department of Health and Human

Services and to propose improvements to those standards. If after a

reasonable interval the commissioner determines that the standards

remain insufficient, the commissioner by rule shall establish

standards and qualifications to ensure that navigators in this

state can perform the required duties.

(c) At a minimum, rules adopted under this section must

provide that a navigator in this state has not:

(1) had a professional license suspended or revoked;

(2) been the subject of any other disciplinary action

by a financial or insurance regulator of this state, another state,

or the United States; or

(3) been convicted of a felony.

(d) The commissioner shall at regular intervals obtain from

the health benefit exchange a list of all navigators providing

assistance in this state and, with respect to an individual, the

name of the individual's employer or organization.

(e) The commissioner may by rule establish a state

registration for navigators sufficient to allow the department to

ensure that navigators satisfy the standards provided by Subsection

(c) and collect the information described by Subsection (d).

Sec. 4154.052. LIMITS ON ADVERTISING. A navigator may not,

in any advertisement or other materials that are published or

distributed in any manner by or on behalf of the navigator:

(1) indicate or suggest the professional superiority

of the navigator;

professional service by the navigator in a superior manner; or

(3) include one or more of the following phrases in the

navigator's name or materials:

(A) "insurance advisor" or "insurance advisory";

(B) "insurance agent" or "insurance agency"; or

(C) "insurance consultant" or "insurance

counselor."

Sec. 4154.053. CERTAIN COMPENSATION PROHIBITED. A

navigator may not receive compensation for services or duties as a

navigator that are prohibited by federal law, including

compensation from a health benefit plan issuer.

Sec. 4154.054. ADDITIONAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. The

commissioner shall adopt rules authorizing additional training for

navigators as the commissioner considers necessary to ensure

compliance with changes in state or federal law.

health benefit plan;

(2) endorse a health benefit plan or group of health

benefit plans;

services related to insurance products not offered through a health

benefit exchange;

(4) offer advice or advise consumers on which

qualified health plan available through a health benefit exchange

is preferable;

dependent on whether a person enrolls in or purchases a health

benefit plan; or

(6) in the course of acting as a navigator, engage in

any electioneering activities or finance or otherwise support the

candidacy of a person for an office in the legislative, executive,

or judicial branch of state government, or of the government of the

United States, or any political subdivision of this state.
