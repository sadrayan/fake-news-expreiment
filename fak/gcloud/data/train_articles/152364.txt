Anon spots Bernie Sanders driving : 4chan
We personally severely dislike reddit and everyone who frequents it. We believe it's a shitty, destructive echo chamber that does much more public harm than anything 4chan has ever done. We think it discourages communication and encourages passive, addict-like consumption. We are making reddit worse as a public service, hopefully driving you people away from this toxic, horrible website.
