ABOUT US – The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense
We are a group of educated, God-fearing Christian conservative patriots who are tired of Obama’s tyrannical reign and ready to see a strong Republican take the White House. We are sovereign citizens who want our government to keep its nose out of our business. We believe in guns, God and the Constitution and will go to any lengths to take OUR country back from the whiny, politically correct liberal masses.

Join THE RESISTANCE today and help us in our mission to be THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE against anyone who doesn’t love The United States of America and fight for the rights afforded to us by our beloved Founding Fathers.

DISCLAIMER: The Resistance may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney. Pictures that represent actual people should be considered altered and not in any way real.
