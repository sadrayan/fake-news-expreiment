For total ballots cast, I use the higher of a state's report of total ballots cast to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission for their 2010 Election Day Survey , or -- if it exists -- a higher number reported on official state websites or canvass reports. The discrepancy may be due to a number of factors, including: a state using vote history from a voter file that has undergone purging between the election and the report to the EAC or incomplete or erroneous reporting from local jurisdictions to the state in the course of the 2010 Election Day Survey. I choose not to report total ballots cast for Mississippi because the state did not report total ballots cast independently of the EAC, and their reported number to the EAC was less than the vote for highest office. For the national total ballots cast, I impute Mississippi's total ballots cast from the ratio of total ballots cast to vote for highest office for all other states, and apply this ratio the Mississippi's vote for highest office.
