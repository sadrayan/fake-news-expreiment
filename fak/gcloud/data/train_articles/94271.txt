Gov. Gregoire to Gov. Perry: ‘Don’t Mess with Washington’
It seems there is some bad blood brewing between Washington state and Texas.

“Mr. Perry from Texas, don’t mess with Washington,” Governor Gregoire said Tuesday. “You want to compare Forbes rankings? Fine. We are in the Top 5. You ain’t.”

Ms. Gregoire made the statement after Texas Governor Rick Perry sent a letter to major Washington state companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks) inviting them to relocate to the Lone Star State, where there is no state income tax.

Ms. Gregoire made the comments during meeting with local business reporters. She said she is not surprised by the governor’s pitch saying she might do the same thing. She also noted that it is likely nothing more than part of Mr. Perry’s race for re-election.

The Republican governor issued the invite after hearing about Initiative 1098, an measure aimed at high-income earners in the state.

Ms. Gregoire said she does not think the income tax will deter businesses from moving to the state. She said she also does not anticipate any businesses moving out of the state because of the tax.
