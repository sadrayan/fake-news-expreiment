Introducing Pottermore Presents: an eBook series from the Pottermore archives
Pottermore has a brand new treat for you this September: Pottermore Presents, a trio of eBooks that delve even deeper into the wizarding world.

We’ve learned so much more about the wizarding world this year already. There's the play and script book of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts One and Two, and soon there will be even more to discover when Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them lands in cinemas this November.

Now Pottermore is opening yet another door, with a new set of eBook shorts called Pottermore Presents.

Pottermore Presents is a series of bite-sized eBooks that dig deep into the Harry Potter stories, with titbits taken from Pottermore’s archives and original writing from J.K. Rowling. The series offers Harry Potter fans added insights into the stories, settings and characters and were all lovingly curated by Pottermore.

The covers were designed by powerhouse designing duo Miraphora Mina and Eduardo Lima – the graphic design team behind the artwork of the Harry Potter films, otherwise known as MinaLima.

The three eBooks will be released on 6 September – just in time for a new term at Hogwarts – and each explores a different Hogwarts-related theme.

Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide dives into the nooks and crannies of the beloved wizarding school itself, unfurling everything from details about the Hogwarts ghosts, to what happens when the Sorting Hat can’t decide on a student’s house.

Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists explores the darker roots of the wizarding world. You’ll learn more about the troubles that faced the Ministry of Magic, the horrors of Azkaban prison and enjoy an entirely new original piece of writing by J.K. Rowling on Horace Slughorn.

Finally, in Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies, Pottermore celebrates the colourful staff of Hogwarts. There’s more to discover about Care of Magical Creatures teacher Silvanus Kettleburn, as well as another new piece of writing from J.K. Rowling on Minerva McGonagall, and her involvement in the second wizarding war.

So, for those who want to quench their thirst for more knowledge about the wizarding world, such as why the Black family bestow such odd names to their children, how a witch or wizard becomes a portrait, or what J.K. Rowling really thinks about Professor Umbridge, step right this way to find out.

Pottermore Presents will be available from a wide range of digital eBook retailers around the world, officially released on 6 September in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish. You’ll also be able to purchase it right here on Pottermore.
