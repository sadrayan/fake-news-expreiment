This calculation is solid in terms of "the average homeowner," given the average taxable value of $330,000. Any taxpayer in Austin ISD could get their own customized number by using the same calculation based on 38% of whatever amount they are required to pay to Austin ISD.

Surrounding districts that pay recapture (Eanes ISD, Lake Travis ISD, Round Rock ISD, Georgetown ISD, Marble Falls ISD) could also provide what percentage of local taxes go straight to the state as well. The percentage is different in those districts, as well as the average home value, but the math works just the same.

Whether these districts are ever actually able to reduce their property tax rates due to reduction in recapture or not, we certainly want taxpayers to be aware of where the dollars they pay to Austin ISD (or any other local school district) are actually spent under the current system.

I hope that helps. Please let me know if you need any other information.

Hello from the Austin newspaper. I am sharing below, seeking your on-the-record analysis and comment. I hope to complete our review today.

Specifically, we are checking this claim by Sen. Kirk Watson: “In Austin, Texas, the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture.”

Below is what the Austin district sent when we asked into the claim.

Seem like a solid calculation? Any suggested improvements?

Thanks.
