Really American
I want to know , just what exactly does the NRA do for any of us ?? I was a member for over 20 years and the only thing we got out of them was a magazine. What do they do for any of you that are members ? We don't need them to protect our rights ,,,,,

,we have the 2nd amendment. And NO one is intending on taking that away . Even though that is what the NRA propaganda is saying !! In the beginning they probably were doing some good . But I think they have way out done their constructive usefullness!
