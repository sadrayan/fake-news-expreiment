Subject: Urgent inquiry for a fact check, PolitiFact Texas

Hello from Austin.

For a PolitiFact Texas fact-check, I write seeking Rep. Olson’s basis for saying in a June 9 interview that Bill Clinton told then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch last year, “We’ve killed people. We killed Vince Foster. We destroyed Webb Hubbell. We will destroy you,” in advance of Hillary Clinton not getting indicted.

This is the statement Olson issued on the matter:

Congressman Pete Olson said, “The personal wreckage suffered by many people during the Clinton years is well documented. Just ask Paula Jones, Jim and Susan McDougal, Kathleen Willey and many others. However, in my discussion about Loretta Lynch and Vince Foster, I took the accusations a step too far. I regret my choice of words. The fact remains Hillary Clinton broke the law, violated national security, and was excused away by Jim Comey and the Obama Justice Department. Most Americans understand this and loathe the Clinton’s for continuing to live under a different set of rules than the rest of us.”
