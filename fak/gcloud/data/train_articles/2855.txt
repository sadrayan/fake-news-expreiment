Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito : Press Releases : Capito Votes to Repeal President Obama's "Train Wreck"
Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito (WV-02) released the following statement after voting for a full repeal of Obamacare, which passed the House today.



“President Obama’s health care law is so expansive and disastrous that even its lead author is calling it a ‘train wreck.’ And after three years since the law’s enactment, the president’s promises of controlling health care costs are ringing hollow. Americans of all ages and income brackets, and businesses across the country are learning the disturbing truth about the partisan legislation that was rammed through Congress without a single Republican vote. With the law’s full implementation looming, Americans are bracing for massive tax increases and daunting uncertainty. As health care costs soar, families’ access to care is limited and businesses contemplate closing their doors, it is time to fully repeal Obamacare.



“I am proud to support the full repeal of Obamacare today. Americans deserve health care reform that lowers costs, improves the quality of care, and protects jobs. My colleagues in the House and I are dedicated to standing up for the interests of Americans by fully repealing Obamacare.”
