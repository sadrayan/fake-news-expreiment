Cuban Inadmissibles

U.S. Customs and Border Protection maintains a robust posture regarding the enforcement of our immigration laws along the nation’s borders and coastal areas. We continue to promote safe, legal and orderly migration from Cuba under our Migration Accords and deter dangerous and unlawful migration from Cuba.

*Effective January 12, 2017, the United States ended the special parole policy, also known as the “wet-foot/dry-foot” policy, for Cuban migrants that has been in place since the mid-1990s. Since then, Cuban nationals who attempt to illegally enter the United States are subject to removal, consistent with our enforcement priorities. These actions are part of the ongoing normalization of relations between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and reflect a commitment to have a broader immigration policy in which we treat people from different countries consistently.
