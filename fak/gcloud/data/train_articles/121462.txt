Spooky footage of a Jesus statue opening its eyes has left some believers claiming it is a miracle.

Paranormal investigators have scoured over the video which appears to show the figure quickly open its eyes at a church in Mexico's state of Coahuila de Zaragoza.

While a church service appears to continue in the background, the effigy then seems to slam its eyes shut in the eerie clip.

While many believe the footage proves the statue in the Chapel of Saltillo came to life, others say it was merely an optical illusion or the video was doctored.

According to Elancasti.com.ar , the footage was shot last June, but it quickly went viral after it was posted on Adimensional this week - a web portal that researches unusual and paranormal cases.

Site manager and paranormal activity expert Ivan Escamilla has quashed rumours there is anything "unusual" about the footage.

He said more than 20 paranormal specialists, as well as priests, sculptors, editors and special effects designers had spent weeks analysing the clip.

He said the footage was real and they found no proof it had been doctored.

However, authorities under the Diocese of Saltillo dismissed the footage and refused to watch it.
