KSD Dietary Practices

Several years ago, changes were made to Kent School District (KSD) breakfast and lunch menus to reduce the pork and red meat options and increase the variety of poultry options for students. These changes were made in accordance with state and federal guidelines and have been designed to provide the most healthy and nutritional options available, offer attractive options that students would enjoy thus reducing waste, and addressing a variety of medical, cultural, and regional needs, tastes, and sensitivities. Because of limited menu options at smaller schools, pork products are not served at the elementary level and are labeled at the secondary level. This practice is not new or isolated to Kent schools.



Every effort is made to accommodate a variety of health and dietary requirements, including medical needs and food allergies, in the over 15,000 meals served daily in 42 KSD school locations.



The Kent region is one of the fastest growing and culturally diverse areas in the United States and the Kent School District is one of the most diverse school districts in Washington State with 28,000 students from over 100 countries and speaking over 130 languages.



The award winning KSD Nutritional Services Department is made up of dedicated professionals that respect and support all students for healthy living and healthy learning.
