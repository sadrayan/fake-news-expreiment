This is from Josh with some additions from me:

On (1), we don’t have those data off the shelf back to 2000. We do know that the black-white unemployment rate gap has grown both nationally and in Texas since 2007 – the earliest year for which I have data.

On (2), part 1, again, can’t be definitive. But discrimination (both in the labor market and pre-labor market (ie, residential segregation that leads to worse schools) seems to me clearly at play and explaining at least part of the gap. On part 2, wages for most American workers have fallen since 2000, so, would actually be surprising if they hadn’t for black workers in Texas. Reason is mostly the elevated unemployment we’ve had for most of the period since 2000, as well as continuing wage-pressures on most American workers from globalization and the generalized assault on institutions (like unions and minimum wages and overtime rules) that provide bargaining power to low and moderate-wage workers.

On (3), labor force participation is a different stat then unemployment – simply measures the share of adults that either have a job or are actively looking for one. Not sure why it would/should be swapped out for the unemployment rate – which is the share of the labor force unable to find a job. In other words, because the gap in labor force participation rates is smaller doesn’t tell you anything definitive about differences in each groups’ ability to find a job.

Also, my guess is that the numbers you’re citing on not for prime-age workers – they’d be a bit higher (prime age is 25-54 years old).

On (4), those are not inflation adjusted. Here’s the same data you sent, adjusted for inflation (constant 2013$):

Year Texas Median Household Income In constant 2013$ 2005 $30,978 $36,964 2006 $32,159 $37,155 2007 $33,843 $38,022 2008 $36,598 $39,596 2009 $35,438 $38,487 2010 $35,640 $38,078 2011 $35,757 $37,034 2012 $37,018 $37,556 2013 $37,608 $37,608

But to the larger point, I would disagree somewhat with the person from TPPF. Household income may be a better measure of overall household resources, but household income can remain constant even when wages are falling if people from the household are working longer hours or receiving more income from non-labor sources (e.g., investments, public transfers). Our data show that wages have indeed fallen slightly in inflation-adjusted terms for African Americans in TX since 2000:
