The politics of porn: Crist takes industry $; Scott invests in company sued for 'enabling' sex predators
Sex and porn sells, perhaps even in the final week of a close political campaign.

Gov. Rick Scott is up with a new ad that echoes a claim his campaign has been pushing for weeks: that Charlie Crist has a "war on women" because he accepted $90,000 from three different Broward companies that operate strip clubs.

Crist has refused to return the money, saying it didn't come from the strip clubs but from the management companies. The RPOF ad says it's "dirty cash."

During the 2010 GOP primary, Scott was also forced on the defensive against sex-related allegations from then-Attorney General Bill McCollum. McCollum alleged that the social networking company Scott invested in, Que Pasa, was in partnership with Latin Playboy and encouraged gay dating.

In a television ad, McCollum's campaign claimed: "There's nothing Republican about porn." In a mailer, McCollum alleged: "The Two Faces of Rick Scott....What Rick Scott does and what Rick Scott says show the completely different faces of Rick Scott."

Scott defended his investment at the time, which PolitiFact Florida determined was 13.9 percent of the company. He called it a "desparate attack by a career politician."

PolitiFact found that Que Pasa did have a partnership with Playboy in 2009 to find and identify "Cyber Chicas" for Playboy's Mexico edition. It ruled false the claim that Scott had anything to do with it.

Que Pasa has since changed its name to MeetMe and Scott and his family trusts increased their investment in the company last year. Meanwhile, the social networking site has drawn its own drumbeat of attention, from prosecutors who claim that "dozens of minors nationwide have been victimized in sex crimes by predators who relied on MeetMe to target their underage victims."
