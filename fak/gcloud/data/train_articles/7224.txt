IFJ Annual Reports on Killings of Journalists and Media Staff
Over the past 14 years more than 1.000 journalists and media staff have been killed in the line of duty. They died because someone did not like what they wrote or said, or because they were in the wrong place in the wrong time.

The International Federation of Journalists monitors press freedom violations and campaigns for greater safety and for a focus on the in-country journalists and freelances who are at greatest risk and who have the least protection.

The IFJ publishes an annual report on journalists and media staff killed in the course of gathering news. These reports include targeted killings, cross fire lethal incidents as well as work-related accidents which result in loss of life.
