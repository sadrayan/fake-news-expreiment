IPRA data of Chicago police officer-involved shootings
The city of Chicago in 2007 created the Independent Police Review Authority, a civilian agency responsible for investigating police shootings and other serious allegations of misconduct. Since then, the agency has tracked a total of 409 people who were shot, an average of nearly one police shooting per week. Of those 409 shootings, only two were found to be unjustified.
