Politically Correct Pizza Party
Donald Trump may know about hiring staff and apprentices, and Sarah Palin may know about which finger to raise at a tea party, but neither seems to know the New York protocol for eating pizza.

When Palin’s “One Nation” bus tour rolled into the Big Apple, she and fellow presidential might-wanna-be went to Times Square for dinner at Famiglia Pizzeria for a large pepperoni. Where according to most, they committed a culinary faux pas: they ate their pizza with a knife and fork!

The chain they chose to visit positions itself as “New York’s Favorite Pizza.” We’ll leave that for a local referendum to decide, but according to our 2011 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, right now national pizza chains rank as follows:

1. Domino’s

2. Papa John’s

3. Pizza Hut

4. Little Caesar’s

5. Round Table

6. Godfather’s

7. Chuck E. Cheese

As it turns out, most people (77%) eat pizza in the traditionally proscribed manner: folded lengthwise and eaten from the narrow end up. Eighteen percent (18%) eat the slice from the bottom up, but don’t fold it at all. One can only suppose that the remaining 5% use utensils.

Over the years Brand Keys has, in fact, applied our predictive metrics to political campaigns. We know that the first-most important driver when it comes to the Ideal President is “Resolve” for Democrats and “Perception” for Republicans. The data is strangely silent about table manners, generally, and silverware, specifically. Although Judith Martin, the doyen of etiquette, recommends using cutlery beginning on the far left or right and progressing toward the middle. Like most Independents.
