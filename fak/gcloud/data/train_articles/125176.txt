Obama Defends Kaepernick National Anthem Protest
President Obama devoted several minutes of a press conference at the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China on 5 September 2016 to sharing his thoughts about NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s ongoing protest against racial injustice in the United States. To date, that protest has taken the form of Kaepernick refusing to stand during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”

“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick has said. “To me, it’s bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street, and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”

When asked about Kaepernick and the controversy surrounding his refusal to stand for the anthem, Obama defended the quarterback’s constitutional right to speak out, cited the long history of sports figures doing so, and said he would rather see young people looking for ways to be engaged in political issues than sitting on the sidelines. Here is a video capturing his remarks about Kaepernick, followed by a transcript of them:
