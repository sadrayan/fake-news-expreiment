Obama sends condolence letter to Jackson family
President Barack Obama, who was faulted in some quarters for his slow and informal acknowledgement of singer Michael Jackson's death, has sent written condolences to Jackson's family, an Obama adviser said Sunday.

"The president has written the family and has shared his feelings with the family," Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

Axelrod suggested Obama was prepared to recognize Jackson at a press availability Friday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but the aide said no reporter raised Jackson's death.

The White House rebuffed reporters' requests for comment from soon after Jackson's death Thursday through Friday afternoon, when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs offered brief comments at a daily briefing.

"The president obviously believes that he was an important and magnificent performer," Axelrod said on NBC. "Obviously, he led a sad life in many ways as well but his impact is undeniable."
