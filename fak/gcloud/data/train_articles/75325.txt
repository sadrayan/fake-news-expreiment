Breaking News for Dallas-Fort Worth
TXU asked one of its main opponents on Wednesday to pull a TV ad that accuses the Dallas-based company of profiteering from rate hikes and planning 11 "massively polluting" coal-burning power plants.

Environmental Defense said it would not kill the ad, which is running on stations in Dallas-Fort Worth and Waco.

The spat is the latest round in an expensive media war over plans by TXU and other power companies to build 16 coal plants in Texas. TXU plans 11 of those.

Environmental Defense's ad says TXU's new plants would worsen air pollution. In a letter to the group dated Monday, TXU corporate affairs vice president Brian Tulloh called the claim "at the least, extremely misleading."

TXU will voluntarily offset all new nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions with cuts at its existing plants, and will go further to reduce its 2005 emissions levels by 20 percent, Mr. Tulloh wrote.

Environmental Defense should urge other power companies to follow suit "instead of misleading the public with scare tactics," he wrote.

Environmental Defense spokesman Colin Rowan said the ad's pollution claim was justified based on the group's analysis of TXU's 20-percent reduction pledge and on new emissions of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas linked to global warming.

The group said in a report last week that the 20-percent pledge is "misleading at best and patently false at worst. It's not really voluntary," the group contended, "and it's not enough to meet federal mandates" that begin taking effect in 2009 and tighten again in 2015.

TXU's new plants would emit 78 million tons of carbon dioxide per year in addition to the 55 million tons per year the company's existing plants emit. TXU is already the state's biggest carbon dioxide emitter.
