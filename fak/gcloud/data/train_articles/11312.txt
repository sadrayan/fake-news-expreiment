In this recent ad, the Kirkpatrick campaign used video clips of McCain appearing to flip-flop on his support for the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act, which would allow people who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents to earn a path to legal status. ...It’s fair for the Kirkpatrick campaign to say that McCain’s rhetoric has shifted over the years. But it’s an exaggeration to portray it as if McCain was totally on board in 2008, completely abandoned dreamers in 2010, and then came back in 2016 because he’s running for reelection...Two Pinocchios.
