Hi Reddit, we are a mountain climber, a fiction writer, and both former Governors. We are Gary Johnson and Bill Weld, candidates for President and Vice President. Ask Us Anything! : IAmA
Hello Reddit,

Gov. Gary Johnson and Gov. Bill Weld here to answer your questions! We are your Libertarian candidates for President and Vice President. We believe the two-party system is a dinosaur, and we are the comet.

If you donâ€™t know much about us, we hope you will take a look at the official campaign site. If you are interested in supporting the campaign, you can donate through our Reddit link here, or volunteer for the campaign here.

Gov. Gary Johnson is the former two-term governor of New Mexico. He has climbed the highest mountain on each of the 7 continents, including Mt. Everest. He is also an Ironman Triathlete. Gov. Johnson knows something about tough challenges.

Gov. Bill Weld is the former two-term governor of Massachusetts. He was also a federal prosecutor who specialized in criminal cases for the Justice Department. Gov. Weld wants to keep the government out of your wallets and out of your bedrooms.

Thanks for having us Reddit! Feel free to start leaving us some questions and we will be back at 9PM EDT to get this thing started.

Proof - Bill will be here ASAP. Will update when he arrives.

EDIT: Further Proof

EDIT 2: Thanks to everyone, this was great! We will try to do this again. PS, thanks for the gold, and if you didn't see it before: https://twitter.com/GovGaryJohnson/status/773338733156466688
