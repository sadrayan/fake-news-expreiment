Save the tips in NY!
Save the tips! That’s the message I along with my colleagues Senator Kathy Marchione and Assemblywoman Mary Beth Walsh gave when we joined with the New York State Restaurant and Tavern Association and several local servers and restaurateurs from Saratoga County at Longfellows in Saratoga Springs to announce our strong opposition to the elimination of the minimum wage tip credit.

The Governor has asked the State Department of Labor to examine the tip credit, with an eye toward replacing tipping with an increased minimum wage. This would negatively impact our small businesses and restaurants, their employees and consumers.

Workers rely most heavily on tips as a main source of income, and eliminating tips would reduce workers’ take-home pay substantially. Even though the base wage for tipped restaurant workers would increase, they would make less money overall. Often times tipped workers make well above minimum wage, and these servers rely on tips to survive.
