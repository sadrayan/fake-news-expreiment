While appearing on Fox, Gibbs chides Fox for airing reality show instead of Obama’s speech. – ThinkProgress
This morning on Fox News, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs chided the Fox broadcast network for refusing to air President Obama’s speech tonight on health care before a joint session of Congress:

I do hope the viewers of Fox will find a way to watch the speech tonight. I know that the network, instead of dealing with the reality of millions of people on health insurance reform, have decided to show a reality show called something like, “So you think you can dance.” […] I do hope that people will check into the reality of what’s going on in America rather than the distraction of a reality TV show.

Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy stumbled and bumbled briefly for a response, before explaining to the audience that Fox has both a broadcast network and a “news channel,” and the Obama speech “will of course be right here on the Fox News Channel.” Watch it:
