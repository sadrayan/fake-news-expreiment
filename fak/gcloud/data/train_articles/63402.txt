Trump to speak at 'Salute to Service' dinner at The Greenbrier
WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. - President Donald Trump is expected to speak Tuesday night in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, at The Greenbrier resort.

The White House said he'll attend a formal, invite-only dinner and speak around 6:30 p.m. The event is part of the rebranded annual PGA golf tournament now called A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier.

This is the fifth time Trump has visited White Sulphur Springs since being elected.

It is an area that overwhelmingly supports the president, and people 10 News talked to said it's great that he's visited so many times.

"I think it's good. West Virginia needs something right now to help the coal industry and I think he's the one to do it,” Ghent resident Willis Hash said.

Most people in the town approve of what the president has done while in office.

"I think it's wonderful. We have a good president,” White Sulphur Springs resident Helen Feury said.

Many businesses are busier, both for the annual PGA golf tournament and for the president’s arrival, including the downtown restaurant Alfredo’s.

"We're happy when he's here. We’re getting a lot of people, increasing business,” manager Ahmed Metwalli said.

President Trump is scheduled to speak at the "Salute to Service" dinner. It's a part of the military appreciation festivities for the golf tournament, which, as always, is bringing thousands of people into town.

"I think it's good for the community. I know he's friends with [Gov. Jim] Justice. That's great. Jim does a great job with this tournament. He does a great job running this place,” caddie Paul Gregg said.

The White House said the president will leave town around 7:30 p.m. Tuesday.
