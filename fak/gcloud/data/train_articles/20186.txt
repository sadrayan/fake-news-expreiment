Meadows Sends Letter Encouraging House Leadership to Defund Obamacare
Representative Mark Meadows (NC-11) released the following statement after [sending a letter to Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor] encouraging them to defund Obamacare through the appropriations process.

“Obamacare is not ready, and the way it is being implemented is not fair,” Meadows said. “By choosing to delay the employer mandate, President Obama demonstrated he knows the law is unworkable. If big businesses get a break, hardworking individuals and families deserve the same relief.

“Today, XX of my House colleagues joined me in sending a letter to Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor encouraging them to defund Obamacare through the appropriations process. We want House leadership to know they have a large group of Members ready to stand with them to stop the president’s destructive and unaffordable health care law. Despite sending the letter today, I will continue to keep a running list of Members who choose to lend their names to this crucial effort. I am pleased so many of my colleagues have signed on and pledged their commitment to keeping health care decisions between patients and their doctors, not patients and Washington bureaucrats.”
