Review: ‘Sam & Dede,’ 2 Giants Forming an Unlikely Bond
Fans of professional wrestling and absurdist drama have a show to call their own. The real-life encounter between Samuel Beckett and Andre the Giant inspires “Sam & Dede, or My Dinner With Andre the Giant,” produced by the Custom Made Theater Co. at 59E59 Theaters.

Though ticket buyers keen to discover Beckett’s signature match-ending move (The Endgame? The Unnameable?) will leave disappointed, Gino Dilorio’s lightweight tale is an affectionate tribute to a stage goliath and a grappler built like a butte.

In the 1950s, Beckett built a cottage in Ussy-sur-Marne in France and struck up a friendship with one of the laborers. Learning that the laborer’s 12-year-old son, Andre, nicknamed Dede, was too large to ride the bus to school, Beckett volunteered to drive him.

Man and boy apparently bonded over a shared passion for cricket. Not much else is known about these jaunts, but the story has already inspired a couple of other plays, a graphic novel and an episode of the Sky TV series “Urban Myths.”
