Lady Gaga on Catholicism
From the Editors: Larry King Live Senior Producer Nancy Baker was on site in London for Larry King's interview with Lady Gaga. She filed this report:

It’s not every day that you have the opportunity to meet a global sensation. I traveled to London this week for Larry King’s interview with superstar Lady Gaga.

Arranging this special one-on-one – part of our celebration of Larry’s 25th anniversary with CNN – was no easy task. Lady Gaga is in the midst of her sold-out world tour, The Monster’s Ball. To say her schedule is jam-packed is to understate the case.

Still, her team carved out the time. The venue was a designated room in the backstage area of the O2 Arena, where Lady Gaga would thrill (and I do mean THRILL!) her fans with a brilliant concert performance just hours later.

Right on time – to the minute – Lady Gaga walked in, accompanied by just three people.

“Hi everyone, I’m Gaga,” she introduced herself to our CNN crew – which was more than three times as large as her modest entourage. She then proceeded to shake hands with everybody. She could not have been more gracious.

I – and everybody else on the crew – had wondered what she was going to wear. She did not disappoint. Just the opposite. Lady Gaga paid a witty tribute to Larry by donning a white silk shirt and unique black suspenders. To add to the visual punch, Larry took his seat on our New York set sporting a black shirt and white suspenders! Was this study in sartorial opposites planned ahead of time? No. Absolutely not. It was serendipity. And it added a terrific touch to a unique show.

Lady Gaga was as candid as she was articulate throughout the interview. Her frankness extended to her very honest comments about growing up in the Roman Catholic Church.
