I believe what you are looking for is some kind of ranking that shows where the US falls in relation to other countries for voter turnout. Peter's answer provided some comparison with OECD countries. The answer depends on how you define voter turnout. If you define it as the ratio of voters compared to the entire population of eligible voters, then according to the IDEA voter turnout database, the US ranks 75th (with 53.58% of eligible voters turning out on election day) out of 113 countries for presidential elections.
