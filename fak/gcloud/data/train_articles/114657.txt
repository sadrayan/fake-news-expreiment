Covering News, How-tos and Personal Stories
This website is dedicated to covering news related to addiction and mental health issues as they apply to veterans and serving military personnel. We are not affiliated with the US Government nor the official Arlington Cemetery. We are here to publish information that aims to support those affected by mental illness attributable to their service in the military. It really does no matter which branch of the military those suffering from mental issues served their time. We attempt to cover stories affecting all military personnel and veterans not matter which branch of the military they may have served currently or the past. We believe mental health issues affecting these people are not given the attention they deserve, and we sincerely hope the stories we share on this
