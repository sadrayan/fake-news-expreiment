Jeb Bush condemns Donald Trump's comments as 'extraordinarily ugly'
@PatriciaMazzei

Jeb Bush, who had already criticized Donald Trump's comments about Mexicans, took the harshest line yet of any 2016 Republican presidential contender Saturday when he called Trump's remarks "way out of the mainstream."

"To make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party. Trump is wrong on this," Bush said in New Hampshire. (On Friday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio issued a statement denouncing Trump's comments as "offensive and inaccurate.")

Trump then issued a statement bashing Bush as "out of touch":

I am very proud to be fighting for a strong and secure border. This is a very important issue, which all the other candidates would have ignored had I not started this important discussion. I will fix the border — no one else knows where to begin.

Today, Jeb Bush once again proves that he is out of touch with the American people. Just like the simple question asked of Jeb on Iraq, where it took him five days and multiple answers to get it right, he doesn’t understand anything about the border or border security. In fact, Jeb believes illegal immigrants who break our laws when they cross our border come “out of love.”

As everybody knows, I never said that all Mexicans crossing the border are rapists. Jeb is mischaracterizing my statements only to inflame. As seen with the tragic and unnecessary death of Kathryn Steinle this past week in San Francisco at the hands of an illegal immigrant who was previously deported five times, our unsecured border is a national security threat.

Jeb will never be able to secure our border, negotiate good trade deals, strengthen our military or care for our veterans. The biggest difference between Jeb and me on the border is that I believe in securing our border by building a wall, which will protect our safety, economy and national security. This is a vital step in Making America Great Again!
