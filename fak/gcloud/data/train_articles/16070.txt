I see that Steve McCraw aired some figures in testimony. See the paragraph that begins “Another consequence seldom discussed…”

Gov. Perry said in a press release today more than 3,000 homicides were committed by illegal aliens in Texas. Do you have data showing as much? If not, who might?

Thanks.
