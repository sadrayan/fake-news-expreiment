John F. Lopez Summer Internship
The John F. Lopez (JFL) Internship takes place each summer to promote development opportunities for undergraduate students. John F. Lopez (JFL) Interns who are selected are current enrolled undergraduate students that demonstrate leadership potential, willingness to face challenges, and ability to share talent and skill with the Hispanic/Latino community. Named in honor of NHI Board Trustee, John F. Lopez, the John F. Lopez Internship is designed to elicit qualities of spirit, creativity, and talent exemplified by its founder. Of the 90,000 NHI alumni, John F. Lopez made some of the greatest contributions to the growth of the National Hispanic Institute. He served as a student participant in the first statewide LDZ program in 1983, volunteered eight successive years in NHI programs, served as a full time professional in Maxwell, and now is a member of the NHI Board of Trustees. John also founded the College Register and internship program.

The purpose of the John F. Lopez Internship is to provide undergraduate student leaders a means to expand opportunities for organization impact, within their desired major/field of study, as well as develop their professional leadership and management skills. As counselors, research specialists, trainers and planners, interns participate in interactive experiences that enable them to critically examine the needs required for future leadership roles. To date, over 200 members have participated as John F. Lopez Interns at NHI.
