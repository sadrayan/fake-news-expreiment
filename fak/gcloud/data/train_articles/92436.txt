Floridians still recovering from income lost in recession
Florida is creating jobs faster than most states, but the recession took a bigger hit to people's income here.

The report from the Joint Economic Committee ranks the Sunshine State 13th of the 50 states in percentage of new private-sector jobs since December 2007, before the recession. The state has added 353,100 jobs in that time, growing by 5.2 percent, the report says.

But median household income fell 12 percent — from $52,300 to $46,100 — from 2007 to 2014, the latest data available, the report says. Florida's decline is the sixth-largest of all states. Income fell in 38 of them.

The report assesses the economies of all 50 states in terms of job growth, poverty and income, unemployment, unemployment among veterans and health insurance coverage. The data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau.

The fastest-growing jobs in Florida since February 2010 — the low point for private-sector employment — were in professional and business services (26.5 percent growth), leisure and hospitality (26.1 percent) and construction (24.8 percent), the report says.

Texas ranked first in job growth with a 15 percent increase since before the recession. The others in the top five were Utah, Colorado, Alaska and New York.

Nevada had the biggest increase in poverty, jumping from 9.7 percent to 17 percent.

The report shows 29 states with lower unemployment than Florida's 4.9 percent in February, the same as the nation as a whole. New Hampshire and South Dakota had the lowest unemployment: 2.7 percent.

Among veterans, 5.4 percent in Florida are unemployed, the 11th highest in the country. Almost 7 percent of Florida's post-9/11 veterans are unemployed, the report says.

Poverty in Florida rose from 12.5 percent in 2007 to 16.7 percent in 2014, the report shows. That was the 12-biggest jump in the country, percentage-wise.

More than 16 percent of Florida's residents had no health insurance in 2014, down from 20 percent the year before, the committee reported.
