Technology for Good

Through our Technology for Good platform we channel our leadership and advocacy, often in collaboration with public and private partners, to address a range of global challenges. The role of ICT to boost socio-economic development cannot be underestimated. It can play an instrumental role in tackling urgent global issues such as poverty and hunger, enhancing financial and social inclusion, improving access to education and health, and addressing humanitarian issues as well as enabling the benefits of the internet for all.
