Syrian Catholic priest murdered in his church – but not beheaded, sources say – Telegraph Blogs
I need to update and correct reports that Fr Francois Murad, a Franciscan friar, was beheaded last week. The priest was actually shot inside his church, it seems – and the video of a beheading, which went viral, does not depict him. The Vatican was widely quoted as confirming the beheading, but an investigation by the Telegraph's Ruth Sherlock has established that this attribution was false. What is clear, however, is that this priest was slaughtered for his faith in his own friary – a shocking example of anti-Christian violence in Syria which the mainstream media seems to have ignored, making room for the misleading report (below) which I pointed to yesterday in good faith.

The Blaze report can be found here.

Rest in peace, Fr Murad.
