NOTE: this data reflects Wisconsin's performance on the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress. There is always a tendency to think, "But my school is much better. We met or exceeded expectations on the Wisconsin school report card." We encourage you to check out your school's test data. Schools can be listed as meeting or exceeding expectations with far fewer than half of their students reading proficiently. In past years, Wisconsinites have been able to find and compare WKCE testing results statewide, but Badger exam results for 2015 were not posted as of the end of 2015.
