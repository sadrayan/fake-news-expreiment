A transgender man who identifies as a woman is facing 70 years in prison over allegations he sexually assaulted and raped a ten-year-old friend of the family. The incident allegedly occurred in a bathroom.

The assault took place in Casper, Wyoming bathroom in March. The accused is Miguel Martinez, who identifies as a woman and goes by the name Michelle. Martinez is a friend of the family, and used his close access to them to lure the family’s ten-year-old daughter into a bathroom, where he sexually assaulted her.

The incident may bring to mind the transgender bathroom controversy of recent years. However, the arrest and trial of Martinez has received little attention outside of Wyoming.

“ The trial for Miguel Martinez, who goes by the name Michelle, began on Monday, the Billings Gazette reported. Martinez allegedly invited the young girl into the bathroom with him where he allegedly fondled the girl’s breasts and genitalia, before penetrating her. The girl told police that “it hurt inside” and she started to cry, the Casper Star Tribune reported. Nurses at a nearby medical center “completed a sexual assault exam and found redness and abrasions on the girl’s genitalia,” according to the Gazette’s report. Local media reports described Martinez as a “family friend” of the 10-year-old victim. Martinez told police that the girl had been “talking crap” and dismissed the accusations as a “publicity stunt,” according to local reports. Martinez faces charges of one count of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor and one count of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor. The trial is expected to last four days, according to the Billings Gazette. „
