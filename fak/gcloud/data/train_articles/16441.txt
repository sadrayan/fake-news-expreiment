This accurate?

In our visit, you offered your ballpark estimate that the 1997 actions that led to the expansion of the homestead exemption have a current-day annual value of about $1 billion with the annual value of the 2006 tax-rate actions being about $6 billion. You also said you have no quibble with calling the 2006 decisions the largest school property-tax reduction in state history.

?

Thanks.

I went back to check the homestead exemption issue again. The value loss from the extra $10,000 exemption is only about $50 billion (my mental math was off). So the school taxes lost on that reduction in taxable value are probably in the range of $650-$700 million per year. The $1 billion figure you had must have been for a biennium. I also checked the Comptroller’s self report of property values, and the total value of the homestead exemption is about $1 billion (that’s the full $15,000 exemption, and the extra $10,000 would be about two-thirds of that.

In terms of the 2006 cut, I think I would characterize the $6 billion as a conservative estimate.
