The Most Recent School Shooter Was A Trump Supporter Who Trained With White Nationalists
UPDATED: The white supremacist group lied to the anti-defamation league and Cruz has no known ties to white supremacists.

According to reports, Nikolas Cruz, who shot and killed 17 people and injured at least 14 more at Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida Wednesday is a Trump supporter.

He’s even got a MAGA hat on in his Instagram profile pic.

Today the disturbing news broke that Cruz had trained with an armed white supremacist group, the Republic of Florida (ROF).

According to reports, “Cruz had participated in at least one training exercise near Tallahassee area, carpooling with other ROF members from south Florida.”

The group claims to be a “white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics” and the creation of a “white ethnostate” in Florida

This matters for a couple reasons. The first and most immediate is that the shooter meticulously planned his attack.

He bought a gun designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time. He had a gas mask and carried smoke bombs. Having participated in active shooter drills at the high school, he knew how his targets would respond. He pulled the fire alarm to send students and teachers into the halls so he could more easily kill them. How much of that training came courtesy of the Republic of Florida?

Secondly, white extremist terrorism is a growing problem.
