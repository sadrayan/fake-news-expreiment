United States Secret Service: Know Your Money
KNOW YOUR MONEY Design Features for Series 1990-1995 Issued Currency Due to increases in color copier technology, two security features were added to Series 1990, 1993 and 1995 U.S. currency. These new features appeared in denominations $5 through $100. Existing currency and the new series will co-circulate until existing currency is withdrawn at the Federal Reserve banks and branches.





Inscribed Security Thread A clear, inscribed polyester thread has been incorporated into the paper of genuine currency. The thread is embedded in the paper and runs vertically through the clear field to the left of the Federal Reserve Seal.



Printed on the thread is a denomination identifier. On $100 and $50 denominations, the security thread has "USA 100" or "USA 50" repeated along the entire length of the thread. Lower denominations (i.e. $20, $10 and $5) have "USA" followed by the written denomination. For example, "USA TWENTY USA TWENTY" is repeated along the entire length of the thread.



The inscriptions are printed so that they can be read from either the face or the back of the note. The thread and the printing can only be seen by holding the note up to a light source.





Microprinting Concurrent with the addition of the security thread, a line of microprinting appears on the rim of the portrait reading "THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" and is repeated along the sides of the portrait.



To the naked eye, the microprinting appears as little more than a solid line and can only be read by using magnification. Microprinting cannot be accurately reproduced by office machine copiers or printers.
