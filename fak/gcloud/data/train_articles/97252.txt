Status of Women Committee on April 28th, 2014
Stella Ambler Mississauga South, ON

Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Dr. Leitch, for being with us today to talk to us about the estimates.

I had a few questions for you, but Mr. Casey's questions were also of interest to me as the chair of the Special Committee on Violence Against Indigenous Women, which I was honoured and privileged to take part in.

I'm sure you'll agree, and perhaps you could tell us about that committee and briefly, whether the government plans to respond to the recommendations. Minister, with the 40 studies that have been done in the last number of years on this issue, do you think those are what the families were referring to when they said, “Enough study, now it's time”?

This committee, which was formed to look into murdered and missing aboriginal women, was struck by a unanimous vote of the House of Commons. It was the 41st study of its kind. Just a brief answer because you've obviously answered a lot of questions about this issue, and it's not really what we're here to talk about.

Do you think that committee did some good work on behalf of parliamentarians here in Canada toward finding the answers? Do you think that those answers were good ones and that the government will likely follow the recommendations made by that committee?
