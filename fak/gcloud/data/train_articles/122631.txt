Mailman massacre: 14 die after Patrick Sherrill 'goes postal' in 1986 shootings
A hulking loner, known in his Oklahoma City neighborhood as "Crazy Pat," Sherrill had a long history of bizarre behavior. Most people who lived on his block said he made them uneasy, very uneasy. Perhaps it had to do with how he wandered around the neighborhood at night, peering into windows. Or maybe it was his tendency to ride around on a bicycle built for two, all alone.
