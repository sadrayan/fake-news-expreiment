Congress: Gohmert goes without health insurance
Rep. Louie Gohmert “gave up his health insurance for 2014, asserting that the president’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, has made coverage too expensive,” the Dallas Morning News reports. He’s refusing to take a government subsidy that would lower his insurance cost and not the figure he cites.

At 60, he’s taking a big risk for himself and his wife.
