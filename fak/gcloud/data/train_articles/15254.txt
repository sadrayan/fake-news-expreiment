Subject: Inquiry for fact check

Hello again. At the press conference this morning, you said Trump’s gimme caps saying Make America Great Again are made in China. Can you share how you reached that conclusion? Some time back, PolitiFact did this fact check.

?

Thanks,

Oh my. I miss spoke. What I meant to say is his words are cheaper than his ties (made in China), some of his suits (also made in China), or his men's dress shirts (made in China, Bangladesh or imported).

It was a joke—much of my speech was tongue in cheek. I appreciate your due diligence.

Best,

Celia
