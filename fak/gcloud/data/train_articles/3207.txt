Buddy Cianci
The Cianci campaign is happy to report that since 1994, The Cianci Scholarship Fund has awarded between 10 – 15 monetary scholarships to select Providence high school graduates each year. Just this past June, the fund awarded $13,000 in scholarships to the students listed below. These hard working students join a larger list of over 220 students who have been scholarship recipients since the fund’s inception.We’d like to clear up confusion regarding the scholarship fund and the Mayor’sOwn Marinara Sauce. Please note; these are two separate entities. The Cianci Scholarship fund is a trust funded by a variety of sources — special events, tournaments, private donations, and (when there is a profit) proceeds from the Mayor’s Marinara Sauce. There are years when the sauce business contributes to the fund; there are years when it doesn’t. In the years when a contribution is made, it is only after all expenses from the sauce business have been covered, including all production and distribution expenses, taxes and insurance. The scholarship fund remains robust, and will continue to proudly support our local scholars in their pursuit of higher education.
