In response to your request for information relating to the AlamoTruth.com website, I am providing the attached document with a list of websites and publications who have written about this issue. Additionally, I am providing reviews from Trip Advisor, Yelp, and Facebook that are concerning to those who want those who visit the Alamo to experience the sense of reverence and awe that it deserves.

As the paragraph also states, “It is our simple goal to improve the visitor experience for guests and all Texans, including our students.” How can this be achieved? By preserving the Alamo Church and Long Barrack, recapturing the 1836 Battlefield, and reinforce the Alamo’s amazing story of sacrifice and heroism.

Additionally, Alamo staff including tour guides, Living History members, and greeters frequently report hearing comments echoed in the reviews below. I have listed in this document:

quotes from elected officials and other related to the Alamo regarding the feedback they’ve received, negative articles and reviews from online publications, an analysis of Trip Advisor ratings and screenshots of negative ratings with common themes including disappointing, meh, not much to see, and overrated, negative Yelp reviews, and negative Facebook reviews.

Thank you.

Sincerely, Brittany
