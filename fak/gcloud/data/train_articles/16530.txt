Justin Nelson for Texas Attorney General

I'm attaching a doc with searches. As I said, we've been searching for indicted statewide elected officials. This doc includes non-elected state officials. Outside Paxton and Missouri Gov. until his recent resignation, we can't find any indicted statewide officials.

In addition to this we query "supreme court" / "supreme court justice" AND state-name AND Indicted. Also search Senate.

If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to call.
