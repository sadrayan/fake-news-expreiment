Astorino Spot: New Yorkers ‘Burned Again’ By Cuomo
A 30-second advertisement released online this morning by GOP candidate for governor Rob Astorino blasts incumbent Democrat Andrew Cuomo for his meddling in the Moreland Commission To Investigate Public Corruption.

The ad is the latest sign Astorino, who is behind in both public opinion polls and fundraising, is trying to gain some traction and capitalize off of Cuomo’s troubles with the commission.

In the ad, a narrator cites The New York Times story last week that detailed the level of involvement from Cuomo’s office, including his top aide’s efforts to direct subpoenas from the anti-corruption panel.

“New York voters trusted Andrew Cuomo to clean up Albany,” the ad says. “Now he’s at the center of the biggest corruption scandal in years.”

The spot seems to go after Cuomo’s biggest perceived strength heading into his re-election — namely that he was a different kind of politician when he was elected in 2010.

Andrew Cuomo: Another phony. Another Albany politician in the cross hairs of federal prosecutors,” the ad says.
