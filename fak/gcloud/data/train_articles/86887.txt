In ‘Red’ and ‘Blue’ Israel, Separate Lives and Divergent Narratives
JERUSALEM — The two front-page headlines told very different stories about Secretary of State John Kerry’s lengthy address about Middle East peace.

In the view of the right-of-center Jerusalem Post: “Kerry exits locked into failed assumptions.”

For the left-of-center Haaretz: “A very Zionist, pro-Israel speech.”

As it turns out, the choose-your-news phenomenon is not unique to the United States.

In Israel, the reaction to the events of recent days, including Mr. Kerry’s speech castigating the government’s policies and a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements, made it clear that Israelis are just as polarized as Americans.

To borrow an analogy, there is a blue, or more liberal-leaning, Israel that thought Mr. Kerry offered painful but necessary truths in the spirit of friendship that indicted the failed leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
