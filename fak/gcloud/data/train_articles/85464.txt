Live Interview: Gubernatorial Candidate Mary Burke
Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke was also

in La Crosse today.

She joins us now live to talk about what she hopes

to do for our state if she's elected governor.

Thanks for being with us.

- As you know, there is a 2 year tuition freeze at

U-W system schools.

If the governor is re-elected he would like to continue

that freeze .

U-W La Crosse officials say the freeze makes it harder

to recuit and maintain faculty.

Also harder to train students for future jobs in technology

and science.

How would you solve the funding issue at state universities

like UW-L?

-Your current ad focuses on a Winona State University

student who took part in a program at a Madison High

School developed with your help called AVID.

The La Crosse School District just added this course

this year to their curriculum thanks to outside funding.

It's designed to give students college-readiness skills.

How will this program help our state?

-You served as Secretary of Commerce for two years

under Jim Doyle, you also served as a school board

member in Madison in what ways can you see businesses

and our University System working together to make

sure we are creating the types of workers our employers

need?

- TREK Bicycles where you worked for nine years and

are currently a major shareholder came under fire

for approximately 20 job layoffs due to foreign trade

last year.

However TREK is also responsible for creating one-thousand

jobs in the state.

That said, what would you do as Governor to stop the

job loss to foreign countries? And to create more

jobs in this state?

-As the first female Governor are there any issues

in the state that you think you would tackle differently

because of your experiences as a woman either personally

or professionally?
