Noelle Nikpour: Numbers show GOP must change
Of all the results from this past November's elections, two numbers stand out: three, and 71. Three is the number of counties nationwide where, according to Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report, if President Obama had won a smaller percentage of the youth and minority vote, he would have lost the entire election.

One of those was Broward County, where he trounced Mitt Romney by 264,000 votes. He won the state by only 74,000 votes. The other two were Cuyahoga County, Ohio, home of Cleveland, and Philadelphia County, Penn.

What about 71? That's the percentage of the Hispanic vote Obama won nationwide. He won 60 percent of the Hispanic vote in Florida, where Broward's County's Latino population is the fastest-growing in the state. Hispanics, of course, were not the only deciding factor in the previous election, but Obama's dominance of that group has Republicans talking â€“ those who want to win future elections, anyway.

Hispanics are growing so quickly in number that Dr. James Johnson, a North Carolina demographer, refers to the phenomenon as "the browning of America." In recent elections, the group had been dominated by Democrats but trending closer to competitiveness, culminating with a less-than-landslide 60-38 split in the 2010 elections.

But the last two years saw Republicans vote against the DREAM Act offering Hispanics a path to citizenship, at the same time some in the party were adopting harsh, anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric. Meanwhile, Obama announced he would not use federal enforcement agencies to deport younger undocumented aliens. It was a blatant violation of the law and the Constitution, but it was fantastic politics.

Meanwhile, young people ages 18 to 29 supported Obama in November, 60-36. That chasm is a little smaller than in Obama's win over John McCain, but the young electorate is bigger than it was in 2008.
