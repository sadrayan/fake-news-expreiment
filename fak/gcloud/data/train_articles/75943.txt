Statewide Septic Tank Evaluation Program

"Proper septic system maintenance is a commonly overlooked responsibility. Failing systems are a significant threat to our health and our water quality. Property owners can save themselves a lot of money and trouble by following a few simple guidelines." - Ben Grumbles, Assistant Administrator of the Office of Water, US EPA

Update June 2011

The 2011 Legislature did not repeal or modify the septic tank evaluation program established in 2010. While the implementation date was moved to July 2, 2011 by the November 2010 Special Session, the department would have to adopt a rule to implement the program. In addition, the Legislature added language in the Budget Implementation Act requiring the department to submit a plan for approval by the Legislature Budget Commission before expending funds in furtherance of the evaluation program. Finally, any rule adopted by the department will require ratification from the Legislature. The department would restart rule development after approval by the Legislature Budget Commission. Information will be posted on the Bureau of Onsite Sewage Programs website at www.MyFloridaEH.com
