TRUMP ENDS HIS STRUGGLE TO GAIN CONTROL OF BALLY
The developer Donald J. Trump, ending a four-month battle to gain control of a rival casino operator in Atlantic City, the Bally Manufacturing Corporation, will sell back to the company his 9.9 percent interest in it, sources close to the deal said.

They said yesterday that the New York developer received $68.6 million from Bally over the weekend and was guaranteed $15.1 million more, for a $31.7 million profit on his holdings.

The deal would put an end to lawsuits Mr. Trump and Bally had filed against each other and would allow Bally to complete a deal to buy the Golden Nugget casino and hotel in Atlantic City for $440 million. This would give Bally, which is based in Chicago, two Atlantic City casinos and would make it the largest gaming corporation in the country, with revenues of about $1 billion.

Until now, only the Trump Organization owned two casinos in Atlantic City.

Bally also owns two large casinos in Nevada that had made it attractive to the Trump Organization, which has no casino in that state. Bally bought the MGM Grand in Reno and the MGM Grand in Las Vegas for $573 million in April and changed their names to Bally Grand. A 'Poison Pill'

Mr. Trump acquired 9.9 percent of Bally's stock beginning in November, making him the company's largest shareholder. Shortly after acquiring the first shares, he told Bally that he planned to buy more than 25 percent of its outstanding shares.
