Prince Harry warned Barack Obama wedding invite could be in trouble
Prince Harry chose Barack Obama to be his flagship interview - but it may not be wise to invite him to his wedding. The Prince chose to feature the former President on the Today Programme, which he is guest-editing on Wednesday.

The interview highlights the close relationship between Prince Harry and Obama. The prince is thought to have told aides he wants to invite Mr Obama and his wife Michelle to the wedding on May 19.

But civil servants are said to fear a diplomatic issue if Mr Obama is invited to the upcoming royal nuptials.

Current president Donald Trump is unlikely to get an invite - and there are fears he would not respond well if the Obamas were asked to come.

Relations between Britain and the White House are currently particularly strained.
