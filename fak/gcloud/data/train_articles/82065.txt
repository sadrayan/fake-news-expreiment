U.S. intervention in Libya now seen as cautionary tale
"In Libya, the bottom line is still that a lot of lives were saved, and Kadafi was removed from power," said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor. "What it's going to take in the long term for Libya to succeed is strategies that build political coalitions and that train forces. Our military action alone wasn't going to be the end of the story. It was the beginning of a new chapter."
