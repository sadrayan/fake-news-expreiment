Florida Department of State
Office History

The Office of the Secretary of State was created in 1845, under the Florida Constitution. The main responsibilities of the office included maintaining the states public records. The Secretary of State also served as the custodian of the state seal, which was impressed on documents to certify them as official.

As Florida's population grew in the 20th century so did the duties of the Secretary of State. In 1969, the Office of the Secretary of State was merged with several state agencies to form the Florida Department of State. As the head of the Department of State, the Secretary of State oversees a large state agency with many task and responsibilities.
