CSSB 5 included the fetal pain provision that would make difficult if not prohibit abortions after 20 weeks (except for life of the mother I think). A TT poll earlier this month indicated that 62% of texans either somewhat or strongly supported the 20 week guideline/provision so I maintain my statement is accurate.

Is there polling on the other major provisions of the measure?

Not that I'm aware of. W/o the 20 week fetal pain provision I wouldn't have made my claim. The pro choice folks focus solely on the "access" issue. That wouldve been a valid focus until the house restored the 20 week provision, then in my opinion, the 20 weeks becomes the salient provision. Ask anyone you know if they're "comfortable" with abortions after 20 weeks.
