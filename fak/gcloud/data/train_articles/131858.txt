UPDATE: Trump Has The Votes-Wins Nobel Peace Prize
The voting for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize has ended, according to our source inside CERN in Norway. It took just an hour for the voting to make its way around the famous “ Circle of Nobels ” with a clear majority for US President Donald Trump. Nobel Society Laureate Coordinator Art Tubolls told BBC-14A:

“The man singlehandedly ended the Korean Conflict. Now they’re hearing about North Vietnam having talks with South Vietnam and East Germany giving up its final Communist checkpoint. That was all Trump. Honestly we can’t quite figure out why Obama won.”

The official tally takes a few days and gets certified by agencies from 17 countries before the award is minted and the $8.3 million prize (10 million Euros) transferred to the charity of Trump’s choice . He could keep the money, being the first person to ever do so, but that seems unlikely.

Few people realize that Trump won more than $4 million in 1995 for the Nobel Prize in Economics. His groundbreaking real estate strategies are considered “mostly responsible” for the billions made by wealthy bankers and business owners during the market bubble of the mid-2000s:

“We learned to take a $60K house and sell it for $300 by giving people with bad credit high-interest loans. Then, we sold that bad debt to companies who sold it to other companies and so on until the entire market was so inflated that all you needed was money to triple your net worth.”

That year, Trump was still a Democrat and gave the money to Planned Parenthood and Hillary Clinton’s Senatorial Campaign.

The whole thing collapsed, of course, and caused the Great Recession , but those at the top got a whole lot richer and if what they’ve been promising kicks in anytime soon, we’ll be golden. Jobs, low-interest loans and a return to the American way of obsolete manufacturing should start trickling down anytime now.
