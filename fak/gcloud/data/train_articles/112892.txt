WB to Rock with ‘Bravo’
Warner Bros. Pictures has purchased the live-action feature film rights to Cartoon Network’s half-hour series “Johnny Bravo” as a potential starring vehicle for the Rock.

Pic, being developed by Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. Pictures, was optioned from Cartoon Network and “Bravo” creator/writer/director Van Partible.

Neal Moritz and Marty Adelstein will produce for Warner Bros. via their Original Film production banner with Van Partible serving as exec producer. As yet, no writer has been hired to pen the script.

“When the Rock mentioned to Neal (Moritz) and myself he was a big fan of ‘Johnny Bravo’ and thought it was a great idea for a movie, we thought it was a natural fit and potentially a great role for him to play, so we went aggressively after the property,” said Adelstein.

The Rock is repped by Endeavor and managed by Original.

Project marks the first live-action motion picture teaming of WB and its fellow company Cartoon Network.

Warner Bros. previously produced an animated feature of Cartoon Network’s hit animated show called “The Powerpuff Girls: The Movie.”

Even though Warner Bros.’ live-action feature “Scooby-Doo” has spawned a new franchise for the studio, Cartoon Network, which broadcasts the original animated TV show on which that movie was based, had no part in the development or production of that feature. Rights to the original show were part of the Hanna-Barbera library, which was acquired by Time Warner through the Turner/Time Warner merger.

“Bravo,” a half-hour series that debuted in July 1997, is one of Cartoon Network’s signature original shows, and has been a huge hit for the network.

The animated series is about a big-muscled, big haired sweet-talking ladies man who sounds like Elvis, loves his mother and worships himself — and continually proves to be his own worse enemy.
