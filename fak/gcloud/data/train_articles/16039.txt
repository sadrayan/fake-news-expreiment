In debate, Sen. Rubio said Cruz’s tax plan, “businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.”

This statement is true.

Here is a rough example that ignores depreciation.

Under current law, the corporate income tax roughly taxes profits. So if a corporation has $200 in revenue, they subtract out their capital costs of $50 and their payroll of $50. The tax base is $100. The business would pay 35 percent of that, or $35.

The Cruz plan enacts a VAT of 16 percent. This will disallow the deduction for wages. So the same company that earns $200 in revenue can only subtract its capital costs of $50. The tax base is $150. The business would pay 16 percent of $150 or $24.

I would add, however, that Cruz’s plan really isn’t that different than current law. Payroll taxes under current law have the same economic impact as the VAT, but at a slightly different tax rate: a 15.3 percent tax on wages.

Interesting.

In your example, I don’t see the payroll part of the 16 percent calculation. Is it more accurate to say that while Cruz proposes to eliminate the payroll tax, that doesn’t mean that payroll goes untaxed; rather, to the extent that payroll plays into revenue less capital costs, it’s taxed as revenue? If this makes sense (it might not, of course), is it also more accurate to say Cruz’s plan taxes revenue less capital costs at 16 percent and that’s that?

That is actually a very good way to put it. Even though his plan gets rid of the payroll tax, his new Business Flat Tax will end up taxing that payroll by disallowing its deduction at the business level.
