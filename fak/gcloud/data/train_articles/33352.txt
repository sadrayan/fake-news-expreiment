Congress negotiators tasked with finding a border deal listed
(CNN) Following President Donald Trump's announcement Friday to reopen the government came the news that efforts to reach a legislative solution to funding border security, immigration issues and Trump's campaign promise of a wall would go to a special committee of senators and representatives to try and hash out a deal.

This bipartisan conference committee has until February 15 to find such a proposal that could clear both chambers of Congress and get Trump's signature. Shortly after each chamber passed the bill to re-open the government, the Senate and House also named which lawmakers would negotiate on behalf of the Republicans and the Democrats.

As the fight largely surrounds funding for Trump's campaign promise of a border wall, the negotiators for both House and Senate come from the Appropriations committees, the panels in each chamber that determine how the federal government spends money.

While it appears obvious on its face that the members of the conference committee would all come from an appropriations panel -- the measure the group will be negotiating, or attempting to conference, is a product of those two committees -- it also creates an interesting dynamic on an issue that for years has flummoxed, vexed and outright defeated every legislative effort to find a compromise: immigration.

Appropriators are, by nature, deal makers and rarely come from the hardline elements of either side of the party. The Senate Appropriations Committee actually came to a bipartisan agreement on a Homeland Security bill last year -- one that included $1.6 billion in border security that included funds for fencing and barrier repairs.
