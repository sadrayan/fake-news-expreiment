Some are calling Mark Meadows a real life "snow angel" after a winter storm trapped thousands far from home this week.

Meadows owns the Chick-Fil-A restaurant on Highway 280 and he too was on the road Tuesday afternoon when the snow started coming down.

"I had a delivery to make. I had this lady who said she still wanted her boxed meal delivered. So I got on 280 and two hours later I was still not to where I needed to be," Meadows said.

That's when Meadows did the first thing that came to mind.

"That's when I started handing out box meals to people on 280," he said.

The Chick-Fil-A closed for business early on in the day when it became apparent the snow storm wasn't slowing down.

But when Meadows finally reunited with his team at the restaurant, none of them were prepared to slow down either.

"And they started preparing sandwiches and we went out into 280 and just stared passing 'em out to people," Meadows said.

Hundreds, if not thousands, of drivers were stuck for hours along the icy highway.

As anyone can imagine, the food was well received. Meadows says he was just trying to make a dreadful situation a little more bearable.

"Tremendous, tremendous response from people almost in tears and they were very glad that we did what we did," Meadows said.

Overnight, the restaurant turned into a shelter when they welcomed stranded divers with a warm place to say.

And once the sun was out, Meadows and his team were back at it again.

"We have given away over a 1,000 Chick-Fil-A biscuits this morning to people who were stranded or in hotels or couldn't get anywhere," Meadows said.

Meadows was happy he could help out in a time of need but says he wasn't alone.

"There were people from Home Depot that were handing out water when I was handing out boxes. There were people out in the middle of 280 pushing cars and trying to get people on their way. This is something that wasn't just me at all, there were a lot of people helping out other out here. And they still are," Meadows said.
