N.J. Gov. Chris Christie swiftly vetoes 'millionaires tax,' property tax rebate bills
TRENTON

— It took about two minutes from the time Senate President Steve Sweeney certified the passage of the millionaires tax package for Gov. Chris Christie to veto the bills at his desk. "While I have little doubt that the sponsors and supporters of this bill sincerely believe that the state can tax its way out of this financial crisis, I believe that this bill does nothing more than repeat the failed, irresponsible and unsustainable fiscal policies of the past," wrote Christie in his veto statement. "Now is not the time for more of the same. Ultimately, another tax increase will punish the state’s struggling small businesses and set our economy further back from recovery."

After the state Senate passed the bill, which had already passed the Assembly, Sweeney walked the bills down the hallways of the Statehouse, from the state Senate chambers to the governor's office. Once inside, he handed the bills to Christie, who was waiting. "What took you so long ?" asked Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak. Christie sat at a wooden desk emblazoned with the seal of the state of New Jersey and swiftly signed vetoes. "We'll be back, governor," said Sweeney. "Alright, we'll see," said Christie. Democrats would need two-thirds majority in both houses of the Legislature to override the veto. "This is something we're not going away on," said Sweeney. "This isn't theater, this isn't a gimmick."
