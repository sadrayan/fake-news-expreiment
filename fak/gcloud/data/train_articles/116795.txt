Neko Case Vermont Farmhouse
In The Stable

Case — with her friend and contractor Nate Homchick — readies Norman, a Percheron-Andalusian cross, for a ride. She has four more upright pianos in this barn, among other rescued treaures — ranging from a pile of archery equipment to cast-off doors and windows to a bathtub. "I've been collecting this stuff from thrift stores and junk shops since I was 16, though it's now called hoarding, I guess," she says, wryly. "I try to get everything used."
