Email, Jason Embry, communications director, Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, Oct. 31, 2017

Speaker Straus is grateful for the overwhelming support he has received from mainstream Republicans as he has traveled the state in recent months. He's confident that most Texans support his solutions-oriented approach to governing and agree with him that the state's most pressing challenges are education, rising property taxes caused by a lack of state support for public schools, infrastructure, and economic development.
