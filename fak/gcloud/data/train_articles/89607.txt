2016 Presidential Swing State Polls Poll - April 9, 2015 - Paul Blooms As Clinton Wilts I
April 9, 2015 - Paul Blooms As Clinton Wilts In Colorado, Iowa, Virginia, Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll Finds

COLORADO: Paul 44 - Clinton 41

IOWA: Paul 43 - Clinton 42

VIRGINIA: Clinton 47 - Paul 43

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's lead is wilting against leading Republican presidential candidates in three critical swing states, Colorado, Iowa and Virginia, and she finds herself in a close race with U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky in each state, according to a Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll released today. In head-to-head matchups, every Republican candidate effectively ties her in Colorado and almost all Republicans effectively tie her in Iowa.





Secretary Clinton has lost ground in almost every matchup in Colorado and Iowa since a February 18 Swing State Poll by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University. The Swing State Poll focuses on key states in the presidential election.





One bright spot for Clinton is Virginia, the largest of the three states, where she leads all Republicans, including 47 - 40 percent over Bush, compared to a 42 - 42 percent tie in February.





Voters in each state say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy. Her overall favorability has dropped significantly in Colorado and Iowa, while Virginia is unchanged. Favorability ratings for the Republicans are lackluster, at best.





"These numbers are a boost for U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky as he formally launches his campaign," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





"Ominous for Hillary Clinton is the broad scope of the movement today compared to her showing in Quinnipiac University's mid-February survey. It isn't just one or two Republicans who are stepping up; it's virtually the entire GOP field that is running better against her.





"That's why it is difficult to see Secretary Clinton's slippage as anything other than a further toll on her image from the furor over her e-mail."





"In all three of these states, more, and in Colorado many more, registered voters say she is not honest and trustworthy," Brown added. "Voters do think she is a strong leader - a key metric - but unless she can change the honesty perception, running as a competent but dishonest candidate has serious potential problems."





Colorado





In the presidential race in Colorado, Paul gets 44 percent to Clinton's 41 percent and other Republicans are effectively tied as well:

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida gets 41 percent to Clinton's 40 percent;

She ties former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 41 - 41 percent;

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker gets 42 percent to her 41 percent;

Clinton gets 42 percent to 41 percent for U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas;

She gets 41 percent to Bush's 38 percent;

Clinton gets 41 percent to 39 percent for New Jersey Gov. Christopher Christie.

Clinton gets a negative 41 - 51 percent favorability, compared to 46 - 47 percent in February. Favorability ratings for the Republicans are:

Negative 22 - 48 percent for Christie;

Negative 29 - 44 percent for Bush;

36 - 31 percent for Paul;

35 - 35 percent for Huckabee;

26 - 23 percent for Walker with 50 percent who don't know enough about him to form an opinion;

31 - 26 percent for Rubio;

Negative 28 - 34 percent for Cruz.

Colorado voters say 56 - 38 percent that Clinton is not honest and trustworthy. Her e-mail controversy is "very important" or "somewhat important" as an issue in their vote, 51 percent of voters say, while 49 percent say "not so important" or "not important at all."





The e-mail issue makes them less likely to vote for Clinton, 42 percent of voters say, while 55 percent say it won't affect their vote. Only 34 percent of voters say she's given satisfactory answers on the e-mail issue, while 57 percent say serious questions remain.





But 51 percent of Colorado voters say a Congressional investigation of Clinton's e-mails would be politically motivated.





"Hillary Clinton still has a mountain or two to climb to win the hearts of Coloradans who don't trust her," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. "The e- mail controversy is opening doors to candidates who had little traction as Hillary Clinton gets bad numbers on trust and honesty."





Iowa





Every Republican is tied or close to Clinton in Iowa:

She gets 41 percent to 39 percent for Christie:

She gets 41 percent to 40 percent for Bush;

Paul at 43 percent to Clinton's 42 percent;

Huckabee ties her 42 - 42 percent;

Clinton edges Walker 44 - 40 percent;

She gets 43 percent to 40 percent against either Rubio or Cruz.

Iowa voters give Clinton a split 45 - 47 percent favorability rating, down from 49 - 40 percent February 18. Favorability ratings for the Republicans are:

Negative 27 - 39 percent for Christie;

Negative 31 - 38 percent for Bush;

35 - 29 percent for Paul;

41 - 31 percent for Huckabee;

25 - 24 percent for Walker with 50 percent who don't know enough about him to form an opinion;

24 - 21 percent for Rubio with 54 percent who don't know enough about him;

Negative 26 - 31 percent for Cruz.

Iowa voters say 49 - 43 percent that Clinton is not honest and trustworthy. Voters are divided 50 - 49 percent on whether the e-mail scandal is important to their vote. While 37 percent of voters say they are less likely to vote for Clinton because of this issue, 58 percent say it will make no difference in their vote.





Clinton has given satisfactory answers on the e-mail scandal, 34 percent of voters say, but 54 percent say serious questions remain. Voters say 53 - 40 percent that a Congressional investigation of the e-mail scandal would be politically motivated.





"Iowa epitomizes the image of a swing state. When Hillary Clinton is matched against seven of the GOP hopefuls, all of those mythical matchups have a difference of four percentage points or less," Brown said.





Virginia





Clinton leads Bush 47 - 40 percent in Virginia, compared to a 42 - 42 percent tie February 18, She gets 47 percent to Paul's 43 percent, her closest race in the Old Dominion. In other races:

Clinton tops Christie 46 - 40 percent;

Clinton over Huckabee 48 - 40 percent;

Clinton tops Walker 47 - 40 percent;

She beats Rubio 48 - 40 percent;

Clinton tops Cruz 49 - 39 percent.

The Democrat gets a split 48 - 45 percent favorability rating, compared to 48 - 44 percent in February. Favorability ratings for Republicans are:

Negative 32 - 38 percent for Bush;

Negative 31 - 41 percent for Christie;

34 - 31 percent for Paul;

34 - 36 percent for Huckabee;

26 - 20 percent for Walker with 53 percent who don't know enough about him to form an opinion.

29 - 25 percent for Rubio;

Negative 30 - 38 percent for Cruz.

Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, Virginia voters say 52 - 40 percent. Her e-mail scandal is important to their vote, 51 percent of voters say, while 47 percent say it's not so important or not important at all. The e-mail issue makes 39 percent less likely to voter for her, while 56 percent say it makes no difference.





Serious questions about the e-mail scandal remain, 54 percent of voters say, while 38 percent say Clinton has given satisfactory answers. Virginia voters say 51 - 46 percent a Congressional investigation into the e-mail scandal would be politically motivated.





"Of the three states tested, Virginia seems to be the friendliest toward Hillary Clinton, perhaps a continuing reflection of the Old Dominion's leftward drift over the past decade. Only yesterday, it seemed, it was deeply red," Brown said.





From March 29 - April 7 Quinnipiac University surveyed:

894 Colorado voters with a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points;

948 Iowa voters with a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percentage points;

961 Virginia voters with a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percentage points.
