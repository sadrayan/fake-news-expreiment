Senators focus on critical state audit while questioning nominees for University of Missouri curators
JEFFERSON CITY � Gov. Eric Greitens' three nominees to the University of Missouri Board of Curators called for more accountability and transparency within the system after fielding questions from state senators about a recent audit that showed millions of dollars of non-salary payments to top administrators.

The Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee on Wednesday interviewed Democrat Darryl Chatman and Republicans Jamie Farmer and Jeff Layman and will vote on whether to approve them before sending recommendations to the full Senate.

The hearing came two days after State Auditor Nicole Galloway released an audit of the University of Missouri System that showed some administrators received $2.4 million in incentive pay and bonuses. The audit dominated questioning by senators.

�What do you bring to the table?� Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard said, questioning Chatman, the first candidate in front of the panel. �Hopefully some common sense. You seem like a common sense fellow.�

Chatman, a St. Louis attorney, said he felt the audit revealed some �disturbing things� and his primary concern was the curators� lack of knowledge about incentive and bonus pay. These payments are dependent on the market and compensation for leaders at competing institutions, Chatman said, but he doesn�t know what that structure should look like for the University of Missouri.

�We do know something is broken, though, on a lot of levels,� Chatman said.

The university system was already facing the possibility of major funding cuts from the state. Earlier this year, Greitens proposed nearly $500 million in cuts from the state budget, including $40.4 million from the UM System�s appropriation.

In response, the university is considering raising tuition, which Chatman said he opposes. He said the university should look internally for costs savings, such as decreasing spending on capital improvement projects. Chatman said layoffs might also be necessary, but in an interview after the hearing said that layoffs are not a favorable option.

�I do think at some point in time when you have a financial crisis, something�s got to happen, but I think the last thing you do is make our young people suffer and pay higher tuition,� he said. �As far as letting people go, that�s kind of the last thing on my list of things to do, but it�s on the table.�

Layman, Greitens� finance chairman during his gubernatorial campaign, also said the university system should look internally to save dollars instead of raising tuition. Increased accountability will be a likely change for the system with the new leadership of President Mun Choi and new curators, he said.

�If that�s not going to happen, we�ll have to force that,� he said about accountability. �There�s just no other way around it. That has to change.�

Farmer, president of Farmer Holding Company, said the curators must set standards for employees to receive incentive packages and in the process of setting those metrics, the curators and system must be transparent.

�I feel what happened in this latest audit and findings was that the board wasn�t clear on exactly how these different individuals were going to be compensated and the administration, with the tail wagging the dog, was able to skirt around and do these fancy payments in the form of payments and travel budgets that really aren�t fair,� she said. �I feel like this is in a time where there�s been so much scrutiny and arguably some of the worst years from the University of Missouri and, just from an optics perspective, this is pretty poor performance and behavior.�

Senators chimed in during questioning to express their thoughts on the audit, most of them critical of the university. Sen. Dan Hegeman, R-Cosby, said the situation is serious and transparency should be demanded.

�And we don�t give bonuses in the state of Missouri on any level of government, so this very troubling for me what we�re seeing and I�m glad you�re taking it to heart,� he said to Chatman. �Even if it�s legal, it may not be the right thing to do.�

Diverting from discussion about the audit, Sen. Doug Libla, R-Poplar Bluff, said his constituents have concerns that professors promote their own personal agendas and asked Layman to respond.

�Well, I think, obviously, we need to be focusing on providing quality education and I don�t think personal agendas fit into that role at all,� Layman said.
