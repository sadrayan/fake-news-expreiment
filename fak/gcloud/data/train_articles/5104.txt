Candidate Tracking System

The Florida Department of State's Candidate Tracking System tracks candidates throughout the elections process presenting candidate status, campaign finance activity, personal photos and contact information. This information is updated regularly as candidates file and update their information.

The Division of Elections offers this tracking system as an unofficial reference of candidates for state elections.
