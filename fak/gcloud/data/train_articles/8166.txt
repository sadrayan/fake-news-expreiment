Congressman Bob Latta
Yesterday, Congressman Bob Latta (R-Bowling Green), along with Congressman Gary Peters (D-MI), introduced legislation that would repeal a duplicative mandate that requires auto dealers to certify if a new vehicle has an emissions system.

“This bipartisan effort to eliminate outdated and duplicative regulations will relieve auto dealers from unnecessary red tape they must deal with on a daily basis. This redundant paperwork requirement is from an outdated law that has been superseded by modern technology and standard vehicle warranties. Small business owners are already compliant with the law and the only impact of this unnecessary paperwork requirement is increased costs for auto dealers and consumers,” said Congressman Latta.

“Repealing laws that burden small business with no discernible benefit to consumers is something both parties should agree on. I commend Reps. Latta and Peters for their effort to repeal this obsolete mandate,” added David Westcott, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA).

Under the current regulation, the Clean Air Act requires dealers to present the buyer with written confirmation that a visual inspection has been completed of a new-vehicle’s emissions system, however documentation certifying compliance can already be found under the hood or on the Internet. Additionally, new-car dealers are contractually obligated to perform comprehensive pre-delivery inspections of the vehicle to ensure the emissions system is functioning properly.
