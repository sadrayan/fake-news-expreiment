New City Smoking Ban in Cars Proposed
The Rockland County Legislature voted unanimously on Tuesday night to ban smoking in private cars with children under 18. Dr. Jeffrey Oppenheim, president of the County Board of Health, said Rockland was the only county in the state to approve such a law. County Executive C. Scott Vanderhoef has 30 days to sign or veto the measure; so far he has not indicated a decision. Similar measures have been passed in Keyport, N.J., and Bangor, Me.
