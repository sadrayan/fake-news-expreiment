Tilapia
Latin Name: Oreochromis spp.

The tilapia are one of many exotic invasives that call Florida home. The tilapia is in the family Cichlidae which boasts a staggering 1300 representatives. Originally from West Africa the tilapia was one of the worldâ€™s first cultured fish and is now the second most widely farmed freshwater fish in the world. These fish are ideal for culturing as they can be raised in fresh or salt water, produce young year round and are most resistant to diseases than any other farmed fish.
