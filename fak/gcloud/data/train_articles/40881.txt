Iowa health insurance marketplace: history and news of the state’s exchange: Obamacare enrollment
Highlights and updates

Iowa exchange overview

Iowa operates a partnership exchange with the federal government . Iowa residents use the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, to compare and purchase coverage. The state is responsible for plan management, consumer assistance, and Medicaid eligibility determination.

Iowa’s plan management functions include selecting and monitoring the qualified health plans (QHP) that offer policies on the exchange. Iowa’s role in consumer assistance is education and outreach, coordinating the in-person consumer assisters, and overseeing the Navigator program. The federal government manages the exchange website and call center, and funds the Navigator program.

But federal Navigator funding was cut significantly for the fall 2017 open enrollment period (for 2018 coverage), as was funding for outreach and advertising for HealthCare.gov. And in 2018, Iowa did not receive any navigator grants at all.

Iowa expanded Medicaid under the ACA, but with a waiver that called for using Medicaid funds to purchase private health plans for eligible residents. But in June 2015, the state announced that they were abandoning their alternative “private option” for Medicaid expansion, and switching Medicaid enrollees to regular Medicaid managed care plans instead. The switch to managed care was initially scheduled for January 2016, but was pushed back to March 2016.

Iowa’s uninsured rate decreased 3.1 percentage points, from 8.1 percent in 2013 to 4.7 percent in 2017, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Iowa’s Medicaid/CHIP enrollment grew by 38 percent —nearly 189,000 people — from late 2013 to late 2018, which is no doubt a significant factor in the reduction in the uninsured rate.



Enrollment in Iowa’s exchange

Open enrollment for 2019 plans ran from November 1, 2018 to December 15, 2018. During that window, 49,210 people enrolled in private plans through the Iowa exchange. That was a drop of about 7.5 percent from the 53,217 people who had enrolled during open enrollment for 2018 coverage.

In the majority of the states that use HealthCare.gov, enrollment peaked in 2016 and has declined each year since then. In Iowa, enrollment did peak in 2016, and although it declined in 2017, it rose again in 2018, although not to the level it had reached in 2016. Here’s a summary of how enrollment has changed over the years in Iowa’s exchange:

29,163 people enrolled for 2014. This was lower than expected, and a Kaiser Health News article attributed the low enrollment to Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield’s decision against participating in the Iowa marketplace. In addition, the fact that transitional (pre-2014) plans were allowed to renew meant that overall enrollment in ACA-compliant plans was lower than expected.

Enrollment grew significantly for 2015, with 45,162 people enrolling in Iowa exchange plans.

Enrollment grew sharply again in 2016, with 55,089 people purchasing plans during open enrollment.

Enrollment declined about 6 percent for 2017, when 51,573 people enrolled during the open enrollment period. [Across all the states that use HealthCare.gov, enrollment dropped by about 5 percent in 2017. This is due in part to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the ACA, and the Trump Administration’s move to cut back advertising and outreach in the final week of 2017 enrollment.]

53,217 people enrolled during the open enrollment period for 2018, but attrition was significant. As of February 2018, the Iowa Insurance Division reported that 46,563 people had in-force ACA-compliant individual market coverage in the state, and nearly 90 percent of them were receiving premium subsidies. Most of the people who weren’t eligible for premium subsidies had left Iowa’s ACA-compliant individual market for 2018. Although the ACA’s individual mandate penalty was still in effect for 2018, an exemption was available to anyone for whome the lowest-cost bronze plan would cost more than 8.05 percent of household income; this likely applied to many of the people who left the unsubsidized market at the end of 2017. By November 2018, total enrollment in ACA-compliant individual market plans (including on- and off-exchange plans) in Iowa had dropped to 39,000 people. Virtually all of those individuals had on-exchange coverage, as the off-exchange ACA-compliant market in Iowa appeared to have dwindled to almost no enrollees. Notably, Iowa still had 68,000 people enrolled in individual market grandmothered and grandfathered plans at that point. Those pre-ACA plans still exist in other states as well, but they don’t comprise the bulk of any other state’s entire individual insurance market. The fact that so many people in Iowa — who were healthy enough to purchase medically underwritten coverage prior to 2013 or 2010 — is part of the reason the state’s ACA-compliant risk pool is so expensive.

Kaiser Family Foundation data indicated that as of 2018, just 17 percent of eligible Iowa residents had enrolled in coverage through the exchange, the lowest percentage in the country (nationwide, the average was 34 percent at that point). The lower-than-expected enrollment may have been due in part to the lack of marketing for the exchange in the state, or the fact that Wellmark sat out the first three years of exchange operation (they began offering exchange plans in 2017, exited for 2018, but then returned in 2019).



Wellmark and Medica offering plans in 2019 (plus a look at insurer participation in Iowa’s exchange since 2014)

In 2014, plans were available in Iowa’s exchange from Aetna (Coventry), Avera, CoOpportunity, and Gunderson. Coventry and CoOpportunity offered plans statewide, while Gunderson’s plans were only available in five northeastern counties and Avera’s plans were only available in nine northwestern counties.

Early in the open enrollment period for 2015 plans, Coventry and CoOpportunity Health both offered plans statewide in the Iowa exchange, and Avera and Gunderson continued to offer plans in the northern corners of the state. But CoOportunity stopped offering policies in late December 2014 (CoOpportunity had stopped offering private plans to Medicaid expansion enrollees as of November, and their 9,700 members in that program had transitioned to Iowa’s fee-for-service Medicaid program instead). CoOportunity was a CO-OP health insurer formed with funding through the Affordable Care Act. CoOpportunity got into financial difficulty after higher than expected enrollment and claim costs in 2014, and was subsequently liquidated, leaving Coventry as the only marketplace insurer available in most of Iowa.

Avera did not offer health insurance in the Iowa exchange in 2016 (their plans were all off-exchange). But Medica joined the exchange state-wide (Aetna/Coventry continued to offer plans statewide), and UnitedHealthcare began offering exchange plans in most of the state. Gunderson continued to offer plans in just the northeast corner of the state.

UnitedHealthcare’s participation in Iowa’s exchange was short-lived however, as they exited at the end of 2016 (as was the case in most states where they offered exchange plans). In 2016, United had offered plans in 76 of Iowa’s 99 counties, and in 71 of those counties, United offered at least one of the two lowest-cost silver plans in the exchange. In 66 counties, the benchmark plan for a 40-year-old would have been between $25 and $100/month more expensive in 2016 if United hadn’t participated. However, the impact of United’s was buffered by the fact that Wellmark joined the exchange in 2017.

Avera’s initial rate filing for 2017 indicated that they would return to the exchange for 2017. They ultimately reversed course, however, and did not return to the Iowa exchange (as of 2019, their individual market plans are still only available in South Dakota). But Iowa’s exchange still had four insurers participating in 2017, as that was the year that Wellmark finally joined the Iowa exchange (Wellmark had long been the dominant insurer in Iowa’s individual market, but had avoided the exchange for the first three years). Medica was the only carrier offering exchange plans in all 99 counties in Iowa, and in 13 of the state’s counties, Medica was the only carrier offering plans in the exchange. Aetna, Wellmark, and Gunderson all offered plans in select areas of the state. [Aetna had stopped offering exchange coverage in 2017 in most of the states where they participated in 2016. They continued to offer coverage in the exchanges in four states, including Iowa (the others were Delaware, Nebraska, and Virginia). But at the end of 2017, they exited the individual market in all four of those states.]

For 2018, Medica continued to offer plans statewide in Iowa’s exchange, but Wellmark, Gunderson, and Aetna all left the exchange at the end of 2017. So Medica was the only option for Iowa residents who wanted on-exchange plans in 2018.

For 2019, Wellmark rejoined the exchange and began offering plans statewide (in part because they were allowed to partner with Farm Bureau to sell medically underwritten plans outside the exchange; details below). So all exchange enrollees in Iowa had a choice between Medica and Wellmark for 2019 coverage.
