Crowds On Demand posted ad for Las Vegas crisis actors in August 10/6/2017 0 Comments ​A California based company called Crowds on Demand placed an advert on Craigslist back in August for crisis actors in the Las Vegas area. Crowds on Demand website: Your home for Protests, Rallies, Audiences, PR Stunts, and Celebrity Events. Today, the Craigslist advert is gone.

Once again we have a tragic event in America, and just like massive protests across America the Las Vegas shooting had ads for actors on Crowds On Demand back in August before the shooting. Two things seem to pop up after major events take place in America in the last year or so, and that is we get a fucked up investigation and there always seems to be ads for actors before an event like the Las Vegas shooting. So now we have new evidence with crisis actors being looked for on Craigslist and Crowds On Demand a month before the Las Vegas event...I think it's time we launch an investigation into Crowds On Demand don't you?
