BKD prepared the original and amended returns for 2010, 2011, and 2012. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) prepared the original and amended returns for 2013 and the 2014 Forms 990 and 990T. PwC also performed the independent audit of the Foundation’s consolidated financial statement for 2014 which includes the accounts and activities of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI). CHAI’s tax return and amended returns for prior years were separately filed; these returns were prepared by a separate tax firm – not BKD or PwC – independently selected by CHAI.

Clinton Global Initiative:

From 2005 to 2009 the Clinton Global Initiative was an initiative of the Foundation. From 2010 to 2013, CGI operated as a separate but affiliated non-profit organization as part of an agreement between the Foundation and the Obama Administration. During this period, the Foundation continued to consolidate CGI's finances into its annual financial reporting. CGI's application for tax-exempt status (IRS Form 1023) and the IRS’s response granting tax-exempt status are available here:

In 2013, CGI ceased operating as a separate entity and resumed operating as an initiative of the Clinton Foundation.

Clinton Health Access Initiative

The Clinton Health Access Initiative (formerly the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative) has been incorporated as a separate, but affiliated, non-profit organization since 2010. Because of this ongoing affiliation, the Clinton Foundation is required to consolidate CHAI's finances into the Foundation's audited financial reporting.
