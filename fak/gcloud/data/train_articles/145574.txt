The Florida shooting took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida yesterday, leaving 17 dead and 14 hospitalised. Those killed were a mix of students and adults. Twelve were killed inside the school, two just outside and one on the street, while two further victims died from their wounds in hospital. Former student Nikolas Cruz was arrested at the scene and has now been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. A mugshot released by police shows Cruz staring blankly at the camera, wearing a black t-shirt.

Teachers at the school had discussed threats made by Cruz while he was a student there, before he was expelled for fighting. One student said yesterday: “I think everyone had in their minds if anybody was going to do it, it was going to be him.” Cruz’s mother died three years ago and his father died when he was a child.
