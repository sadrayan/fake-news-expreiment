Trump Claims to Protect Pre-Existing Health Conditions. That’s Not What the Government Says.
what was said

“When it comes to health insurance, Donald Trump and Republicans will protect patients with pre-existing conditions.”

the facts

This requires context.

The Justice Department told a federal court in June that it would no longer defend provisions in the Affordable Care Act that protect patients with pre-existing medical conditions.

In a brief responding to a lawsuit filed by Texas and 19 other states, the Justice Department called the individual mandate — which requires most Americans to buy insurance or face financial penalties — unconstitutional.

Government lawyers argued that protections for pre-existing conditions and other medical issues cannot be separated from the individual mandate, and should also be overturned.

In a letter to Congress explaining the brief, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that decision was made “with the approval of the president of the United States.”
