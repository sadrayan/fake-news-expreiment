Ted Cruz to ride with Obama to Dallas on Air Force One
(CNN) Sen. Ted Cruz is traveling to Dallas aboard Air Force One with President Barack Obama on Tuesday.

The Texas Republican and Obama will join former President George W. Bush, Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama for an interfaith memorial service following the attack last week that left five police officers killed.

"President Obama invited Senator Cruz to travel on Air Force One to the memorial service, and the Senator accepted the invitation," Cruz spokeswoman Rachael Slobodien said.

It's the former presidential candidate's first trip with Obama aboard Air Force One.

Cruz isn't the only former 2016 Republican presidential contender to ride on Air Force One. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio rode Air Force One following the Orlando nightclub shootings that killed 49 people last month.
