New Kendrick Meek TV Ad Touts Kendrick’s Record Fighting for Florida’s Middle Class

"Only One" Highlights Real Differences in U.S. Senate Race

Ad: "I'm Kendrick Meek, the Democrat for Senate, and with three of us running, you should know what makes me different"

MIAMI GARDENS - Kendrick Meek, Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, today launched his first television ad of the general election. In "Only One," Kendrick touts his record of standing up for the middle class. He shows how he fought to stop developers from draining the Everglades, took on George W. Bush, led the fight against privatizing Social Security, and stood up against big credit card companies.

"On issue after issue, Kendrick is the only candidate who has fought for middle-class Florida families," said campaign manager Abe Dyk. "He's the only one will repeal the Bush tax cuts for the super wealthy, stop big developers from draining Florida wetlands, and stand up to the deep pockets of special interests. While Charlie Crist was getting cozy with big developers and special interest lobbyists in Tallahassee, Kendrick was fighting to cut taxes for middle-class families, increase the minimum wage, and rein in high credit card fees. Kendrick is the only candidate who will fight to get our economy moving for everyday Floridians -- not the big developers or special interests."
