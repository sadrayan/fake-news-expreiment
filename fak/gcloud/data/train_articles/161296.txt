Obama admin used pepper spray on migrants at border in 2013
As the Trump administration’s use of tear gas on migrants trying to illegally cross the border over the weekend draws backlash, a 2013 story about the Obama administration using a similar method on disorderly migrants resurfaced.

On Sunday, Border Patrol agents used tear gas against members of a migrant group after they threw rocks and debris at the agents while trying to break through a barrier at the U.S.-Mexico border.

A widely circulated photo from a Reuters photographer, showing a mother running away from the tear gas while pulling along her two young children in diapers, sparked outrage.

Almost five years ago to the day, Border Patrol agents used pepper spray to force back a crowd of migrants who had tried to illegally cross the border. That group had also thrown rocks and bottles at agents, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported in November 2013.

The Obama administration’s use of force, however, did not receive the same level of coverage by news organizations as the Trump administration’s actions.

No arrests were been made during the incident in 2013, according to the Union-Tribune. Forty-two people, most of whom were adult men, were arrested Sunday after the group of migrants tried to rush the border.
