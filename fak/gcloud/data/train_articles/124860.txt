Parking Information for Buses
Fees in lots on and adjacent to the Museum Campus are $11 to $80, based on availability and type of vehicle. Please check parking fees before you visit. School, tour and charter buses may park in the lot adjacent to Adler Planetarium, managed by Standard Parking (312-235-7724).

Buses can also park free on Canal Street at Roosevelt Road, approximately one mile due west of the Museum Campus. Canal Street offers several restaurants and coffee shops where drivers can wait until called back for pickup. Buses cannot stage on Solidarity Drive or in the museum drop-off areas.

Cleaner air = cleaner water. For people and for fish, please turn off your engine. Illinois law limits idle times to 10 minutes for stationary diesel vehicles of more than 8,000 pounds.
