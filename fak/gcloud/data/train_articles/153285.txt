Pell comes under fire from sex abuse groups
According to Canada's national newspaper, The Globe and Mail, Dr Pell told his audience of World Youth Day delegates that "abortion is a worse moral scandal than priests sexually abusing young people", during a public religious instruction session last week. The statement allegedly came in response to a question from a Kentucky youth minister, Greg Rickert, who had asked Dr Pell what Catholics should say when asked about the sex abuse crisis in the US Catholic church.

The newspaper reported that Mr Rickert sought clarification from Dr Pell over his statement, to which the archbishop replied: "Because [abortion] is always a destruction of human life."

Dr Pell then insisted his comments were not designed to downplay sexual abuse; he was merely trying to point out that sex abuse by Catholic clergy had attracted attention to the detriment of other issues.
