Here is what you said: A Texas law requires every high school to have a voter registrar "and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become 18 and become eligible to vote, that they vote."

Precise words, starting about 21:30 here: “I think the other key is the schools. We actually have a state law that requires every public and private high school in the state of Texas to have an actual voter registrar in campus and part of their responsibility is to make sure that when children become 18 and become eligible to vote, that they vote.”

Meant to say "register" to vote oh well I was close

What's interesting is that even though this has been part of our Texas Election Code not too many folks seem to be aware of it. Not to mention, it's a lost opportunity to ensure we are encouraging and graduating civically-minded and responsible young adults.

Thanks!
