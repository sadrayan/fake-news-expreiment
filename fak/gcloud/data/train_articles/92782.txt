Jolly and Graham introduce bipartisan legislation to extend Gulf oil drilling ban
U.S. Reps. David Jolly, a Republican, and Gwen Graham, a Democrat, have introduced legislation to extend the ban on oil drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico through 2027, adding five years to an existing moratorium.

The effort, called the Preserving Florida’s Coastal Communities Act, matches a bill Sen. Bill Nelson already introduced and reflects growing concern about drilling as oil-state lawmakers look to remove the ban.

“It is paramount that we take steps to continue protecting our pristine beaches, our fisheries, our marine sanctuaries, and coastal communities from the impact of drilling in the eastern Gulf and devastating events like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. An oil spill off the Coast of Pinellas County would be disastrous to our quality of life and our local economy. We must ensure that we do not put our Gulf Coast at greater risk by drilling closer to our shores,” Jolly said

The current ban on offshore drilling extends 125 miles off much of Florida’s Gulf of Mexico coast and as far as 235 miles in some areas. It expires in 2022.

“The panhandle knows all too well the devastating effects an oil spill can have on our state,” Graham said in a joint statement. “Keeping our Gulf waters and beaches free from drilling is vital to protecting our economy and military in North Florida.”
