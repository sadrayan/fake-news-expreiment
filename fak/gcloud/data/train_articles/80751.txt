State unions disavow "stick it to Walker"
Wisconsin AFL-CIO President Phil Neuenfeldt issued a statement Thursday afternoon disavowing any union connection to an effort to convince people to attach anti-Walker stickers to grocery items on May 1.

Neuenfeldt said:

"We have no knowledge beyond unevidenced assertions made to the media by the Wisconsin Grocers Association of any such campaign, but let's be crystal clear--there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations.

We have made clear all along that we see small business as a parner and ally in getting Wisconsin back to work. Right now, Wisconsin teachers, students, students, firefighters, small business owners and citizens everywhere are working side-by-side to demand our governor and legislature stop playing politics and start putting Wisconsin first."

Since I broke the story with my post Wednesday, links to the sticker downloads and photos of stickers on products at a store in New York have been disabled. The identity of the person or organization responsible for the web postings and an email urging participation remains unclear.

The Wisconsin Grocers Association earlier this week alerted its members to the possibility of the sticker campaign happening in local stores. Products from companies that are linked to donations to Gov. Scott Walker's campaign last fall are targeted.
