Orange Democratic Movement
Citizens Democracy requires responsible citizens who can make sound decisions about their future, and can act on these decisions. ODM supporters have shown through the years that they are ready to make sound and critical decisions that have propelled our country forward.

Communities Democracy requires a community, or a society of citizens, that can work together. In ODM, we have proven that though separated by language, culture and geography, communities in Kenya can come together and work together to overcome the worst dictatorships. By community we don’t mean the colonial construct known as “tribes” but people, regardless of ethnic extractions, who identify with the national challenges of the day and join in others to agitate for solutions.
