The claim is essentially correct.

For a variety of reasons, it can be difficult to get complete information on which countries pay for the performance right. Iran and North Korea do not currently pay. China is a bit more ambiguous right now; there may have been a deal struck. We've also gotten some conflicting information on Afghanistan and Rwanda. Let me check in with my own sources and i'll get back to you quickly with what I find out, as well as some context on why we're so out of step with the rest of the developed world.
