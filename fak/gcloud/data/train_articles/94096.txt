The Points of Light Institute has sold its MissionFish subsidiary to eBay for $4.5 million. The deal closed April 30 and took effect May 1. MissionFish, for now, will remain in Washington, D.C.



MissionFish and eBay have been working together since 2003, according to Meridith Rentz, chief operating officer at the Points of Light Institute in Atlanta.



MissionFish allows eBay sellers to give proceeds from sales to a favorite nonprofit, and helps nonprofits raise funds by selling on eBay. Nonprofits can also receive donations from eBay users through the Donate Now feature, which lets anyone with a PayPal account donate to nonprofits right away. And, it is administrator of eBay Giving Works.



MissionFish has operations in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. It derives its income through a deduction from donated funds processed. The eBay community raised $54.8 million for U.S. and U.K. nonprofits in 2010, according to eBay. A donation was made every 24 seconds through eBay Giving Works, raising more than $91 every minute. Overall, donations were up 7 percent in 2010, compared to 2009_.



Total revenue for MissionFish from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2010 was $60,157,582. In terms of funds raised, during the past eight years MissionFish collected more than $241 million in the United States and the U.K. For fiscal year 2010, the total revenue was $17.6 million. Of that, more than $13 million was distributed to charities, according to the Points of Light Institute.



The average donation through the eBay Giving Works program was $4.01 and there are more than 650,000 charity items in the marketplace.



MissionFish was launched in 2000 as an online exchange where nonprofits could accept in-kind gifts, keep anything useful, and sell the rest.
