The House voted 108-2 to approve additional regulations for aspiring hemp growers.

Lawmakers made industrial hemp a legal crop last year, but a regulatory commission must still be developed before farmers can plant the first seeds.

The bill would add four more people to the five-member Industrial Hemp Commission charged with developing a permitting process for hemp farms. It adds law enforcement to the hemp permitting process, requiring the new commission to notify the State Bureau of Investigation, sheriffâ€™s departments and police about the location of all approved hemp farms. Those agencies would be allowed to inspect hemp operations at any time, and farmers would be required to maintain production records.

An amendment added to the bill Monday night would limit the amount of land that can be used for hemp farming. In the first year of the program, each farmer would be limited to 50 acres of hemp, with a cap of 2,500 acres statewide.
