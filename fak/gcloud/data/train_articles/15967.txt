Emails, Robert Bernstein, public affairs specialist, Media Relations, Public Information Office, U.S. Census Bureau, Sept. 28 and 30, 2015

8:54 a.m.

We have estimates in the American Community Survey for domestic inmigration, domestic outmigration, and international inmigration for states. Those estimates for 2014 can be found in the state-to-state migration table (http://www.census.gov/hhes/migration/data/acs/state-to-state.html).

Domestic inmigration for Texas can be found in cell H68

Domestic outmigration in cell DA10

International inmigration in cell DS68

So according to the 2014 American Community Survey (just released the week before last), 538,572 moved from a different state into Texas during the previous year; another 217,392 moved into Texas from abroad; and 435,107 left Texas for a different state over the period.

Thanks again. These are not calendar-year tallies, correct?

Also, the bureau does not account for individuals leaving for other countries, correct? How much of an adjustment should typically be made to account for them?

Anything else of interest?

No, these data come from the 2014 American Community Survey, which collected data on a rolling basis all throughout the year; the statistics are based on answers to the question "Where did this person live 1 year ago?" For some people, this period could be January-January, for others, April to April, and so forth.

We don't collect data on international outmigration.

Thanks. What's the update date for the 2013 numbers and what was the update date for the 2014 numbers?

11:12 a.m.

The 2014 numbers were released on Sept. 17, 2015. The 2013 numbers were released in Sept. 2014 (I believe on the 18th.)

These are ACS numbers, correct?

I am wondering if we should use them mindful the bureau cautions against citing this source--one-year American Community Survey results--for population counts. “In general, use ACS to obtain population characteristics (percents, means, medians, and rates) rather than estimates of population totals,” the bureau says.

Guidance?

These are indeed ACS numbers.

The Population Estimates Program does produce the official estimates for the population (and housing units) of states, but these are estimates of migration/geographic mobility and not the total population.

Either source should be used, but because of differences in reference period, methodology, etc., extreme caution should be taken when using both. Users should pick one or the other.

I take you to be saying: the key thing is not to mix figures from the population estimates with the ACS results.

Is that what you mean?

Yes, that's correct.
