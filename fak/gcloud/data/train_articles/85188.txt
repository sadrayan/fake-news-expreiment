The 2016 Congressional District Map reflects Session Law 2016-1, which is now under review by the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. Individual voting records will not be updated to include the new congressional district information until after the March Primary Election. A separate primary will be held on June 7 for the U.S. House of Representatives pursuant to Session Law 2016-2.
