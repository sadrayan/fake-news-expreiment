U.S. Exports Reach All-Time High of $191.2 Billion in June

Exports Up 41.5 Percent Since 2009

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The United States exported a record $191.2 billion of goods and services in June 2013, according to trade data was released today by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Commerce Department.

U.S. exports in June 2013 reached an all-time high, exceeding the previous record of $188.7 billion set in December 2012. The June export level is also 2.2 percent higher than that of the previous month.

"Today's announcement of record-level U.S. exports in June is a testament to the strength of American exports. Increased exports mean more jobs here at home – the goal of President Obama's National Export Initiative. We at Ex-Im Bank work every day to help American exporters and their workers succeed in selling their products and services in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," said Ex-Im Bank Chairman and President Fred P. Hochberg.



Exports of goods and services over the past twelve months totaled $2.2 trillion, which is 41.5 percent above the level of exports in 2009. Exports have been growing at an annualized rate of 10.4 percent when compared to the same period in 2009.



Over the last twelve months, among the major export markets (i.e., markets with at least $6 billion in annual imports of U.S. goods), the countries with the largest annualized increase in U.S. goods purchases, when compared to 2009, occurred in Panama (28.6 percent), United Arab Emirates (23.1 percent), Russia (22.6 percent), Peru (21.9 percent), Chile (21.4 percent), Colombia (19.5 percent), Hong Kong (19.2 percent), Argentina (18.5 percent), South Africa (18.3 percent) and Venezuela (18.1 percent).
