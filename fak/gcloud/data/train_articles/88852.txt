The Senate Judiciary Committee is pulling back from plans to subpoena Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the firm that helped commission the salacious, disputed dossier on President Donald Trump’s alleged connections to Russia, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead, Simpson is expected to be allowed to testify privately.

The initial plan for Simpson to testify in the open had raised the specter of public testimony about the dossier's seamy and contested claims of sexual misconduct and a years-long Kremlin conspiracy to boost Trump.

Separately, a person close to the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation said former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort will meet with that panel in the next 48 hours and has agreed to provide notes of a now-controversial meeting at Trump Tower last year with a Kremlin-linked lawyer.

The Senate Judiciary Committee, however, has issued a subpoena for Manafort to publicly testify at its hearing on Wednesday.
