Introduction

The National Bureau of Statistics, formerly known as Southern Sudan Centre for Census, Statistics and Evaluation (SSCCSE) is the official statistical agency of the Government of South Sudan. It is mandated by the Transitional Constitution to collect, analyse and disseminate all official economic, social and demographic statistics.

Under the provisions of the CPA and the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan, SSCCSE was assigned responsibility for conducting the Southern Sudan section of the 5th Sudan Population and Housing Census in 2008. While the 2008 Census remains the largest undertaking by the SSCCSE, it has carried out other large nationally representative surveys, most notably the 2006 and 2010 rounds of the Sudan Household Health Survey (SHHS) and the National Baseline Household Survey (NBHS), 2009. It has also carried out other statistical activities as evidenced by the publication of the annual statistical yearbooks in 2009 and 2010.
