Rio Olympics 2016: Fehaid Al-Deehani wins first independent gold
The IOC flag was raised and the Olympic anthem played during the medal ceremony for Fehaid Al-Deehani's shooting gold

Shooter Fehaid Al-Deehani has become the first person to win an Olympic gold medal as an independent athlete.

He was unable to represent his native Kuwait at Rio 2016 after its Olympic body was suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Al-Deehani, 49, beat Italy's Marco Innocenti 26-24 in the final of the double trap shooting event.

The IOC banned Kuwait in October 2015 citing domestic laws that permit government interference in sports.

During the medal ceremony the Olympic flag was raised and the Olympic anthem played.

"That was for my country, for the people who don't want us to participate in the Olympics," he said. "I'm showing them that we are here and we got the medal."

Appearing in his sixth Olympics, Al-Deehani, an army officer and one of eight independent athletes at the Games, had turned down the chance to carry the IOC flag at the opening ceremony.

He won bronze in the event at the 2000 Sydney Games, and another bronze in single trap at London 2012 while competing for Kuwait.

It was the first medal for an independent athlete since the 1992 Barcelona Games.

Great Britain's Steven Scott beat compatriot Tim Kneale to win the bronze medal in the same event.
