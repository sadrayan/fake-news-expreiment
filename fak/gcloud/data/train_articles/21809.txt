Additional Trend Information



Government corruption is a "very serious" problem in New York State today, 56 percent of voters say - the highest number ever on this point - while another 31 percent say it's "somewhat serious," according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.





New York State voters say 50 - 38 percent that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the State Legislature will not take steps to improve ethics in state government in 2016. In fact, voters say 48 - 36 percent, current elected officials are incapable of ending political corruption and all should be voted out of office so new officials can start with a clean slate.





Gov. Cuomo gets a 50 - 40 percent job approval rating, similar to his 51 - 38 percent score in an April 4 survey by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University. Only 13 percent of voters give him an A grade for his job as governor. Other grades are:

33 percent - B

26 percent - C

13 percent - D

13 percent - F

"Throw out everyone in Albany, say almost half of New Yorkers. Voters don't think that the current crowd is capable of cleaning up corruption," said Quinnipiac University Poll Assistant Director Maurice Carroll.





"Almost nine-tenths of voters think corruption is a serious New York problem. And, although they give Gov. Andrew Cuomo OK job-approval numbers overall, lots of them think that on corruption he's part of the problem."





When it comes to corruption, Cuomo is part of the problem, 48 percent of voters say, while 36 percent say he is part of the solution.





Voters also say 78 - 15 percent that elected officials convicted of a felony should lose their pensions. Support is 67 percent or higher among every listed group.





New York State voters approve 49 - 23 percent of the job State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is doing and approve 39 - 18 percent of the job State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli is doing.





Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara gets a 40 - 18 percent approval rating.





"They still haven't made U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, the main scourge of corrupt legislators, a household name. But he's getting there," Carroll said.





Upstate Economy





Gov. Cuomo's efforts to improve the upstate New York economy will be successful, 38 percent of voters say, while 39 percent say it will not be successful.





Upstate voters say 53 - 34 percent the effort will fail.





A total of 41 percent of voters say the statewide economy is "excellent" or "good," while 57 percent say it is "not so good" or "poor."





Upstate, no voters say the economy is "excellent," while 29 percent say it is "good." Another 40 percent say the economy is "not so good" and 28 percent say it is "poor."





Only 21 percent of voters statewide say the economy is getting better, while 29 percent say it is getting worse and 47 percent say it is the same. Upstate results are similar.





"The governor's ballyhooed plans to boost the upstate economy have come under various investigations and voters split on whether or not the effort is working," Carroll said.





"Upstate voters give the recovery plans a big thumbs down."





From July 13 - 17, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,104 New York State voters, with a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and the nation as a public service and for research.
