Moran Statement on $1.2 Billion in Premium Savings from Obamacare
Washington, DC – Congressman Jim Moran, Northern Virginia Democrat, applauded the Department of Health and Human Service’s (HHS) new report released today showing that 6.8 million consumers have saved an estimated $1.2 billion on health insurance premiums in 2012 due to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

“Rising health care costs have handicapped consumers and choked family budgets. Thankfully that growth has been reined in through the Affordable Care Act (ACA),” said Rep. Moran. “The rate review provision, which has been responsible for these savings, prevents insurance companies from unfairly raising consumers’ premiums in order to simply pad their bottom lines.”

New federal rate review rules under the ACA require insurance companies to submit any proposed health insurance premium greater than 10 percent for federal approval. This provision was put in place in 2011.

The ACA also requires insurance companies to devote 80 percent of premium dollars to health care, not administrative costs or overhead. Last year, to comply with the 80 percent threshold companies lowered premium costs by $3.4 billion. Companies in violation returned an additional $500 million to consumers.

This issue, and many others related to the ACA, will be discussed at the Congressman’s upcoming community forum entitled “Navigating the Affordable Care Act: Making Health Reform Work for You and Your Family” on September 16th at 7:00PM at TC Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia.
