Subject: Seeking detail for a fact-check, Austin reporter

As I mentioned on the phone to Darrel Petry, I write on behalf of the Austin American-Statesman and the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project.

In this instance, we seek the El Paso Police Department’s perspective, including relevant data, on a claim we’re trying to fact-check. In this commentary, Paul Sperry of the New York Post credits the completion of fencing near El Paso in 2010 for driving down crime in El Paso. Sperry writes: “Before 2010, federal data show the border city was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. El Paso since then has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics.”

Is all of this accurate per the department’s data and experience? If not, what would be accurate and why? Any other considerations?

I’d be happy to hear back by email or phone. We count on attributable on-the-record responses for our stories.

Thanks for a quick reply,

g.
