Man accused of trying to light sex offenders on fire, deputies say
The Orange-Osceola State Attorney's Office last week formally charged a 50-year-old man accused of trying to kill sex offenders by lighting them on fire at a Kissimmee-area motel in March, documents show.

Osceola County Sheriff’s deputies were called around 5:15 p.m. March 7 to a disturbance to the Friendly Village Inn at 2550 E. US 192 near Kissimmee.

Two victims who were in a room said Jorge Porto-Sierra ran up to their door with a red gas can in his hand, according to the affidavit. The victims said Porto-Sierra was screaming “You’re going to die child molester,” the affidavit said.

He began pouring gasoline at the door, broke a window and dumped more gas inside the room, the affidavit said.

The two victims escaped through a back window, fearing for their lives, according to the report.

Porto-Sierra then attacked two people in a car, prosecutors allege. He rammed their vehicle three times with his car, got out and poured gasoline inside, the affidavit said.

Porto-Sierra admitted to the acts and said “they raped kids … they deserve to die,” the report said.

When the deputy asked him why he didn’t light the car and room on fire, he replied “because you got here too soon,” the report said.

Records show three of the victims are sex offenders.

Porto-Serra faces a slew of charges, including attempted murder, false imprisonment and burglary.

He’s at the Osceola County Jail without bond.
