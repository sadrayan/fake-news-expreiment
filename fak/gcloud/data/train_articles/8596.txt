We Found Where Donald Trump's "Black Crimes" Graphic Came From
Straight out of the white supremacist fever swamp

So today, this happened. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (yes, him again) re-tweeted the following blatantly racist graphic:

Not only is this racist, it’s completely false. These statistics are made up out of thin air, and the source — the “Crime Statistics Bureau” in San Francisco — simply does not exist.

Here are the actual statistics from a real source, the FBI:

Whites killed by blacks 15% Whites killed by whites 82% Blacks killed by blacks 91% https://t.co/m2S3HzGdvW https://t.co/QJMOAnD4u8 — Justin Miller (@justinjm1) November 22, 2015

So let’s recap. The leading candidate for the Republican Party’s nomination for president is tweeting absolute nonsense with a blatantly racist slant.

But where did this graphic come from? My first thought was that it must have originated at a white supremacist website like Stormfront, because it really is that bad. But neither Google Image search nor tineye.com found it posted at any websites. Google Images did, however, find the earliest tweet in which this horrible racist image appeared:

(I saved a screenshot in case it suddenly goes missing.)

UPDATE: Sure enough, it went missing, so here’s that screenshot:

Here’s the bio of the person who posted it:

Notice that he’s an admirer of Hitler:

Should have listened to the Austrian chap with the little moustache.

And his avatar, that looks like a modified swastika, is the symbol of the neo-Nazi German Faith Movement.

So there you have it. Donald Trump is posting racist imagery that comes directly from neo-Nazis.

I hope you’re not surprised that a guy like Donald Trump, who continually spouts fascist rhetoric, is attracted to fascist memes posted by neo-Nazis. This is where the right wing has ended up in 2015.
