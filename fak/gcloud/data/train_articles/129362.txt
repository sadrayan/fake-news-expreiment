Cleveland police chief: Isaiah Crowell apologized for Instagram post
One day after Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell posted a controversial photo on Instagram, Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said Crowell apologized.

Williams told media during a Republican National Convention related meeting that Crowell apologized to him. Williams said Crowell was "contrite and apologetic."

Crowell posted a photo of a man cutting the throat of a police officer to his Instagram account:

C'mon Isaiah Crowell..... You're a professional athlete. No need to fuel with garbage like this. #NFL #Browns pic.twitter.com/sa0MN2Ncs2 â€” Paul Maland (@PaulMalandNFL) July 11, 2016

The photo was quickly deleted.

Crowell issued an apology through the Browns Monday evening, noting the past week was emotional and difficult with all of the violence occurring across the country.
