Said a visible shaken Jameel Mendoza after watching an advanced screening of Stephen Kings New Movie IT.

A packed theatre in Haddonfield, New York watched an advanced screening of IT and they had to cut the movie short after several people were so horrified they passed out and went into cardiac arrest.

“I don’t know what it is but that ain’t no clown, they definitely gave it the right name “IT” cuz a clown it’s not!” — Movie Goer

Scientist Frederick Bookman gave a statement saying:

Unfortunately, movies are not just entertainment, but a way to attack your consciousness. This movie could have triggered the brain by those images, they are powerful too, and their body had a natural response to terror. Fight or flight. And sadly it was flight. So please be careful when you looking for entertainment in movies like IT. And please dont take the your children, talking about ” we use to watch this when we was little”. Guard your consciousness folks.

We will update you as we get more info as there have been similar cases in several other theaters across the country and the movie has been banned.
