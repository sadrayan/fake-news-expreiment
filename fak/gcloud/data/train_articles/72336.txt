Caliber Biotherapeutics
MedCare Investment Funds

MedCare and its affiliated entities manage approximately $1 billion in assets, the substantial majority of which are related to the medical and healthcare services industry. When capital needs require more than one investor, MedCare may act as the lead investor in capital syndications. Because the fund is committed to both capital appreciation and long-term business growth, it may invest in companies in any stage of development, including joint ventures and fully integrated enterprises. MedCare is privately owned and financed and has the flexibility to make crucial venture decisions without the influence of outside investors or the public equity market.
