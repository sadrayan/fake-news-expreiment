Hitching Post pressing forward with federal lawsuit against Coeur d'Alene
DESPITE BEING TOLD THEY WON'T HAVE TO PERFORM SAME

SEX WEDDINGS, A COEUR D'ALENE MARRIAGE CHAPEL IS GOING

AHEAD WITH A FEDERAL LAWSUIT.

THE HITCHING POST WANTS THE CITY TO PAY THEM FOR WAGES

LOST DURING THE TIME THEY THOUGHT THE CITY WAS GOING

TO FORCE THEM TO PERFORM WEDDINGS.

FROM OUR NORTH IDAHO NEWSROOM...

KXLY 4'S CAITI CURREY IS WORKING FOR YOU WITH THE

SAME-SEX DEBATE NOW PLAYING OUT IN COURT.

the hitching post made their stance on gay marriage

very clear last year when the initial ban was overturned.

Last May they told me they will close their doos if

they are forced to perform same sex marriages Almost

a year later they are in the midst of a legal battle

with the city of coeur d'alene saying the city is

violating their religious freedom.

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT.

A RIGHT HITCHING POST OWNERS DON AND EVELYN KNAPP

BELIEVE IS IN JEOPARDY WITH IDAHO NOW ALLOWING SAME

SEX MARRIAGES.

W7 26

The bible is pretty clear that homosexuality is not

his way and therefore i cannot unite people in a way

that would conflict with what the bible teaches.

THAT WAS DON LAST MAY WHEN THE COURT DECISION WAS

FIRST ANNOUNCED.

THEY FILED A CLAIM IN FEDERAL COURT, SAYING THE CITY

COULDN'T FORCE THEM TO PERFORM THE MARRIAGES.

EVEN SHUTTING DOWN FOR SEVERAL DAYS - SAYING THEY

WERE AFRAID THEY'D BE ARRESTED.

BUT THE CITY AGREED WITH THEIR POSITION - AND, SAID

THE HITCHING POST WAS NON-PROFIT AND THEREFORE, EXEMPT.

BUT, THAT DIDN'T END THE FIGHT.

THE HITCHING POST NOW WANTS THE CITY TO PAY THEM FOR

THE DAYS THE CHAPEL SHUT DOWN - EVEN THOUGH THEY DID

SO BY CHOICE.

THE BUSINESS ALSO SAYS IT LOST CUSTOMERS AND RECEIVED

HATE MAIL BECAUSE OF OUR STORY AND OTHER MEDIA ATTENTION.

RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION

NEVER THREATENED ANY LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE HITCHING

POST, NOR DOES IT INTEND TO DO SO.

THE CITY FILED FOR A SECOND TIME TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT

ON MONDAY, BUT WAS DENIED.
