Cuyahoga County executive front-runner Ed FitzGerald helped close a deal for which Jimmy Dimora was bribed, federal prosecutors say
CLEVELAND, Ohio â€” Lakewood Mayor Ed FitzGerald, a top contender to be the first Cuyahoga County executive, helped close a deal for which Dimora had been bribed, federal prosecutors say.



FitzGerald has not been charged with a crime. Charges filed Wednesday against Dimora say that in March 2008 the county commissioner telephoned FitzGerald on behalf of businessman William Neiheiser, who wanted to lease Lakewood's ice rink. Neiheiser had phoned the mayor, but FitzGerald had not returned the call.

"He wants to make a proposal to you ... that he thinks will be advantageous to the city and to you if you wanted to talk to him," Dimora told FitzGerald, according to a transcript included in the 139-page indictment against Dimora, Neiheiser and others.

FitzGerald, a former FBI agent, obliged.

"I'll make time ... I'll make time to talk to him," he replied.

Less than two months later, Dimora and Neiheiser each gave $250 to FitzGerald's campaign, records show. In June 2008, at FitzGerald's urging, the Lakewood City Council unanimously agreed to lease its Winterhurst ice rink to a Neiheiser company. FitzGerald said he sought and considered other proposals, but Neiheiser's was the only one that council members reviewed.

"We took the mayor's word on it, which we often do," said Council President Kevin Butler. "There's no reason to disbelieve him on it."

The charges do not accuse FitzGerald of wrongdoing or identify him by name. But the Democrat acknowledged Wednesday that he is the elected municipal leader prosecutors refer to as Public Official 14.

FitzGerald, who worked on an organized crime squad years ago in the FBI's Chicago office, added that agents have interviewed him about Dimora's phone call and the Winterhurst deal.

"Their remarks to me directly were that there was no doubt whatsoever that I conducted myself in this matter exactly as a public official should," FitzGerald said in a phone interview.

FBI spokesman Scott Wilson declined to comment on FitzGerald's assertions.

Neiheiser's Ice Land USA pays the city about $75,000 a year in rent. The businessman is accused of bribing Dimora with, among other things, free home improvements in exchange for favors.

For FitzGerald, the timing of the revelation couldn't be worse. Last week, he won the Democratic primary for county executive, a powerful new position that voters ordered to replace the three commissioners. The vote was seen as a referendum on corruption in county government.

In telephone interviews Wednesday, FitzGerald defended the deal with Neiheiser as one that helped Lakewood cut its losses on a money-losing operation. City leaders had contemplated closing the rink.

Public discussions about leasing out Winterhurst began before Dimora's phone call, FitzGerald said. But he added that the city did not solicit specific ideas until hearing from Neiheiser, who pledged to spend $1 million on improvements.

Lakewood's codified ordinances exempt real estate transactions from competitive bidding. Even so, FitzGerald said, "I still felt that it was appropriate to seek other proposals."

Yet FitzGerald and his law director, Nora Hurley, said they could not remember how many vendors were invited to submit plans. They identified one other proposal, from Canton's Center Ice Sports Complex. That pitch did not include a pledge to pay for needed improvements.

"I don't second-guess the propriety of the decision for a minute," FitzGerald said.

Hurley could not locate a copy of the rival plan Wednesday. A Center Ice executive did not return a telephone call seeking comment.

Neiheiser's attorney, Bob Rotatori, said the Winterhurst deal was clean.

"He spent over $2 million refurbishing that facility," said Rotatori, whose client has pleaded not guilty. "You don't bribe someone to spend $2 million."

FitzGerald said the phone call from Dimora had no affect on any decision regarding the ice rink.

"I had the misfortune of taking my one and only phone call from Jimmy Dimora, and it lasted 30 seconds," he said. "He's a sitting county commissioner. I wasn't going to hang up."

Fitzgerald said the federal government does not allege he did anything wrong in the Dimora indictment. He said he is a witness to the crime, not a participant in it.

He said he commissioned a review of the Winterhurst deal after he learned that Neiheiser was under investigation, and the review found that the city had benefited by hundreds of thousands of dollars by signing the contract. No wrongdoing was found, Fitzgerald said.

Eventually, Fitzgerald said, he bundled Neiheiser's and Dimora's donations along with others from corruption probe figures and wrote a check to charity. He also denied that the campaign cash from Dimora and Neiheiser had influence over his decision to pursue the deal with Ice Land USA.

"I used to investigate this stuff for a living," he said. "I'm the last person on the planet who would do something like that."
