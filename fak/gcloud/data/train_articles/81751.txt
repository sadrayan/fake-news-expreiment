TEXAS - You may have seen an article that claims that Texas native Lance Armstrong has died.

No need to worry. He's definitely still alive.

An article from fox-news24.com said that, according to his daughter "Anna Armstrong," he died on Wednesday.

Armstrong, however, does not have a daughter by that name.

The man himself also posted a video on Instagram of himself holding his smartphone with the fox-news24.com article pulled up:

"The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated." - Mark Twain A post shared by Lance Armstrong (@lancearmstrong) on May 12, 2017 at 9:07am PDT

So, we can definitely verify that Armstrong is very much alive and the rumors of his death are false.
