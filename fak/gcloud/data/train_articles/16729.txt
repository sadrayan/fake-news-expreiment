On behalf of the Austin newspaper and the PolitiFact Texas fact-checking project, I seek the latest available data—perhaps covering all of 2016 or covering much of 2017--showing the prevalence of keys left in vehicles stolen, for Texas alone and for the nation. We’re checking a claim that nearly half of vehicles stolen in Texas each year have the keys left inside.

So readers know, we seek information that’s both directly attributable and on the record. We don’t do background or off the record.

My deadline is today.

THANK YOU.
