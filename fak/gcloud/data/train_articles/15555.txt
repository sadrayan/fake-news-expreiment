The Senate Library passed along this information on civil rights related legislation of the 1930s and 40s. In the rare cases when bills came to a roll call vote, it appears that LBJ consistently voted against (either on the bill or to table [kill] a bill or motion). As I mentioned yesterday, most likely LBJ voted in favor of a civil rights bill for the first time in 1957.

“The House would pass an anti-lynching bill in 1937 and 1940 but, again, filibusters (threatened and carried out) kept the Senate from voting on either bill. Indeed, no anti-lynching bill of the 257 proposed between 1882-1951 ever reached a Senate vote”- from article in the Jackson Advocate by Barbara Harris (Vol. 65, No 19 pg 9A), “The Ku Klux Klan: From Fear, Anger, Poverty and Disenfranchisement Arose a Terrorist Group.”

1. April 15, 1937 Congressional Record vote on passage of H.R. 1507 page 3563 Johnson voted Nay
