ADL Statement on Whole Foods Market

New York, NY, August 4, 2011 ... The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has found no evidence to claims by some bloggers on the Internet that Whole Foods Market is "anti-Israel."

In particular, some have specifically criticized a Whole Foods seasonal promotion around halal foods that meet the company's high quality standards. Such criticism is misguided, inappropriate and contrary to American values. We live in a multicultural, multi-ethnic and multi-faith society.

Just as Whole Foods provides prepared food, recipes, and specialty items (including products imported from Israel) to Jewish customers for Passover and other holiday observances, it is entirely fitting for them to do the same for customers marking Muslim, Hindu and other religious festivals.

The Anti-Defamation League, founded in 1913, is the world's leading organization fighting anti-Semitism through programs and services that counteract hatred, prejudice and bigotry.
