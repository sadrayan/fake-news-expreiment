Congressman Lynn Westmoreland : Press Releases : Westmoreland Rejects President Obama's Iran Deal
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representative Lynn Westmoreland issued the following statement after he voted ‘no’ on H.R. 3461, a bill to approve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed at Vienna on July 14, 2015, relating to the nuclear program of Iran:

“We do not need to be negotiating with Iran - period. Iran is a dangerous nation that cannot be trusted and this deal only weakens the national security of our country and that of our allies – particularly Israel. Like many times before, President Obama is manipulating the system to get his way: presenting this to the American people as a ‘deal’ instead of what it really is –a treaty – to circumvent needing approval by Congress. President Obama and Secretary Kerry also showed a lack of leadership and strength in agreeing to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct. The administration put the ball in Iran’s hands, and it will forever be a huge mistake.

“I came to Congress to make our country and our world a safer and better place for my children and grandchildren, and this deal does not do either. Not only do I reject this agreement, but I reject the President’s secretive manipulation and the negotiations with Iran entirely.”

In addition to voting NO on H.R. 3461, the approval of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Rep. Westmoreland voted in support of H.R. 3460, which would prevent the President from ending the current sanctions against Iran.
