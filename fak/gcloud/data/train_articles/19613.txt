House Judiciary Committee
Washington, D.C.— House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) today announced a Committee investigation into allegations that Planned Parenthood abortion doctors altered abortion procedures in order to harvest the organs and body parts of aborted children for money.

The Committee’s investigation will focus on the inhumane acts detailed by an executive of Planned Parenthood in several reports and a video.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte issued the following statement:

Chairman Goodlatte: “Every human life is sacred and should be protected from the atrocities allegedly undertaken by Planned Parenthood. The House Judiciary Committee is investigating these horrific acts including ascertaining how Congress might act.

“The prospects of altering an abortion procedure in order to preserve intact the organs of aborted children, including their brains, reminds us yet again of the horrors of late-term abortions, and the need for the Senate to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.

“Members of the House Judiciary Committee have been committed to the preservation of human life, including the lives of unborn children. We will continue to fight for the rights of the unborn.”
