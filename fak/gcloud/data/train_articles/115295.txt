Boston Common was a sea of pink Saturday, as wall-to-wall crowds assembled for the Boston Women’s March.

Organizers say at least 100,000 people attended the equality rally, with some estimates swelling as high as 150,000. The crowd—which was heavily female and heavily white—came with signs, chants, and cheers on topics ranging from reproductive freedom to climate change. Many protested President Donald Trump.

A visibly impassioned Mayor Marty Walsh and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren drew the most enthusiasm from the crowd, stressing the need to organize and fight against discrimination and hate.

“We want Washington to hear what’s going on in Boston today,” Walsh yelled.

Other marches took place in hundreds of cities around the country and world Saturday. The Washington, DC, march attracted hundreds of thousands of demonstrators.

“We can whimper. We can whine. Or we can fight back!” Warren said in Boston.

Additional local speakers included Sen. Ed Markey, Attorney General Maura Healey, and about a dozen other activists and supporters.
