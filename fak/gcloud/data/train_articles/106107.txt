BREAKING: Ivanka Trump Is Finally Being FIRED From The White House — And It Has Trump In A RAMPAGE!
White House chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly furious with first daughter Ivanka Trump ‘s job performance within the administration, according to a recent report by CNN.

Sources revealed to the news network that Kelly thinks that Trump has failed to have an objective perspective on the first daughter and senior adviser to the president.

Kelly has reportedly explained to others privately that the first daughter is “playing government,” while branding her child tax credit as “a pet project.”

The shocking report comes after Trump’s trip to the closing Olympic ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea last week, which has raised concerns among several in the White House, including Kelly.

“This isn’t like going to Italy. The stakes are far higher and more complex,” a source close to President Trump explained to CNN.

Kelly reportedly expressed his worries behind closed doors about the first daughter’s utter lack of experience, however, the White House assured this past Monday that he was in support of her visit.

“General Kelly and General McMaster were supportive of the trip since the planning process began,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said to CNN. “We all thought it was a great success. Ivanka was a great representative for the administration.”

Ivanka Trump found herself under heavy scrutiny thus Monday after she stated during an interview with NBC that it was inappropriate to question her about the sexual misconduct allegations against her father, despite that fact that she serves as a senior adviser to the president.
