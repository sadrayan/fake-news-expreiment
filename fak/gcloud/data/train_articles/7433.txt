(NYSE: ANTM) today announced that second quarter 2017 net income was $855.3 million , or $3.16 per share. These results included net negative adjustment items of $0.21 per share. Net income in the second quarter of 2016 was $780.6 million , or $2.91 per share, which included net negative adjustment items of $0.42 per share. Excluding the items noted in each period, adjusted net income was $3.37 per share in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the adjusted net income of $3.33 per share in the prior year quarter (refer to the GAAP reconciliation table for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP”). “I am pleased with our second quarter 2017 results, carrying forward our operating momentum. Our commitment to improving the quality and affordability of health care for our customers is resonating in the marketplace and benefiting our shareholders," said Joseph Swedish, president and chief executive officer. “Our solid second quarter financial results reflect solid performance across our various business segments, which is reflected in our updated 2017 outlook,” said John Gallina , executive vice president and chief financial officer. CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS Membership: Medical enrollment totaled approximately 40.4 million members at June 30, 2017, an increase of 0.6 million members, or 1.6 percent, from 39.8 million at June 30, 2016. Commercial & Specialty Business enrollment increased by 389 thousand medical members as the Company experienced growth in both fully insured and self-funded Local Group businesses, partially offset by a decline in membership in the National Account and Individual businesses. Enrollment also grew by 193 thousand in the Medicaid business and 58 thousand in the Medicare business. Medical enrollment increased by 468 thousand during the first six months of 2017. Enrollment gains were primarily in the Local Group, Individual, and Medicare businesses. Operating Revenue: Operating revenue was $22.2 billion in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.9 billion , or 4.3 percent, versus the $21.3 billion in the prior year quarter. The growth in revenue reflected premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends across our business. Additionally, the increase was driven by higher enrollment in the Local Group insured and self-funded businesses, as well as in Medicaid and Medicare . These increases were partially offset by the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and less favorable adjustments to the prior year risk adjustment estimates. Benefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 86.1 percent in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 190 basis points from 84.2 percent in the prior year quarter. The increase, as expected, was largely driven by the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and less favorable adjustments to the prior year risk adjustment estimates. The increase was partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses. Medical claims reserves established at December 31, 2016 developed moderately better than the Company’s expectation during the first six months of 2017. Medical Cost Trend: For the full year 2017, the Company continues to expect underlying Local Group medical cost trend to be in the range of 6.5% - 7.0%. Days in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable (“DCP”) was 40.5 days as of June 30, 2017, a decrease of 0.1 days from 40.6 days as of March 31, 2017 . SG&A; Expense Ratio: The SG&A; expense ratio was 13.8 percent in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of 20 basis points from 14.0 percent in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease, as expected, was primarily driven by the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, the impact of operating expense efficiency initiatives taken by the company, and fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. The decrease was partially offset by higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals and the 2015 cyber attack litigation settlement recorded during the quarter. Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow was $393 million , or 0.5 times net income in the second quarter of 2017, and approximately $3.1 billion , or 1.7 times net income for the first six months of 2017. The Company continues to expect its full year 2017 operating cash flow to be greater than $3.5 billion . Share Repurchase Program: During the second quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares of its common stock for $0.5 billion , or a weighted-average price of $182.83 . During the first six months of 2017, the Company repurchased 2.8 million shares of its common stock for $0.5 billion , or a weighted average price of $180.37 . As of June 30, 2017 , the Company had approximately $3.7 billion of Board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining. Cash Dividend: During the second quarter of 2017, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $171.8 million . On July 25, 2017 , the Audit Committee declared a third quarter 2017 dividend to shareholders of $0.70 per share, an increase of $0.05 per share from the second quarter dividend. On an annualized basis, this equates to a dividend of $2.80 per share. The third quarter dividend is payable on September 25, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 8, 2017 . Investment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the second quarter of 2017, the Company recorded net realized gains on financial instruments totaling $16.2 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $7.2 million . During the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded net realized gains of $12.5 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $25.7 million . As of June 30, 2017, the Company’s net unrealized gain position in the investment portfolio was $846.3 million , consisting of net unrealized gains on equity and fixed maturity securities totaling $450.5 and $395.8 million , respectively.

It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management (refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables).

These statements include, but are not limited to: financial projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions; statements regarding plans, objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services; and statements regarding future performance. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking statements.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof.
