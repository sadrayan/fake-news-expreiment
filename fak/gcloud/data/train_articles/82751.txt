Non-Fatal Officer Involved Shootings

LVMPD is committed to being transparent and accountable in the use of deadly force by our officers. As a part of this effort, for the year beginning 2012, LVMPD will be releasing reports for non-fatal shootings similar to the way LVMPD releases reports in events resulting in death.

In many non-fatal officer involved shootings, there are related criminal charges pending. In those cases LVMPD cannot jeopardize the judicial process by releasing related reports until such time as it is determined that release of the reports will not affect a pending criminal matter. LVMPD will monitor the status of the open criminal cases related to non-fatal officer involved shootings and will make reports available on the OIO website when they become public records. For this reason, LVMPD will not be releasing reports in chronological order. As with fatal events, LVMPD will be releasing the following two reports:

Force Investigation Team (FIT) Reports: The FIT Report contains all the evidence found by the investigating homicide detectives. These reports will be made available to you in their entirety with the exception of any information that is deemed confidential in nature.



Office of Internal Oversight (OIO) Review: The Office of Internal Oversight Review will consist of an internal review that covers key conclusions and outcomes of each use of deadly force incident. This review includes the findings of the Use of Force Review Board that is made up of both commissioned officers and citizens. The review will also include any changes or additions that were made to policy, procedure, tactics or training if it was necessary to do so as a result of each use of deadly force.
