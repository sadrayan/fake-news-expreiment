FDP Statement On In-State Tuition For Florida’s Dreamers

The Florida Democratic Party released the following statement on the in-state tuition bill which passed the Senate Education Appropriations Subcommittee earlier today:

“The fact that providing Florida’s undocumented students access to an affordable education remains controversial with Florida Senate Republicans shows just how out of touch their party is,” said Florida Democratic Party political director Christian Ulvert. "What Floridians saw today was a party torn between election-year pandering and their anti-Hispanic agenda. Despite weakening the bill to provide in-state tuition to Florida’s undocumented students, 5 Senate Republicans remained obstinate in their opposition to helping young Floridians realize their dreams. This debate has gone on long enough — it’s time for Florida Republicans to do what is right for Florida’s Hispanic Community.”
