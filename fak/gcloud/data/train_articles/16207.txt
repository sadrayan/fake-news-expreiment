Email (excerpted), Emmanuel Garcia, communications director, Texas Democratic Party, on behalf of Leticia Van de Putte campaign, Oct. 8, 2014

What I am confused about is "My opponent falsely attacks me to hide her failed record on illegal immigration."

However, Senator Van de Putte has an extensive record on human trafficking and has voted to increase border security funding. Dan Patrick voted against the 2013 budget which raised funding for border security through DPS.

Senator Van de Putte has a plan on immigration and border security, Patrick has nothing but a slogan.

It looks to me at this point that Patrick’s ad claims about Van de Putte’s record and statements hold up.

She did oppose the troops’ dispatch and was the Senate sponsor of the 2001 act.

Also, KGBT-TV in June 2014 quoted her calling for Congress to OK Obama’s $3.7 billion request, which included $295 million that would go to the State Department and other international programs to “support efforts to repatriate and reintegrate migrants to Central America, to help regional governments better control their borders and to address the underlying root causes driving migration, i.e. creating the economic, social, governance and citizen security conditions. Beyond initial assistance, continued funding for repatriation and reintegration activities will be contingent on sustained progress and cooperation by the Central American countries.” We noticed this White House “fact sheet.”

Anything else to consider?
