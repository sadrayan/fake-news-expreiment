John Kasich Replaces Rick Scott As Most Unpopular Governor In 2011
Public Policy Polling surveyed Florida voters and found 52 percent disapprove of Republican Gov. Rick Scott -- an improvement in his poll numbers that leaves Ohio Gov. John Kasich as the most unpopular governor the Democratic-leaning firm has polled in 2011.

Scott's favorability spread was 33/59 last June, and it improved to 36/52 in a survey conducted September 22-25. Independents thawed in their attitudes the governor, going from a 27/64 rating to 35/52.

Still, Scott would lose in a landslide if the election were held today, the poll finds. If his predecessor, Republican-turned-independent Charlie Crist, switched his affiliation to Democrat, he would beat the governor by a 51-38 margin. Alex Sink, the Democratic nominee whom he beat by one point in 2010, would win over Scott by a 52-41 margin. The good news for Scott is that he's not up for re-election until 2014.
