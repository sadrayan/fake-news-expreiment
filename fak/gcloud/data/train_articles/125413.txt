FACT CHECK: Black Trump Supporter Shot and Killed by Chicago Protesters
On 12 March 2016, the Christian Times Newspaper web site reported that a black supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had been shot and killed by political protesters at a chaotic rally for the GOP hopeful held in Chicago the previous day:

Christian Times Newspaper has learned that an African-American supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has died after allegedly sustaining gunshot wounds in the aftermath of Friday night’s chaos in Chicago. Robert King Bullock, aged 37, was a resident of Chicago’s Evanston suburb. According to Bullock’s friend, who also attended the Trump rally, Robert was an avid chef, and he recently obtained his Masters of Business Administration and planned to open a local restaurant. This source spoke with CTN on the condition of anonymity, and asked to be referred to as “Terry.” He called for Bullock’s death to serve as a reminder to anti-Trump groups and the mainstream media.



There was no truth to this story, however. The Christian Times Newspaper is not a legitimate source of news, but rather a site that mixes real political news items — most of which have little or nothing to do with the subject of Christianity — with clickbait fake news items (with the “Black Trump Supporter Shot and Killed by Chicago Protesters” story being one of the latter category).

The site’s disclaimer notes that Christian Times Newspaper content is not necessarily factual:
