Liberal Feminist Calls For Elderly People And Dementia Patients To Be Euthanized

Katie Hopkins, liberal British television personality who was on president Trump’s show The Apprentice, has said that old people should be euthanized because they are too much of a burden to society.

Hopkins has thought it all through – she said that we should create “euthanasia vans” that would go from door to door and collect elderly people. She said:

“We just have far too many old people. It’s ridiculous to be living in a country where we can put dogs to sleep but not people. Euthanasia vans – just like ice-cream vans – that would come to you home. It would all be perfectly charming. They might even have a nice little tune they’d play. I mean this genuinely. I’m super-keen on euthanasia vans. We need to accept that just because medial advances mean we can live longer, it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”

Hopkins also called for people with dementia to be euthanized, because she says there is no point in them taking up space in hospitals and care facilities. She says that in a way – their lives have no point because of their illness.

According to reports, it’s not the first time Hopkins says something like this. She recently posted a tweet about patients with dementia, openly mocking them:

“Babe I’m here again, I’m here again, where have you been. Babe I’m back again. I’m back again where have you been? Take that dementia style.”

She shouldn’t be even joking about serious stuff like these because one day soon enough, she herself will be an elderly woman with the possibility of having dementia.
