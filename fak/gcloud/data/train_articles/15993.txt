Gardner, currently nothing has changed about testing in grades 3-8. The legislature passed HB 866 that would reduce some testing for those grades. But because that conflicts with the requirements of No Child Left Behind, which requires us to test students in reading and math every year for grades 3-8, we have had to ask the U.S. Department of Education for a waiver. That waiver is still pending. Hereâ€™s a press release with more details. http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=25769806037&ekfxmen_noscript=1&ekfxmensel=e9edebdf8_620_628
