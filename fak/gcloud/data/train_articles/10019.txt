Average is not measurably different from the U.S.

Average is lower than the U.S. average

1 The international average reported here differs from that reported in Mullis et al. (2004) due to the deletion of England. In Mullis et al.,the reported international average is 467.

2 Met international guidelines for participation rates in 2003 only after replacement schools were included.

3 Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China.

4 National desired population does not cover all of the international desired population.

NOTE: Countries are ordered by 2003 average score. The test for significance between the United States and the international average was adjusted to account for the U.S. contribution to the international average. The tests for significance take into account the standard error for the reported difference. Thus, a small difference between the United States and one country may be significant while a large difference between the United States and another country may not be significant. Parentheses indicate countries that did not meet international sampling or other guidelines in 2003. Countries were required to sample students in the upper of the two grades that contained the largest number of 13-year-olds. In the United States and most countries, this corresponds to grade 8. See table A1 in appendix A for details.
