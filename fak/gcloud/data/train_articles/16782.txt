All of these entities seem to be banking their estimates on this item from NHTSA:

Seems to me that claiming 50% of vehicle thefts due exclusively to keys being left in the car is ignoring other behaviors included in “driver error” Still, there is no empirical data to support it.

Also, TXDMV wrongly interprets our ForeCAST report—the one I sent to you—with this line: “NICB’s data only covers insured vehicles, which would not be equal to the total number of vehicles reported stolen in a state” The data cited in that report is for all NCIC thefts regardless of insured or uninsured status.

The other document looks to be a rehash of recycled vehicle thefts stats that have been around for a while…not the language in our very own brochure (attached) which, btw, we have been providing free to law enforcement agencies around the nation for years.

This is all I could get. The 2016 and 2017 data was not yet distilled to produce the specific result you wanted. That said, here are the figures for the indicated years, Texas only, and be advised—these would be on the very low end since we have to rely on reporting officers indicating keys were a factor in the text field of each NCIC record. They don’t always provide that extra bit of information.
