HIV and Injection Drug Use
Overview

Sharing needles, syringes, and other injection equipment puts people who inject drugs (PWID) at high risk for getting HIV and other infections, including hepatitis. Annual HIV diagnoses among black and Hispanic/Latino PWID were cut in half between 2008â€“2014, but diagnoses among white PWID dropped by only 28%. One reason may be that fewer blacks and Hispanics/Latinos are sharing needles and syringes, while whites are more likely to share them. Syringe services programs (SSPs) can play a role in preventing HIV and other health problems among PWID. They provide access to sterile syringes and should also provide comprehensive services such as help with stopping substance misuse; testing and linkage to treatment for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C; education on what to do for an overdose; and other prevention services. State and local health departments can work with their lawmakers and law enforcement to make SSPs more available to PWID.

State and local health departments can:

Use data on HIV, hepatitis, substance use, and overdoses to determine where services are needed.

Work with law enforcement and local leaders to expand access to SSPs, where permitted by law.

Provide HIV and hepatitis testing and prevention services for PWID.

Ensure treatment is available for overdoses, HIV, hepatitis, and substance use disorder, and inform first responders about available resources.
