Should Trump Get Credit for Good Jobs Numbers?
The first monthly jobs report to reflect the state of the economy during the Trump presidency is quite good. There’s not much to dislike about the 235,000 jobs added in February, nor an unemployment rate that ticked down to 4.7 percent, nor an average hourly earnings rise of 0.2 percent.

And it comes on the heels of mostly good data across a range of indicators, including retail sales, industrial output and the number of people filing for jobless benefits.

But it’s not enough to enjoy some decent economic numbers. Invariably these things become politicized. The Drudge Report splashed “GREAT AGAIN: +235,000” on its landing page within seconds of the Labor Department release. President Trump retweeted, one presumes gleefully, a tweet making the same point.

So how much of the economic gains evident in the data does the Trump administration actually deserve credit for? The answer is more ambiguous than you might think — and boils down to your philosophy of how the economy works.
