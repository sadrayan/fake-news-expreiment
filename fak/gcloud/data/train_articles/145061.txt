Trump administration seeks to monitor social media of disability recipients, including vets
Donald Trump and Republicans loudly proclaim themselves to be champions of veterans, but time and time again, they underfund veteransâ€™ care and implement policies that undercut their public statements. Now the Trump administration is seeking to implement a particularly boneheaded policy of monitoring the social media of citizens who receive disability payments from the government. In short, if you are a veteran and you post a photo of yourself enjoying life, the government can then determine you do not need to receive disability payments for things like post-traumatic stress disorder.
