For Travelers
Measles is still common in other countries

Measles remains a common disease in many parts of the world. Each year around the world, an estimated 10 million people get measles, and about 110,000 of them die from it.

In the United States, most of the measles cases result from international travel. The disease is brought into the United States by unvaccinated people who get infected in other countries. Typically 2 out of 3 of these unvaccinated travelers are Americans. They can spread measles to other people who are not protected against measles, which sometimes leads to outbreaks.
