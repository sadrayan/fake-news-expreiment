Politics, Inc.: Principle, not profit: why we need statesmen, not career politicians: John Cox: 9781425936136: Amazon.com: Books
Politics, Inc - career politicians have turned politics into a business and the result is not good - excessive partisanship, gridlock and a lack of reasonable solutions to our problems. In Washington, D.C., the money chase is on and statesmen are nowhere to be found. Many books preaching about how to fix politics and public policy come from...the very people who burdened us with the defective politics and public policy in the first place. Among them are self-serving politicians seeking the approval of a public they don't respect. They perceive the public as simple folk that desperately need a lesson in the complexities, subtleties and merits of public policy that isn't their interest. They also are the inbred media, who, writing for each other, aren't interested in or understand what's really happening at your home, at your job or in your mind. And what's on their mind is the fear that government one day might fall into the hands of "amateurs"-namely, you, the American public. So, when a book comes along from someone who isn't rationalizing and justifying his role in messing up America, you've got a real find. In Politics, Inc., John Cox sketches with the passion and clarity of a Ronald Reagan a blueprint for national prosperity, health, security and well being, with you in mind. Here is a recipe from someone who is neither a career politician nor a pundit. It is from someone who has been tested in the real world of the free market, and succeeded. It is written for people who have had enough of career politicians, and who would appreciate the insight that someone not caught up in the trap of Washington politics can contribute. This book is for those interested in returning to what the Founding Fathers intended to bequeath us: a nation not of self-serving career politicians, but of self-governing citizens.
