Do lemons and lemon juice cure cancer?

There is a popular myth about lemons and lemon juice being able to cure cancer that is making the rounds of the internet. The myth is so popular even Snopes.com responded, stating that the email message is a mixture of true and false information.

There is some truth involved in the creation of this myth, based on a few recent studies. These studies indicate that citrus fruits, including lemons, contains compounds that may be beneficial in preventing or combating some types of cancer.

However, the myth significantly exaggerates the potential of lemons and lemon juice as a cancer remedy. The beneficial compounds in lemon juice have shown promise in recent studies, but the levels found in foods may only enhance the body’s ability to fight off cancer. In the end, there is no proven scientific replacement for radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

If you are diagnosed with any type of cancer, “you need to continue to eat a healthy diet,” states Michelle Morgan, Clinical Dietician. Don’t be taken in with fad diets or “anti-cancer” food claims. Follow the treatment recommendations from your cancer treatment team. And if you are cancer free, then eating healthy foods may help reduce your chances of getting certain types of cancer in the future.
