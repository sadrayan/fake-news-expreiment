WisPolitics.com: Rep. Kessler: Statement re: LRB-0894
2/19/2013Dear Colleagues After receiving feedback from constituents and colleagues regarding the circulation of a preliminary bill draft pertaining to firearm ammunition, State Representatives Kessler, Barnes, Goyke and Senator Harris have contacted the Legislative Reference Bureau to request that revisions be made to LRB-0894 that would remove any conflicts of law and provide exemptions that honor our states great sporting heritage.LRB-0894 was never intended to conflict with current laws or codes related to Wisconsins rich hunting tradition and those who annually participate in it. We do however believe that our state needs to have a serious and meaningful conversation about gun violence. While the initial draft contained unintended oversights, our intention was to provide protection to future victims of gun violence from ammunition that has a devastating impact on innocent civilians and law enforcement officials.We will be working with the Legislative Reference Bureau, Legislative Council, and the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that any future bill drafts are consistent with current sporting and hunting regulations.We represent districts plagued by gun violence. It is our duty as representatives to seek an end to such tragic violence. We believe there is room for consensus and compromise on the issue of gun violence.We welcome the coming debate and appreciate the feedback we have received from our fellow legislative colleagues and the constituents we represent.FREDERICK P. KESSLERState Representative12th Assembly District
