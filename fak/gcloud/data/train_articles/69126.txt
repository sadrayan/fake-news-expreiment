Water Use in the United States

The U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Use Science Project, a part of the National Water Census, is responsible for compiling and disseminating the nation's water-use data. The USGS works in cooperation with local, State, and Federal environmental agencies to collect water-use information. USGS compiles these data to produce water-use information aggregated at the county, state, and national levels. Every five years, data at the county level are compiled into a national water-use data system and state-level data are published in a national circular. Over the history of these circulars, the water-use categories have had some changes. The USGS Water-Use Data and Research program seeks to develop improved water-use data through agreements with State water-resources agencies.
