9 Airmen Killed When Air Force WC-130 Crashes in Savannah, Georgia
Responding to a distress call, sailors assigned to a rescue and assistance team from the U.S. Navy guided-missile cruiser USS Anzio (CG 68), provide aid to the motor vessel SINAA, a 35-meter Iranian-flagged dhow. Anzio supplied the dhow with water, fuel and food to sustain her crew of 24 for their transit home on Nov. 10, 2006. The Pentagon is working with its Defense Intelligence Agency to declassify and release images, including two Iranian dhows carrying land-attack missiles, to back up the Trump administration's claims of a growing threat from Iran, according to four defense officials.
