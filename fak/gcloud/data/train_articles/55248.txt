Andrew Gillum hits Ron DeSantisâ€™ health care record in new TV ad
Andrew Gillum's campaign is hitting the airwaves with a new television ad aimed at Ron DeSantis' health care record: namely, the former congressman's vote last year for the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

The ad, titled 'Everybody' and paid for by the Florida Democratic Party, accuses DeSantis of trying to "roll back protections" for people with pre-existing conditions by allowing insurance companies to reject coverage. It also quotes him from a CNN interview around that time in which he said if people need health care, they "show up to the emergency room."

DeSantis has said on the campaign trail that he opposes the Affordable Care Act and would seek a waiver from former President Obama's signature health care law.

"Congressman Ron DeSantis cannot run from his extreme agenda and the six years he spent in Washington trying to take healthcare away from Floridians," said campaign spokesperson Joshua Karp in a statement. "He's proven he'll always put rich, corporate interests ahead of what's best for Florida families."

The ad buy, which was not disclosed, will air in major media markets starting Tuesday.
