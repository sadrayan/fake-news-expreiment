Notice of retraction, correction, and clarification
Notice of correction, clarification and retraction:

On August 27, 2018, a third-party news article not written by Infowars appeared on this webpage regarding the Jacksonville shooting which contained the incorrect assertion that the suspect posted on Reddit under a particular username. The third-party article, which was originally published at Information Liberation, a site not affiliated with Infowars, was not subjected to the requisite degree of editorial review that Infowars requires for all of its reporting. Upon review, the third-party article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed. The views expressed in that article were those of the author and not Infowars or Alex Jones. Once Infowars became aware of the inaccuracies within the third-party article, it was promptly removed.
