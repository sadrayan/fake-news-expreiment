Joe Biden to offer contrast to Trump in London foreign policy speech
Washington, DC (CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden will travel to London next week for a series of events, including a foreign policy speech that will offer up a contrast to President Donald Trump on the world stage.

The trip comes as Biden himself weighs a presidential run against Trump in 2020 , a decision he says will come after the midterm elections.

A source close to Biden told CNN the former vice president will arrive in London Monday ahead of a private fundraiser for the McCain Institute Tuesday. Much of his schedule is still taking shape, but he is expected to participate in events tied to the Biden Cancer Initiative's outreach to medical researchers as well as the Biden Foundation's work with military families. He's also likely to meet with some British leaders while in London, the source said.

But perhaps his most closely watched appearance will come at Chatham House Wednesday afternoon when he will speak at an event titled "A Vision for the Future of the Transatlantic Relationship."

Since leaving office, the former vice president has not shied away from challenging Trump's foreign policy, including the administration's approach to the transatlantic relationship.
