Here’s all I have for you in regards to the period from notification of incident to public notice, which was 17 business days – just over two weeks. In that time, we secured the employee’s account (got all the passwords changed) got the computer in question back to Austin for further review. It was kept in a safe in our headquarters while an image of the drive was sent off for further analysis by MIS-SAC, as we discussed. Staff also conducted interviews with employee regarding incident and began investigation of exactly what happened, what information might have possibly been exposed, etc. Finally, as soon as our staff had enough information to safely notify the school districts, we did so via website, email and follow-up phone calls.

Summary is

these sort of malware incidents are unfortunately very common

TDA responded as quickly and as responsibly as possible, all within the parameters of state law.

TDA provided notice because it was the right thing to do, not because we had to.

Investigation into the incident continued after notification; manual investigation showed number of records which might have had PII exposed that could lead to malicious use was less than 200 records, possibly less than 50

Computer image is still being analyzed but TDA fully expects that no data ever left the device

Let me know if you think of any other questions.
