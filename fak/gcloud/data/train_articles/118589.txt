'Super lice' makes an appearance in GA, SC and NC - FOX Carolina 21
A mutant form of lice is now being seen in our area, but a local hair expert advised parents Wednesday that it's very treatable.



Scientists published results of a study that found the mutant form of lice in 25 states, including South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia.



Maureen Rable, director of operations at Pediatric Hair Solutions, said she has seen many cases of super lice, and it is totally treatable, but the super lice is resistant to common over-the-counter lice shampoos and medicines.

Rable said she uses a special heat treatment to get those bugs out of you or your child's hair.

"What we do is a heated airflow that attacks the lice eggs, which can't resist the heat," said Rable. "We go around the head, and in a half hour it desicates the eggs and kills all the bugs, and then we do a combout, which is basically just combing out the shell casings at that point."

Rable said the genetically-mutated super lice should be treated immediately.
