The voter registration totals are accurate of course. The state understands this which is why the secretary of state only reports turnout by county as % of registered voters who voted

The problem is that we can never be fully certain of the CVAP (citizen voting age population). Short of the census, population surveys are always estimates which include a margin of error. It is not a precise measure because the population is always changing because of deaths, migration, undercounts etc. For example if Travis County grew at a much faster rate than the estimates, the results could be under 90% but we cannot be certain.

.

With that said, it is likely that Travis county has 90% of the CVAP registered simply by looking at 2014 as a baseline…. In 2014, using the CVAP provided by Bruce (759,526) and the registered voter totals for Travis County provided by the secretary of state (655,056) http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist175_race833.htm the registered voter rate in Travis County for 2014 was 86.2% for a low salience mid-year election.

The county had two years to increase the voter registered rate by 3.8% and a lot of events in their favor

1. The March Primary was competitive for both parties and there was a Texan (Ted Cruz) at the top of the Republican ticket.

2. The nomination of Hillary Clinton represents a historical moment in American History

3. The summer has been anything but boring politically.

4. Presidential elections feature more registered young voters who want to "vote in their first election". No one wants their first election to be a mid-term so young people often skip it (2014)

5. There has been a large voter registration push statewide.

These numbers show the rise in registered voters

2014 655,056 (SOS)

2016 March Primary- 667116 http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist273_race62.htm

2016 Fall Election = 717694 (Bruce)

Travis County is also at the higher end of the state average. This page shows the statewide estimates for voter registration

http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/historical/70-92.shtml with the statewide average being about 75%. It was 85% in 2000.
