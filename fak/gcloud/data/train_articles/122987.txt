Janet Reno Refused to Let Parkinson’s Define Her
MIAMI — Janet Reno sat in a wheelchair with a blanket over her knees, her fingers curled inward so she could not shake hands. She was skinny — very skinny — almost unrecognizable as the prosecutor who had shot to fame as President Bill Clinton’s attorney general, the first woman to hold that position.

Her family had consented to let us meet Ms. Reno this summer for an article about a Parkinson’s fund-raising event she has long participated in. They agreed because one of us, Marilyn, also has Parkinson’s, and the article was to be as much about her journey coming face to face with what her health is likely to look like a few decades from now as it would be about Ms. Reno.

But after that first meeting, Ms. Reno’s sister, Margaret Hurchalla, fiercely protective of her health and privacy, did not show up for the second interview. Ms. Reno’s niece, Hunter Reno, politely explained that her family feared that an article on the former attorney general’s disease would overshadow her professional contributions.

The decision reflected her family’s wish for her to be remembered for her milestone achievement as the first female attorney general, not for being a poster child for Parkinson’s. But it also reflected Ms. Reno’s own attitude toward her disease — that it not define her.
