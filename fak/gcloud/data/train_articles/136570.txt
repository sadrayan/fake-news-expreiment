Here's who we saw at Donald Trump's Ohio rally
In the high-school parking lot, Colston L. of Columbus was one of a number of vendors hawking Trump merchandise. Colston, who only gave his last initial, said since arriving at 9 a.m. Saturday, he sold about 300 "Make America Great Again" hats at $10 each in about 9 hours. Colston said this was his first time selling Trump merchandise -- he answered a Craigslist ad earlier in the week and agreed to sell the hats, earning 20 percent of whatever he makes.
