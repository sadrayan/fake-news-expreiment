CNN Journalist Of The Year Fired For Creating Fake News Stories
The CNN journalist of the Year in 2014 has been fired for wiring fake news.

And not simply writing fake news like getting some facts incorrect.

Nope, he wholesale fabricated entire interviews and sources.

How fitting that he was honored by the fake news champions of the world, CNN.

ABC News reported on the story.

Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine has fired Claas Relotius, an award-winning staff writer, after finding he fabricated and invented facts in many articles in recent years.

“Truth and lie are muddled in his texts,” Der Spiegel said.

Among the fabricated stories were articles about a wrongfully detained Guantanamo inmate, about children kidnapped by Islamic State, and about a woman attending the execution of a death sentence as a witness in the United States.

Der Spiegel said it had immediately terminated his work contract. Relotius, who is 33 years old and started writing for Der Spiegel in 2011, was not available for comment.

The magazine said Relotius’s senior editors confronted him after a fellow journalist at the magazine voiced suspicions…

“Claas Relotius acted with intent, methodically and with a high level of criminal energy,” Der Spiegel said, adding that he had written about and cited people he had never met or spoken to.

Relotius told his editors: “It was not about having the next big thing. It was fear of failing.”

BTW, this now disgraced #FakeNews fraud was @CNN’s 2014 Journalist of the Year. You really can’t make this stuff up. https://t.co/SbTRGoqbQu — John Cardillo (@johncardillo) December 19, 2018

Winner of CNN's 'journalist of the year' award faked stories for several years and committed journalistic fraud on a "grand scale". https://t.co/VEHxz3aKUH — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) December 20, 2018

A serial fabulist working for Der Spiegel came to a small rural town to report on "Trump's America." He then fabricated much of his stereotyped story. This month, he was fired. In 2014, CNN had named him "journalist of the year." https://t.co/UaZr7nWv0k — (((Yair Rosenberg))) (@Yair_Rosenberg) December 19, 2018

"He had written for the magazine for seven years and won numerous awards for his investigative journalism, including CNN Journalist of the Year in 2014." https://t.co/ZF8li7b11I — Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) December 19, 2018

So, in other words, he was CNN's Journalist of the Year. — azf (@thaazf) December 20, 2018

Seems qualified to be “journalist” of the year. Or is there someone with more lies that should have won instead? — James R. Bergsten (@jrbergsten) December 20, 2018
