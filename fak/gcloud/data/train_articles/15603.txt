Subject: Query for a fact check

Drew:

Good afternoon.

A reader pointed out Sen. Cornyn recently saying the Texas leg of the Keystone project “has already created 4,800 jobs in just the year it's been up and running.” Can you provide the basis of this 4,800 figure?

Thanks.

AP: “Construction began in August 2012 and involved more than 11 million hours of labor by 4,844 workers in the U.S.” http://newsok.com/pipeline-to-gulf-coast-to-crank-up-jan.-22/article/feed/633272

Fort Worth Star-Telegram: “Officials have long touted the pipeline’s economic impact. Howard said the southern leg created 4,844 jobs; the southern and northern leg together should bring about 20,000.” http://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article3851651.html#storylink=cpy

The Hill: “Touting what he said was the thousands of jobs the southern leg provided to the U.S., Girling said Keystone XL’s northern leg would create twice as many. Roughly 4,844 workers in the U.S. helped construct the southern leg.” http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/196133-transcanada-calls-keystone-xl-safest-pipeline-to-date

Beaumont Business Journal: “Construction of the 487-mile crude oil pipeline involved more than 11 million hours of labor, completed by 4,844 workers from across the United States on more than 50 contracts with manufacturers, equipment suppliers and companies building the pipeline.” http://beaumontbusinessjournal.com/article/oil-gas-wrap/gulf-coast-pipeline-complete

Drew:

I am still collecting information from TransCanada and elsewhere. Right now, it appears the figure Cornyn used to refer to jobs "in just the year it's been up and running" refers to construction jobs that came and went before the pipeline was up and running. Make sense?

Please attribute the following to Megan Mitchell, Communications Director: "Our office was correct in noting that 4,800 jobs were created as a result of the Gulf Coast leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Unfortunately, we erred in the timeframe."
