Loan Program Helps Support Customer-Driven Non-Profit Health Insurers
The Affordable Care Act creates a new type of private nonprofit health insurer, called a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan, or "CO-OP." CO-OPs are directed by their customers and designed to offer individuals and small businesses additional affordable, consumer-friendly and high quality health insurance options.

The CO-OP program offers low-interest loans to eligible nonprofit groups to help set up and maintain these issuers. This page includes awards for initial funding which has resulted in a current CO-OP option for consumers in 23 states, as well as funding for four of the current CO-OPs planning to expand operations into a neighboring state to offer coverage in 2015 or 2016.

Beginning January 1, 2014, CO-OPs, are offering health plans through the new Health Insurance Marketplace, as well as outside the Marketplace.

CO-OP loans are only made to private, nonprofit entities that demonstrate a high probability of financial viability. All CO-OPs receiving loans were selected by CMS on a competitive basis based on external independent review by a multi-disciplinary team. As CO-OPs meet or exceed developmental milestones, funds are allowed to be incrementally drawn down.

CMS continues to monitor CO-OPs to ensure they are meeting program goals and will be able to repay loans. To ensure strong financial management, CO-OPs are required to submit quarterly financial statements, including cash flow and enrollment data, receive site visits, and undergo external audits. This monitoring is concurrent with the financial and operational oversight by state insurance regulators.
