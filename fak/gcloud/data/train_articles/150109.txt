Washington, D.C. ­– At the request of Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and his family, Mayo Clinic released the following statement today:

“Following a routine annual physical, Sen. John McCain underwent a procedure to remove a blood clot from above his left eye on Friday, July 14 at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix.
