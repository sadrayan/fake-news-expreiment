United Way comes out against Senate GOP tax bill
United Way Worldwide, the world's largest privately-funded nonprofit, came out against the Senate's tax bill early Saturday as senators voted on amendments to the plan

The nonprofit organization argued that the tax plan wouldn't provide much benefit to low-income families and would hurt charities.

“On behalf of those who will be impacted in nearly every community we serve, I am deeply troubled by many aspects of the tax reform bill the Senate is now considering,” United Way Worldwide President and CEO Brian Gallagher said.

“Congress is gambling with the lives of millions of people who rely on charitable and government social services by increasing the federal deficit to fund tax cuts."

He added that, "the elimination of the charitable deduction for 31 million middle and upper-middle income taxpayers causes such damage to our ability to help people, we have no choice but to oppose the bill.”

Because the bill increases the standard deduction, fewer people would take the itemized deduction for charitable contributions. The nonprofit sector has argued that this change would lead to a decline in charitable giving.

Charities had pushed for people to be able to deduct their donations regardless of whether they itemize. While some GOP lawmakers took up their cause, a universal charitable deduction was not included in the bill.
