Saving Lives, Protecting Health

USAID's Family Planning program is one of the success stories in U.S. development assistance. Since the launch of the program in 1965, families are better able to feed, clothe, educate, and provide health care for their children. Countless women and children are alive today as a result of USAID assistance.

Fighting HIV/AIDS through providing information, counseling, and access to male and female condoms

USAID's Family Planning Guiding Principles and U.S. Legislative and Policy Requirements

Principles of voluntarism and informed choice guide USAID's family planning program. These principles are articulated in program guidelines and a number of legislative and policy requirements that govern the use of U.S. family planning assistance. The requirements fall into two general categories:

Voluntarism and Informed Choice

USAID is committed to ensuring that women and couples in developing countries have access to voluntary family planning services and are free to make informed decisions about their reproductive lives.





USAID is committed to ensuring that women and couples in developing countries have access to voluntary family planning services and are free to make informed decisions about their reproductive lives. Restrictions on Support for Abortions

There are several legislative and policy restrictions relating to abortions.

USAID takes these family planning requirements very seriously and works with Missions and partners to ensure compliance with the family planning requirements in their programs.

USAID's family planning program is subject to certain restrictions on the use of funds, which are implemented through standard provisions inserted in all grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts that include family planning activities. The current standard provisions for Voluntary Population Planning Activities, including both mandatory and supplemental requirements, for cooperative agreements and grants are available in the USAID Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 303. The current standard provisions that apply to contracts are found Acquisition & Assistance Policy Directive 08-01.
