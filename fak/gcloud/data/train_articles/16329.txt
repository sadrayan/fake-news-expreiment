Patents:

Over the last year residents of Austin have patented inventions including a laser-guided nail clipper for dogs and cats, an electronic fishing reel system, a fertilizer that also functions as a pesticide, and a gadget that can detect explosive chemicals with microphones–along with about 2,900 other ideas, the second-most per-capita of any metro area in the U.S.

Silicon Valley still dominates the U.S. as a magnet for innovative companies and people. But in our first-ever ranking of America’s Most Innovative Cities, the “Silicon Hills” of Austin were close on the Valley’s heels.

There is a city-wide sense of pride in Austin for local small businesses, and as

the live music capital of the world, Austin has always attracted creative and

artistic individuals. This creative presence has led Austin to become one of the most innovative cities in America, with 2,900 new patents issued — the second-most per-capita of any metro area in the U.S.
