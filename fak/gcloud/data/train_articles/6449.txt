[Press Release] Gov. Perry Announces Action on Legislation
Gov. Perry Announces Action on Legislation

Gov. Rick Perry today vetoed two bills and filed two without signature. He issued the following statements:

SB 346, Vetoed

"Freedom of association and freedom of speech are two of our most important rights enshrined in the Constitution. My fear is that SB 346 would have a chilling effect on both of those rights in our democratic political process. While regulation is necessary in the administration of Texas political finance laws, no regulation is tolerable that puts anyone's participation at risk or that can be used by any government, organization or individual to intimidate those who choose to participate in our process through financial means."

"At a time when our federal government is assaulting the rights of Americans by using the tools of government to squelch dissent it is unconscionable to expose more Texans to the risk of such harassment, regardless of political, organizational or party affiliation. I therefore veto SB 346."

HB 535, Vetoed

"HB 535 requires state agencies, when purchasing goods, to give preference to goods "manufactured" in Texas. Current law already requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas. While I support and encourage our agencies to buy goods from Texas businesses, this bill simply does not change current law."

SB 567 and HB 1600, filed without signature

"While I have concerns about transferring the ratemaking functions for water and wastewater to the Public Utility Commission, I agree with the overall goal of improving the rate process for the affected customers. Therefore, I will allow SB 567 and HB 1600 to become law without my signature."
