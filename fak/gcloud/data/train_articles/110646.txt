This Russian cat eats caviar while you don’t
This Moscow cat is enjoying the most fancy of feasts — while her human comrades struggle!

Moscow city councillor Yulia Alferova refused to apologize for posting pictures of her cat, Tessa, enjoying black caviar as much of the nation battles economic hardship.

Alferova said she purchased the caviar and no one has the right to tell her what to do with it, according to Central European News.

“I actually bought caviar for myself and she played with a jar for a while, and was very interested in the contents when I opened it,” she said.

“So I posted this funny image to pay tribute of course to the fact that it was world cat’s day. If I delete it, I will be limiting my freedom of expression so I don’t intend to do that.”

The tone-deaf pol didn’t understand why a caviar-eating cat might upset everyday Russians struggling to make ends meet.

“I don’t see what all the fuss is about, if I showed a picture of her eating cereal it wouldn’t get anywhere near as much reaction,” she said.

The country has felt the full brunt of economic sanctions and falling fuel prices.

President Vladimir Putin has introduced austerity plans that include 10-percent pay cuts for senior leaders.

But even in this backdrop, Alferova, 35, has still managed to post pictures showing off her lavish lifestyle. Russians tore into Alferova via Twitter and VKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook.

“Kids are dying from hunger and this b—h is feeding her cat with black caviar!” wrote a woman named Olga.
