Royal wedding: the Prince William and Kate Middleton guest list as open data
The royal wedding guest list for Prince William and Kate Middleton came out last week. We wondered what would happen if we tried to turn that list into open data that we can use.

The guest list, published on the official site, only covers a fraction of those invited - around 300 of the 1,900 who will go to Westminster Abbey.

But it gives an insight into a list the royal family claims is 'mostly' chosen by the bride and groom-to-be. It's a mixture of celebrities, soldiers, diplomats and foreign dignitaries. Or, as Stephen Bates wrote,



an eclectic mix of friends, family, sports stars, personalities and the odd unsavoury dictator or two

This is the official breakdown:

So, who's invited? We've added some extra data into the list, including the nationality, type and number of people named on the official invitation.

Here's how the national breakdown looks, showing Australia just in the lead, after UK residents:

And where will they sit? Here's the guide, thanks to Tableau:
