Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on Tax Reform and more
Following my conversation with Paul Ryan on Wednesday, multiple news outlets wrote reports about it: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/01/gop-eyes-post-tax-cut-changes-to-welfare-medicare-and-social-security/

Fox News picked it up as well and ran audio from my conversation with Ryan on their television broadcasts.

And a lot of liberals wet their beds about what Ryan said to me about entitlement reform.
