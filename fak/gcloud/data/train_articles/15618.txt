Subject: RE: CDC Inquiry- raw milk

We only have illness information as it is linked to outbreaks, which would be an underestimate for number of actual illnesses since most illnesses are not part of recognized outbreaks.

Our FOOD Tool (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/foodborneoutbreaks/) includes outbreaks and outbreak-related illnesses/deaths that state health departments report to CDC. You can download specific searches that you do at the bottom through Excel. For instance, I see 2 suspected (not confirmed) outbreaks in Texas in 2015 suspected to be linked to raw milk (one with 4 cases, one with 3 cases). From 2006 to 2015, it is showing up as 2 suspected outbreaks linked to raw milk that led to 7 illnesses and 1 hospitalization in Texas. You can do this for each state.

This article describes outbreaks associated with raw milk from 2007 to 2012 (none in Texas): http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/nonpasteurized-outbreaks-2012.html

You likely want to check with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services who may have illness info not linked to outbreaks. I’m checking on a PIO name/contact now.

Thanks,

Brittany

How can I tell it’s a “suspected” rather than “confirmed” outbreak on the FOOD Tool?

It says in the excel doc that you can pull at the bottom of the food tool page after you run a search. I understand Chris Van Deusen with Texas is also working on getting back to you on this. He'll have more specifics.

Thanks,
