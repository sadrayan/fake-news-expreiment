Shonda,

The purpose of my spreadsheet was to illustrate the difference in permitting costs associated with a 322 unit wrap style apartment project in Austin vs that same project in Dallas. I was not attempting to display a summary of actual fees paid on a specific project. The fees that I outlined are accurate fees based on adopted ordinances and city codes. We have paid roughly these amounts on several projects in Austin and Dallas recently.

What my spreadsheet doesn’t do, and needs to be discussed in far more detail, is outline the substantial difference in the time it takes to permit a project in Austin vs Dallas/Houston/or San Antonio. Even with the new “expedited” building permit process in Austin, the site development permit process is still going to take 9 months so we are going to wait a very long time to start our projects. It is accurate to say that it takes 9 times as long and costs 9 times as much to permit the same project in Austin as it does in Dallas.

This shouldn’t be a Politifact article. It is a real estate article that really needs your capable touch.

Best,

John
