No, That 'Man Enough For Hillary' Ad Featuring a Tattooed Beefcake Is Not Real
Today, an ad started widely circulating on Twitter, purportedly from the Clinton campaign, featuring a tatted up, gelled, almost harassingly bearded man. “I’m man enough to vote for a woman...” it reads. “Are you?” The Clinton campaign confirms to Jezebel that this is not a real ad. Come on, guys.

The first person who appears to have tweeted the image is the anime-avatared gentleman above, but the hashtag #ManEnough4Hillary has been circulating for a few weeks, mainly from aggrieved gents who seem to believe that my labia wrap themselves around the voting lever every four years.

GQ wrote the new fake ad up, pointing out that Tattooed McHairgel Von Looks Like All My Exes is also featured in a Portland bus ad for getting your STD tests. (The author does note his gentle doubts about the ad: “I haven’t seen it connected to an official Clinton social media account, and it does seem like it could be the type of thing put together by another camp to make her look bad.”)

Yes. It was that. A Clinton spokesperson tells Jezebel, “This is not an ad from the campaign.”

Great. What fresh teapot tempest shall we turn to next?
