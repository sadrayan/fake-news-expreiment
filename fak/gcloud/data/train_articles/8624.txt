Civilian Labor Force Estimates Query
Civilian Labor Force Estimates include employment, unemployment figures and unemployment rates. Prepared in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ), estimates are by place of residence. Most area data are NOT seasonally adjusted. However, seasonally adjusted data are available for the United States, Ohio and the Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA ).

Notes: 1) Workforce Area definitions change periodically. Maps based on former definitions can be viewed at http://jfs.ohio.gov/owd/wia/wiamap.stm under "Past Workforce Maps". 2) Current Civilian Labor Force Estimates offers additional information for the most recent month available. 3) Concepts & Methodology offer brief, non-technical explanations of terms and procedures used to develop local area employment and unemployment statistics.
