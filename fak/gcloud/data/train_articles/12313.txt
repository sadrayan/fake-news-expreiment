Rising Relative Risk of Mortality for Singles: Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression
Abstract

Never-married persons (singles) constitute a growing demographic group; yet, the magnitude of the all-cause relative mortality risk for nonelderly singles is not known and important moderating factors have not been explored. The authors used meta-analysis to examine 641 risk estimates from 95 publications that provided data on more than 500 million persons. The comparison group consisted of currently married individuals. The mean hazard ratio for mortality was 1.24 (95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.30) among multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios with a high subjective quality rating. Meta-regressions showed that hazard ratios have been modestly increasing over time for both genders, but have done so somewhat more rapidly for women. The results also showed that the hazard ratio decreased with age and that study quality has an important relation to hazard ratio magnitude.

Research on the relation between marital status and mortality has a rich history in sociology because of Durkheim's (1) seminal book on suicide. In that work, Durkheim found that never-married persons (hereafter referred to as singles) had higher suicide rates than did married people. Early studies of the association between marital status and all-cause mortality consistently reported elevated mortality levels for singles (2–9).

In more recent studies, investigators examined whether the observed differentials in mortality by marital status result from premarital health differences (i.e., marital selection) or from postmarital health changes (i.e., a marital protection effect) (10–12). Some scholars have shown that individuals with health problems, less happiness, and less emotional stability are both less likely to get married and more likely to die at an earlier age (10, 13, 14). Others have found that married people typically enjoy more social support and better economic conditions and that they are less likely to engage in risky behaviors than are singles (15, 16). Whereas marital relationships may also be a source of health-damaging stress (17–19), on the whole, being married is thought to be associated with better health.

Other interesting trends have emerged in the study of relative mortality for singles. First, there is an increasing use of approaches that examine changes in marital status and health using a life-course perspective (20–22). Second, the literature shows that the frequency of health problems for singles is increasing (23). Although cohabitation is rapidly becoming more widespread and has become a common alternative to marriage (24, 25), research suggests that it is less advantageous than marriage in terms of mental and physical health (26, 27). Because the average age at first marriage is gradually increasing in Western nations (28–30) and growing numbers of people never get married (31–33), understanding the relation between marital status and mortality rate is more important today than ever before.

Only recently has this growing body of research been systematically reviewed (34, 35). In their meta-analysis of marital status and mortality among elderly persons, Manzoli et al. (34) concluded that singles had an 11% greater relative risk of early death did than married persons, but that relative risks did not vary by gender or geographic location. Additional meta-analyses are needed, however, because this previous work focused on the elderly (those aged 65 years or older) and on recent publications (1994–2005). Therefore, much remains unknown about trends in relative risks over time and across various groups and cultures. In the present study we sought to test whether the relative risk of mortality for singles is elevated at younger ages. We also sought to test whether the relative risk for singles has changed over time and whether there exist cultural or regional differences. We present meta-analyses by gender, age, time period, and region. We also present meta-regression analyses that assess various study-level factors that have the potential to affect the estimated magnitude of the relative risk.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In June 2005, we conducted a search for publications that dealt with psychosocial stress or social isolation (including marital status and other diverse measures of social relationships, such as social network size, frequency of social interaction, and level of social support received) and all-cause mortality (additional information on search procedures is available from the authors upon request). Using these search results as a base, we iteratively hand-searched 1) the references cited in eligible publications; 2) the lists of sources that cited an eligible publication; and 3) the sources identified as “similar to” an eligible publication (Figure 1). Hand-searching was ongoing for 3.5 years, and we exhausted the literature in January 2009 after 5 iterations. Two authors independently determined publication eligibility and extracted the data (see section 1 of the Web Appendix, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/, for a list of variables). Unpublished work was considered for inclusion. Although our search was done in English, we translated 8 non-English publications. The most frequent reasons for study exclusion were the lack of an eligible psychosocial stress or social isolation measure, failure to report a ratio measure of mortality risk, and confounding in the dependent variable such that the outcome was not strictly all-cause mortality. The full “social relationships” database contained 334 publications. We randomly selected and recoded 25 publications (153 point estimates) and found no coding errors.

The present analysis uses the subset of 95 articles (90 journal articles, 3 book chapters, 1 dissertation, and 1 unpublished paper; see section 2 of the Web Appendix) that reported a mortality risk for singles relative to currently married or cohabitating persons. Analyses of marital dissolution (E. Shor, D. J. Roelfs, P. Bugyi, and J. E. Schwartz, McGill University, Montreal, Canada; University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky; and Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, unpublished manuscript, 2011) and widowhood (36) were produced from separate subsets of the data and presented in separate papers. A study was included only if the outcome was all-cause mortality. Publications with cross-sectional and longitudinal (cohort) designs were considered for inclusion. The 95 publications provided 641 point estimates for analysis (many studies, for example, reported separate results by gender or age group, and most presented both bivariate and multivariate analyses).

Statistical methods varied between studies, and all non-hazard-ratio point estimates were converted to hazard ratios (see section 3 of the Web Appendix). When not reported, the standard errors used to calculate inverse variance weights were recovered from 1) confidence intervals, 2) t statistics, 3) χ2 statistics, 4) exact P values, or 5) the midpoint of the P value range. For 263 of the 641 point estimates, no measure of statistical significance was reported, and standard errors were estimated using multiple regressions (see section 4 of the Web Appendix). An indicator variable was created so analyses could be conducted both with and without these estimations. We sought to maximize the number of hazard ratios analyzed, capturing variability both between and within publications. In cases in which this caused a set of person-years to be represented more than once, we utilized a variance adjustment procedure (see section 5 of the Web Appendix).

Two measures of study quality were adopted. First, the coding authors assigned a 3-level subjective rating to each publication (individual study ratings are available upon request). Publications were rated low quality if they contained obvious reporting or methodological errors (e.g., mathematically impossible confidence intervals or references to the result of a Poisson regression as an odds ratio). Publications were rated high quality if models were well-specified and results were reported in detail. Second, we used principal components factor analysis (see section 6 of the Web Appendix) to construct a scale quality measure using the 5-year impact factor of the journal (if none was available, we assigned an impact factor of 1) and the number of citations received per year since publication (37). The Spearman correlation between the subjective rating and the factor-analysis-derived rating was low (rho = 0.296; P < 0.001), indicating that these 2 measures tapped different dimensions of quality. This low level of correlation was expected, given that the subjective rating focused exclusively on methodological quality, whereas the factor-analysis-based score reflected the quality of the literature analysis and discussion in addition to the quality of the methods.

Heterogeneity presence and magnitude were assessed with Q tests and I2 tests (38). All analyses were calculated by maximum likelihood using a random-effects model and matrix macros provided by Lipsey and Wilson (39). The possibility of selection and publication bias was examined using Rosenthal's method (40) and examinations of the funnel plot, with plot asymmetry evaluated using Peters’ test (41, 42).

The covariates used in the analyses were 1) whether an estimated death rate was used to convert a point estimate to a hazard ratio (yes or no); 2) whether standard error was estimated (yes or no); 3) the proportion of respondents who were male; 4) the mean age of the sample at baseline, divided by 10; 5) the age range of the sample at baseline, divided by 10; 6) the age of the publication (i.e., years elapsed since publication), divided by 10; 7) the age of the study (i.e., years elapsed since the collection of baseline data), divided by 10; 8) the duration of the baseline period, in years; 9) the number of years elapsed between the end of baseline and the beginning of follow-up; 10) the maximum follow-up duration, in years; 11) a series of interaction terms between gender, mean age, follow-up duration, and study age; 12) geographic region; 13) sample size, log transformed; 14) a series of variables that indicated the level of statistical adjustment; 15) a subjective quality rating (range, 1–3); and 16) the composite scale of study quality (continuous; range, 0–10).

RESULTS

Singles had a 30% increased risk of mortality relative to married persons (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24, 1.37) in studies in which investigators controlled for multiple covariates (Table 2). Table 2 also shows that the exclusion of data in cases in which either the death rate or the standard error had to be estimated did not substantively alter the direction, magnitude, or level of statistical significance of the mean hazard ratio. The mean hazard ratio among the highest quality studies was marginally lower than the overall mean (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.30). In the interest of presenting conservative results, all discussions of Table 2 focus on hazard ratios adjusted for multiple covariates. All reported P values are 2-sided.

Subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses

The relative risk of death was higher for men (HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.41) than for women (HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.32), as shown in Table 2. The overlapping confidence intervals suggested a lack of difference between men and women, but a more robust test can be performed with meta-regression, which controls for additional sources of heterogeneity that could mask group differences. Table 3 presents the results of 3 meta-regression analyses, and the discussion will focus primarily on the final parsimonious model. The significance of the gender variable in model 1 and of the gender-study age interaction in models 2 and 3 confirmed that the mean hazard ratio was higher for men relative to women.

The relative mortality risk for singles has increased over the last few decades, but the trend is difficult to discern. The mean hazard ratio (Table 2) was 1.38 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.59) for studies that used baseline data collected between 1960 and 1969, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.31) for studies between 1970 and 1979, 1.41 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.52) for studies between 1980 and 1989, and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.49) for studies between 1990 and 1999. The meta-regression results for study age (i.e., years elapsed since the baseline data were collected; P < 0.001) and the gender-study age interaction (P < 0.01), however, showed that hazard ratios have been modestly rising (Table 3, Figure 2, and section 7 of the Web Appendix). The hazard ratio for singles was historically greater for men than for women and has increased over time for both genders, but more rapidly so for women.

Younger singles had an especially elevated hazard ratio. The mean hazard ratio (Table 2) was elevated by 128% for singles aged 30–39 years (HR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.64, 3.16) and by 80% for those aged 40–50 years (HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.22). The mean hazard ratio was lower for persons aged 50–59 years (HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.85), 60–69 years (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.38), 70–79 years (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.29), and 80 years or older (HR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.29). The results of the final meta-regression showed that the mean hazard ratio decreased by 10% with each additional 10 years of age (P < 0.001).

The hazard ratio for singles was highest in the East Asian nations (China, Taiwan, and Japan) (HR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.61, 2.33). The meta-regression results showed that the hazard ratio for Eastern Asia was 59% higher than the hazard ratio for Western Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland) (P < 0.001). The meta-regression also shows that, when compared with western continental European nations, the lowest hazard ratios were found in the United Kingdom and its former colonies of Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Singles in Scandinavia and the United States had similar hazard ratios, 14% and 15% higher than in Western Europe, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The hazard ratio in Eastern Europe was 27% higher than in Western Europe (P < 0.001).

Other significant predictors of hazard ratio magnitude included the log of the sample size (P < 0.001), the subjective quality rating (P < 0.001), and the scale measure of study quality (P = 0.02). The hazard ratios were significantly lower in those cases in which the standard error needed to be estimated (a decrease of 9% in the HR, P < 0.001), but the indicator variable for whether an estimated death rate was used was not significant. Other nonsignificant predictors included the age of the publication (P = 0.69), the number of years elapsed between the end of baseline and the beginning of follow-up (P = 0.83), and the follow-up duration (P = 0.74).

DISCUSSION

Singles had a 24% higher risk of early death than did married persons (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.30) in studies with a high subjective quality score. Perhaps the most interesting finding of the present study is the interaction between gender and time, although the findings presented in Table 2 initially suggested no gender difference in hazard ratio and the lack of a time trend (note the overlapping confidence intervals). After accounting for heterogeneity from various sample and study-design characteristics, however, the meta-regressions showed that the hazard ratio for singles increased modestly over time for both men and women, but that the historical gender difference in hazard ratio has decreased slightly because the hazard ratio for women grew at a faster rate (Figure 2 and Table 3).

Our finding that hazard ratios have become approximately equal for men and women in recent years confirms the findings of Manzoli et al. (34) of no difference in relative risk between genders among studies published since the mid-1990s. Our results, however, show that this gender equality is a relatively recent phenomenon. This finding contrasts with those of Liu and Umberson (43), who found that self-rated health for never-married women (relative to married women) did not change between 1972 and 2003. Rising hazard ratios for both genders are particularly interesting when one considers that societal pressures to be married have actually declined in recent decades (28, 44, 45). This finding therefore challenges the hypothesis that remaining single is hazardous mainly because of the social disapproval and consequent stress that is often involved in not abiding by the norm of getting married (46–48).

Socioeconomic trends might offer a plausible explanation for rising hazard ratios for women. Despite improvements in gender equality over the past few decades, women continue, on average, to be paid substantially less than their male counterparts (49, 50). Within the increasing portion of the population in the West who are single parents (51, 52), women are more likely than men to have custody of the child and to bear the economic burden of childrearing (53, 54). With the concurrent decline in public assistance (55–57), health benefits (58, 59), and the family wage (60, 61) in Western societies, single women are more economically and medically marginalized now than in previous years and are therefore at a higher risk for health problems and early death.

It is also interesting to note that the hazard ratio for singles declined by 10% for every 10-year increase in the mean age of the sample. In their meta-analysis of persons aged 65 years or older, Manzoli et al. (34) found an 11% elevated relative risk for singles. The mean hazard ratios found in the present study were quite similar for the comparable age groups (1.28 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.38) for ages 60–69 years, 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.29) for ages 70–79 years, and 1.22 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.29) for ages 80 years or older) but were notably higher for younger persons. Some caution must be exercised when interpreting this finding, however. When the underlying death rates are very high in both the case and control groups (as is the case at older ages), ratio statistics such as the hazard ratio lack statistical power to detect group differences. Given the magnitude of the age effect, however, it is still likely that the observed 10% decrease in hazard ratio per decade is substantively meaningful rather than merely a statistical artifact. Therefore, possible reasons for the finding need to be considered. Single persons from previous generations may have retained the reduced risk of death that existed in their younger years. Alternatively, it may be that as people age, they acclimate to being single, finding ways to compensate for the lack of instrumental and social support that are associated with being married. It is also possible that risky behaviors such as substance abuse or hazardous driving, associated more often with single people, decrease with age. Alternatively, it may also be that many who marry at a young age are more cautious by nature and therefore less likely to engage in risky behaviors. The likelihood of risk-averseness is certainly not homogenous, as those who marry very young (e.g., as the result of teen pregnancy) likely differ from those who marry relatively young (e.g., around the age of 21). In either case, selection effects may be especially important for young people, whereas the protective effects of marriage may be more important for those in older age groups.

The mean hazard ratio was highest in the Eastern Asian nations (HR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.61, 2.33), which suggests that the hazard ratio is most pronounced in locations where the social sanctions for remaining single are highest. Throughout the years, marriage rates in China and Japan have been very high, largely because of arranged marriages, patrilocal household formation, and the centrality of the family as the primary religious, social, and economic unit (32, 62, 63). Furthermore, marital selection effects may be stronger in these nations in which a larger proportion of those who remain single have a preexisting health condition. Finally, the economic disadvantages associated with single-earner households may be more pronounced in East Asia (especially for women, who were traditionally excluded from the formal labor sector).

Marital protection versus marital selection

Many existing studies on relative mortality for singles were not longitudinal and/or did not control for health, rendering them unsuitable for disentangling marital protection and selection effects (11). There is near consensus in more recent research, however, that indicates that both selection and protection effects exist (11, 12, 20, 64, 65). Although the relative strengths of marital protection and selection are still being debated, only a minority of the studies found that selection is more important (13), whereas most argued that protection is a more substantial determinant of the effect (14, 47, 66–68).

Life-course perspectives are preferable for further investigations of marital protection versus marital selection. When this design is not feasible, statistically controlling for selection mechanisms (such as health and socioeconomic status) is highly advised. Although the data analyzed here did not allow us to ascertain the degree to which the elevated hazard ratio for singles is the result of marital protection or of marital selection, the results offered some support for the protection effect. An additional meta-regression (data not shown) revealed no significant difference between the 97 hazard ratios that controlled for health and the remaining 544 hazard ratios (P = 0.52). Similarly, there was no significant difference between the 167 hazard ratios that controlled for socioeconomic status and the 474 hazard ratios that did not (P = 0.38).

We cannot rule out selection processes altogether, as attributes and behaviors that are likely to reduce the odds of marriage (such as heavy drinking or a type A personality) may also cause health problems in the long run. Latent health problems such as these would be missed if they first appeared after baseline data had already been collected. It may also be that adverse selection, in which unhealthy people seek marriage to gain health support, also occurs (69, 70). Furthermore, variations in cultural norms may substantially affect the strength of the selection effect (71).

Limitations

A major limitation of the present study is one that is shared by many meta-analyses: publication bias (72, 73). A funnel plot of the log hazard ratios against sample size appears asymmetric around the mean hazard ratio, which suggests the presence of publication bias or other biases related to either the size or quality of the studies (see section 8 of the Web Appendix). This possibility was also suggested in the meta-regression results, as lower-quality studies and studies based on larger samples both tended to report higher-than-average hazard ratios.

The results of Peters’ test (42) confirmed that publication bias exists (P < 0.001), with the direction of the regression coefficient indicating that small studies with small hazard ratios are missing from the analysis. We remain confident in the search procedures used, though we also acknowledge that alternative broad search terms might have uncovered additional eligible works. The results from an analysis of study quality, however, suggested that the observed publication bias was primarily due to the nonreporting of null findings among lower-quality studies. However, the absence of these studies does not seriously compromise the results, as the number of nonreported null hazard ratios required to render the key findings statistically insignificant (see reference 40) is quite high. The reported mean effect among all statistically unadjusted hazard ratios would become nonsignificant only if 845,374 additional null hazard ratios were uncovered. Similarly, 858,075 additional null hazard ratios would be required to render the mean age-adjusted hazard ratio insignificant. In addition, 191,693 additional null hazard ratios would be needed to compromise the mean hazard ratio among studies that were adjusted for age and additional covariates. Because of ongoing concerns about formal methods to correct for publication bias, such as the “trim and fill” method (74), we have not performed additional analyses using adjusted data. Our results should be treated with caution, as they may overestimate the mean hazard ratio. However, because of the similar magnitudes of the mean hazard ratio for all studies adjusted for age and additional covariates (HR = 1.30) and the mean hazard ratio for the subset with high quality scores (HR = 1.24), any overestimation due to publication bias is likely to be relatively small.

A second limitation stems from differences in the covariates used by each study (see section 9 of the Web Appendix). Although the majority of the studies that used multivariate adjustment included 1 or more of the most prominent confounding factors (e.g., socioeconomic status and prior physical/mental health), these covariates were not universally present. As a result, the mean hazard ratios might have been overestimated. As we discussed in the marital selection versus protection section above, however, our findings suggest that any overestimation is likely to be very small.

A third limitation relates to the difficulties inherent in quantifying study quality. Different dimensions of study quality were evaluated through the use of multiple quality measures, including the level of statistical adjustment, a subjective quality rating, and a citation-based quality score. Each of these has shortcomings, particularly the citation-based quality score. The journal impact factors and the number of citations received, on which this score is based, also reflect factors such as the historical prominence of a journal and the relative prestige of authors in the larger social science community.

A fourth limitation stems from the overrepresentation of data from the developed world. Relatively few studies were conducted in Eastern European countries, Lebanon, or Bangladesh. Because the sample sizes in the developing world are small, any conclusions about the difference between the developed and the developing world should be made with caution. Because most of the results come from the developed countries, they should not be extrapolated to populations in developing countries. There is a great need, in particular, for comparative studies between developing and developed countries. There are likely regional differences in the mechanisms associated with increased relative risks for singles (for example, gender norms vary greatly from region to region, which would lead one to suspect that gender may interact with geographic location in interesting ways).

Singles have a significantly elevated relative risk of all-cause mortality. The hazard ratios associated with this group have been increasing over time, especially for women, and are particularly high in younger cohorts. Future research is needed to evaluate the socioeconomic explanations conjectured upon here. New analyses should try to include measures of health-care access, economic assistance received, and variables such as type of work, wage, and periods of unemployment, which may prove particularly valuable for determining why singles are more at risk. In addition, more work assessing the relation between singlehood and cause-specific mortality will likely shed further light on the specific health mechanisms involved and help in identifying ways for intervention. Finally, the disparity in risk between different cultures calls for more studies on the relative mortality risk for singles in non-Western cultures.
