Resolution 120 charged the Special Committee with the responsibility to conduct an extensive investigation into and to hold public hearings on specified matters relating to the President's and Mrs. Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development Corporation (``Whitewater'') along with James and Susan McDougal, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association (``Madison Guaranty''), and related matters. In discharging its responsibilities under Resolution 120, the Special Committee deposed 274 witnesses and held 60 days of public hearings, during which 136 witnesses testified. The Committee also reviewed approximately 1 million pages of documents produced by the President and Mrs. Clinton, the White House, various federal agencies, and a number of individual witnesses. Resolution 120 authorized the Committee to investigate and to hold public hearings into three general subject areas. Section 1(b)(1) authorized investigation into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in handling papers in Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster's office following his death on July 20, 1993--the so-called Foster Phase of the Special Committee's inquiry. With respect to the Washington Phase of the inquiry, Section 1(b)(2) authorized investigation into whether the White House improperly interfered with any investigations or prosecutions by various federal agencies relating to, among other things, Whitewater, Madison Guaranty related entities, and Capital Management Services, Inc. (``CMS''). Finally, in the Arkansas Phase, Sec. 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized the Special Committee to investigate, among other things, the activities of Whitewater, Madison Guaranty, CMS, Lasater & Co., and the work and billing practices of the Rose Law Firm relating to Madison Guaranty. 1. the foster phase During the 103d Congress, the Banking Committee, pursuant to Senate Resolution 229, conducted an inquiry into the cause of Mr. Foster's death and the conduct of the subsequent investigation of his death by the United States Park Police. On July 15, 1994, Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske, Jr. advised the Banking Committee that ``public hearings on the subject of the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office while this investigation is continuing could prejudice our investigation.'' 1 Accordingly, the Banking Committee's public hearings on July 29, 1994 into the cause of Mr. Foster's death excluded inquiry into the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office. At the conclusion of the Banking Committee's hearings in the summer of 1994, the following matters, among others, were identified for future inquiry relating to Mr. Foster's death: the White House interference into the Park Police search of Mr. Foster's office; the presence of White House counsel staff during standard Park Police investigatory interviews; the White House insistence that the Park Police investigation proceed with Department of Justice involvement to the extent that DOJ was ``calling the shots'' and ``setting up protocol'' and the Park Police were ``stand[ing] and waiting for permission to do our job''; and the late delivery of the note in Mr. Foster's office to Park Police, discovered by White House counsel. 2 On April 22, 1995, Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr advised the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Banking Committee that his investigation would not be hindered or impeded by a Senate inquiry into the way in which White House officials handled documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death. Accordingly, the Special Committee commenced its investigation and public hearings into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in handling documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death. The Special Committee recognizes that Mr. Foster's death remains a source of much grief to his family and friends. In conducting its inquiry under section 1(b)(1) of Resolution 120, the Committee sought to balance carefully the need to protect the privacy of the Foster family and its duty to carry out fully the mandate of the Senate. 2. the washington phase Resolution 120 directed the Special Committee to review the handling of several federal investigations relating to the Whitewater real estate venture; Madison Guaranty McDougal's S&L;, the failure of which cost American taxpayers more than $60 million; and CMS, a small business investment company owned by David Hale, who made illegal loans to James and Susan McDougal in part to finance the Whitewater investment. Specifically, section 1(b)(2) of the Resolution authorized the Special Committee to conduct an investigation and public hearings into the following matters: (A) whether any person has improperly handled confidential Resolution Trust Corporation (``RTC'') information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater, including whether any person has improperly communicated such information to individuals referenced therein; (B) whether the White House has engaged in improper contacts with any other agency or department in the Government with regard to confidential RTC information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater; (C) whether the Department of Justice has improperly handled RTC criminal referrals relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater; (D) whether RTC employees have been improperly importuned, prevented, restrained, or deterred in conducting investigations or making enforcement recommendations relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater; and (E) whether the report issued by the Office of Government Ethics on July 31, 1994, or related transcripts of deposition testimony-- (i) were improperly released to White House officials or others prior to their testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs pursuant to Senate Resolution 229 (103d Congress); or (ii) were used to communicate to White House officials or to others confidential RTC information relating to Madison Guaranty or Whitewater.3 In conducting the inquiry mandated during this so-called ``Washington Phase'' of the investigation, the Special Committee examined whether the President and Mrs. Clinton--or their agents--misused the power of the presidency in responding to a series of investigations of the Whitewater matter. As in the past, the Senate sought to serve as the public's watchdog, to expose abuses of the public trust. Of necessity, the Special Committee inquired into the investigative and prosecutorial processes of Executive Branch agencies to determine whether the laws were properly and faithfully executed. Congress has a duty to investigate allegations that the normal investigative and prosecutorial processes of the Executive Branch have been compromised.4 More important, Congress has the constitutional obligation to ensure that the President's private interests have not been elevated above the public good. 3. the arkansas phase This is the beginning of the Whitewater matter. In this phase of its inquiry, the Senate charged the Special Committee with investigating the complex web of intermingled funds, fraudulent transactions, political favors, and conflicted relationships which comprise the ``20 years of public life in Arkansas'' that Mrs. Clinton did not want an independent counsel, among others, to look into.5 Specifically, Section 1(b)(3) of Resolution 120 authorized an investigation and public hearings into the following matters: (A) the operations, solvency, and regulation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association, and any subsidiary, affiliate, or other entity owned or controlled by Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association; (B) the activities, investments, and tax liability of Whitewater Development Corporation and, as related to Whitewater Development Corporation, of its officers, directors, and shareholders; (C) the policies and practices of the RTC and the Federal banking agencies (as that term is defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) regarding the legal representation of such agencies with respect to Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association; (D) the handling by the RTC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation of civil or administrative actions against parties regarding Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association. (E) the sources of funding and the lending practices of Capital Management Services, Inc., and its supervision and regulation by the Small Business Administration, including any alleged diversion of funds to Whitewater Development Corporation; (F) the bond underwriting contracts between Arkansas Development Finance Authority and Lasater & Company; and (G) the lending activities of Perry County Bank, Perryville, Arkansas, in connection with the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial election. These various subjects, seemingly disparate, are nevertheless woven together by common and recurring themes of abuse of power, fraud on federal institutions and theft of public funds, and frequent neglect, if not deliberate disregard, of professional, ethical, and, at times, legal standards. The Special Committee completed its task under Resolution 120 in a bipartisan manner. With few notable exceptions, the Special Committee conducted its investigation and public hearings by mutual consent between the Chairman and Ranking Member, thus obviating the need for votes by the Special Committee. Because the testimony of witnesses before the Special Committee was often contradictory, incomplete, or inaccurate as to important events and actions, the Committee placed particular emphasis on available documentary evidence. Unfortunately, throughout its inquiry, the Committee was hindered by parties unduly delaying the production of, or withholding outright, documents critical to its investigation. Although the White House was most often and most notably engaged in this course of action, the pattern of noncooperation extended to other parties, as this Report lays out more fully in the Washington Phase of the Special Committee's inquiry. This Report of the Special Committee is divided into three separate but interrelated parts. Part 1 focuses on the Foster Phase of the inquiry, into whether White House officials engaged in improper conduct in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of his death. Part 2 summarizes the Special Committee's investigation into the Washington Phase and discusses the handling of federal investigations into Whitewater and related matters, the Administration's attempts to interfere with these investigations, and the White House's attempts to interfere with Congressional inquiries into the Administration's alleged improprieties. Part 3 centers on the Arkansas Phase and details the transactions and activities that comprise Governor Clinton's web of political, personal, and business relationships--a web that includes, among others, Whitewater, Madison, CMS, James McDougal, David Hale, and Danny Ray Lasater. Each Part begins with a separate, detailed outline and concludes with respective endnotes. These three parts are interrelated because the entire story of Whitewater is not simply the sum of its parts. Rather, seeping through the pages that follow are clearly identifiable patterns of motivation, conduct, and, at times, concealment. Beyond discrete judgments of impropriety in particular instances, therefore, the Special Committee has examined the evidence and reached conclusions that transcend any individual persons, actions, or events but rather illuminate patterns of conduct behind the Whitewater affair. The Conclusions of the Special Committee are summarized at the beginning of each Part. They do not answer all questions and allegations that have surfaced, but, taken together, they provide a comprehensive survey of the facts uncovered by the Special Committee in its 13 months of investigation. And they offer a full, fair, and often troubling picture of the inner workings of government that the Senate, by an overwhelming mandate, charged the Special Committee to present to the American people.

''--Diary of Roger Altman, former Deputy Secretary of Treasury, quoting Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady.8 ``Ms. Thomases and the First Lady may have been concerned about anyone having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office.''--Associate White House Counsel Stephen Neuwirth.9 The death of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr. on July 20, 1993 marked the first time since the death of Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in 1949 that a high- ranking U.S. official took his own life.10 Now, almost three years later, the circumstances surrounding Mr. Foster's tragic death remain the subject of much speculation and even suspicion. Against the backdrop of the death of a high-ranking U.S. official, this controversy has been fueled by a series of misguided actions taken by senior White House officials to shield the documents in Mr. Foster's office from independent career law enforcement investigators and to spirit the documents to the White House Residence. As Deputy Counsel to the President, Mr. Foster was the number two lawyer in the White House. He worked on the most important public issues faced by the new Clinton Administration. At the time of his death, Mr. Foster also was one of the Clintons' key advisors on Whitewater and Travelgate. These matters are now the subject of criminal investigations by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In fact, by July 20, 1993, federal investigators already were examining Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, the S&L; at the center of the Whitewater affair, as well as the controversial firing in May 1993 of seven career White House Travel Office employees. Mr. Foster's office contained important evidence of actions that the Clintons and senior White House officials took with respect to Whitewater and Travelgate. The Special Committee's investigation into the handling of Mr. Foster's documents was among the most important matters of inquiry under Resolution 120. It raised the question, once again in our nation's history, whether the power of the White House was misused to serve the purely private ends of the President and his associates: specifically, whether senior officials took improper steps, in their handling of Mr. Foster's documents, to cover up embarrassing revelations or even crimes relating to Whitewater and Travelgate. Often, the successful prosecution of financial crimes and public corruption depends on the documentary trail left by the perpetrators of such wrongdoing. For example, Independent Counsel Starr recently obtained the convictions of Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan McDougal, the owners of Madison Guaranty and the Clintons' partners in the Whitewater real estate development, in part on the basis of more than 600 documents introduced into evidence. By the same token, the concealment or removal of documents can seriously delay or derail investigation of financial malfeasance. The White House undeniably mishandled the review of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death. Department of Justice and Park Police investigators told the Special Committee that their investigations were hindered and impeded by the refusal of senior White House officials to allow them to review Mr. Foster's documents. The question before the Committee, then, is whether senior White House officials simply committed an inexplicable series of blunders and misjudgments or whether these officials deliberately interfered with the investigations into Mr. Foster's death and, perhaps, into the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs. After careful review of all the evidence, the Special Committee concludes that senior White House officials, particularly members of the Office of the White House Counsel, engaged in a pattern of highly improper conduct in their handling of the documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death. These senior White House officials deliberately prevented career law enforcement officers from the Department of Justice and Park Police from fully investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Foster's death, including whether he took his own life because of troubling matters involving the President and Mrs. Clinton. At every turn, senior White House officials prevented Justice Department and Park Police investigators from examining the documents in Mr. Foster's office, particularly those relating to the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs then under investigation. This pattern of concealment and obstruction continues even to the present day. The Special Committee concludes that senior White House officials and other close Clinton associates were not candid in their testimony before the Committee. Specifically, the Committee concludes that Margaret Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady, Susan Thomases, a New York attorney and close advisor to Mrs. Clinton, Bernard Nussbaum, then-White House Counsel, and Webster Hubbell, former Associate Attorney General and now-convicted felon, all provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to the Committee in order to conceal Mrs. Clinton's pivotal role in the decisions surrounding the handling of Mr. Foster's documents following his death. Finally, the Special Committee concludes that the misconduct surrounding the handling of Mr. Foster's documents is part of a larger and more troubling pattern, that began in Arkansas in the 1980s and has continued in Washington during the Clinton Administration, in which the Clintons and their associates have sought to hinder, impede and control investigations into Madison Guaranty S&L; and the Whitewater real estate investment. Parts of this larger pattern include (i) Mrs. Clinton's decision in 1988--when federal investigators were examining possible misconduct leading to Madison Guaranty's failure just two years before--to order the destruction of records relating to her representation of this S&L; (ii) Mr. Foster's and Mr. Hubbell's improper and unauthorized 1992 removal of Rose Law Firm records and files relating to Mrs. Clinton's representation of this corrupt S&L; and (iii) and the improper communication to White House officials during the fall of 1993 of confidential information relating to ongoing criminal investigations of Madison Guaranty and of Capital Management Services, Inc., a small business investment company also central to the Whitewater affair. By the time of Vincent Foster's death in July 1993, the Clintons had established a pattern of concealing their involvement with Whitewater and the McDougals' Madison Guaranty S&L; The actions of senior White House officials and other close Clinton associates in the days and weeks following Mr. Foster's death cannot be viewed in a vacuum. Their actions were but part of a pattern that began in 1988 of concealing, controlling and even destroying damaging information concerning the Whitewater real estate investment and the Clintons' ties to James and Susan McDougal and the Madison S&L.; Indeed, at the time of Mr. Foster's death, the Clintons and their associates were aware that the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater land deal, the McDougals, and the Madison S&L; might subject them to civil liability and even criminal investigation. In 1988, Mrs. Clinton ordered the destruction of records relating to her representation of Mr. McDougal's Madison S&L.;11 This was not a routine destruction of records. At the time, federal regulators were investigating the operation and solvency of Madison in anticipation of taking it over. These Rose Law Firm records, which after Madison's failure would have belonged to the Resolution Trust Corporation (``RTC''),12 were directly relevant to that investigation. By ordering their destruction, Mrs. Clinton eliminated pertinent records and also exposed her firm to potential liability with respect to her representation. Indeed, if such representation was proper, as Mrs. Clinton has claimed, her document destruction deprived the law firm of the records necessary to defend itself in a suit by federal investigators. Moreover, in 1988, Seth Ward, a former associate of Mr. McDougal and Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, was actually suing Madison Guaranty over a land deal that federal regulators have described as a fraud.13 Mrs. Clinton had performed work on the project, including having numerous telephones calls and meetings with Mr. Ward, and the law firm record of her work and the transactions surrounding this land deal certainly would have been highly relevant to the conduct of that suit. Accordingly, Mrs. Clinton's destruction of documents could constitute a breach of legal ethics and, possibly, a violation of law if done with the knowledge that the documents are material to investigations or ongoing litigation.14 Professor Stephen Gillers of New York University, a noted ethics expert, has recently stated: ``I don't know how it could be that these files were destroyed. . . . It makes it stranger that they were destroyed, not only so soon after they were created but also at a time when this lawsuit was about to go to trial. . . . It certainly could lead to suspicion that she has something to hide because one possible inference from the destruction is that there was something in those files that she did not want to have made public.'' 15 The pattern further continued during the 1992 presidential campaign, after questions arose about the Clintons' investment with the McDougals in Whitewater and Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty before a state agency. In an effort to respond to inquiries from the press and charges from other candidates, Mrs. Clinton's then-law partner, Vincent Foster, collected all the information he could on the Madison representation. At the conclusion of the campaign, the Madison files, which were by now the property of the RTC as conservator of Madison, as well as the files of other Rose clients for whom Mrs. Clinton had performed legal services, were secretly removed from the firm by another then-Rose Law Firm partner, Webster Hubbell. Mr. Hubbell removed these files, at times taking the firm's only copies,16 without obtaining the consent of the firm or client.17 Given that Mr. Hubbell was about to assume a position of great public trust as Associate Attorney General, his unauthorized decision to remove these files is especially troubling. Also during the 1992 presidential campaign, Mr. Foster or Mr. Hubbell ordered the printing of billing records relating to the Rose Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty. These important records revealed the extent of Mrs. Clinton's legal work for McDougal's S&L;, including her telephone call to Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the Arkansas Securities Commissioner appointed by Governor Clinton, about the troubled thrift's controversial proposal to raise capital by issuing preferred stock. The records also reflected Mrs. Clinton's work on the IDC or Castle Grande transaction, which federal regulators described as a series of fraudulent land flips.18 The records contain the handwritten questions of Mr. Foster to Mrs. Clinton and notations by Mr. Hubbell.19 Mrs. Clinton has recently stated through her lawyer that she may have reviewed them during the 1992 presidential campaign. After federal investigators began to look into matters relating to Madison Guaranty and Whitewater, a number of subpoenas were issued for these Rose Law Firm billing records. By then, however, the records were nowhere to be found. Despite extensive searches conducted by the law firm, neither the originals nor copies were discovered.20 They were not in the firm computers, its client files, or the firm's storage facility.21 Apparently, at some point, someone removed these billing records from the Rose Law Firm. In August 1995, Carolyn Huber, an assistant to Mrs. Clinton, discovered them in the book room of the White House Residence, next to Mrs. Clinton's office.22 At the time, Mrs. Huber did not realize the records were under subpoena, and she placed them in a box in her office. In January 1996,23 Mrs. Huber identified these records, and personal counsel for the President and Mrs. Clinton turned them over investigators. Mr. Hubbell testified that he last saw the records during the 1992 presidential campaign in the possession of Mr. Foster.24 By July 1993, the Clintons and their associates had established a pattern of concealment with respect to the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater and the Madison S&L.; Because of the complexity of the allegations of misdeeds involving these institutions, documents and files are critical to any inquiries into the matter. Yet, at every important turn, crucial files and documents ``disappeared'' or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised. The Clintons and their associates were aware, at the time of Mr. Foster's death, that the Clintons' involvement with Whitewater and the Madison Guaranty S&L; might subject them to liability In late fall 1992, Betsey Wright, the coordinator of ``damage control'' efforts during the presidential campaign and a former chief of staff to Governor Clinton, learned of a ``criminal referral regarding a savings and loan official in Arkansas and . . . involv[ing] the Clintons.'' 25 Ms. Wright testified that she learned this information from a Clinton supporter from California who had a friend who heard it at a cocktail party in Kansas City.26 At the cocktail party, an RTC official informed someone, whose friend reported it to Ms. Wright, that the RTC had just sent a ``criminal referral up to the prosecutor in Little Rock.'' 27 Upon hearing the news, Ms. Wright tried to gather more information about the referral.28 She then told Mrs. Clinton about the referral directly. Ms. Wright testified: ``I remember I asked Hillary if she was aware of any friend of theirs who was in a savings and loan business who might be under criminal investigation, and we couldn't think of anybody.'' 29 It is with this knowledge that the Clintons and their advisers came to Washington, taking with them the important documents relating to Whitewater and Madison. The documents (including documents improperly taken from the law firm) were entrusted only to close associates of the Clintons, chiefly Messrs. Foster and Hubbell. By March 1993, senior Clinton Administration officials confirmed that the RTC had sent a criminal referral mentioning the Clintons to the Justice Department.30 Specifically, RTC Senior Vice President William H. Roelle testified that, after taking office, Roger Altman, then Deputy Treasury Secretary, directed the staff to inform him of all important or potentially high-visibility issues.31 According to Mr. Roelle, on or about March 23, 1993, he told Mr. Altman of an RTC referral involving the Clintons.32 Powerful documentary evidence strongly indicates that Mr. Altman immediately passed this important information on to White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum. On March 23, Mr. Altman sent Mr. Nussbaum a facsimile with a handwritten cover sheet, forwarding an ``RTC Clip Sheet'' of a March 9, 1992 New York Times article with the headline, ``Clinton Defends Real-Estate Deal.'' 33 This article reported the responses of presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, to an earlier Times report on the Clintons' Whitewater investment. The next day, Mr. Altman faxed to Mr. Nussbaum the same article that he sent the day before and portions of the earlier Times report on Whitewater, dated March 8, 1992, entitled ``Clintons Joined S&L; Operator in an Ozark Real-Estate Venture.'' 34 In addition, SBA Associate Administrator Wayne Foren testified that, in early May 1993, he briefed Erskine Bowles, the new SBA Administrator about the agency's ongoing investigation of David Hale's Capital Management Services because the case involved President Clinton.35 Shortly thereafter, Mr. Bowles told Mr. Foren that he had briefed White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty about the case.36 Although Mr. Bowles did not recall being briefed by Mr. Foren about Capital Management 37 or talking to Mr. McLarty about the case,38 Mr. Foren's account was corroborated by his deputy, Charles Shepperson.39 Mr. McLarty's calendar indicated that Mr. Bowles had two meetings with Mr. McLarty at the White House in early May 1993.40 As of July 1993, therefore, Mrs. Clinton and others in the Administration were on notice that there was an ongoing federal investigation to which Madison-related documents could be relevant. At the time of his death, Mr. Foster's office contained damaging evidence about the Whitewater and Travelgate affairs After he became Deputy White House Counsel, Mr. Foster continued to play a key role in controlling potential damage to the Clintons from Whitewater. He was given the responsibility for overseeing the preparation of Clintons' tax returns for 1992 to reflect properly the sale of their shares in Whitewater.41 Mr. Foster worked with other White House officials in the Spring of 1993 in preparing a response to expected Whitewater questions.42 And, most interestingly, Mr. McDougal had left a message for Mr. Foster on June 16, 1993, ``re tax returns of HRC, VWF and McDougal.'' 43 The documents in Mr. Foster's office at the time of death included a file on Whitewater and his notes of conversations with the Clintons' accountant, Yoly Redden, concerning the tax treatment of the sale of Whitewater.44 The notes identified the tax problem as a ``can of worms you shouldn't open'' 45 and further warned: ``Don't want to go back into that box Was McD trying to circumvent bank loss--why HRC getting loan from other.'' 46 Mr. Foster also played a central role in both the firing of seven career employees of the Travel Office on May 19, 1993 and subsequent attempts to conceal Mrs. Clinton's true role in the controversial firings. Harry Thomason, a close Clinton confidant, reportedly instigated the firings after the career employees rejected his plan to obtain the White House's charter business for a company he partly owned.47 With public criticism growing, the White House circumvented normal procedures and directly asked the FBI (not the Department of Justice) to investigate allegation so possible criminal misconduct by the career employees of the Travel Office.48 Although Mr. Foster was not formally reprimanded for his role in the firings, he felt personally responsible.49 Other senior White House officials implicated in Travelgate include David Watkins and Patsy Thomasson. The Special Committee belatedly obtained a memorandum of Mr. Watkins outlining Mr. Foster's extensive involvement as Mrs. Clinton's conduit to the firings.50 Indeed, Mr. Watkins fingered Mr. Foster as the person who directly communicated to him Mrs. Clinton's order that the Travel Office staff be fired: ``Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action--the action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff.'' 51 Notwithstanding Mrs. Clinton's clear involvement in the firing of the staff, Mr. Foster and other White House officials did nod disclose her true role to investigators probing the affair. Significantly, at the time of his death, Mr. Foster's briefcase contained files, a personal notebook and a torn-up note, all concerning the controversial Travel Office matter. Thus, when Mr. Foster committed suicide in July 1993, White House officials were aware that a danger existed that the law enforcement officials might discover documents concerning Whitewater or Travelgate in his office. In fact, David Margolis, one of the Justice Department officials who attended the search of Mr. Foster's office two days after his death, was aware of an RTC criminal referral concerning Madison that mentioned the Clintons.52 This risk of discovery provides the backdrop against which the story of Mr. Foster's death and the White House's subsequent scramble must be viewed. White House officials engaged in highly improper conduct in handling documents in Vincent Foster's office following his death The evidence before the Special Committee established that White House officials engaged in a pattern of deliberate obstruction, and interference with, efforts by law enforcement authorities to conduct their several investigations into Mr. Foster's death. This White House interference began immediately following Mr. Foster's death on the night of July 20. Senior White House officials ignored specific requests by the Park Police to seal Mr. Foster's office on the night of his death.53 Instead, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, Chief of Staff to the First Lady Margaret Williams and Deputy Assistant to the President Patsy Thomasson entered Mr. Foster's office purportedly to search for a suicide note. According to career Secret Service Office Henry O'Neill, and corroborated by Secret Service records, Ms. Williams removed file folders from Mr. Foster's office that night. Even assuming, contrary to the testimony of Officer O'Neill, that no files were removed from the office that night, the multiple entries into Mr. Foster's office plainly compromised the integrity of evidence the Park Police considered to be valuable.54 Beyond this, Mr. Nussbaum not only ignored instructions to seal Mr. Foster's office, but also allowed Ms. Thomasson, a staffer without a security clearance who was involved in the Travel Office matter, to conduct an improper search of Mr. Foster's office. For reasons unknown--but to a large extent illuminated by Officer O'Neill's testimony-- Margaret Williams also participated in the late night foray through Mr. Foster's office. The next morning, on July 21, Mr. Nussbaum's personal secretary, Betsy Pond, also rummaged through Mr. Foster's office--ostensibly to straighten it up--thereby disturbing important evidence.55 Stephen Neuwirth, Mr. Nussbaum's associate, immediately recognized the impropriety: ``I didn't think it was appropriate for an assistant to Mr. Nussbaum to be in the office at that time.'' 56 Thomas Castleton, a staff assistant, also entered Mr. Foster's office in the morning of July 21.57 Only the Park Police investigators were impeded in their attempt to enter Mr. Foster's office to search for evidence. They waited in vain all day ``for approval from Mr. Nussbaum'' to conduct their investigation.58 In addition, members of the White House Counsel's office participated in the Park Police interviews of White House staffers, not to protect the legal interests of the staffers but, in the words of Park Police Detective Peter Markland, to ``report back to Mr. Nussbaum what was being said in the interviews.'' 59 The White House Counsel's office coached the staffers about their testimony during a meeting on ``comportment and interrogation.'' 60 The Park Police left with the impression that their interviews had been rehearsed.61 The pattern of obstruction continued with the White House dealings with the Justice Department. Mr. Nussbaum agreed with Deputy Attorney General Heymann on the procedures for reviewing documents in Mr. Foster's office.62 The next day, when Susan Thomases, a close advisor to Mrs. Clinton and a member of the Whitewater defense team during the 1992 presidential campaign,63 complained about the review procedures after a conversation with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nussbaum broke the agreement and changed the procedures.64 In explaining this about-face, Mr. Nussbaum told his associate, Stephen Neuwirth, that Ms. Thomases and Mrs. Clinton were ``concerned about anyone having unfettered access to Mr. Foster's office.'' 65 Contrary to his promise to the Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Nussbaum proceeded to review the documents by himself and did not afford Mr. Heymann an opportunity to decide whether Justice Department officials should be present for the review.66 The Special Committee concludes that Mr. Nussbaum engaged in highly improper conduct in braking the White House agreement with the Justice Department. Mr. Nussbaum, in effect, interposed himself between the investigators and the matters under investigation. Prompted by Mrs. Clinton, Susan Thomases, and senior White House officials, he made a conscious decision to interfere with a federal investigation. Beyond this, the Special Committee concludes that the ``review'' of documents in Mr. Foster's office on July 22 was a sham. Law enforcement authorities did not review any documents; Mr. Nussbaum relied on their presence simply to ``dress up'' the review.67 Mr. Nussbaum ignored repeated complaints by Justice Department officials that they had no meaningful role in the review, and that Mr. Nussbaum was providing only a ``generic description'' 68 of the files in the office.69 He carefully glossed over sensitive documents that he knew could embarrass the President and the Administration, including those related to Whitewater and Travelgate. Almost immediately after law enforcement offices left Mr. Foster's office, Mr. Nussbaum went to work to conduct the real search in secret. Michael Spafford, an attorney for the Foster family, testified that he overhead Mr. Nussbaum tell Mr. Sloan at the end of the meeting that they would look through the materials again later.70 Associate White House Counsel Clifford Sloan's notes of the meeting ended with the following: ``get Maggie--go through office--get HRC, WJC stuff.'' 71 Ms. Williams and Mr. Nussbaum collected the files, including at least one marked Whitewater. Ms. Williams then consulted with Mrs. Clinton, and transferred one or two boxes of documents to the White House Residence for further review by the President and Mrs. Clinton. In the case of Mr. Foster's highly sensitive Travelgate files, Mr. Nussbaum took the records to his office.72 There is also evidence that indices of files in Mr. Foster's officer were altered or destroyed after his death.73 These indices were the only means of securing a chain of custody for Mr. Foster's documents. In short, senior White House officials deliberately disrupted the critical chain of custody of Mr. Foster's documents and may have lost or destroyed evidence now highly relevant to ongoing criminal investigations of Whitewater and Travelgate. During the July 22 search, Mr. Nussbaum also failed to inform law enforcement officials that scraps of paper were at the bottom of Mr. Foster's briefcase. He was told by both Clifford Sloan \74\ and Deborah Gorham \75\ that papers remained in Mr. Foster's briefcase after his search, but did not inform law enforcement. When Mr. Neuwirth finally ``discovered'' Mr. Foster's torn-up note on July 26, the White House waited a further 26 hours before notifying the authorities. Although the ostensible reason for the delay was to permit the President and Mrs. Foster to review the note, White House officials conducted a series of meetings during this period to discuss the consequences of turning the note over to the authorities. Even without the benefit of all the facts uncovered by the Special committee within the last year, Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann aptly summed up the pattern of troubling behavior by the White House as it appeared to him on July 27, when he finally saw the note: I'm trying to describe a collection of little things, each of which I'm prepared to believe is just a difference of opinion, and in my view, a clumsy and foolish way to handle the matter on the part of the White House staff and Mr. Nussbaum. But they're starting to collect, and as they're collecting too much, and the last one's quite dramatic. I mean, first of all, we had a sensible system for reviewing the documents, and that's changed to a system that doesn't have any law enforcement input into it at all. It's changed without notifying me. I'm vaguely worried about the Park Police feeling that they're not wholly able to investigate those messages are not too clear. And then along comes a note that should have been found on the 22nd, if they really went through all the documents. I never looked at the briefcase but it at least worries me that perhaps it should have been found, and we learn about it 27 hours later.\76\ Mr. Heymann then ordered the Justice Department to investigate the discovery of the note and Mr. Foster's assertions made therein. Amazingly, the White House did not cooperate fully even with the new investigations ordered by Mr. Heymann. During official FBI interviews, where they were under an obligation to tell the truth, senior White House officials did not tell the FBI that Mrs. Clinton saw the note, and that Susan Thomases was told about it by Mr. Nussbaum, before it was disclosed to the authorities. At Mr. Heymann's request, the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility investigated Mr. Foster's assertion that the FBI lied in their report to the Attorney General on the Travelgate controversy. Mr. Foster's notebook on that matter, which Mr. Nussbaum found in Mr. Foster's briefcase, was critical evidence to that investigation. Nevertheless, instead of disclosing its existence to Justice Department officials, Mr. Nussbaum tucked away in his office Mr. Foster's notebook and other Travelgate materials.\77\ In July 1995, when he found out about Mr. Nussbaum's concealment of Mr. Foster's Travelgate notebook, the Director of the Office of Professional Responsibility at the Justice Department, Michael Shaheen, wrote an angry memorandum to Associate Attorney General David Margolis. After outlining specific instances of noncooperation by the White House, Mr. Shaheen concluded: ``The fact that we have just now learned of the existence of obviously relevant notes written by Mr. Foster on the subject of the FBI report is yet another example of the lack of cooperation and candor we received from the White House throughout our inquiry.\78\ Viewed in the aggregate, then, these numerous instances of White House interference with several ongoing law enforcement investigations amounted to far more than just aggressive lawyering or political naivete. Rather, the Special Committee concludes that the actions of these senior White House officials constitute a highly improper pattern of deliberate misconduct. Mrs. Clinton was closely involved in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office following his death and directed that investigators be denied ``unfettered access'' to his office From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death, Mrs. Clinton and her key agents--Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases--were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office. Telephone records indicate that upon learning the news, Mrs. Clinton first called her Chief of Staff, Margaret Williams.\79\ After talking with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Williams and her assistant, Evelyn Lieberman, drove to the White House and searched Mr. Foster's office. The second call Mrs. Clinton made on the night of Mr. Foster's death was to the residence of Harry Thomason,\80\ a key player in the Travelgate scandal. Mrs. Clinton then called Susan Thomases, who handled Whitewater damage control during the 1992 presidential campaign, and talked for 20 minutes.\81\ This series of telephone calls in the hours immediately following Mr. Foster's death established a communications triangle among Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Thomases, and Ms. Williams that would surface frequently in the handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office. The evidence strongly suggests that Mrs. Clinton, upon learning of Mr. Foster's death, at least realized its connection to Mr. Thomason's Travelgate scandal, and perhaps to the Whit
