In Minnesota, the campaigns of incumbent Sen.

He had also worked in the Clinton White House as a senior advisor during 1993-98, and was finance chair of then-Gov. Bill Clintons 1992 presidential campaign. Rep. Emanuel succeeded the late Rep. Robert T. Matsui as Chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in January 2005, and was later hailed by fellow Democrats as one of the architects of their comeback in 2006, when they won 31 seats to become the Houses majority party for the first time in 12 years.

Sen. Stevens is scheduled to be sentenced on January 26, 2009.



Sen.

Sen. Stevens was originally appointed to the Senate in December 1968 to fill a vacancy caused by the death of incumbent Democratic Sen. E.L. (Bob) Bartlett, and won election to his first full term in 1970.



The last sitting U.S. Senator to be convicted in a criminal case was Harrison J. Williams, a New Jersey Democrat found guilty in May 1981 of bribery and conspiracy charges related to the Abscam affair. He resigned his Senate seat ten months later.

Democrat Jackie Speier, a former Congressional staffer who served for 18 years in the California Legislature, won an April 8 special election to succeed the late Rep.

Speier worked on Capitol Hill as Legislative Counsel for Rep. Leo J. Ryan (D CA).

Rep. Andrews to challenge Sen. Lautenberg in New Jersey Democratic Contest



Nine-term New Jersey Rep. Robert E. Andrews (D) announced April 2 that he will challenge 84-year old incumbent Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg in the states June 3 primary. Rep. Andrews, 50, said in a statement that after consulting with family, friends, supporters and people from all points of view, I have decided that I will place my name and my credentials before the people of New Jersey to serve as their new United States senator. The people of New Jersey deserve to choose their senator.



Rep. Andrewss announcement comes despite the efforts of the seven members of New Jerseys Democratic Congressional delegation to discourage him from running. The states six other Democratic House members  Rush Holt, Frank Pallone, Jr., William J. Pascrell, Jr., Donald M. Payne, Steve Rothman and Albio Sires  have all pledged to share their ballot line in their districts with Sen. Lautenberg. U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D), Gov. Jon Corzine (D), State Democratic Party chair Joseph Cryan, Jersey City Mayor Jerramiah Healy, and Newark Mayor Cory Booker have also announced their support for Sen. Lautenberg.

Rep. Wynn (D MD-4) to resign from House in June

Rep. Wynns departure could set the stage for a special election where the Democratic nominee who defeated him in February, Donna Edwards, would be favored to win in Marylands Fourth Congressional District, which takes in parts of Prince Georges and Montgomery counties. However, Maryland election laws also give Gov. Martin OMalley (D) the option of leaving the seat vacant until the regular general election on November 4.

Rep. Thomas M. Reynolds (R NY-26) announced March 20 that he would not run for reelection to the House seat he has held since 1999. Rep.

This year, Davis and two other Democrats, Jonathan Powers of Clarence and Alice J. Kryzan of Buffalo, are seeking their partys nomination. Among Republicans, State Assemblyman James E. Hayes of Amherst and State Sen. George D. Maziarz of Newfane are considering their possible entries into the race.

Rep. Robert E. (Bud) Cramer, Jr., a member of the House Appropriations Committee and the conservative-leaning House Democratic Blue Dog Coalition, announced on March 13 that he would not run for a 10th term this year. Rep. Cramer, 60, said in a statement that [A]fter 28 years of public service it is time for me to step aside, spend more time with my family and begin another chapter in my life. He is the sixth Democrat who will not stand for election to the House; 24 Republicans have also decided against seeking re-election in 2008.



The filing deadline for Alabamas June 3 primary is on April 4. Democrats being mentioned as possible Fifth Congressional District candidates include State Senators Tom Butler of Madison and Parker Griffith of Huntsville, and State Rep. John Robinson of Scottsboro. Among area Republicans, Madison County Commissioners Mo Brooks and Dale Strong, as well as State Senator Arthur Orr of Decatur, may run for the seat.
