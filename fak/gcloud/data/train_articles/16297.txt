The roadway projects included in Proposition 1 are regionally significant roadways in Austin that fall under the operational purview of TxDOT. We work closely with our partners at TxDOT and they have estimated the total amount of new or extended lane miles to be approximately 15 miles. The estimated 15 miles is comprised of the I-35 related projects, the SH 71 projects, and FM 1826 project.

In addition, the other roadways in the Austin Strategic Mobility Plan (this information can be found on pg. 13) include key regional roadways that experience congestion, traffic safety and have multi-modal mobility needs. Immediate safety issues that can be funded within the budget will be implemented. Longer-term projects will be advanced into preliminary engineering in order to prepare for future funding opportunities.

Thank you,

Sam
