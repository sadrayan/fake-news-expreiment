State Medicaid Expansion Approaches
NOTES: *Coverage under the Medicaid expansion became effective January 1, 2014 in all states that have adopted expansion unless otherwise noted. Maine has adopted the expansion but is not included in the count of states that expanded through SPAs because it has not yet submitted a SPA to the federal government. Number of uninsured adults who would be eligible for Medicaid coverage if non-expansion states expand includes individuals currently in the coverage gap (<100% FPL), those who currently may be eligible for Marketplace coverage (100-138% FPL), and those who are currently eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled; US total is for all non-expansion states; state values may not sum to national total due to rounding. ^The Virginia House of Delegates voted 69-31 on February 22, 2018 to approve a budget proposal that would have the state adopt the ACA Medicaid expansion as well as institute a work requirement for many Medicaid enrollees. The Virginia Senateâ€™s budget proposal does not include Medicaid expansion. The final budget must get a majority vote in each house; the legislative session is scheduled to end on March 10, 2018.

SPA: State Plan Amendment. CMS: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
