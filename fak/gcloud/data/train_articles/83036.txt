Covering the Weed Beat: The Denver Post Wants Editor for Pot Website
Colorado legalized recreational marijuana use last year, so the obvious next step is everyone in Colorado finding unique ways to profit off it. In walks The Denver Post which is now, apparently, looking for an editor for a “recreational marijuana website.” Best. Job. EVER.

Again, I need to emphasize that this is not High Times doing this, it’s The Denver Post. Steve McMillan, an editor for public policy and digital publications for the Post, actually tweeted this out on Wednesday.

Needless to say, this shocked and surprised a lot of people, and McMillan tweeted this response to one of the bewildered masses.

And well, let’s face it, if newspapers get to have restaurant and wine reviewers, surely legal pot deserves the same mise-en-scène, no?
