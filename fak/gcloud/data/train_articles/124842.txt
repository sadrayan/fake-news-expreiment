David West reads Plato and Friedrich Nietzsche, runs a charity to help impoverished youths and sits on the advisory board for a renewable energy company.

So it’s no surprise that late Tuesday night, when news surfaced that Donald Trump would be the 45th president of the United States, the Warriors power forward followed closely. It was a sobering development for a player who is well schooled on African American history.

“This whole fairy tale about this post-racial utopia that Obama supposedly created is all bull,” West said after shootaround Wednesday. “That’s the bottom line. When you look at what the results say from last night, this nation has not moved a thread in terms of its ideals.”

West, 36, is an avid reader of the Economist and the Wall Street Journal. Though he has career earnings of roughly $88 million, he practices a frugal lifestyle and still owns the 2003 Lexus LX 470 he bought before he was drafted. West has stood last in line and two feet behind his teammates during the national anthem for years in silent demonstration against inequalities against black people.

Like many Americans, he is trying to make sense of how a man with a history of racist and misogynistic comments could be elected president. His only explanation is that the majority of the nation shares the views Trump has long voiced publically.

“The things that he said, the things that he represented, that’s the way that the majority of this nation feels,” West said. “I think he just emboldened them because he’s able to say it publically. He got the platform.

“It is kind of unnerving and unsettling. … The man’s 70 years old, so he is who he is. It’s just a shame that, throughout the process, a lot of these people were in hiding and waited for the cover of the ballot to represent who they are.”

West isn’t the only Golden State player not pleased to have Trump as president-elect. Shortly after political commentator and Democratic strategist Van Jones described during CNN’s election coverage a “white-lash” against an increasingly diverse country, Stephen Curry tweeted, “Van Jones….nothing but respect!”

Though he kept his most candid comments off the record, small forward Andre Iguodala admitted that he wasn’t surprised that Trump beat Hillary Clinton. He had sensed in recent months that much of the country was gravitating toward the former reality-TV star.

“We thought it was going to happen anyway,” Iguodala said.
