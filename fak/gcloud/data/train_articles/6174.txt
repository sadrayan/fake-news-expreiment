Donald Trump snubbed 'good friend' Tom Brady during the Pats' White House visit
President Donald Trump welcomed the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House Wednesday afternoon and while praising almost everyone on the team, from head coach and good friend Bill Belichick to rookie Malcolm Mitchell, there was one person not name checked.

Patriots QB Tom Brady.

“Whether you’re trying to win a Super Bowl or rebuild our country, as Coach Bill Belichick would say, there are no days off,” Trump began.

Trump then jumped into the story of how Belichick wrote him an encouraging letter during the contentious presidential election.

“He toned it way up! It was much better. Much better,” Trump said. “He made that the greatest letter and I did very well in that state.”

Trump then gave a special shout out to the fourth down conversion Danny Amendola made, which made for an awkward moment when Trump kept turning around to look at him, only to find out he wasn’t in attendance.

Trump also called out a laundry list of Patriots players such as Trey Flowers, Julian Edelman, Marcus Cannon, Matt Slater and Malcolm Mitchell, to praise their performance.

The one person who wasn’t name checked in Wednesday’s speech was Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady, who skipped the White House ceremony for family reasons.

Much has been made of Brady’s refusal to either publicly endorse or publicly denounce his “good friend” Donald Trump. Right before the election, Trump told a crowd that Brady was planning on voting for him, which was never confirmed.

Brady also skipped the Patriots 2015 White House visit. During that ceremony, President Barack Obama noted Brady’s absence during his opening remarks, acknowledging that a prior family commitment kept him away.

Maybe this is a slight, or maybe Trump just forgot about Brady’s record breaking 466 passing yards and 43 completions that lead the Patriots to their fifth Super Bowl victory.
