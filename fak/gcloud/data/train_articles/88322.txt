A White House report without merit
The Weekly Standard's Daniel Halper won himself another coveted Drudge Report link on Thursday for flagging a CBS News affiliate reporter's claim that White House press secretary Jay Carney receives questions from the press in advance of his daily press briefing.

Rather than question the report, Halper accepted it wholesale, replete with language like "CBS reporter from Arizona reveals..." and a sub-headline that reads, "It's just a show."

The report, by CBS 5's Cathereine Anaya, has no merit, as Carney and several members of the White House press corps were quick to point out on Thursday.

"Briefings would be a lot easier if this were true! Rest assured, it is not," Carney tweeted.

"Story is false," Fox News White House correspondent Ed Henry wrote. "Completely false for me -- not aware of others doing it either."

"Hey @CatherineAnaya, I am not sure which WH briefing you are referring to, but, trust me, @PressSec doesn't get my Qs," tweeted ABC News White House correspondent Jon Karl.

This gives you a little insight into how misinformation spreads online. Few websites, if any, have as much political influence as Drudge Report. A link featured prominently on its site will account for huge spikes in traffic. Hundreds of thousands of people, if not more, will read Halper's item, and many won't know any better. This item, meanwhile, will likely get read by a few thousand.

UPDATE (12:12 p.m.): By the time I went to press, Drudge had made Halper's story his banner.
