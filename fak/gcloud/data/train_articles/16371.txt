Subject: Re: Austin reporter

In the quote you shared Perry did not directly refer to Ukraine as a country with strong terrorist ties. But, generally speaking, there are no organizations or groups operating in Ukraine today that are recognized by the US government (or the EU) as terrorist organizations and added to State Department's FTO list. So Ukraine clearly does not have strong terrorist ties. Please call me if you need follow up.

Poroshenko has said the separatists should be called terrorists: http://www.thewire.com/global/2014/07/poroshenko-there-are-no-separatists-only-terrorists/374772/

Has the U.S. or other countries agreed with that?

No, none of the top US officials called separatists in Eastern Ukraine terrorists. That's the standard policy until US Govt officially designates these groups as terrorist organizations.

EU leaders similarly refrain from calling them terrorists.
