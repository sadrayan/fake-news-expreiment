VICE News Tonight also spoke with residents of Charlottesville, members of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the Charlottesville Police.

From the neo-Nazi protests at Emancipation Park to Cantwell's hideaway outside of Virginia, VICE News Tonight provides viewers with exclusive personal access inside the unrest.
