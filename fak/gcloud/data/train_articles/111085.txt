With less than six minutes left in the Steelers’ 37-19 victory at Carolina on Sunday night, Pittsburgh tailback LeGarrette Blount ripped off an eight-yard scoring run that was, by all measures, a textbook display on how to play the position.

First, Blount showed patience letting fullback Will Johnson execute a kick-out block. Then, Blount displayed the vision and burst needed to identify and get through the hole.

Then, at around the four-yard line, the 6-foot, 250-pound Blount lowered his shoulder into Panthers safety Thomas DeCoud and drove the defender backwards. Though DeCoud would eventually bring down Blount, that came after the Steelers’ tailback had entered the endzone.

In celebration, Blount got up and flung the ball right-handed into the stands.

However, for throwing the ball into the crowd, Blount was fined $5,512, the NFL confirmed to PFT on Friday.

For the record, throwing the ball into the stands is a fineable offense, per the CBA between NFL owners and players. It is a collectively bargained issue. It’s a line item in a 318-page document, one for which there’s a reason why it’s on the books. It is what it is.

But you know what Blount’s run was? It was high-level professional football. It’s the sort of stuff that quickens the pulse. It was a burst of brilliance, a little unexpected bonus for watching a simple running play off the left side in a 30-13 game and seeing it through.
