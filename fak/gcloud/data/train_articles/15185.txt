San Diego La Raza Lawyers (SDLRLA) had its first organizational meeting in 1976 at the Pioneer Room of the San Diego County Public Law Library. It was then an unincorporated association, made up of approximately 12 attorneys (only about 5 of whom were female). The organization was formed with a desire to effect change in San Diego by representing the interests of the Latino community, identifying issues which involved the Latino community, and advocating for those issues. Presidents of the unincorporated organization were Hon. Rafael Arreola and Hon. Roy B. Cazares. The first networking function ever thrown by SDLRLA was hosted at the home of Ramon Castro, a well known criminal defense attorney.
