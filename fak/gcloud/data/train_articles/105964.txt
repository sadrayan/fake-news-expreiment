Queen Elizabeth II wore a brooch during her meeting with President Donald Trump that she received from former President Barack Obama, People magazine reported Tuesday.

Obama gave Elizabeth the vintage green flower brooch during his state visit with first lady Michelle Obama in 2011, according to People. The Obamas hand-picked the brooch at a Washington, D.C. jewelry store.

A spokesperson for the Royal family denied claims that Prince Charles and Prince William did not want to meet Trump.

“In line with standard practice for guest of government visits, the President was received by The Queen as Head of State,” the spokesperson told People. “The arrangements were mutually agreed between the Palace and the U.K. and U.S. governments”

Despite the breech of protocol, Trump praised Elizabeth in his Wednesday interview with the U.K tabloid The Sun.

“She is a tremendous woman. I really look forward to meeting her. I think she represents her country so well,” Trump said about Elizabeth. “My wife is a tremendous fan of hers. She has got a great and beautiful grace about her.”
