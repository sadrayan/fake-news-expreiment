Florida Governor Rick Scott's Job Record, Florida Job Creation
Jobs in Florida: The Rick Scott record

Gov. Rick Scott has staked his political future on his ability to bring jobs to Florida, but the first comprehensive review of his efforts shows few successes and hundreds of unfulfilled promises. Since taking office in 2011, Scott has pledged $266 million in tax breaks and other incentives in return for 45,258 new jobs. But 96 percent of the jobs have yet to materialize, according to a Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald review of 342 job-creation deals that involve various tax breaks.
