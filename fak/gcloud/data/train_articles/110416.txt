Obama Confirms Hillary In Top Job
Barack Obama has confirmed his former rival Hillary Clinton as his choice for US Secretary of State and he has been unveiling his national security team.

Mr Obama said he was "confident" the team would help resolve some of the major issues currently facing America and the world.

Introducing Senator Clinton as "my dear friend" he told reporters she possessed extraordinary intelligence and a remarkable work ethic.

"She's an American of tremendous stature who will have my complete confidence, who knows many of the world's leaders, who will command respect in every capital, and who will clearly have the ability to advance our interests around the world," he said.

Senator Clinton went on to tell how, despite it being "very difficult" for her to leave the Senate, she was "proud" to join Mr Obama in a "difficult and exciting adventure".

Mr Obama went on to name the rest of his defence team, including defence secretary Robert Gates who will continue in his current post but with a "new mission" to end the Iraq war and hand over control of the country to the Iraqis.

The President-elect also introduced retired Marine General James Jones as White House national security adviser, former Justice Department official Eric Holder as attorney general and Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano as secretary of homeland security.

Mr Obama said: "I assembled this team because I'm a strong believer in strong persnalities and decisions."

He went on to assert his authority over the powerful group, saying: "As Harry Truman said, 'the buck will stop with me'."

Sky's US political analyst Jon-Christopher Bua said: "Obama is demonstrating that he wants all of these leaders to work in a close and coordinated fashion to use all elements of power to keep America safe and make the world a safer place.

"By picking Hillary Clinton and giving her 'the jewel in the crown' it is clear he is serious about using diplomacy before military force."
