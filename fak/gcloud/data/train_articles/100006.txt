Carbon levy and rebates
Bill 1, An Act to Repeal the Carbon Tax, was introduced in the Alberta Legislature on May 22, 2019. Alberta will begin administering the changes set out in the Bill effective immediately at the beginning of the day on May 30, 2019. The carbon levy no longer applies to any type of fuel as of that time. Fuel sellers are expected to comply with the proposed changes set out in the Bill. See Carbon levy – Information for fuel sellers and Carbon levy – Information for consumers for more information. Contact Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) if you have questions related to the federal fuel charge under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (Canada).

Overview

The carbon levy is a tax on transportation and heating fuels.

Carbon Levy

The carbon levy is applied to diesel, gasoline, natural gas and propane at the gas station and on heating bills. It does not apply to electricity.

Certain fuels, such as marked gasoline and marked diesel used in farming operations, are exempt.

The levy rate is based on the amount of carbon pollution that is released by the fuel when it is combusted, not the mass of the fuel itself.

Carbon levy household rebates

Single Albertans who earn less than $47,500/year and families who earn less than $95,000/year receive a rebate to help offset costs associated with the carbon levy.

Payments

Household rebates will be mailed or deposited directly by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in 4 quarterly payments: January, April, July and October.

If you have a spouse or common-law partner, the rebate will be paid to the person whose tax return is assessed first.

The CRA is administering the carbon levy rebate program on our behalf. For more information about receiving the rebate, visit the CRA website or call 1-800-959-2809.

CRA will use your 2018 tax return to calculate rebates for the 2019-20 benefit year. Payment information will be sent to you in July 2019. If the quarterly rebate for your household is less than $25, you will not get a payment.

Changes in household status

The CRA reassesses eligibility on a regular basis, as updated household information is received.

If your household qualifies for a greater rebate than what was originally paid, the CRA will issue an additional payment for the difference.

If your household qualifies for a smaller rebate, or no rebate, you will receive a letter from CRA indicating the amount you will have to return. To find out how to return payments, contact the CRA at 1-800-959-2809.

If your household receives a rebate for a family member who has died, the amount owing will be forgiven so the rebate will not have to be returned.

Support for businesses administering the carbon levy

Registration forms, guides and instructional videos are available for businesses that are responsible for remitting the carbon levy.

See carbon levy information from Tax and Revenue Administration.

Farm fuel exemption

The carbon levy does not apply to marked diesel or marked gasoline used in farming operations.

The farm fuel carbon levy exemption uses the same eligibility criteria as the Alberta Farm Fuel Benefit (AFFB) fuel tax exemption. The AFFB registration number will also be used for the carbon levy exemption certificate.
