The table is from our last job growth and unemployment article: https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/04-24-2018-job-growth-unemployment

I’ve attached my extract of the data for March 17 and March 18.

The mayor might better have said Austin is creating jobs faster than any other major metro, rather than creating more jobs, since some slower growing much larger metros are bound to actually be creating a larger number of jobs.

Note that for the purpose of this ranking, I rank MSAs and MSA divisions (excluding the ‘super’ MSAs, i.e., those with divisions). For example, there’s the Dallas MSA and it has two divisions Dallas (7 counties) and Fort Worth (6 counties). I treat/rank Dallas MDiv and Fort Worth MDiv as metros (and exclude the Dallas-Fort Worth MSA). In the Excel attached, you’ll see the 11 ‘super’ MSAs separated at the top of the file and excluded from the ranked metros. I have a miscellany of reasons I typically handle MSAs/MDivs this way but if it seems like a complication you don’t want to have to allude to in the fact check, I could run you up a version of this that is just MSAs and excludes Divisions. It will make no difference to Austin’s standing in terms of creating jobs at the fastest rate.
