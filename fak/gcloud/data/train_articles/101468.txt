I Can See Your Voice PH: Alex may nakatutuwang hirit kay Wacky Kiray
Published on Nov 15, 2017

I Can See Your Voice PH is a mystery music game show franchise which originated in Korea. In every game, there are six ordinary people, some can carry a tune (SEE-ngers) and some are tone-deaf (SEE-ntonado). The exact number of SEE-ngers and SEE-ntonado vary every game. In every episode, a recording artist (Guest Star) must eliminate the SEE-ntonado based on visual clues until he is left with what he believes is a SEE-nger. This SEE-nger will have a duet with the Guest Star and receive a price. The show is hosted by Luis Manzano and features a panel of celebrities (Sing of the Crime Operatives) who will provide a running commentary to help the Guest Star in his choices.
