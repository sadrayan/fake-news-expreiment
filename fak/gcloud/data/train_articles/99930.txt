Buhari is an economist, he will put another $5billion for the oil search in the north in his 2nd term. He has travelled to business submit in Jordan, where he will be talk on how to invest in invisible and unrealistic project, after all he is fighting kwarruption. Next level poo. 10 Likes

It's common sense not America wonder, you can find oil in sokoto, but will never see a drop in Kano although three are in the same region... Go and ask God why he distributed them that way. Oil in Syria does not need exploration, it flows like a stream,again you did to ask God why he made it so...so keeping wasting Nigerian money looking for oil where it does not exist...kwarruption fighter my foot.. They are looting the money in the name of looking for oil, so many oil well are untapped in the south south.

The fact still remains that Niger and Chad are in the North and still produces crude oil. The fact still remains that Niger and Chad are in the North and still produces crude oil. 2 Likes 1 Share

One of the major reasons that the North wants to hold on to power is their endless and fruitless quest to find Oil.

You're right! Not only that....they (this is the core muslim north by the way) want to hold on to power because they want to use the human and natural resources of Nigeria as well as any FDIs and funds coming into Nigeria from abroad to disproportionately favour their own regions of north-west and north-east. You'd be amazed at the amount of billions of dollars that's been wasted mainly in the north-east in the name of reconstruction...rehabilitation of IDPs....and fighting boko haram, and most of this money develops legs and runs off before reaching its final destination!



They prefer Buhari to Atiku, not just b'cos Buhari has better appealed to their islamic sentiments, and they feel he will defend and progress their faith better than Atiku who they see as more interested in a level playing field for all ethicities and religions in the country; they also prefer Buhari because he is remorselessly bigoted and vindictive....disproportionately favouring these two northern regions (n-e and n-w) in appointments and infrastructure, as well as 'dealing' with the infidel southerners very well (as can be seen with Onnoghen, the murder of IPOB youth, Mazi Kanu, Patience Jonathan, and many other southerners locked up or sacked for one reason or the other)!



People say they wish oyel will be found in the north, so Buhari and his kinsfolk can fuc/k off and go form their own country! I laugh at this! Even if oyel is found in commercial quantity in the core north, they're not going anywhere b'cos they want to continue using 'one Nigeria' to progress! Why do you think they hate the word restructuring, and rather prefer big gov't? It's so that they can control and continue to milk ministries and parastatals like aviation (airports), railway, customs, NPA, NNPC, UBEC (and other bodies that dispense funds in the education sector), ministry of finance, the armed forces, etc! They also want 'one Nigeria' so they can continue to have access to the sea...not just to control it! You're right!

The fact still remains that Niger and Chad are in the North and still produces crude oil. She said northern Nigeria not north Africa. Of course libya, Egypt are major oil exporters. But just forget oil in northern Nigeria. If you find it won't be significant enough for commercial purposes. She said northern Nigeria not north Africa.

"Crude oil cannot be discovered in any part of northern Nigerian no matter the depth of drilling, the $1billion wasted in oil exploration in the region should have been invested in education" — American Geologist and Former NASA Astronaut, Kathryn D. Sullivan. Trash!...



First of all, who is Kathryn and why exactly should her words be taken as sacred fact?... Is it because she is white or is it just because it aligns with the ethnic prejudices of some fellows?... how are we sure the so called Kathryn actually even made this statement?... Why is this report contained and circulated only in IPOB facebook pages and whatsapp groups?



Most of the oil fields in Nigeria and all over the world today were not known to be oil fields until exploratory drilling discovered the oil. Just recently, oil was found and is now currently drilled in Ghana... If there can be commercial quantities of oil and gas in the Lake Chad basin on the Chadian side of the border, why exactly are some folks who know nothing about petroleum geology so confident that there can't be oil on the Nigerian side of the same basin?

The choice of words are quite local, probably from the depths of an uneducated apprentice in Nnewi or Mokola.



In addition, no geologist can tell you with certainty what's going on in a sedimentary basin until investigations are carried out.



Usually such investigations require drilling which is what NNPC is doing right now.
