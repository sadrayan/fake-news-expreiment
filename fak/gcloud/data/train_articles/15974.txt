Please see the attached document, specifically the section showing the strength of the US Army from 1930 to 1941. Please note that these numbers represent active duty soldiers only, they do not include National Guard or US Army Reserve soldiers. The numbers dramatically jumped in 1941 just prior to the US involvement in WWII because, among other things, the National Guard and Reserves were called to active duty.

We have no sources for the strength of the Portuguese Army prior to World War II.

Sincerely,

James Tobias
