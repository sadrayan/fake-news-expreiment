Gucci Is Donating $500,000 to the March for Our Lives Gun Control Rally
Two days after Gucci’s Fall 2018 men’s and women’s show, everyone is still talking about the “transhumans” with their unibrows, fake heads, and baby dragons. But today, the brand is making headlines for another reason—arguably one with wider-reaching implications: Gucci is donating $500,000 to the March for Our Lives rally for gun control, set to take place in Washington, D.C., next month in partnership with Everytown for Gun Safety.

“We stand with March for Our Lives and the fearless students across the country who demand that their lives and safety become a priority. We have all been directly or indirectly impacted by these senseless tragedies,” the brand stated in a release. Creative director Alessandro Michele later added: “I am truly moved by the courage of these students. My love is with them and it will be next to them on March 24. I am standing with March for Our Lives and the strong young women and men across the United States who are fighting for their generation and those to come.”

The news follows a string of donations from celebrities, among them George and Amal Clooney and Oprah Winfrey. Gucci has a way of influencing fashion and culture, too, so expect more brands and celebrities to follow in the coming weeks. Jeremy Scott has already spoken out and wore a demand gun control now T-shirt while filming with Vogue in his Moschino atelier; other designers are taking to social media to voice their support.

Watch this space for more news and mark your calendar for March 24, when the march will take D.C. If you can’t make it, your city might be planning a sister march, too; until then, you can do your part by following Everytown for Gun Safety on Instagram.
