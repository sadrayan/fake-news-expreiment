Reuse-A-Shoe: Shoe Recycling with Nike and Converse
The salty ocean breeze and a lighthouse signaling the finish line – that’s what participants of the TD Beach to Beacon 10K will experience this August 3, 2012, during the 15th annual race in Maine. Nike Reuse-A-Shoe will team up, once again, to support the 6.2-mile run and the charity, The Center for Grieving Children.

In 1997, Benoit Samuelson, the race’s founder and coordinator – and 1984 Olympic Marathon Gold Medalist –created the race for runners to experience the scenic training grounds. Her goal in this 15th year is to recycle and compost at least 75 percent of the waste from the race. Last summer, the race commissioned 6,000 runners and 10,000 spectators and Joan is confident there will be plenty to reduce, reuse and recycle again this summer. A green team of race volunteers will help ensure all recyclables are, in fact, recycled.

This year, to help the cause, Samuelson has applied to the Council for Responsible Sports’ to recognize the race’s sustainability efforts. Each year, the race holds a Nike Reuse-A-Shoe drive for participants and spectators who want to recycle worn-out training kicks.

It is a lesser known fact that shoes take hundreds of years to break down in landfills, so Nike Reuse-A-Shoe is pumped to be joining forces with the event again this year to keep those kicks out of the trash. In 2011, the event collected more than 200 pairs of running shoes and Nike Reuse-A-Shoe hopes to double that number this year.

Want to get involved? There's still time. The TD Beach to Beacon 10K isn't until August 3, and runners and volunteers are still needed. Be sure to look out for our bins around the course next month! For more information, please visit http://www.beach2beacon.org.
