Alabama is a state located in the Southern United States. According to the 2010 United States Census, Alabama is the 23rd most populous state with 4,779,745 inhabitants and the 28th largest by land area spanning 50,645.33 square miles (131,170.8 km2) of land.[1] Alabama is divided into 67 counties and contains 460 incorporated municipalities consisting of 169 cities and 291 towns.[2] These cities and towns cover only 9.6% of the state's land mass but are home to 60.4% of its population.[1]

The Code of Alabama 1975 defines the legal use of the terms "town" and "city" based on population. A municipality with a population of 2,000 or more is a city, while less than 2,000 is a town.[3] For legislative purposes, municipalities are divided into eight classes based on the municipality's population, as certified by the 1970 federal decennial census[4][5]. The class of a municipality does not change if its population increases or decreases since the population figures refer to the 1970 federal census. Any municipality incorporated after June 28, 1979 is placed in a class according to the population of the municipality at the time of its incorporation. Class 1 is defined as all cities with a population of at least 300,000, as of the 1970 census. Birmingham is the state's only Class 1 municipality.[6] Class 2 are cities between 175,000 and 299,999 inhabitants, as of the 1970 census. Mobile is the state's only Class 2 municipality. Montgomery and Huntsville are Class 3 municipalities. Class 3 cities are those with populations between 100,000 and 174,999 inhabitants, as of the 1970 census. Tuscaloosa and Gadsden are Class 4 cities with between 50,000 and 99,999 inhabitants, as of the 1970 census. Class 5 are cities with a population greater than 25,000 and less than 49,999. Class 6 are those with between 12,000 and 24,999 inhabitants, and Class 7 are cities with a population from 6,000 to 11,999 inhabitants. Class 8 includes all towns, plus all remaining cities with populations of less than 6,000.

The largest municipality by population is Birmingham with 212,237 residents while the smallest by population is McMullen with 10 people.[1] The largest municipality by land area is Huntsville, which spans 209.05 sq mi (541.4 km2), while the smallest is McMullen at 0.11 sq mi (0.28 km2).[1]
