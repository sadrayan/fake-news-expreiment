Subject: Best information on two fronts?

Folks:

...

Also, I am writing to see if the agency has information speaking to the state’s percentage share of public school expenses over the years. On this front, we’re checking a claim that the state covered 68 percent of school expenses in the 1980s and that share is lately 38 percent.

The current percentage covered by the state is included in the rider 73 charts published online at https://tea.texas.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=51539620034

The chart on the first page (using revenue) shows the state paying 40.8% of total revenue available to school districts for FY 2016.

I’ve got an update for you from yesterday on the Rider 73 charts I sent you. When looking at the chart on the first page (all revenue), we need to subtract federal funds from the $11,943 denominator to come to the accurate share of state and local funds. When you do so, you come to a total of $10,726 for state and local funds, with 45.45% for the state percentage.

I’m attaching a few pages from a report submitted to the Texas legislature for the 1986-87 biennium detailing the methods of financing for the public education budget in 1985. If you’ll look at the very last page under Methods of Finance, state funds were $4,723,259,468, out of a total of $8,319,020,897, with $2,973,690,561 from local sources and $622,070,868 from federal.

If we exclude federal funds, as we do for the rider 73 analysis provided for 2016, the total state and local is $7,696,950,029 and the comparable state percentage is 61.3%.

Thanks,

Lauren
