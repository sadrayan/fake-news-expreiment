Bluetooth tracker

A Bluetooth tracker, also called smart tracker or tracking tag, is a small device that can be attached to any object and monitored using a smartphone. Basic devices, such as a simple tracker you might attach to a wallet, keys, TV remote or a phone is a small square shape or a key fob design that emits an audible alarm when accessed via smartphone or mobile device application.

Tracking Distance

These trackers are limited in that the device attached to the tracker can only be found if it is located within the device's Bluetooth range. Typically the range of a Bluetooth tracking device is a 200-foot distance between the smartphone and the tracking device, so these trackers are useful only in situations where items are misplaced within a short distance from youâ€”like losing your wallet in between the couch cushions or when you forget where you last had your car keys. Some manufacturers allow devices to be tracked in an online community setting to expand distances in which tracked items can be located.
