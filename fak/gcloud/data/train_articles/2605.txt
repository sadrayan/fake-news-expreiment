Boehner Statement On Sen. Harry Reid's "Opt-Out" Plan

Oct 26, 2009



Washington- Congressman John Boehner (R-West Chester) made the following statement today in response to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s announced “opt out” plan for the government takeover of health care:



“Whether you call it a public option, an opt-out, a trigger, or a co-op, the fact is all of these proposals put us on the path to government-run health care. Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn’t the answer, but that’s exactly what the Democrats’ plan would do.



This “public option” is only one of the problems with this legislation. Will Democrats allow states to opt out of the job-killing tax increases, unfunded mandates, and Medicare cuts for American seniors? We don’t need to give states the option of skipping one portion of this big-government scheme, we need to scrap it and start over on bipartisan reform that lowers cost and expands access at a price we can afford – that’s what the American people want, and what they deserve.”
