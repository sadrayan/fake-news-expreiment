Two years, $7 million, 800 pages later, GOP Benghazi report lands with a thud
GWEN IFILL:

After years of investigations, interviews, and hearings, the House special committee looking into the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, released 800 pages of findings today.

The assault, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, slams the Obama administration for lax security and a sluggish response, but it doesn’t lay blame at then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s doorstep.

Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, the panel’s chairman, said Clinton, now the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, was never the focus of the inquiry.
