Star Wars: Han Solo prequel candidate Dave Franco describes the audition experience
Dave Franco knows first hand that a Star Wars audition is a unique experience. Though it may have felt like “most other auditions,” the actor told MTV News, “Because of the nature of what it is, it just explodes everywhere.”

Franco, who auditioned for the role of Han Solo in an upcoming Star Wars anthology film, continued to describe the situation to MTV. “Everyone’s coming up and being like, ‘Dude, what’s going on?’ And I’m like, ‘I don’t know. You know as much as me,'” he said. “I don’t want to underplay it, like, I’m very flattered to have been or to be whatever, wherever they are in the conversation, but, like, it is what it is.”

According to reports, Alden Ehrenreich (Hail, Caesar!), Jack Reynor (Transformers: Age of Extinction), Taron Egerton (Kingsman: The Secret Service), and Emory Cohen (Brooklyn) were also among those considered for the role, which sees a younger version of Harrison Ford’s iconic character.

“I’m not good with impressions,” Franco answered in response to whether he was trying to do a “Harrison thing.” He continued, “I think that’s the reason it’s so hard to cast this role, too. It’s like, do they want to like perfectly embody who Harrison Ford is, or do they want to go a completely different route? Do they want someone to look really similar him? So, I don’t know, I think they’re struggling with that, maybe.”
