Oklahoma part of growing voter fraud program
Oklahoma is among a growing number of states signing on to a program aimed at stopping voters from casting ballots in multiple states for the same election.

The Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program, established and run by the Kansas Secretary of State's Office, has been operating since 2006.

The recent addition of Indiana brought to 24 the number of states participating.

Kansas' Secretary of State Office looks through voter registration data and compiles a list of potential duplicates, which can be triggered by information such as matching names or Social Security numbers. Those lists are then distributed to participating states.

Nearly all the states surrounding Oklahoma are currently part of the program, with only Texas and New Mexico not enrolled.

Brad Bryant, Kansas state election director, said that from 2008 to 2010, there were only nine cases involving potential duplicate votes that were referred for prosecution, one in Oklahoma. Most of the thousands of cases flagged as potential duplicate votes have simple explanations such as a father and son having the same name, or a misplaced signature on a voter registry.

Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax said that even though the number of prosecutions is very low, it makes sense to participate in the program because it's a low-cost way to monitor potential voter fraud. The program is free and state manpower required to participate in it is minimal, he said. Before the program, there was no way to monitor duplicate voter fraud across state lines.
