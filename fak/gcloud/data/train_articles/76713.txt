The information is presented by experts from multiple government agencies that deal with intellectual property issues. Participants will learn: how to identify and protect the various intellectual property assets they have; the mechanisms for obtaining IP protection in overseas markets and strategies for determining where they should seek protection; how to record their mark with Customs, with on-site help, in order to exclude counterfeit goods from entering the United States; how to combat counterfeits on international e-commerce sites; and about government resources available to help U.S. businesses with intellectual property issues. In short, participants will learn information vital to competing in an increasingly global environment.
