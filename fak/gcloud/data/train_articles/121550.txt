Here's the Full John Kasich Quote About Women and Kitchens That Got the Internet Riled Up
Ohio Gov. John Kasich caused a stir on Monday when he made comments that initially appeared to suggest his women supporters were leaving the kitchen to back him.

"How did I get elected?" said the Republican presidential candidate at a campaign event. "I didn't have anybody for me. We just got an army of people, and many women who left their kitchens to go out and to go door to door to put up yard signs for me."

That quote made the rounds on social media. But it appears to have been taken out of context. NBC News' Kailani Koenig reported:

Still, a woman in the crowd didn't take well to Kasich's remark. She told him that she would still come out to support him but would not do so from her kitchen.

"I gotcha," Kasich replied.

Kasich's campaign later responded to the outcry over the statement:
