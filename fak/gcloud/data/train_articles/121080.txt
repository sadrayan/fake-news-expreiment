Clarification
An editorial in the March 18 Las Vegas Review-Journal stated Stanley Greenberg, husband of Connecticut Democratic Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, who has proposed legislation imposing new mandates on food producers, “is a leading Democratic political strategist and consultant with clients including pesticide and fertilizer giant Monsanto.” Both DeLauro’s office and a spokesman for Greenberg’s firm said Thursday that Monsanto has not been a client of Greenberg’s for more than 10 years.
