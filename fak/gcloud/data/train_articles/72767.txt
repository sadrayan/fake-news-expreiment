CBS THIS MORNING Co-Host Norah O’Donnell interviewed President Barack Obama today, June 20 at the White House. In an excerpt broadcast tonight on the CBS EVENING NEWS WITH SCOTT PELLEY (6:30-7:00 PM, ET), Obama said that ISIS militants have exploited a power vacuum in Syria to amass arms and resources.

A transcript of tonight’s excerpt is below.

O’DONNELL: Would that vacuum exist had we backed the moderate rebel forces in Syria?

OBAMA: Yes, I think this notion that somehow there was this ready-made, moderate Syrian force that was able to defeat Assad is simply not true and, you know, we have spent a lot of time trying to work with a moderate opposition in Syria. But as I said yesterday, when you get farmers, dentists and folks who have never fought before going up against a ruthless opposition in Assad, the notion that they were in a position suddenly to overturn not only Assad but also ruthless, highly-trained jihadists if we just sent a few arms is a fantasy.
