Governor Rick Scott to Illinois Business Leaders: Get a One Way Ticket to Florida
Fresh off of the news that Florida created 32,000 private-sector jobs in March and that Florida’s unemployment rate is below the national average at 7.5 percent, Governor Rick Scott today unveiled his “One Way” campaign. This campaign is designed to attract Illinois businesses to Florida because of the Sunshine State’s business-friendly environment.

Governor Rick Scott said, “My number one priority is to continue to make Florida the number one destination for business so we can continue to create jobs and opportunities for Florida families. My ‘One Way’ campaign is a great way to let businesses in Illinois, and around the world, know that they are welcome in Florida.”
