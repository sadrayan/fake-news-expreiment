The photo was published by the press service of Aliaksandr Lukashenka on his official website. During the visit of Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, he and the Belarusian ruler planted a tree in the Alley of the Honor Guests at the Palace of Independence.



The photo shows that it started raining during the planting of the tree. However, this did not prevent the leaders of the countries from watering the fir-tree from cans. Berdimukhamedov and Lukashenka had guards holding umbrellas above them.
