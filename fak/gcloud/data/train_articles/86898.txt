Election 2016: Exit Polls
Exit polls for 2010 will be available when all polls close in this race.

Methodology

Data for 2016 were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBSNews, CNN, Fox News and NBC News. The voter survey is based on questionnaires completed by 24,537 voters leaving 350 voting places throughout the United States on Election Day including 4,398 telephone interviews with early and absentee voters.

In 2012, 2008 and 2004, the exit poll was conducted by Edison/Mitofsky; in 1996 and 2000 by Voter News Services; in 1992 by Voter Research and Surveys; and in earlier years by The New York Times and CBS News.

Direct comparisons from year to year should factor in differences in how questions were asked. Race and sex were determined by interviewers in surveys before 1984. Independent or third-party candidates are not shown.

Population scaling is representative of the number of voters in each category.

*Change is shown in percentage points. When comparable data are available, this measure combines the change in Republican support and the change in Democratic support from the previous election.
