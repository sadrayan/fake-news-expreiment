Happy to provide what information we can. The DCC traveled on their first USO tour in 1979 and have since traveled to more than 200 locations worldwide to entertain troops and their families including locations such as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Cuba, Germany, Iceland, Iraq, Japan, South Korea, Kuwait, the United Kingdom, as well as numerous stateside visits.

Unfortunately, many of our files and records were lost in an office fire many years ago, so we are not able to account for the total number of troops and military families the organization has touched since their first tour in 1979. However, since 2002 (our earliest available records) the DCC have made 381 appearances, entertained more than 198,000 troops and military families on 78 USO tours.

As for any Bob Hope stats, all information related to Bob Hope and his support of the USO is property of the Bob Hope Foundation. It will be necessary to reach out the foundation directly for those records.
