Polls: Clinton's Lead Over Trump Increases in Three Battleground States
(FILES) This file photo combination shows Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton(L) on April 4, 2016 and Republican challenger Donald Trump on February 16, 2016. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump hit the campaign trail April 20, 2016 after their big primary wins in New York, with the Democratic frontrunner locking up the nomination, while the Republican billionaire's path to victory remains unclear. The routs on their home turf reset the races in their favor, with Clinton putting an end to rival Bernie Sanders' multi-state winning streak and Trump righting his ship after a series of losses to Ted Cruz that have raised the specter of a brutal battle at a contested convention in July. / AFP PHOTO / dskDSK/AFP/Getty Images
