Groundbreaking Federal Conservation Fund Expires
The Land and Water Conservation Fund was not supported by taxes. It was part of a deal with the oil and gas industry for offshore drilling. These energy companies paid royalties of $900 million each year to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This money was then put back into recreational spaces and natural habitats. That sounds â€¦ balanced. If we profit from the natural world's finite treasures now, shouldn't we invest in preserving some resources for the future? Drilling will continue and resources will continue to be depleted. Therefore, we deserve funding to combat this destruction and conserve land for future generations.
