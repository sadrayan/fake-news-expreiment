(a) Findings Regarding Progress in Afghanistan and Pakistan.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Over 40,000 American military personnel are currently serving in Afghanistan, with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the finest traditions of the United States Armed Forces, and are deserving of the strong support of all Americans. (2) Many American service personnel have lost their lives, and many more have been wounded in Afghanistan. The American people will always honor their sacrifice and honor their families. (3) Afghanistan and Pakistan are experiencing a deterioration of their internal security resulting from a growing insurgency fueled by Al Qaeda, the Taliban and other extremist networks that continue to operate along the western border of Pakistan, including in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), as well as in areas under central government authority such as Quetta in Baluchistan and Muridke in Punjab. (4) The United States and the international community have welcomed and supported Pakistan's return to civilian rule after almost nine years with the free and fair elections of February 18, 2008, and have supported the development of a democratic government in Afghanistan. (5) Since 2001, the United States has contributed more than $33,000,000,000 to Afghanistan and $12,000,000,000 to Pakistan to strengthen each country's governance, economy, education system, healthcare services, and military. (6) The governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan must expand the writ of the national government across all provinces to secure their borders, protect their population, enforce the rule of law, and tackle the pervasive problem of corruption in order to bring security and stability to their people. (b) Report.--Because the stability and security of the region is tied more to the capacity and conduct of the Afghan and Pakistani governments and to the resolve of both societies than it is to the policies of the United States, the President shall submit a report to the Congress, not later than the date of submission of the fiscal year 2011 budget request, assessing whether the Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan are, or are not, demonstrating the necessary commitment, capability, conduct and unity of purpose to warrant the continuation of the President's policy announced on March 27, 2009. The President, on the basis of information gathered and coordinated by the National Security Council, shall advise the Congress on how that assessment requires, or does not require, changes to that policy. The measures used to evaluate the Afghan and Pakistani governments' record of concrete performance shall include the following standards of performance: (1) Level of political consensus and unity of purpose across ethnic, tribal, religious and party affiliations to confront the political and security challenges facing the region. (2) Level of government corruption and actions taken to eliminate it. (3) Performance of the respective security forces in developing a counterinsurgency capability, conducting counterinsurgency operations and establishing population security. (4) Performance of the respective intelligence agencies in cooperating with the United States on counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations and in purging themselves of policies, programs and personnel that provide material support to extremist networks that target United States troops or undermine United States objectives in the region. (5) Ability of the Afghan and Pakistani governments to effectively control the territory within their respective borders. prohibition on assistance to hamas Sec. 21009.

(d) Report.--Whenever the certification pursuant to subsection (b) is exercised, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 120 days of the certification and every quarter thereafter on whether such government, including all of its ministers or such equivalent are continuing to publically accept and comply with the principles contained in section 620K(b)(l) (A) and (B) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2378b(b)(l)).

This Act may be cited as the ``Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and that I may insert extraneous and tabular material on H.R. 2346. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds. Mr. Speaker, we have a new President who has inherited a war he is trying to end. This bill tries to help him do that. We have no real alternative but to support it. I urge support for the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as members of the Appropriations Committee began the process of writing this legislation, I was hopeful that the House would return to its traditional approach to considering appropriations bills under an open rule on the House floor. Unfortunately, that is not the case today. There are Members of both political parties who have thoughtful and well-intentioned amendments that ought to receive the consideration of the full House. An open rule would ensure that each and every Member has the right and the opportunity to make a good bill even better. But Members on both sides are once again being denied this precious right. There is one exception to this rule, however. To cover itself politically on a highly sensitive national security issue, the majority leadership has included an amendment offered by my chairman, David Obey, that is self-executed into the rule on this bill. However, the Obey amendment only pays lip service to protecting our citizens from the release of known terrorists from Guantanamo into the United States. Mr. Wolf, who is perhaps the most knowledgeable Member of the House on this issue, offered an amendment in the full committee last week which was defeated on a straight party-line vote. Yesterday, Mr. Wolf testified on his amendment at the Rules Committee and he was denied the opportunity to even offer his amendment today on the floor. I don't say this lightly, but on this issue the majority leadership of the House appears to be more sensitive to the rights of known terrorists than the rights of duly elected Members of this body. What a shameful exercise this has become. House Members were initially led to believe that this legislation would be kept at the President's original level of $84 billion to fund only the critical needs of the global war on terrorism. As presented today, however, this legislation has grown to $96.7 billion since it was submitted to the Congress 5 weeks ago. The Members know that we face many crises around the world deserving our attention and thoughtful deliberation. It was President Kennedy who a generation ago reminded us that, when written in Chinese, the word ``crises'' is composed of two characters: one represents danger; the other represents opportunity. If there is any doubt about what we are doing, let us be mindful that the supplemental provides the necessary resources for our soldiers and civilians to wage a successful battle on multiple fronts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. We know that the Taliban is now increasingly emboldened and the situation on the ground in Pakistan is, at best, fragile. Closer to our shores, the potential closure of Guantanamo has become a symbol of best intentions colliding head-on with political reality. Chairman Obey's decision to withhold funding for Guantanamo is the clearest indication to date that the Obama administration still has no plausible plan to deal with this complex national security issue. The President owes it to the American people and this Congress to provide a detailed plan for the potential [[Page H5617]] relocation of detainees prior to any funds being appropriated for this purpose and prior to any detainees being transferred to our shores. As presently written, the legislation does absolutely nothing to prevent the release of detainees from Guantanamo into the United States, into our neighborhoods and communities, after October 1 of this year. These detainees, many of them well-known terrorists, trained by al Qaeda, would be released with no security risk assessment or even the prior notification of Members of Congress. Congressman Wolf and Congressman Tiahrt each had amendments addressing this critical national security issue, and both were denied the opportunity to offer their amendments on the floor. As a result, it is now only a matter of time before known terrorists will be brought to the United States on a permanent basis. Today, it is less clear, not more clear, what rights they will be afforded when they arrive and under what judicial system they will be tried. And, indeed, in many ways we will be treating them as though they were citizens of the United States. The insistence of the majority leadership to consider this legislation under a closed rule is disappointing because the bulk of this emergency supplemental was put together with very serious bipartisan cooperation. It is one of the rare instances in recent times when Republicans and Democrats have largely set aside partisan differences to do what is best for our country and what is best for our troops. I am deeply concerned about legitimate national security questions taking a back seat to political partisanship. But we must pass this legislation, even in its presently flawed form, to ensure that funds continue to flow to support our efforts to bring peace and stability around the world. I urge an ``aye'' vote on this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha). Mr. MURTHA. As all the Members know, most of this bill has been bipartisan. Bill Young and I worked almost every detail out, and it is for the troops in the field and the military families at home. For military personnel, we include--and I noticed there was a Member up not long ago who said what they did on stop-loss. Well, I will tell you who did what on stop-loss, this subcommittee, this appropriation committee did the stop-loss, put $734 million in for 185,000 military servicemembers. Recognizing the hardship placed on troops, we made sure that they will get $500 a month because of the hardship placed on them for an involuntary draft, in a sense. Additional military pay. We had several hearings on trying to figure out how much money the military needed to take care of the shortage of pay. Finally, we came down to $2.5 billion and we added that to the bill. TBI and psychological health. Nobody has been more in the forefront than Mr. Young and myself in trying to make sure that we have money. We put an extra $100 million there. Since 2001, there have been 42,600 diagnosed cases of PTSD and 58,000 servicemembers treated for TBI. Out at Bethesda not long ago, I just saw the new facility for PTSD. Orthopedic research and treatment. The bill includes $68 million. Nearly two-thirds of combat-related injuries require orthopedic procedures or treatment. Amputee rehabilitation. We put $20 million in. Joint family assistance. The bill includes $125.1 above the request and a total of $739 million for family advocacy programs. Yellow ribbon. The bill provides $238 million for information, services, referrals, and outreach to the reserves for that program. We put in money for C-17s, for 130s. We put money in for Apaches, helicopters, all of these things needed in the war effort. MRAPs. We put in new MRAPs. Strykers. We put money in for Strykers because it takes twice as long, and these are medical care Strykers, because it takes twice as long to get people to a hospital or to medical care in Afghanistan, and this will help that situation and reduce the time it takes to get to medical care. Bradley Fighting Vehicles. National Guard and Reserve. We put $500 million in the bill. Guantanamo. In the initial stages we took the money out and said give us a plan; and, of course, the chairman has developed a plan for that. We have withdrawal timelines from Iraq, August 31, 2010. Training Afghanistan security forces, $3.6 billion. Pakistan counterinsurgency fund, $400 million. And contracting. {time} 1430 And on contracting, one of the things the Secretary talks about and we talk about is that it costs us $44,000 more to have contractors in Iraq than it does to have regular troops there. And we finally said to them, Look, you've got to start taking the nationals there, putting their people to work, get the Americans or the foreign people--when I say ``foreign,'' other than Iraqis--out of the country. So we're going to get a schedule of getting the contractors down. The report includes language directing the Department of Defense to provide monthly reports on the number of contractors in the US CENTCOM Area of Responsibility. We have a heck of a time getting this. But this bill provides the resources and capabilities needed to support deployed U.S. forces. It is a completely partisan bill, and working with Mr. Young, I appreciate his cooperation and ask the Members to vote positively on this bill. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young). Mr. YOUNG of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that I rise in support of the supplemental. Most of the money in this supplemental is for our troops. It is for the war on terror, and it is to take care of the soldiers that are conducting that war. As Mr. Murtha said, we worked together to create this legislation. In fact, the subcommittee met and all the members had an opportunity to have their input. The majority staff worked very closely with the minority staff, and we feel like we have crafted a really good wartime supplemental. So I urge the support for the supplemental, most of which is the defense part of the bill. I want to say that I agree with Ranking Member Lewis on the issue of Guantanamo. I don't think we have it all figured out yet. I think just to say we're going to close Guantanamo doesn't really get the job done; there's too much to it. Last year, the Congress approved my amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill and said you can't close Guantanamo until you do two things: one, have a plan as to what you will do with the detainees; and number two, which doesn't get mentioned very often, have a plan of what you are going to do with the facilities. As appropriators, we know that we spent close to half a billion dollars creating a medium-security holding facility and a maximum- security holding facility. They're state-of-the-art facilities. If you have to be in prison somewhere, Guantanamo is the place to be, because these are really nice facilities. What are we going to do with half a billion dollars worth of detainee facilities? I think we need to know the answer to that. In my amendment last year, the legislation required the administration to report within 180 days of what the plan would be on those two issues. That has not happened to this day. We can't deal with Guantanamo lightly. We can't bring terrorists who have been responsible for killing many Americans into the United States without careful consideration. My preference would be not to bring them into the United States. I may be in the minority on that issue. But anyway, the overall bill is a good bill, and I do support it. I congratulate Mr. Obey, the chairman, and Mr. Lewis, the ranking member. And certainly, having worked with Chairman Murtha to craft the defense part of this bill, it's one that we can all support without any hesitation. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), [[Page H5618]] the chairwoman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee. Mrs. LOWEY. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2346, the FY09 Emergency Supplemental. This legislation provides the resources our military, diplomatic, and development personnel need to make our Nation more secure. I was very pleased to work in a bipartisan way with Kay Granger. The Obama administration's policy to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is critical to prevent the region from being a base for terrorist plots against the United States and our allies. H.R. 2346 provides $3.8 billion for economic security initiatives in the region and funds our diplomatic development personnel and their security. I welcome the administration's efforts to forge a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. This legislation provides economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to the West Bank and Gaza to encourage stability and political moderation. It ensures that Hamas and other terrorist organizations do not receive taxpayer funds and that a potential unity government and all its ministers publicly recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence, and adhere to past agreements before receiving U.S. assistance. H.R. 2346 also provides $470 million to help Mexico fight violent narcotraffickers with surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and law enforcement equipment, and to support rule of law programs, bringing to $1.17 billion the total appropriated in 2008 and 2009
