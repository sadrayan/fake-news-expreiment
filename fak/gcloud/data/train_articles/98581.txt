Philippine Statistics Authority
The Philippine Statistics Authority, as the primary implementing agency to carry out the provisions of Republic Act No. 11055 or the Philippine Identification System Act (PhilSys Act), has not yet started the registration of applicants for the PhilID.

Also, kindly take note that under Section 7 (c) (3) of RA 11055, the initial application and issuance as well as the renewal of the PhilID for citizens shall be free of charge.

Therefore, entities or persons collecting fees and representing themselves as authorized registration centers are not in any way connected to the Agency.

Relevant announcements will soon be made.
