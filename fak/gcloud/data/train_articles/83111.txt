Medicare Rights Center
About Us

The Medicare Rights Center is a national, nonprofit consumer service organization that works to ensure access to affordable health care for older adults and people with disabilities through counseling and advocacy, educational programs and public policy initiatives.

Since 1989, we’ve been helping people with Medicare understand their rights and benefits, navigate the Medicare system and secure the quality care they deserve. We’re the largest and most reliable independent source of Medicare information and assistance in the United States.

Our offices are located in New York City and Washington, D.C., but through our phone hotlines, internet services, large volunteer network and community programs we work with clients no matter where they are located.

Today, there are 49 million people with Medicare—and we’re here to help not just them, but also their caregivers and the health care professionals who serve them.

We empower Americans to help themselves, and when they need it, take action on their behalf.

We seek recognition of health care as a basic human right. Inspired by the struggles and stories of the men and women we serve, we seek a stronger, more effective Medicare program, one that should be a model to deliver health care to all Americans.

We need your help. The Medicare Rights Center is empowered to do its important work through the generosity of its many compassionate donors—corporations, foundations and individuals like you—who care about the well-being of our nation’s older adults and people with disabilities, and who believe that all Americans should have access to affordable, high-quality health care. You can make us even stronger and more powerful in our efforts. Please donate today!
