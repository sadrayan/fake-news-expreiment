Barack Obama presents Medal of Freedom to stars including Tom Hanks, Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jordan
President Barack Obama on Tuesday bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour, to some of the country's best known performers, scientists and athletes including Tom Hanks, Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jordan.

This was the last time Mr Obama led the ceremony, and he said this year's list constituted a particularly "good class", before praising them both for the work that made them famous and their charitable and humanitarian endeavours.

"Part of the reason these events are so special to me is that everybody on this stage has touched me in a very powerful, personal way," he said. "These are folks who have helped me become who I am."
