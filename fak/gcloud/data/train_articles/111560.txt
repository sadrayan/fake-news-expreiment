This guy, dressed as a Mexican wrestler, appears to be fanning the flames as a Donald Trump pinata is burned in effigy outside the California state Republican convention in Burlingame this afternoon, where Donald Trump is speaking. And appears a few eggs were tossed at it for good measure.

Burning effigies of the vocally anti-immigrant Trump has actually become a popular pastime in Mexico, and this was done all over the country during their Easter holiday.

After having to pass through a phalanx of protesters, some of whom tried to block his route to the event by blockading the freeway and a road leading to the hotel where it was taking place  he ultimately had to, on foot, hop over a freeway median to get there  Trump reportedly said from the podium, "That was not the easiest entrance I’ve ever made. It felt like I was crossing the border actually. I was crossing the border, but I got here." You can see our full coverage of the event here.

Here are a few more images, and a video, of the effigy.
