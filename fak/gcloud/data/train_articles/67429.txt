Fact checking Sen. Cruz’s claim of potential ban on SNL sketches
(CNN) – Imagine an America where a presidential impersonation on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" would suddenly become illegal.

In what brave new Orwellian world would "SNL" comedians become brazen outlaws just for mocking the oval office?



Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says that would be the outcome if the Democrats' new proposal for campaign finance reform were to become law. The amendment bill is designed to give Congress greater authority to regulate campaign contributions from corporations, after the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling.

It's an idea that Cruz says could potentially affect corporations' free speech, and he uses the example of NBC, home of "Saturday Night Live."

"Who can forget in 2008 Saturday Night Live's wickedly funny Sarah Palin?" Cruz said on the Senate floor Wednesday. "Lorne Michaels could be put in jail, under this amendment."

But CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin disagrees with Cruz, and lays out why the Texas senator is wrong in the video above.
