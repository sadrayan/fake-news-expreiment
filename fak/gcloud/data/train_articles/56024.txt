Ancaster home featured in SCOTUS nominee Kavanaugh ‘vandalism’ hoax
Either U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is quietly living in Ancaster or you can add that wealthy suburban community to the ever-growing "fake news" landscape.

If you don't follow (or are hiding from) U.S. politics, the judge is President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States.

He is also an increasingly contentious choice, thanks to sexual misconduct allegations that exploded during the highly partisan confirmation process. A U.S. Senate vote on the appointment is pending.

Over the weekend, a claim emerged on social media that irate "left-wing" protesters had vandalized Kavanaugh's home. It was widely shared by self-described supporters of the controversial judge.

But the picture accompanying the claim is actually a Spectator photo of an Ancaster home vandalized in 2016 after a beloved neighbourhood tree was cut down. (That might explain why the two-year-old story about tree-related rage was a top story on TheSpec.com Tuesday.)

The owner said she hadn't realized her home had become a "ridiculous" rallying cry for partisan conspiracy theorists until contacted by The Spectator.

"Maybe this is my time to sell," she said sarcastically. The woman asked not to be identified because she is still worried and "haunted" by the unprosecuted vandalism, which featured a threat to burn down her home.

"I didn't like seeing it then. I'm obviously not going to like seeing it all over (online)," she said.

Searching out the origin of a photo is often a quick and reliable way to "debunk" a dubious purported news story, said Mark Busser, who ensures his students learn how to "reverse search" images online as part of course he teaches on fake news and conspiracy theories at McMaster University.

In this case, the photo isn't the only hint the story is an obvious hoax.
