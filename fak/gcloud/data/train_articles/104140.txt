Don't spend any money on the New York Times and don't click buttons on their website.



Don't give any money to people who advertise in the New York Times.



Write them letters about how them giving money to the Racist New York Times is costing them your business. Marketing people pay attention to that because it's a double loss. Not only is their marketing not generating revenue, it's also taking away from a previous steady revenue stream.



Capitalize Racist in Racist New York Times every time.



Don't even mention this lady.



They're going to lose a ton of money either way. They'll recover by either coming back to center or going all-in for leftist support, where they'll join like literally hundreds of other publications that don't make nearly as much money as they could if they would have just reported facts since day one and were still reporting facts.
