During a rally in West Virginia, Trump was presented with a hard hat from a miners union that endorsed him, which he donned onstage, then tried to fix his hair.

“My hair look alright? Give me a little spray,” he said. “You know you’re not allowed to use hairspray anymore because it affects the ozone. You know that, right?"

“In the old days you’d put the hairspray on and it was good. Today, you put the hairspray on and it’s good for 12 minutes."

Trump expressed disbelief that hairspray affects the ozone layer when used indoors.

“I say no way, folks. No way. No way," he said. "That’s like a lot of the rules and regulations you people have in the mines, right? The same kind of stuff.”
