[Press Release] Statement of Gov. Rick Perry Regarding President Bush's Immigration Proposal
Statement of Gov. Rick Perry Regarding President Bush's Immigration Proposal

“During my visit with President Fox last November, I reaffirmed my support for a guest worker program that balances our two countries’ economic realities along with the need for homeland security. President Bush’s proposal reflects those goals.

“As a former governor of this state, President Bush understands well the huge impact that immigration has on Texas, as well as the importance of developing a plan that simplifies the legal immigration process while discouraging individuals from entering this country illegally.

“I commend the President for his leadership on an issue that has tremendous impact in our state. Texas will no doubt play a key role in discussions that will help shape a final strategy, and I look forward to working with the President in the coming months.”
