Honda Responds
Honda and our associates and dealers offer our sincere condolences and respect to the victims and families involved in the tragic events of September 11, 2001. We also offer our deep appreciation and support for the inspiring efforts of the thousands of American heroes involved in rescue and recovery during this time of national need.



- The Honda Family of Companies



Together with our associates, Honda is working to support assistance programs designed to help cope with these devastating losses.



Direct associate contributions have raised $448,534 from thousands of Honda associates, contractors and retirees from every Honda company in North America.



In addition, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., Honda of America Mfg., Inc. and other sister companies in North America have contributed a total of $1,100,534, including company matching funds and direct cash contributions.



These combined efforts total $1,549,068. The bulk of these funds have been earmarked to the United Way of New York "September 11 Fund," and the American Red Cross.



As an immediate step, Honda donated all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) to help rescue workers quickly navigate the difficult terrain around the World Trade Center. These vehicles provide immediate aid to speed recovery efforts and cleanup in the area. Other material contributions include water pumps and generators to assist City of New York Fire Department crews with cleanup and repair efforts. We remain in touch with New York authorities to determine their need for additional equipment. Honda had previously donated commercial generators to the American Red Cross for use in disaster-relief efforts such as this.



Honda continues to evaluate the most effective and meaningful ways to address the needs brought about by these tragic events.
