Seminole Tribe Wins Big With New Compact, Expands Florida Gaming
The Seminole Tribe of Florida — the longtime biggest player in the state's gaming industry — has finally inked a deal with Governor Rick Scott designed to ensure the tribe remains the top shop in games of chance in the state. The new compact, however, also opens the door for an expansion of the Florida's gaming scene — a move that has critics already crying foul.

Under the new proposal, the details of which were released Monday night, the Seminoles will maintain an exclusive right to blackjack gaming at their seven casinos for the next seven years. The new compact also allows the tribe to expand craps and roulette at their properties. Pending approval by the state leguslature, the new deal means the tribe will hand over to the state a $3 billion cut in revenues.

“With a $3 billion guarantee along with a cap on the tribe’s gaming, it is my hope that this compact can be the foundation of a stable and predictable gaming environment for the state of Florida,” Scott wrote in letter this week to members of the legislature. “My execution of this compact is the first step in the process outlined in law, and I look forward to continuing to work with you and your respective chambers this session in order to ratify this $3 billion historic agreement.”
