About PublicData.com

PublicData was started on September 1, 1997 and was originally incorporated outside the United States. In 1997, government attitude toward making access to public records easy and inexpensive was to confront those who did so with threats of prosecution and civil penalties. Ultimately, after some lobbying and law changes; PublicData was moved into the US in 2004.

Governments (federal, state, local) within the US generally remain opposed to the idea of PublicData.com and look for ways to discourage general public access to Public Records (simply put, governments view this as a loss of their power and control). It is common for opportunistic politicians or bureaucrats to jump onto manufactured stories of a criminal element using information from PublicData.com to perpetrate a crime. These "keepers of the public trust" are motivated by their own quest for power by duping the public into demanding that access to Public Records be restricted. Now to be sure, criminals have used PublicData.com but we work very aggressively with law enforcement to help assure conviction.

We remain dedicated to the idea that all citizens of our free society should have access to all of the records that government collects (except information critical to national security and information involved in ongoing criminal investigation). Likewise we will continue to lead the industry in "low cost" real-time access to Public Records. We will continue to add to the number of database offerings while providing better performance and more value. PublicData.com purchases all of its data from various government entities (directly and indirectly) and is in no way subsidized by any government.
