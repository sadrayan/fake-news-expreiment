Love Breitbart hate new app

New app takes me to safari everytime I scroll thru a story. Ultra sensitive to the ads inside. Need to fix or I will not be viewing app any more!!! Come Alex, Matt, etc. We are better than that. That is on purpose as I updated 10 min ago to new app and started getting these problems immediately on all 4 stories that I clicked on. Unacceptable to me!!!
