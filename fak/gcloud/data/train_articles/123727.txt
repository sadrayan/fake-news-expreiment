Darrell Issa Hides On A Roof Because He Is Too Afraid To Face People Angry About Trumpcare
Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) was so afraid of a group of protesters that he hid on the roof of his district office instead of listening to his constituents.

Issa’s opponent Mike Levine tweeted a picture of Issa hiding on his district office roof to avoid angry questions from people about health care:

Yes, this is really @DarrellIssa on the roof of his district office building. Too afraid to come speak with assembled constituents below. pic.twitter.com/wCYRjO8Ev8 — Mike Levin (@MikeLevinCA) May 30, 2017

Issa did come out for 5 minutes to engage with the protesters:

Several hundred in front of @DarrellIssa's office this AM. Issa came out for 5 minutes but refused to engage with those across the street. pic.twitter.com/z6XEw1FPLy — Mike Levin (@MikeLevinCA) May 30, 2017

Here is a video clip of the protesters across the street from Issa’s office who he would not talk to:

Instead of owning up to his vote for Trumpcare, Issa is hiding from his constituents. A real representative of the people would have talked to the protesters. Rep. Issa should have listened to them, but Darrell Issa hid from them, because what is he going to tell his constituents?

Yes, I voted for a health care bill that will, at minimum force you to pay more for less coverage? Issa should admit that he voted to take health insurance away from at least 23 million Americans.

The health care issue isn’t going to blow over.

Republicans, like Issa, can hide all they want. They can avoid town halls and protests, but they can’t avoid being on the ballot in 2018.

The time is coming for Darrell Issa and other House Republicans to be held accountable for their actions.
