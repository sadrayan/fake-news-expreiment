Congressman Cantor: CBO Report Confirms What Republicans Have Been Saying For Years
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Congressman Eric Cantor (VA-7) released the following statement after the Congressional Budget Office released its latest Budget and Economic Outlook:

"The CBO’s latest report confirms what Republicans have been saying for years now. Under Obamacare, millions of hardworking Americans will lose their jobs and those who keep them will see their hours and wages reduced. How much more proof do we need of Obamacare’s devastating effects before Democrats finally admit the law they enacted isn’t working for America? It’s not fair to working middle class families who are dealing with canceled plans, higher costs and declining access to also see their jobs, wages and hours be put at risk.

"The CBO also warned that spending in Washington continues to head in a dangerous direction, despite the progress Republicans have made in reducing deficits since taking back the House. President Obama and congressional Democrats must finally stop ignoring the problem and work with Republicans to reduce spending, grow our economy, and ensure an America that works for everyone."
