PMI - Philip Morris International
We are developing the next generation of e-vapor technology

While heating tobacco is one possibility in developing alternatives to cigarette smoking, another approach is to produce a nicotine-containing aerosol without the use of tobacco. Our e-vapor products use nicotine that is extracted from tobacco leaves. These battery-powered devices – commonly known as e-cigarettes – vaporize a liquid solution containing nicotine and flavors.

In 2014, we acquired Nicocigs, a leading e-cigarette company in the U.K., which produces a variety of products (Nicocig and Vivid) that includes disposables, rechargeables, and tank systems.

In addition, under an agreement announced in 2013, Altria Group, Inc. has made available its e-cigarette products exclusively to PMI for commercialization outside the U.S., which we currently sell under the brand name Solaris in Israel and Spain.
