Friends don't let friends drink formaldehyde.

PepsiCo (the parent brand of Naked drinks) settled a 9 million dollar lawsuit because they claimed their Naked drinks were all-natural. They actually were found to have a bunch of nasty chemicals in them including formaldehyde (keeps your dead body preserved- no thanks), Fibersol-2 (“a soluble corn fiber that acts as a low-calorie bulking agent”), fructooligosaccharides (an alternative sweetener), other artificial ingredients, such as calcium pantothenate (synthetically produced from formaldehyde), and genetically-modified soy. They never recalled the drinks off the shelves. They never reformulated. Wanna know what they did in compliance with the lawsuit? They had to remove the word "NATURAL" from the label. It's still the same toxic concoction I was forcing my kids to drink because I believed they were good for us. Please dump this nasty junk down the drain if you have it in your house. Don't buy the harmful chemicals these companies hide in their "natural drinks". Tag your friends who drink Naked brand drinks. I bet they don't know how harmful they are !!
