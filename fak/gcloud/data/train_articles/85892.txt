State files appeal of ruling that favors judges on pension and benefits
The state Monday filed its appeal of a ruling that favored Hudson County Superior Court Judge Paul DePascale’s suit which argued that increasing pension and health benefit contributions for judges is unconstitutional.

Mercer County Superior Court "Judge (Linda) Feinberg appropriately determined that the action taken violates the Constitution of the State of New Jersey,” said DePascale’s lawyer, Justin P. Walder, last night when asked about the appeal.

In June, Gov. Chris Christie signed a law requiring all state employees to pay more toward their pension and health benefits in order to ease budget woes. Increased contributions taken from judges’ and justices’ pay checks under Christie’s plan began Oct. 14.

On Oct. 17 Feinberg ruled judges and justices are exempt from paying more because a provision in the state Constitution prohibits their salaries from being “diminished” during their terms. She disagreed with the state’s contention that increasing judges’ pension and health benefits contributions is not a reduction in pay.

Christie was infuriated, said the state would appeal and called for a constitutional amendment to allow for a reduction of judges’ salaries.

Feinberg has been criticized for ruling on a case that affects her, but case law allows judges to hear such cases when there is no other appropriate court to address the matter.

Feinberg’s ruling would have stopped the deductions but the state has also filed a motion asking for a stay during the appeals process. Walder has filed papers arguing that there should not be a stay as it would cause something that is unconstitutional and illegal to continue.
