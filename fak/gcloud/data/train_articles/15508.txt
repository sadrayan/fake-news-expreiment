Email, Alejandro Garcia, press secretary, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Feb. 26, 2015

Here is our reply:

It was an unintentional error. Texas creates more jobs than all other 49 states combined (2008-2014). That was the number he was thinking of as he ad-libbed the comment. But the fact that Texas will have an estimated $11 Billion dollars in the Rainy Fund by the end of the next biennium, which is second only to Alaska, is something Lt. Gov. Patrick and all of Texas should be very proud of.

Thanks,

Alejandro Garcia

Press Secretary

Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Texas

I am looking at Tables 28 and 29 here to see if there is data applicable: http://www.nasbo.org/sites/default/files/NASBO%20Fall%202014%20Fiscal%20Survey%20of%20States.pdf

Good afternoon.

I heard Lt. Gov. Patrick's KLBJ-AM interview<http://www.newsradioklbj.com/blogs/texas-news/listen-lt-gov-dan-patrick-pushes-big-tax-cuts-texas> today. About eight minutes in, was he declaring what I'm pasting below as a fact?

If so, I'd be interested in his backup information.

Patrick: "We are in the best financial shape of any state in the country. We'll have about $11 billion or so in our rainy day fund by the end of our fiscal year. That's more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined."

Thanks.
