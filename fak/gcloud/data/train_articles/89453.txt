Jonathan Boucher : R.I. would lose clout by sending Republicans to D.C.

Ian Prior�s Jan. 14 Commentary (�R.I.�s weakening influence in Washington�) about the Rhode Island congressional delegation�s losing its influence in Washington is not only misleading, but also completely inaccurate. It is also a serious omission that The Journal, while identifying Mr. Prior as the Northeast regional press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, failed to mention that he was also the campaign manager for Brendan Doherty who ran unsuccessfully against David Cicilline in 2012. With that in mind, it is easier for readers to understand Mr. Prior�s motivations for writing such a column.

The notion that all of our problems would be solved by replacing our delegation with a bunch of Republican freshmen is completely absurd. The current Congress, which is controlled by Democrats in the Senate and Republicans in the House, only sent 57 bills to President Obama�s desk in 2013, making it the least productive Congress in history � barely beating out the last Congress, which had the same division.

The House Republicans� failure and inability to govern caused the first government shutdown in 16 years. The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill, extending unemployment benefits, raising the minimum wage, and passing comprehensive immigration reform.

Electing more Republicans to Congress wouldn�t improve the situation; it would only make it worse. And the idea that four Republican freshmen from Rhode Island would all of a sudden save the day and deliver for our state is absolutely ridiculous. In fact the opposite would happen. Our state would receive less federal funding and we would be at a significant disadvantage compared with other states with more senior representation. Just look how effective the newest batch of Republican members were last year. Only four � that�s right, four � Republican freshmen saw their bills become law in 2013.

It�s also important to remember that the Democrats still control the White House for another two years and currently control the U.S. Senate. Even if the Republicans were to win control of the Senate in November, they would still have to go through a Democratic president to get their legislation signed into law and they wouldn�t have enough votes to override a veto.

The only body currently controlled by the Republicans is the House of Representatives, and the Republicans saw their majority shrink from 25 seats to 17 seats in the 2012 election. If the Republicans continue to play games with sensitive issues like the debt ceiling and unemployment benefits, the Democratic Party could win back the House this November and maintain control of the Senate.

At the end of the day, the mark of good legislators isn�t how many bills they pass into law but how well they represent their constituents and how hard they fight for their interests in Congress. And on this measure, the people of Rhode Island have outstanding representation in Washington.

Jonathan Boucher is the executive director of the Rhode Island Democratic Party.
