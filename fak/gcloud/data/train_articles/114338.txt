The Body Language of Liars: From Little White Lies to Pathological Deception-How to See through the Fibs, Frauds, and Falsehoods People Tell You Every Day [: Lillian Glass: 9781601632807: Books
I didn't really like the way the author placed the importance of seeing how a celebrity lied in the past. Most of the book is spent talking about the same few people and how they obviously lied. Although it is a little bit helpful in spotting a liar, there is nothing concrete in how to tell if someone is telling the truth. The author says a lot of "this could be an indication of a lie" and "this may or may not be a tell." I don't like how vague the author seemed to be throughout the book.
