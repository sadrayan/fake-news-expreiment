NDP REALITY CHECK: Stephen Harper’s billion dollar campaign?

When Steven Harper’s Conservatives came to power, they promised to do things differently.

“…fixed election dates stop leaders from trying to manipulate the calendar simply for partisan political advantage.” – Stephen Harper, May 26, 2006 “The previous Liberal government repeatedly abused the power to call general elections and this legislation will strengthen accountability and provide certainty by setting October 19, 2009 as the date for the next general election.” – Peter Van Loan, May 3, 2007

So Conservatives passed a law fixing the next election date as October 19, 2009.

Stephen Harper almost immediately broke his own law, threw out his fixed election date, and called a snap election in 2008.

“Prime Minister Stephen Harper pulled the plug on his own minority government on Sunday, setting off a national election campaign that will send voters to the polls on Oct. 14 at a cost of about $300 million.” – Canwest News, Sept. 7, 2008

Now, Stephen Harper’s Conservatives are at it again in 2015.

“He games the system….what it does is completely distort everything we've ever fought for, everything we've established as rules." – Former Chief Electoral Officer Jean-Pierre Kingsley, August 1, 2015, CBC Radio's The House.

Calling an early election is another hypocritical attempt by Conservatives to try and gain a financial advantage – and foot taxpayers with the bill.

Today’s election call will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions more – and the total cost for the campaign could now reach as high as $1,000,000,000.

While Stephen Harper’s cynical ploy will help the Conservative Party, it won't kick-start a sagging economy or put 1.3 million unemployed Canadians back to work.

Tom Mulcair and the NDP have a concrete plan to improve accountability and help middle class families get ahead. Tom is ready to bring change to Ottawa.
