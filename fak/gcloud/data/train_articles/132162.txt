Bill Clinton: 'Allegations Of Sexual Misconduct Should Disqualify A Man From Public Office'

WASHINGTON, D.C.—In the midst of Judge Kavanaugh's ongoing confirmation process, Bill Clinton offered a few words in order to discourage the Senate from confirming the man to the Supreme Court, claiming that "allegations of sexual misconduct should disqualify a man from public office."

Speaking to an interviewer on MSNBC, Clinton came out swinging, stating in no uncertain terms that "any single allegation of sexual misconduct should immediately call into question a man's ability to help lead a nation."

"How can you trust somebody who has some accusations against them?" he said thoughtfully. "I know for my part, if a judge or president had even a single allegation—let alone several credible ones—I wouldn't want that person to be representing our entire country. It just wouldn't make any sense."

"We really need to return to an era of honesty and integrity in our political leadership, like during my term for example," he concluded.
