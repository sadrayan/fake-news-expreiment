Biff Tannen
Biff Howard Tannen is a fictional character in the Back to the Future trilogy. Thomas F. Wilson plays Biff in all three films as well as the Universal Studios ride, and voiced the character in the animated series.

Biff is a large, rude, arrogant and violent bully who obtains what he wants by intimidating others into doing his work for him, or by cheating. He and his family members have a tendency to misuse idioms in a way that makes them appear foolish and comical despite their intention to insult or intimidate, and all share a disdain for manure. His favorite insult is "butthead".

Character biography

Early life

Biff was born in Hill Valley, California. He is the great-grandson of Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen grandfather of Griff Tannen. Rather than studying in high school, he prefers to bully George McFly into doing his homework for him while he drinks and hangs out with his friends. Biff is feared by most of his schoolmates but is less brave when he is without his gang (Match, Skinhead, and 3-D).

A draft script reveals that his middle initial is "H" for "Howard". According to the second film, he has been living with his grandma, Gertrude Tannen, at 1809 Mason Street for some time by November 1955.

Relationships

In 1955, Biff had a crush on Lorraine Baines who does not return the sentiments. However, the alternate 1985 reveals that Lorraine ended up marrying Biff so her children could live a better life. In the original 1985, Biff's marital status is unknown as no mention of a wife or children was ever made in the trilogy.[1]

Children

By 2015, Biff has a teenage grandson, Griff, suggesting that Biff had at least one child by 1985. The animated series reveals that Biff has a son, Biff Jr., although this may not be canon.
