March for Life Statement on Tax Plan
The March for Life released the following statement cheering today’s passage of a pro-life tax plan in the House.

“March for Life applauds the House of Representatives for passing a pro-life tax plan that takes key steps towards recognizing the dignity of all human life. We are heartened to see this bill promote the personhood of an unborn child via an education savings plan that begins prior to birth, and see this as a huge stride toward expanding the child tax credit to recognize life beginning at conception. Additionally, we are pleased that the adoption tax credit, an integral aspect of pro-life policy, has been retained for the heroic families whose love saves lives when they choose to adopt.” – Tom McClusky, Vice President of Government Affairs for March for Life
