In 2013, Michael Enea agreed to sell his Menomonee Falls home to help pay restitution to victims of a Ponzi scheme he operated, and now the federal government is willing to give him a place to live: behind bars.

A plea deal calls for Enea, 59, to plead guilty to wire fraud for running a $2.1 million Ponzi scheme that cost at least 10 investors more than $750,000, records filed in U.S. District Court last week show. He also is agreeing to plead to filing a false income tax return for writing off payments to the scheme's investors without reporting the income he received from them.

The deal calls for the prosecutors to recommend a sentence within the range recommended by federal sentencing guidelines â€” likely to be between 41 months and 51 months.
