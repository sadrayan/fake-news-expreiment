“Please see the link below for why the latest gun control bill should be filibustered and defeated,” Palin wrote in a Facebook post. “I can not and will not support politicians who support any more limits on our Second Amendment rights.”The link takes readers to a fact sheet that appears to have been put together by Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC, called “Why the Schumer-Toomey-Manchin Gun Registry Bill Should Be Filibustered and Defeated.”Among the claims on the fact sheet are that private sellers who advertise a gun for sale “on a poster at church could be imprisoned,” and that the bill would lead to a national gun registry.The Toomey-Manchin proposal would close the so-called gun show loophole and require background checks and record keeping for firearms purchased at a gun show, online or through a classified ad. Failure to meet the background-check requirements would be classified as a felony.However, the bill exempts gun sales between friends and family – a key demand for Republicans.The proposal would also require gun sellers to maintain records proving to law enforcement officials they conducted a background check on gun buyers. Some conservatives argue this could lead to a registry that would allow the federal government to one day confiscate legally owned firearms.
