Donald Trump finally concedes that Obama was born in the U.S.
WATCH: "I believe he did that last night." - @DonaldJTrumpJr on father saying Pres. Obama was born in the USA https://t.co/Jkpibap9N8 â€” Good Morning America (@GMA) September 16, 2016

Donald Trump Jr., one of his father's closest advisors, had a tough task on "Good Morning America" on Friday. He had to explain his father's tortured embrace of the unfounded theory that President Obama was not born in the U.S., while at the same time explaining his own comments that touched awkwardly on the Holocaust.

First, the Obama "birther" question. Donald Trump, who flamed the controversy for years, refused once again in a Washington Post interview Thursday to say whether Obama was born in the United States. His campaign late Thursday put out a statement that falsely blamed Hillary Clinton for starting the controversy in 2008 and claimed credit for bringing "this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate." The statement said Trump "believes that President Obama was born in the United States."

But the statement, which credits Trump with providing Obama a service, was not in Trump's name. And Trump's Post interview, refusing to repudiate the birther theory, came after his own campaign manager and running mate had earlier claimed that Trump no longer believed it.
