GOODLATTE STATEMENT IN HONOR OF CONSTITUTION DAY

WASHINGTON, D.C.: Today, Congressman Bob Goodlatte issued the following statement in honor of Constitution Day, which was first observed in 2005.



“226 years ago on September 17, 1787, the founders of our country signed the United States Constitution that laid the foundation for our freedoms today. Formed in the middle of crisis and fashioned by one of the world’s youngest nations, it has stood the test of time as the oldest written constitution still in use today.



“That historic day in Philadelphia may be thought on with reverence as we reflect on the great risks made by the original 39 delegates who chose to sign the Constitution and establish a new form of government. Thanks to the delegates who stood up for freedom and democracy, this document continues to safeguard America and provide necessary checks and balances for our country hundreds of years later.



“This year on Constitution Day, we are concerned whether the President is adhering to his constitutional duty of ‘faithfully executing the laws’ in light of laws he has circumvented or refused to enforce. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee that has jurisdiction over issues pertaining to the U.S. Constitution, I am pleased to announce a Constitution hearing in coming weeks on this topic.”



Congressman Bob Goodlatte is the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over Constitutional amendments and other issues pertaining to the U.S. Constitution.
