Officer Involved Shootings

LVMPD’s commitment to the public is to be both transparent and accountable regarding our use of deadly force incidents involving employees. For each use of deadly force incident that has not been through the Coroner’s Inquest process, we have made available to you three reports. Beginning with the first use of deadly force in December of 2010 and moving forward chronologically, you will be able to view the following documents:

District Attorney’s Decisions: As the District Attorney issues his decisions; LVMPD will post them in their entirety on the Office of Internal Oversight webpage. Force Investigation Team (FIT) Reports: For the first time in LVMPD history, we are making the criminal investigation reports, otherwise known as FIT Reports, available to our community. The FIT Report contains all the evidence found by the investigating homicide detectives. These reports will be made available to you in their entirety with the exception of any information that is deemed confidential in nature. Office of Internal Oversight (OIO) Review: The Office of Internal Oversight Review will be available to our community and will consist of an internal review that covers key conclusions and outcomes of each use of deadly force incident. This review includes the findings of the Use of Force Board that is made up of both commissioned officers and citizens. The review will also include any changes or additions that were made to policy, procedure, tactics or training if it was necessary to do so as a result of each use of deadly force.
