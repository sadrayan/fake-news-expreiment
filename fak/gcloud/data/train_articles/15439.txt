We got this figure from a Statesman article.

http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/zehr-when-will-austin-wages-catch-up-with-its-job-/nfg6G/

From 2009 to 2013, almost 57 percent of the newly created jobs in the area paid less than the living wage for a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from EMSI and the oft-cited living wage calculator created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Please let me know what else you need.

Thanks,

Jim

Jim:

Good morning.

I write today because we’re trying to check this claim by Steve Adler on his website: “57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage.”

Was he speaking to jobs created in Austin?

What was his basis?

Thanks.
