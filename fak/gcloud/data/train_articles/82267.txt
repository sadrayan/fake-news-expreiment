Luke Hoyer Obituary - Fort Lauderdale, FL
Luke T. Hoyer, 15, of Parkland, FL passed away suddenly on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Luke was born in Louisville, CO on October 25, 2002. Luke was a quiet young man with simple tastes: basketball, video games, chicken nuggets and anything sweet. He loved his family, his dogs and his friends. Luke didn't need to say much; just having him around made the room feel warm and welcoming. His smile and good nature will be greatly missed by those that knew and loved him. We will continue to feel his presence in our hearts and souls. He will always be our Lukey-Bear. Surviving Luke is his loving parents Thomas and Gena Stroud Hoyer, a sister Abby Hoyer, a brother Jake Hoyer, his Maternal Grandparents Janice and Eddy Stroud, his Paternal Grandparents Richard and Ann Hoyer, his aunts and uncles, Ron and Joan Cox, Jim and Joan Tucker, Susan and Paul Cooper, Sally and Tim Button and Pat Hoyer and his cousins, Trey Cox, Grant Cox, Anna Tucker, James Tucker, Mathew Button, Grace Button and Zachary Button.
