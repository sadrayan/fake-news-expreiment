Senate Judiciary Committee sets Kavanaugh vote for Friday
Washington (CNN) The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled its vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court for Friday morning at 9:30 am.

The move would place the panel's decision just a day after it is set to hear testimony from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who has accused him of sexual assault during a party in their high school years.

In a statement, Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley's spokesman, Taylor Foy, said committee rules normally require such votes to be posted three days in advance.

"An executive business meeting is being noticed tonight in the event that a majority of the members are prepared to hold one on Friday," Foy said.

Grassley tweeted, in characteristic style, following the initial announcement to stress the possibility that the committee's vote could be further delayed, while reiterating the move could allow for a Friday vote if so desired.
