The benefits of a college degree in one graph
That's from Matthew Yglesias, who comments:

Virtually every single member of congress, every senator, every Capitol Hill staffer, every White House advisor, every Fed governor, and every major political reporter is a college graduate. Whatâ€™s more, we have a large amount of social segregation in the United Statesâ€”college graduates tend to socialize with each other. And among college graduates, there simply isnâ€™t an economic crisis in the United States.
