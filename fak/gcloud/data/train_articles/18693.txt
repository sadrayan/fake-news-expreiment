Why Did Cortez Masto Drive Uber Jobs Out Of Town? Answer: Politics.
We’ve already shown how former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto helped drive business to a special interest law firm in Washington, D.C. – then received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from partners at the firm.

But our new ad shows how she helped special interests even when it meant denying paychecks to Nevada families.

After accepting $70,000 from taxi companies, Cortez Masto drove their rival Uber out of town—and, with it, all of the jobs the company offered.

“In a tough economy, a paycheck can mean everything to your family,” the ad explains. “Many Nevadans relied on Uber for work. But, after accepting $70,000 from taxi companies, Catherine Cortez Masto went after Uber—once, twice, three times—until she drove them out of town, along with all their jobs. She put campaign donors ahead of Nevadans and protected special interests instead of us.”

Life gets busy. Kids. Errands. Appointments. Not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to keep a nine-to-five job. The flexibility of Uber offered Nevadans the opportunity to work on their own schedule at a time when every bit mattered.

Cortez Masto took all of that away.
