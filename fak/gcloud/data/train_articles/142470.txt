Dr. Boretti was involved in Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) research and development since the latest 80s, working on the engine projects of a major European car manufacturer (FIAT) for both production and racing applications. For what concerns racing, his experience includes R&D of engines developed not only for cars but also for motorcycles by the most successful racing engine departments, namely Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Aprilia and Ducati. For what concerns production, his experience includes R&D of the first generation UNIJET Diesel injection system that established the Direct Injection Diesel engine as the market leader in Europe, as well as R&D of the second generation UNIJET Diesel injection system and the latest UNIAIR pneumatic valve actuation systems. Dr. Boretti has also been involved in government sponsored research projects for many years. In the 90s he was the FIAT representative in the JRC (Joint Research Committee) of European car manufacturers (Fiat, Peugeot SA, Renault, Volvo and Volkswagen), European Union and Italian government sponsored research programs on ICEs. Dr. Boretti has been involved recently in a series of research projects sponsored by the ARC and the Victorian government as well as in consulting projects, on gasoline and alternative fuel engines for cars and trucks. The most part of the latest activity has been devoted to the development of high efficiency, low irreversibility, low pollutant formation gas fuelled engines (hydrogen, methane, propane) using traditional as well as novel main chamber mixture preparation and ignition systems. The lean burn direct injection jet ignition engine more efficiently and completely burns lean fuel mixtures permitting throttle less load control by quantity of fuel injected and high efficiencies about the 50% mark almost independent of load. Teaching and academic research interests Automotive, Aerospace and Power generation have been the areas of major concern during the more than 20 years post doctorate activity, with particular emphasis placed on design, research and development of IC engines (especially racing gasoline, but also street car, truck and cogeneration plan engines, fuelled with gasoline, diesel, bio ethanol, bio diesel, CNG, LPG and hydrogen). Attention is now being focused to generally cover environmentally friendly energy conversion devices and sustainability.

Current research interest span from basic fluid dynamic and combustion research, for example turbulence, spray and combustion studies, to applied research for development of energy conversion devices, for example internal combustion engines. These activities are usually carried out by using both computer aided design (CAD), computer aided engineering (from CFD to FEM to general CAE) and experiments (from laser diagnostics to transient engine dynamometers). Current teaching interests include most of the thermo fluid plus power generation and energy conversion issues, namely teaching undergraduate and graduate courses on subjects including: Internal Combustion Engines Power train Vehicle technology Propulsion Motor sport Power Generation Alternative energy conversion devices Environment and sustainability Alternative fuels Turbo machines Computational Engineering Mechanical Design Computational Fluid Dynamics Experimental Mechanics Clean and Alternative Energies Fluid Mechanics Lectures given so far for engineering courses include the following: Master - Fluid dynamics Bachelor- Measurement systems Bachelor - Internal combustion engines Master - Power train technologies Bachelor - Fundamentals of Engineering (Dynamics) Lectures for engineering courses that will be delivered in 2010 include the following: Bachelor - Fundamentals of Engineering (Dynamics) Bachelor - Fluids & Thermofluids Master - Energy Conversion Master - Fluid Dynamics Publications Notwithstanding the most part of the work performed during the past 22 years’ of experience in the automotive industry has been finalized to the competitive advancement of engine solutions for production and racing applications with no interest in peer-review publishing and scientific dissemination, Dr. Boretti has been author or co-author of 80 journal and conference papers and invited talks, 20 of them in the last 2 years, the most part of them as main author. SAE papers have successfully completed SAE’s peer review process requiring a minimum of three (3) reviews by industry experts under the supervision of the session organizer. A. Boretti, F.
