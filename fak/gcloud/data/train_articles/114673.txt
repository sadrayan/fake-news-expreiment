"The force which binds my concepts as a perceptual realist stems from my

observations of contemporary human civilization and its relevance to the

natural world. All subjects are bound together with metaphoric juxtaposition

to render an enigmatic association giving the narrative of each image a

subjective conclusion. The intent is to create a neutral platform of description

as to the statement being made within the composition.



My interest in environmental sciences has always been the nucleus on my

creativity. I base my artistic expression on what I have experienced on

this subject as well as combining the contemporary condition of human

civilization in the 21st century. My goal is to depict human relevance to

the environment from the perspective of modern culture"
