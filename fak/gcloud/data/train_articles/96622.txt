Michelle Obama is getting some TV time with the Food Network's first lady of Southern cooking. The wife of Democrat Barack Obama recently joined Savannah's Paula Deen in the kitchen to tape an episode of Deen's show "Paula's Party." Deen publicist Nancy Assuncao said Friday the two women cooked fried shrimp and french fries and swapped stories about their families' favorite meals.

Assuncao said Michelle Obama told Deen her husband's not into fancy foods and his favorite dish at home is chili. Deen offered to cook for them at the White House if Obama is elected president.

What Deen isn't offering is a political endorsement. Assuncao said Deen doesn't discuss her personal politics.

She said the celebrity cook has alsoinvited Republican John McCain's wife, Cindy, and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, to appear on her show.
