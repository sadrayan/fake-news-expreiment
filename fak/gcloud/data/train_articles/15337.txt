The $720million/day figure you reference was provided in testimony in February 2013, and reflects 2011 trade numbers. Our staff was asked to submit preliminary data/analysis nearly a month in advance of testimony, which was prior to the release of official 2012 trade numbers. Testimony included a combination of 2011 numbers related to Texas-Mexico trade, and newly released 2012 data related to composite global trade, and was referenced as such.

The simple calculation related to Texas-Mexico trade is as follows: 2011 imports from Mexico into Texas were $175.1 billion (see attached spreadsheet/highlight) and 2011 Texas exports to Mexico were $86.6 billion which equals a total of $261.7 billion. $261.7 billion/363 days (discounting New Year's and Christmas Day when most Texas and Mexico sea/inland ports are closed) = approximately $720 million/day.

The attached spreadsheet outlines TX import figures based on port-level import data. State-level export data can be found here: http://tse.export.gov/TSE/ChartDisplay.aspx. The same calculation can be applied to data from 2012, 2013 and 2014.

Please note that the spreadsheet and data presented in testimony reflected port-level import data, which was the best available to us at the time. We no longer use port-level import data. We have access to more specific metrics now and utilize the following data sets: http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/imports/tx.html#ctry, which reflect different numbers.

Lucy:

I asked an expert with the federal government for her analysis of Texas trade with Mexico and she came back with a lower dollar figure, for 2013. It’d seem logical for the 2013 figure to exceed the 2011 trade figure. I asked her if she could try to discern the differences between the state’s calculation you shared and the later one. Her latest email appears immediately below.

I touched on that a little in my last email – the calculation presented in testimony was based on port-level data, which was the only data set available to us at the time. That data came from the U.S. Census Bureau, and was accessed via WiserTrade for 2011. As I also mentioned in my previous email, we no longer use port-level data, as we have access to specific metrics now. We currently utilize the following data sets: http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/imports/tx.html#ctry that show the FY2013 numbers based on non port-level data: $100.9 billion + $94.6195 billion = $195.58 B /363 = $538.8 million.
