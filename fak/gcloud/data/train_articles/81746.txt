Coronado High To Host Gubernatorial Forum Friday; Watch Live On KVIA.com
POSTED: 12:18 pm MDT September 23, 2010

This Friday, Coronado High School will host a forum with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White.

The audience will consist of only students who are eligible to vote. Initially, organizers wanted to host a debate between White and incumbent governor Rick Perry. But Perry declined all debate invitations because White has refused to release his tax returns from his time as deputy energy secretary in the mid-1990s. White has released his tax returns from his time as Houston mayor.
