Rubio Hails House Passage Of Bill To Defund ObamaCare, Keep Government Open
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a short-term continuing resolution that defunds ObamaCare while keeping the federal government open:

“The American people support defunding ObamaCare and oppose shutting down the government. The House voted today to follow the will of the American people and the Senate should now follow suit.

“Americans are struggling in an uncertain economy and ObamaCare is making their lives harder. Instead of throwing more money at ObamaCare, or threatening to shut down the government, President Obama and his allies in Congress should work with Republicans to stop ObamaCare from ruining people’s lives, incomes, health plans and doctor relationships.”
