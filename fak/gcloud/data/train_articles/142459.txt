A lot of restaurants offer free meals to veterans on Veterans Day. They can order whatever they want from the menu. However, when President Woodrow Wilson designated November 11, 1919 as Veterans Day, he opened up the kitchen of the White House and helped cooked ravioli for the veterans.

He reasoned that the veterans might want a home cooked meal after returning from World War I. Since the veterans had survived on military rations for such a long time that a home cooked meal would be an appropriate gesture for them.

There was no steak dinner because at the time the nation was in a food shortage and rationing was taking place.

One of the new trends in food was ravioli, an Italian import that usually provided a serving of grain, dairy or meat, and a vegetable in one meal. It was also easily mass produced and canned for easy meals and long-term storage.

So President Woodrow and his kitchen staff served 2,000 soldiers who had returned from the war.

Honor veterans you know by serving them a home cooked meal. Ravioli would be a good choice; a very good choice.
