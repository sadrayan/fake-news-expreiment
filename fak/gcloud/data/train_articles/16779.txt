Yes, we did examine income segregation in cities and found Austin, TX to be highly segregated compared to other cities. In fact, Austin ranked at 265 out of 274 cities in terms of income segregation (where 1 is the least segregated at 274 is the most segregated). In the link you show below for our work, you can see a figure depicting this, pasted below:

In this graph, the blue line shows Austin’s income segregation score over time, and the yellow line shows the average of all cities in our sample. Although Austin ranks as highly segregated, it did improve on segregation between 2000 and 2013 while most other cities worsened. So it has shown some improvement, but is still toward the bottom of the pack.

Austin is also fairly racially segregated, but improved between 2000 and 2013 on that front as well, as can be seen by the figure below (again, the blue line is Austin’s racial segregation score, and the yellow line is the average of all other cities).

Please let me know if I can provide any further information.

Thanks,

Tina
