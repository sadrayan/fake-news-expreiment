Hugh Hefner Funeral: Playboy Boss Laid to Rest Next to Marilyn Monroe – Variety
Playboy founder Hugh Hefner was laid to rest in a private ceremony at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, Calif. Saturday afternoon.

According to TMZ, the ceremony was attended by key staff members, Hefner’s wife Crystal Harris, and his four children, Christie, David, Marston, and Cooper.

Hefner, who died at the age of 91 on Wednesday, was interred next to Marilyn Monroe, having purchased the space 25 years ago for $75,000. Monroe was featured on the first cover of Playboy in December 1953 — Hefner bought old nude photos of her taken before she was an international star.

Hefner died at the Playboy Mansion, which will now be passed on to neighbor Daren Metropoulos, who paid $100 million for the iconic house in 2016 with the stipulation that Hefner would reside at the house until his death.

Hefner’s son, Cooper, released a statement after his death.

“My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom,” he said. “He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history.He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises.”

Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery is home to several notable stars, including Dean Martin, Natalie Wood, Truman Capote, and Farrah Fawcett.
