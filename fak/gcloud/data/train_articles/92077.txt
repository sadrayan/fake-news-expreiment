We look back to the last budget shortfall, the governor plays media critic and Houston’s Metro accused of using wrong numbers to get federal grant.

(Happy birthday to budget guru Don Green and Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune.)

REMINDER: Former New York Gov. George Pataki and state leaders including Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Attorney General Greg Abbott will rally against the newly passed health care law on the south steps of the Capitol at 8 a.m. today.

• We all want to know how the state is going to close a budget shortfall expected to exceed $10 billion next year. Gov. Rick Perry gives a pretty standard answer on this front, saying he’s confident that the Legislature can balance the budget by cutting spending because that’s what happened when the state faced a similar shortfall in 2003.

In an interview last week with Evan Smith, Perry said, “In 2003, cutting $10 billion out of the entire budget, yet we put $1.8 billion into public education, we put $800 million more into health and human services.”

How did lawmakers cut $10 billion out of the budget while increasing funding for the two largest sections of the state budget?

They didn’t.

The Legislature did not balance the budget in 2003 with spending cuts alone. Lawmakers also prolonged a tax that was set to expire, used accounting tricks to delay state payments and accelerated their practice of collecting fees for one purpose and spending that money on something else entirely.

Earlier this month, the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for more spending on programs that aim to help low-income Texans, outlined what it described as the balanced approach that the Legislature took to balancing the budget in 2003.

The Legislature cut $1.4 billion in state funds from the 2003 budget - the one written in the previous session. On top of that, the Legislature actually reduced state spending by $1.2 billion, as compared to what was budgeted the prior year. CPPP (which says the budget shortfall that year was actually $15.6 billion) estimates that lawmakers cut $7.5 billion from what it would have cost to maintain current services and keep up with inflation.

Here is the stuff that Perry doesn’t talk about: Lawmakers took $1.26 billion out of the Rainy Day Fund. They extended the Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund tax, which was set to expire, and that brought in $250 million. They hired additional state workers at the comptroller’s office to enforce tax laws, which brought in about $122 million. They delayed payments to schools from the last day of the biennium to the first day of the next biennium, an accounting trick that saved $800 million on paper but that had to be paid for in the 2005 biennium. And state employees and teachers faced new out-of-pocket costs for health care.

Now let’s go back to those spending figures for education and health and human services that Perry mentioned. He said the state put $1.8 billion into public education in 2003. The state actually cut state spending on education by $1.2 billion. So where did that increase in funds come from? The federal government and the No Child Left Behind Act. According to Texas Education Agency figures, federal revenue for Texas public schools increased from $897 million in 2002 to $3 billion in 2004.

As for that $800 million more that went into health and human services, state funding only increased by $232 million. But state and federal funding for those programs increased $1.3 billion. So when Perry talks about the state increasing funding for education and health and human services while cutting the budget in 2003, it is important to remember that almost all of that increased funding came from the federal government.

• Also in that interview, Perry said “no one in the mainstream media” covered the April 2009 press conference in which he threw his support behind Rep. Brandon Creighton’s resolution on state sovereignty. The press conference drew little coverage. But to say that nobody covered it goes too far, PolitiFact Texas finds.

• Last week, KHOU in Houston reported that the Metropolitan Transit Authority in Houston was accused of using outdated data when seeking a federal grant in 2009 — during Bill White’s tenure as mayor. You can watch the KHOU story here.

• The Statesman’s Mike Ward reports this morning that a state board declined Monday to choose between two proposals for an expansion to the Governor’s Mansion. “In a surprise move, a state board that was expected to choose between two plans for an addition to Texas’ historic Governor’s Mansion declined Monday to choose one plan over the other. Instead, the Antiquities Advisory Board punted the politically charged decision to the full Texas Historical Commission board. Some members insisted that they did not have enough details on the two options to adequately assess their effects on the mansion’s historical integrity. One option would add 1,555 square feet to the back of the famous house; the other would add about half that. Some board members complained privately that security concerns prevented them from fully assessing both plans.”

• From the Statesman’s Chuck Lindell: “The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal Monday from Charles Dean Hood, a Texas death row inmate who complained that he was denied a fair trial because his trial judge and prosecutor had engaged in a secret years-long affair. Announced without comment from the court, the rejection appears to put the issue of the amorous judge and prosecutor to rest for future Hood appeals, though defense lawyers said they were evaluating additional litigation options.”

• From Bloomberg: “Illinois, New Jersey and Texas are among municipal-bond issuers sticking with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to underwrite pending debt sales after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the firm with fraud.”

• Brandi Grissom of the Texas Tribune reports this morning that Gov. Rick Perry’s Web-based border camera surveillance program is meeting its goals for the first time. “But that’s only because the targets have been scaled back so dramatically that the program hardly resembles the wide-reaching virtual border neighborhood watch Perry initially promised.”

• Paul Burka breaks down how Debra Lehrmann beat Rick Green in a Republican race for a Supreme Court nomination last week, calling it “a classic race of New Texas versus Old Texas, rural versus urban and suburban.”

Everything else

• Austin weather: Mostly cloudy, high of 74.

• NFL schedule will be released today. Texans and Cowboys will play in Houston this year. Here’s hoping it’s on a Sunday or Monday night.
