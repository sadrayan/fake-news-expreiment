Loesch: 'Gun-Free Zones Are Criminal Protection Areas'
On "The Kelly File" tonight, Dana Loesch said it's incredibly disappointing to see President Obama immediately call for increased gun control in the wake of the Oregon campus shooting.

She pointed out that all the facts have yet to come out regarding the gunman, his motivation and how me might have obtained his weapons.

Loesch said that Obama's claim that the states with the strictest gun laws have the least gun deaths simply is not backed up by the data, particularly in a city with which Obama is very familiar, Chicago.

"Gun-free zones are criminal protection areas," Loesch stated. "You cannot refute numbers. You cannot refute the statistics."
