Prostate cancer incidence statistics : Cancer Research UK
Substantial increases in incidence have been reported in recent years for many countries around the world, including the UK.7

The prostate cancer incidence trend for the UK is shown in Figure 1.2. The European AS rate increased by almost half (48%) between 1993-1995 and 2003-2005. Rates have remained relatively stable since then, and increased by 3% between 2003-2005 and 2007-2009.1-4

The trend for a longer time period is shown in Figure 1.3 for Great Britain. Overall the European AS rate increased by three times between 1975-1977 and 2007-2009, with the most rapid increases being seen in the early 1990s and late 1990s/early 2000s.1-3

The incidence trends for men aged up to 74 show similar patterns of overall increases since the mid-1970s (Figure 1.4). The largest increase has been in men aged 45-54, with the European AS rate increasing by eight times between 1975-1977 and 2007-2009. For men aged 85 and over, there has been a decrease in the rate since the mid-1990s (with a steep fall since the early 2000s), and the rate for men aged 75-84 has also decreased slightly since the early 2000s.1-3

Much of the increase in incidence (both in the UK and in many other countries worldwide) can be attributed to the incidental discovery of prostate cancers following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and, more recently, the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing.8 An analysis of prostate cancer incidence trends in Scotland concluded that much of the apparent increase in cancer incidence between 1981 and 1996 was caused by increased detection - before 1989 through increasing rates of TURP, and afterwards through the rising use of PSA testing (Figure 1.5).9

Analyses for other countries, including the USA10,11 and Australia,12 have pointed to increased detection being a factor. In the USA, widespread PSA testing on asymptomatic men resulted in dramatic increases in incidence (an 82% rise among men aged 65 years and older between 1986 and 1991),11 and it is estimated that 75% of US men aged 50 years and older have had a PSA test.13 In Europe, the level of population screening is much lower, with published estimates of 10-20%.14
