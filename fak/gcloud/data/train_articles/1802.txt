RES. 59) MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES [House Report 113-216] [From the U.S. Government Printing Office] 113th Congress Report HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 1st Session 113-216 ====================================================================== PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE JOINT RESOLUTION (H.J. RES. 59) MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES _______ September 18, 2013.--Referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be printed _______ Mr. Cole, from the Committee on Rules, submitted the following R E P O R T [To accompany H. Res. 352] The Committee on Rules, having had under consideration House Resolution 352, by a nonrecord vote, report the same to the House with the recommendation that the resolution be adopted. SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION The resolution provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 59, the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014, under a closed rule. The resolution provides one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The resolution waives all points of order against consideration of the joint resolution. The resolution provides that the amendment printed in this report shall be considered as adopted and the joint resolution, as amended, shall be considered as read. The resolution waives all points of order against provisions in the joint resolution, as amended. The resolution provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Section 2 of the resolution provides that it shall be in order at any time from the calendar day of September 26, 2013, through the calendar day of September 29, 2013, for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV and that the Speaker or his designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this section. EXPLANATION OF WAIVERS The waiver of all points of order against consideration of the bill includes a waiver of the following: Section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of legislation providing new budget authority in excess of a 302(a) or 302(b) allocation of such authority. Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits consideration of legislation that would cause the level of total new budget authority for the first fiscal year to be exceeded or would cause revenues to be less than the level of total revenues for the first fiscal year or for the total of that first fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years for which allocations are provided. Section 314 of the Congressional Budget Act, which prohibits the consideration of legislation that provides budget authority for a fiscal year that exceeds either of the discretionary statutory spending limits. The budget resolution suspended the application of this section for individual spending caps only in the case that the sum total of the spending limits was not exceeded. H. J. Res. 59 provides budget authority in excess of that combined spending total. Although the resolution waives all points of order against provisions in the joint resolution, as amended, the Committee is not aware of any points of order. The waiver is prophylactic in nature. COMMITTEE VOTES The results of each record vote on an amendment or motion to report, together with the names of those voting for and against, are printed below: Rules Committee record vote No. 72 Motion by Ms. Slaughter to make in order and provide the appropriate waivers for amendment #2, offered by Rep. Van Hollen (MD), which funds the government until November 15, 2013 at the FY 2014 pre-sequester discretionary Budget Control Act caps that total $1.058 trillion and replaces the entire sequester--which will cause deep cuts to domestic priorities and defense for FY 2014--with savings from specific policies that reflect a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The amendment protects our most vulnerable citizens, asks those earning over $1 million per year to contribute more, eliminates Agriculture direct payments, and cuts subsidies for large oil companies.
