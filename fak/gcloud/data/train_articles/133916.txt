Elote Justice Ladies Tank
Elote Justice depicts the reaction from the community to the awful attack on a local LA Mexican elote vendor. The bearded hipster jerk (shamefully, also an immigrant, from Argentina) is running away from a barrage of flying elotes. Image is from the viral cartoon by yours truly, nationally syndicated cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz. Proceeds from the sale of this image went to help the elotero and his family, fundraiser period is over August 7th, 2017. (There is also a non-captioned version available)
