Joint Statement from Leaders Pelosi and Schumer on President Trump’s Attempt to Change Subject from GOP Making Mess of Health Care System

Washington, D.C. – House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer issued this statement as President Trump desperately tries to change the subject from Republicans making a mess out of our country’s health care system:

“The president is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about and that Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and Republicans in Washington are making a mess of our health care system, causing premiums to increase and care to decrease while threatening to gut protections for pre-existing conditions. Democrats are focused like a laser on health care and will not be diverted.”
