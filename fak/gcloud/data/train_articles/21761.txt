Freedom Partners says in a TV ad that Feingold "got a memo in 2009 that outlined veteran harm" at a Wisconsin VA facility "and nothing was done."

Whether the memo was ever delivered to Feingold, who was then a U.S. senator, may never be known. But Freedom Partners cites no evidence that it was delivered.

And it made a revised version of the ad that essentially walks back its claim, now saying the memo was marked as delivered, not that Feingold actually received it.

Because there isnâ€™t evidence that Feingold received the memo, we rate the claim False.
