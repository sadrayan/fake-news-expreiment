A Special Election –Florida Congressional District 13
By Karen Cross, National Right to Life Political Director

Following the death of Congressman Bill Young (R), Florida Governor Rick Scott scheduled a January 14 special primary and March 11 special general election to fill the 13th Congressional District seat.

Declared candidates for the Republican primary are pro-life attorney David Jolly, pro-abortion state Rep. Kathleen Peters, and attorney Mark Bircher, whose position on life issues is unknown.

David Jolly is the only candidate in the GOP primary who has taken a pro-life stand. State Rep. Kathleen Peters has a 100% pro-abortion voting record – even voting against a ban on sex-selection abortions. Mark Bircher has not returned National Right to Life’s questionnaire and has refused to answer questions about his position when asked by local Floridians.

The winner of the January 14 Republican primary will face Alex Sink in the March 11 general election.

The field has been cleared for pro-abortion Democrat candidate Sink, an EMILY’s List candidate. EMILY’s List only supports radical pro-abortion candidates who support abortion-on-demand for any reason and who support taxpayer-funded abortions.

The district went 51% for Obama in 2012.

Early voting begins January 4 through January 12, 2014 for the January 14 special primary election.
