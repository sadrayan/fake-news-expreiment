Official Statement on Two-Dollar Circulation Coins
Ottawa, Ontario, April 21, 2010 - In response to recent Toronto-area media reports and inquiries by the public and local businesses, the Royal Canadian Mint has issued the following statement:

Since 1996, Canadian two-dollar circulation coins have been produced with two different images of the Queen: a smaller crowned portrait (from 1996 to 2002) and a larger uncrowned portrait introduced in 2003 to update the image of Her Majesty on all Canadian coinage.

This last effigy has appeared on all Canadian circulation coins (one-cent, five-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, 50-cent, one-dollar and two-dollar denominations) produced since June 2003.

All circulation coins bearing these effigies are genuine and are to be accepted as legal tender in Canada. View images and information concerning these coins here.
