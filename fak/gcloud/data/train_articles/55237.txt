Trump said people watched his rally on TVs outside the Fairgrounds. They didnâ€™t.
There were no massive TV screens and no JumboTrons outside of the Trump rally in Tampa on Tuesday, like President Donald Trump said there was.

But the hundreds outside did crane their necks, stand on tippy toes and listen through open doors. Some groaned because they couldn't get in. As Trump supporters discovered they couldn't get in, many made their way to the protest in the First Amendment Zone.

"We just want to hear what the other side has to say," said Kristin Panozzo, 22, of Tampa. "We're disappointed we couldn't get in, but that's all right, we're here."

There Panozzo found, at last count 150 protesters and counter protesters, divided by a line of law enforcement. There she found small confrontations. Shoving, shouting from both sides.

Christina Luke, 24, of Tampa said despite times of friction, she is trying to keep the peace.

"We are not here to encourage violence," said Luke, who came with her friends to support fellow Muslims and Haitians. "We are here for peace."
