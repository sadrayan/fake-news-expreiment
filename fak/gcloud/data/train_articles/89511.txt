Report: Florida Leads in Cutting Carbon Pollution

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Florida has a big role to play in combating global warming, according to a new report released on Tuesday.



Analysts for the nonprofit group Environment America examined the total reductions in carbon pollution projected, by state, for the next ten years. They found the Sunshine State will cut more carbon than all but six others – mostly as a result of federal rules to clean up power plants and improved fuel-efficiency for cars.



Julian Boggs, Environment America's global warming outreach director, says Florida could be doing even more, depending on the state's political climate.



"We hope that folks reach out to the governor and state legislature, and urge them to take urgent action on climate change," says Boggs. "After all, Florida is under enormous threat from sea-level rise."



The report says states like Florida should be doing more to promote solar and wind power, and the use of electric cars, public transportation and light rail.



Boggs criticizes elected officials who say they're not sure about humans' role in climate change, or aren't supportive of such efforts as the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan.



"At minimum, we ask that folks like Governor Scott and Senator Rubio step out of the way and stop trying to block progress," Boggs insists. "At least let the EPA and local cities continue to move forward to reduce emissions."



He describes the report as intended to raise public awareness, ahead of an international conference on climate change in Paris this December.
