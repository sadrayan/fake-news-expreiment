Democrats Had 300,000 More Votes for Congressional Seats than for Governor
VOTER FRAUD: Orange County Numbers DON’T ADD UP – Democrats Had 300,000 More Votes for Congressional Seats than for Governor

Orange County, a traditionally conservative enclave in Southern California turned all blue after Democrats found tens of thousands of votes post election day.

Just two years ago in 2016, only 2 Congressional districts in Orange County voted blue–now just two years later every single district voted blue.

Democrat blue wave? More like Democrat election fraud.

From a reader:

I did a bit of my own research, and what’s interesting is in both Stanislaus County (ca-10) and Orange County Republican John Cox beat Gavin Newsom for Governor. John Cox ran a horrible campaign and was virtually invisible. I find it hard to believe that voters would split the ticket — voting R for an unknown guy Governor and D for a super liberal congressperson. Just seems like a BIG red flag.

The election results

Orange County Governor’s race:

Republican John Cox 489,249

Democrat Gavin Newsom 476,827

Orange County House results:

District 39:

Democrat Gil Cisneros 113,075

Republican Young Kim 109,580

District 45:

Democrat Katie Porter 143,144

Republican Mimi Walters 135,120

District 46:

Democrat Lou Correa 85,691

Republican Russell Lambert 40,777

District 47:

Democrat Alan Lowenthal 124,436

Republican John Briscoe 69,942

District 48:

Democrat Harley Rouda 140,323

Republican Dana Rohrabacher 123, 401

District 49:

Democrat Mike Levin 139,480

Republican Diane Harkey 111,778

Total votes in Orange County House races:

Democrat: 776,218

Republican: 590,598

So according to the election results:

300,000 (299,931) more Democrats voted for the Democrats in the Orange County Congressional races than voted fro Democrat Gavin Newsom for governor.

This screams of voter fraud.

And Republican John Cox beat Newsome by 12,000 votes in Orange County.

This makes no sense and points to fraud.

I’m is lifelong Californian and want this exposed. I was a Democrat until recently and know many former California Democrats like me who are sick of what’s happening in California. These seats were stolen.
