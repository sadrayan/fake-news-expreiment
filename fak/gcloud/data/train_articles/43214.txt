Completing the rebuilding of school facilities in New Orleans through the School Facilities Master Plan ;

Expanding options and access to quality schools in Baton Rouge through the Baton Rouge Achievement Zone partnership and the development of the centralized enrollment system EnrollBR ;

Partnering with high quality organizations to support the transformation of struggling schools statewide through the School Redesign initiative; and

Acting as the final intervention for schools that continue to struggle despite plans for redesign or comprehensive school system improvement strategies. Involvement by the RSD can include mergers, closures, or transformation by a charter operator.
