Kenyan man found not guilty in alleged extortion plot involving local bank president
A foreign national and U.S. Navy member who was charged with trying to extort $50,000 out of a local bank president was found not guilty last week in Mobile County Circuit Court.

Edwin Kigathi Gitau, 24, of Kenya, was facing one count of first-degree extortion, a felony. The jury issued its verdict on June 5, the fourth day of the trial.

Mobile police arrested Gitau on Dec. 27, released him on bail, and rearrested him four days later after victim told authorities he was still in fear for his life. Records from the Navy showed Gitau had orders to leave Mobile County in the coming weeks, according to court records.



Prosecutors said that Gitau approached the bank president at his home on Dec. 27 and told him that a "hit" was taken out on him, his wife and his children. Gitau told the man he was a Navy Seal and used his Navy identification card as proof of his position.



He told the victim he needed $50,000 to protect the man and his family and get himself out of the country, according to a motion filed by prosecutors to review the conditions of Gitau's release. He gave the victim his cell phone number and told the victim to make contact when the money was ready.
