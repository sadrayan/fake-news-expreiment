Governor Cuomo Directs State Health Department to Investigate Public Health and Safety Hazards at NYCHA Properties
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today directed the New York State Department of Health to investigate the hazardous conditions plaguing the New York City Housing Authority to protect New Yorkers. Prior to the announcement, the Governor toured the Jackson Houses, a NYCHA building in the Bronx, alongside Borough President Ruben Diaz, City Councilmember Ritchie Torres, Assemblyman Michael Blake, New York State's Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker, and Jim Walden, an attorney for NYCHA tenants, where they saw evidence of mold, vermin, and decades-old, potentially hazardous paint peeling from the walls. The conditions present a clear threat to public health and serve as a reflection of conditions across NYCHA housing, which demand immediate action from the state.

"The situation we've seen is as upsetting and as disturbing as anything I've seen anywhere and I've been through the worst housing complexes all across this country," Governor Cuomo said. "It is just shocking that in New York State we would have people who are subjected to these conditions, and on behalf of the people of the state, I apologize to the NYCHA residents because they deserve better and they'll get better."
