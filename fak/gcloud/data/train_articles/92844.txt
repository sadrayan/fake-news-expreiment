Seminole Tribe launches two new ads to promote long-shot compact
With the Florida Legislature all but declaring Gov. Rick Scott's agreement with the Seminole Tribe dead on arrive, the tribe has launched two 30-second television ads that are running statewide on cable news networks to keep the pressure on.

The Senate Regulated Industries Committee has scheduled a workshop on the proposal on Wednesday and the House Regulated Industries Committee is drafting an alternative to the compact that is expected to be ready next week. Senate Majority Leader Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, has predicted that the issue will not get resolved this session.

One of the Seminole's ad, “Sovereign” highlights the Seminole Tribe’s commitment to Florida, and the second “Letter” focuses on the governor's agreement but continues to echo misleading claims from the governor's letter and suggests that "for the first time" would "empower the Legislature to keep Florida family friendly" and creates "nearly 20,000 new Florida jobs."

There is nothing today that stops the Legislature from "keeping the state family friendly" and there is nothing in the proposed deal that requires the creation of any jobs.

Both ads are running Tampa, Miami, Orlando, West Palm Beach, Jacksonville, Ft Myers, Mobile-Pensacola, Tallahassee, Panama City, and Gainesville.on CNN, FOX, MSNBC and on digital sites.
