Mason-Dixon: Reid by one
Former Nevada Assemblywoman Sharron Angle remains closely competitive with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, according to a poll released Friday, despite weeks of attacks from the Democratic incumbent and an unsteady performance from Angle on the campaign trail.

In a Mason-Dixon survey published by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Reid was just 1 percentage point ahead of Angle, leading 43 percent to 42 percent. That result differs from a Mason-Dixon poll taken earlier this month, which gave Reid a 7-point advantage.

The earlier Mason-Dixon poll tested 625 likely voters, while the one released Friday, showing a tighter race, tested 625 registered voters.

This week’s poll shows a sharp geographic divide in the race: Reid holds an 8-point advantage over Angle in populous Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. In the rural areas of the state, Angle has a massive 29-point lead.

Still, there’s little doubt that Reid’s heavily funded television ads, describing Angle’s views as “dangerous” and “extreme,” have changed the dynamics of the race, battering Angle’s public image to the point that she’s viewed almost as negatively as the unpopular Democratic incumbent. Reid’s favorability ratings remain weak, with just 38 percent saying they viewed him positively and 51 percent saying they had an unfavorable impression of him.

But Angle had exactly the same favorable number — 38 percent — and only a marginally lower unfavorable number of 47 percent. In early June, before Angle won the GOP’s Senate nomination, just 20 percent of respondents in a Mason-Dixon poll said they viewed her unfavorably.

This week’s Mason-Dixon poll was conducted between July 26 and July 28, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Two automated polls this month, conducted by Rasmussen Reports and Public Policy Polling, showed Reid with a similar, 2-point advantage over Angle.
