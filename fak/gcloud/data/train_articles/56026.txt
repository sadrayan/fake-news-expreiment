TransCanada seeks $15 billion compensation for Keystone XL pipeline
CALGARY—TransCanada Corp. is moving forward with its attempt to seek more than $15 billion compensation under the North American Free Trade Agreement following the U.S. government’s rejection of the company’s proposed Keystone XL pipeline.

The Calgary-based company made a formal request for arbitration from the International Centre for Settlement of Investment disputes under the trade deal on Friday, after giving notice of its intention to make the claim back in January.

The request says talks with the U.S. government to resolve the dispute began in April, but the two sides failed to reach an amicable settlement.

Similar to the notice TransCanada filed in January, the company alleges in the compensation request that the government concluded numerous times that the pipeline would not have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions.

Still, TransCanada contends the government rejected the pipeline to appear strong on climate change.
