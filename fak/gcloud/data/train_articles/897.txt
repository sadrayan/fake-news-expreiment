Poll: Obama leads McCain nationally by slight margin

THE RACE: The presidential race nationally

___

THE NUMBERS

Barack Obama, 47 percent

John McCain, 43 percent

Ralph Nader, 6 percent

___

OF INTEREST:

If Nader, the independent, is not included, Obama's lead is 49 percent to 46 percent. About one in five voters say they may change their minds. Four in 10 Democrats say Hillary Rodham Clinton should stay in the race until the party's August convention. If she is Obama's running mate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is McCain's, the Democrats' lead is 6 percentage points. Just over half of Democrats want Obama to put Clinton on his ticket, and if he doesn't one in four want her to fight for the spot at the convention. More than four in 10 Republicans still say they'd rather see the GOP nominate someone besides McCain.

___
