McCaskill fired up over lack of hearings on healthcare bill
Sen. Claire McCaskill criticized Republicans for not planning to hold any hearings on the Senate version of the American Health Care Act.

"There is a group of guys in a backroom somewhere that is making these decisions," the Missouri Democrat said in a Senate Finance Committee hearing Thursday about the Department of Health and Human Services budget.

Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Republicans are open to ideas and suggestions on the Senate version of the AHCA, which would partially repeal and replace Obamacare.

"I don't know that there are other hearings, but we have invited you to participate and give your ideas," he said.

McCaskill shot back that "when you are saying that you inviting us, for what? We don't even know? We have no idea what is being proposed."

She noted that Republicans criticized Democrats for drafting the Affordable Care Act behind closed doors, but added that they held hearings and Republicans were allowed to offer amendments.

Senate Republicans are considering a series of options for their healthcare legislation, and several Republicans have said they hope to get a vote on a bill before they leave for their August recess.
