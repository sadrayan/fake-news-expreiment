Mitt Romney Will Be a Great Commander-In-Chief of Abu Ghraib
Oh, Mitt Romney! You are a determined, can-do individual. When it comes to torturing family pets and traumatizing children, nobody does it better than you:

Before beginning the drive, Mitt Romney put Seamus, the family’s hulking Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon’s roof rack …. Tagg Romney commandeered the way-back of the wagon, keeping his eyes fixed out the rear window, where he glimpsed the first sign of trouble. ”Dad!” he yelled. ”Gross!” A brown liquid was dripping down the back window, payback from an Irish setter who’d been riding on the roof in the wind for hours.

Mitt stopped the car, strangled the dog, and wiped his shitty hands on his eleven horrified sons.
