Bad Blood: Judge Kavanaugh's Mother Presided Over Far Left Accuser's Parents' Home Foreclosure (UPDATED)
Bad Blood: Judge Kavanaugh’s Mother Presided Over Far Left Accuser’s Parents’ Home Foreclosure (UPDATED)

Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are working overtime to delay Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.

On Thursday, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) referred a mysterious letter about Kavanaugh to the FBI.

Feinstein had been holding on to the letter since earlier this year.

It turns out the woman who sent the letter to Democrat lawmakers – Christine Blasey – is a far-left activist.

Independent journalist Mike Cernovich says Christine Blasey is a far-left activist who spent all weekend deleting her social media accounts.

Christine Blasey is a far left wing activist who spent all weekend deleting her social media accounts. I didn’t name her because that wouldn’t have been nice, but this is straight activism on her part.https://t.co/fLNiSezpgx https://t.co/T1ORi6jFib — Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) September 16, 2018

The only other witness to the alleged attack said it never happened and the allegations are “absolutely nuts.”

On Monday morning Judge Brett Kavanaugh responded to the allegations.

Kavanaugh refuted the 36-year-old claims by the far left activist.

And now this…

Judge Kavanaugh’s mother foreclosed on Christine Blasey Ford’s parents’ home.

The parents of Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser were defendants in a court case Kavanaugh’s mother ruled on 22 years ago. That’s 13 years after the alleged incident in question took place. — Richard Armande Mills (RAM) (@RAMRANTS) September 17, 2018

UPDATE— CBS News reports the case was settled amicably and the Blaseys kept their house.

.@CBSNews went to Montgomery Co Court today to look into Blasey's parents' 1996 foreclosure. The Blaseys settled w/their lender. The bank asked Judge Martha Kavanaugh to dismiss the case. She did. The Blaseys kept the house. There's no record they appeared in her courtroom. — Steven Portnoy (@stevenportnoy) September 17, 2018
