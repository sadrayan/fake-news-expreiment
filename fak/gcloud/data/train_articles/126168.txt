FACT CHECK: Will Netflix be Discontinued Because of Rampant Account Sharing?
In March 2017 a creation of the EarlyView.net “prank news” site fooled social media users into believing the popular Netflix entertainment streaming service would soon be discontinuing service in June 2017 “due to the company losing money … from people sharing each other’s accounts”:

Prank news sites are not entirely like their fake news counterparts, as they enable user-generated hoaxes designed to trick one’s friends on social media.

Netflix wasn’t the first entity targeted by EarlyView.net pranks. In February 2017 the site helped spread a death hoax about Walking Dead star Andrew Lincoln, and a similar hoax about actor William H. Macy the following month.
