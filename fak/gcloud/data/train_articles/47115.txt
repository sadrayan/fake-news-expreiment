Obamacare Took Months to Craft; Repeal May Be Much Swifter
WASHINGTON — In June 2009, House Democratic leaders unveiled the first draft of legislation that would ultimately become the Affordable Care Act. A month later, three House committees began formally drafting the bill ahead of a House vote that came well into the fall, after the summer heat had dissipated and the leaves had begun to change.

On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee will formally mark up legislation to repeal and replace the act — less than 48 hours after Republicans unveiled the bill to the public. If all goes according to plan, the House will vote within a few weeks, and the Senate will take up the legislation before its spring recess begins on April 7.

Republicans excoriated Democrats for rushing passage of the Affordable Care Act — President Barack Obama’s landmark health law — blasting “back-room deals” and cheering on the nascent Tea Party movement, with its hostile chant “Read the bill, read the bill.” But Republicans have adopted a much more aggressive timetable for repealing the law and remaking Medicaid, the health program for more than 70 million low-income people.

“The difference between 2009 and 2017 is like black and white,” said former Senator Max Baucus of Montana, one of the chief architects of the Affordable Care Act, who spent countless hours in hearings and negotiations on the legislation as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “It’s a chasm. There’s no comparison.”
