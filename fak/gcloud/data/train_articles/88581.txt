Tom Cotton blasts NRSC attack on Mark Pryor - Tal Kopan
Republican Rep. Tom Cotton is pushing back against an “offensive” attack from his own party’s Senate campaign committee against the Democratic senator he is challenging in Arkansas.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee on Wednesday criticized Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) for past statements on the Bible after the lawmaker aired a new ad in which he talks about his religious beliefs and calls the Bible his “compass.”

“So is the Bible Mark Pryor’s compass, providing the ‘comfort and guidance to do what’s best for Arkansas?’ Or is it really not a good rule book for political issues and decisions made in the Senate? Guess it depends on which Mark Pryor that you ask,” NRSC Director Brad Dayspring wrote in a blog post.

A campaign manager for Cotton, who is challenging Pryor for his Senate seat in next year’s election, called the NRSC comments “bizarre and offensive.”

“We should all agree that America is better off when all our public officials in both parties have the humility to seek guidance from God,” campaign spokesman David Ray told CNN.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee also blasted the NRSC.

“The NRSC has crossed the line this week with attacks on the religious faith of Democrats. The most recent is a despicable attack on Mark Pryor. The NRSC should immediately pull down their attack and apologize to Senator Pryor and other people of faith who don’t deserve to have their religious beliefs attacked by political operatives in Washington, D.C. This attack was out of bounds,” Executive Director Guy Cecil said in a statement.

Dayspring did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
