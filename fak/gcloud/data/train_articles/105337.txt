The biggest way to avoid children dying while in custody of the border patrol is to not take them on dangerous, thousand mile journeys in the first place. We know the illegal alien invaders want their welfare checks, but they should at least think of the children who are suffering, with two dying.

To the media, the two children dying is like a major, breaking news event. Never mind the fact the kids were probably sickened on their journey north because of the parents.

Oh and during the Obama years, 18 children died in the custody of the border patrol, yet back then the media didn’t seem to care. In fact, I can’t recall the media publishing one story about the 18 kids who died because of Obama.

Did you know that during the Obama administration 18 children died while in custody of Border Patrol? Where was the media outrage then? — Michael J. Morrison (@OfficeOfMike) — Michael J. Morrison (@OfficeOfMike) December 26, 2018

No one wants to see kids dying, well unless you are a leftist who gets off on abortions. But the hypocrisy of the media and their coverage of two kids dying vs 18 dying thanks to Obama is rather amusing to watch.

OF course, it was Obama who put illegal alien kids in cages and got wrapped in tin foil, yet somehow Trump got the blame for that too. I guess I shouldn’t be so surprised.
