Edwin Cadena is a graduate student at North Carolina State University and has worked at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. He studies vertebrates, and is interested in the evolution of turtles. He uses fossils, proteins, and bone histology to understand molecular evolutionary rates, trends in proteins degradation and modification, and the biogeography and evolution of turtles.

In the Cerrejon mine, Edwin has spent several years collecting, finding large fresh-water turtles, among the biggest ever recorded in geological history.
