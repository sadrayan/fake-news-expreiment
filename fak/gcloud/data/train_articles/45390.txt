Tuition-Free Degree Program: The Excelsior Scholarship
Leading the Way to College Affordability

We've made college tuition-free for middle class New Yorkers.

With the passage of the FY 2018 State Budget, New York is now home to the nation's first accessible college program - The Excelsior Scholarship.

Under this groundbreaking program, more than 940,000 middle-class families and individuals making up to $125,000 per year will qualify to attend college tuition-free at all CUNY and SUNY two- and four-year colleges in New York State. The new program begins in the fall of 2017 and will be phased in over three years.

In order to apply, students must:

- Be residents of New York State - Attend a SUNY or CUNY two- or four-year degree program - Take 30 credits per calendar year (including January and Summer sessions) - Plan to live and work in New York following graduation for the length of time they participate in the scholarship program
