Fix Politics â€“ Just another WordPress site
Every 20 years, something remarkable happens in our country. In 1959 we had elections that freed us from colonial rule, leading to our independence in 1960. In 1979 we had the election that freed us from military rule. In 1999 we had to, again, be freed from military rule. It is another 20 years since 1999 and Nigerians now fully recognize the need to free Nigeria from an incompetent and corrupt political class. We can only do this if we fix our politics. The next 20 years will be about fixing our politics and Oby Ezekwesili will be leading the charge.
