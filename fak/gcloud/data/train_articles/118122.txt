What is CERN doing? Bizarre clouds over Large Hadron Collider 'prove portals are opening
That is if you are incined to believe the latest conspiracy theory surrounding the monster machine. A video claims two images showing cloud and light over the LHC at Geneva on the French/Swiss border were taken on June 24 - the same day CERN scientists began a new Awake experiment to change the way it smashes particles together. The film, entitled What portal did CERN open now? Strange Clouds Hover Above the LHC, was made by Freedom Fighter Times, a religious conspiracy theory channel on YouTube, and raises "major concerns" about what the LCH is being used for. The narrator of the video of CERN, otherwise known as European Organisation for Nuclear Research, claims the two images had been forensically researched and been found to be genuine and not edited.
