HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACES 2017 OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD:

JANUARY ENROLLMENT REPORT



For the period: November 1 - December 24, 2016

During the fourth open enrollment period, the individual market Health Insurance Marketplaces (“the Marketplaces”) continue to play an important role in fulfilling one of the Affordable Care Act’s core goals: reducing the number of uninsured Americans by providing access to quality, affordable health insurance.

This report provides interim data on enrollment-related activity in the Marketplaces during the first part of the 2017 Open Enrollment Period (OEP) for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (covering the period from November 1, 2016 through December 24, 2016). The report indicates that, as of December 24, 2016, more than 11.5 million individuals are signed up for 2017 coverage through the Marketplaces, an increase of 286,000 people compared to the comparable period last year.

The report includes detailed state-level data on the characteristics of these individuals. The report includes data on the overall distribution of plan selections through the Marketplaces by gender, metal level, age, and financial assistance status (i.e., whether the consumer will receive advance premium tax credits and/or cost-sharing reductions). Additionally, it includes separate breakouts on new consumers and those who are reenrolling in coverage, and data related to completed applications, eligibility determinations, website visitors, and call center activity. Some or all of these data are available for states using the HealthCare.gov platform and the 12 State-Based Marketplaces (SBMs) that are using their own Marketplace enrollment platforms for the 2017 coverage year.

Additionally, for the HealthCare.gov states, the report includes data on the distribution of plan selections by self-reported race/ethnicity, rural status, and household income; data on the number of reenrollees who actively reenrolled and/or changed plans; and data on the average monthly advance premium tax credit.
