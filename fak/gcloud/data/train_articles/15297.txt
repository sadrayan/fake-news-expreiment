2,220,300 people were incarcerated in the United States at yearend 2013, the most recent count

​ (see Table 1 here)​

.

​ This is the population in county jails, state prisons, and federal prisons. ​

At yearend 2014, the United States held an estimated 1,561,500

​people

in state and federal

​prisons

I'll get back to you soon about the second point.

The concept of "career criminals," which you can read a bit about in this book from influential criminologist Al Blumstein (from 1986) gets to your second point. Note that the uses quotes when using the term, presumably b/c it's pretty politically loaded.

Here's more recent scholarship on this issue, again indirectly related to your question and with far more detail than you need (also, it's focused on the question of whether all people age out of crime). But you might want to contact these scholars for a more specific answer to your question than I've provided (or dig around in the article to find an answer). Sorry that I can't help more now.

Can you or a colleague tell me how this fact sheet got to its counts of Americans with criminal convictions? Are the counts (including the 100 million figure) adults only?

The Bureau of Justice Statistics has estimated that in 2012, 100,596,300 individuals had criminal history files with states - this figure includes arrests that did not result in conviction and double counts people who had files with multiple states. This figure does not include youth who were adjudicated as juveniles.
