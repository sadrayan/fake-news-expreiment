Perry tells New Hampshire voters he opposes border fence
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry may have been 2,000 miles from the border, but his immigration record in Texas quickly became the focus in New Hampshire on Saturday afternoon.

Speaking to hundreds of Granite State voters at a private reception, the Texas governor was asked whether he supported a fence along the Mexican border.

“No, I don’t support a fence on the border,�? he said, while referring to the Texas border. “The fact is, it’s 1,200 miles from Brownsville to El Paso. Two things: How long you think it would take to build that? And then if you build a 30-foot wall from El Paso to Brownsville, the 35-foot ladder business gets real good.�?

Instead, Perry said he supported “strategic fencing�? and National Guard troops to prevent illegal immigration and violence from Mexican drug cartels.

The answer produced an angry shout from at least one audience member. And it exposed an ongoing rift with some conservative voters over Perry’s immigration record.

Tea party activists in Texas have been particularly upset by his steady opposition to the fence. He also signed a law giving illegal immigrants in-state tuition for Texas universities. And Texas tea party groups sent Perry an open letter this year expressing disappointment over his failure to get a bill passed that would have outlawed sanctuary cities, municipalities that protect illegal immigrants.

Perry has been consistent in opposing a total fence or wall, but now backs some urban fencing in strategic areas.

He has surged to the lead in national polls since joining the presidential race three weeks ago. But New Hampshire Republicans are just getting to know him.

“I think there are a lot of questions out there still,�? said tea party activist Jerry DeLemus, chairman of the Granite State Patriots Liberty PAC. “We don’t know him very well.�?
