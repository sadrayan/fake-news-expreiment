DEAN LORICH Obituary - New York, New York
It's so difficult to believe. It is so, so sad... Nine years ago he operated my 3 bones broken and displaced ankle. Young and beautiful and the top orthopedic surgeon who people trusted like a god. I wanted to give his information to my friend and coworker, who really needed help from this level of surgeon. I was looking for his card I keep for 9 years and then also went online and saw this obituary. Its an irreplaceable loss.
