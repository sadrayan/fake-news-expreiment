Dem poll: Michelle Nunn stronger than John Barrow - James Hohmann
Democrat Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn, performed slightly better than Democratic Rep. John Barrow in a head-to-head matchup against Republican Jack Kingston in the Georgia Senate race, according to a poll conducted for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in March.

Barrow announced Tuesday that he will not seek the Senate seat being opened by Republican Saxby Chambliss’ retirement. A moderate who survived in a Republican-leaning district that includes Augusta, Barrow has often been mentioned as the strongest hope for the party.

But the internal survey of 800, obtained by POLITICO, found that Barrow would have started off a general election down 4 points against Rep. Jack Kingston, 33 percent to 29 percent. Nunn, the CEO of the non-profit Points of Light Institute which encourages volunteerism, would have begun down just 1 point, 33 percent to 32 percent.

Kingston is among several candidates expected to run in the GOP primary. The poll assumed he would be the Republican nominee because Democrats view him potentially as the strongest opponent.

All of the candidates start off virtually unknown to voters statewide, something that will change after millions of dollars are spent on attack ads. Barrow and Kingston had identical name identification, viewed favorably by 18 percent and unfavorably by 10 percent. Nunn’s name ID was lower, viewed favorably by 14 percent and unfavorably by just 5 percent.

After positive and negative messages were read about all three candidates, Nunn led Kingston by three points, 37 percent to 34 percent, while Barrow trailed Kingston by one, 33 percent to 32 percent. Both were within the margin of error.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the percent that Michelle Nunn would have in a general election matchup with Jack Kingston.
