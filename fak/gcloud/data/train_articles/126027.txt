FACT CHECK: McDonald’s Employee Accused of Smuggling 80 Lbs of McNuggets
On 21 September 2016, the World News Daily Report web site published an article reporting that a McDonald’s employee was arrested for smuggling (over time) an estimated 80 lbs. of frozen chicken nuggets in his anal cavity:

An employee of a McDonald’s restaurant in Canada was accused of stealing more than 80 lbs of chicken Mcnuggets from his employer, allegedly hiding them in his rectum to smuggle them out of his workplace. 31-year old Andy Brown was arrested this morning by the Ottawa Police, after a cavity search revealed four condoms filled with frozen chicken nuggets hidden in his rectum … According to McDonald’s spokesman David Knoxx, Mr Brown’s employer had suspected him of stealing food for some time and had already searched him on five occasions, but they never seemed to find anything on him. Mr Brown now faces five charges of petty theft and two charges of possession of stolen property, after allegedly stealing more than 80 lbs of McNuggets between the month of December 2015 and September 2016.

This story was just another piece of fake news, and the appended mugshot dated to 2008 and was unrelated to the smuggling of Chicken McNuggets from McDonald’s.
