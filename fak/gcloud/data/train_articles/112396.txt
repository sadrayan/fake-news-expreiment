A BILL

To require that health plans provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay for mastectomies, lumpectomies, and lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer and coverage for secondary consultations.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the `Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 2007'.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that--

(2) health care providers located in a State serve patients who reside in the State and patients who reside in other States; and

SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974.

Such plan or coverage may not--

`(A) except as provided for in paragraph (2)--

`(i) restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with a mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (such as a lumpectomy) for the treatment of breast cancer to less than 48 hours; or

`(ii) restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with a lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer to less than 24 hours; or

`(B) require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or the issuer for prescribing any length of stay required under subparagraph (A) (without regard to paragraph (2)).

`(2) EXCEPTION- Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the provision of inpatient coverage if the attending physician and patient determine that either a shorter period of hospital stay, or outpatient treatment, is medically appropriate.

`(b) Prohibition on Certain Modifications- In implementing the requirements of this section, a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may not modify the terms and conditions of coverage based on the determination by a participant or beneficiary to request less than the minimum coverage required under subsection (a).

`(c) Notice- A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan shall provide notice to each participant and beneficiary under such plan regarding the coverage required by this section in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary.

Such plan or issuer shall ensure that full coverage is provided for such secondary consultation whether such consultation is based on a positive or negative initial diagnosis. In any case in which the attending physician certifies in writing that services necessary for such a secondary consultation are not sufficiently available from specialists operating under the plan with respect to whose services coverage is otherwise provided under such plan or by such issuer, such plan or issuer shall ensure that coverage is provided with respect to the services necessary for the secondary consultation with any other specialist selected by the attending physician for such purpose at no additional cost to the individual beyond that which the individual would have paid if the specialist was participating in the network of the plan.

`(2) EXCEPTION- Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed as requiring the provision of secondary consultations where the patient determines not to seek such a consultation.

`(e) Prohibition on Penalties or Incentives- A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may not--

`(1) penalize or otherwise reduce or limit the reimbursement of a provider or specialist because the provider or specialist provided care to a participant or beneficiary in accordance with this section;

`(2) provide financial or other incentives to a physician or specialist to induce the physician or specialist to keep the length of inpatient stays of patients following a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or a lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer below certain limits or to limit referrals for secondary consultations;

`(3) provide financial or other incentives to a physician or specialist to induce the physician or specialist to refrain from referring a participant or beneficiary for a secondary consultation that would otherwise be covered by the plan or coverage involved under subsection (d); or

`(4) deny to a woman eligibility, or continued eligibility, to enroll or to renew coverage under the terms of the plan or coverage solely for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this section.'.

(b) Clerical Amendment- The table of contents in section 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 713 the following:

`Sec. 714. Required coverage for minimum hospital stay for mastectomies, lumpectomies, and lymph node dissections for the treatment of breast cancer and coverage for secondary consultations.'.
