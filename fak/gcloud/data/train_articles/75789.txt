Ohio taxpayers will likely pay for Kasich's security while on presidential campaign

Ohio taxpayers likely are paying the bill for overtime and other costs accompanying the State Highway Patrol security detail that protects Gov. John Kasich as he campaigns for the presidency across the U.S.

Unless an unknown third-party is reimbursing the state, the Ohio treasury is paying the security-related expenses associated with the Republican�s travels that do not involve official state business.

In response to a public-records request from The Dispatch, state officials said on Friday that the Department of Public Safety has no records reflecting billings sent to, or payments made by, New Day for America, Kasich�s campaign committee.

The parent agency of the patrol declined to release records detailing the pay, overtime and compensatory time off earned by the governor�s Executive Protection Unit and the troopers� expense reports.

The records are legally exempt from release because their disclosure could imperil Kasich�s safety by revealing �patterns, techniques or information relevant to the size, scope or nature of the security and protection provided to the governor,� a public-safety lawyer wrote.

State officials have declined to say who is paying the costs of Kasich�s patrol security detail as he campaigns out of state. Kasich has made nearly 30 campaign and fundraising visits since late March.

�For the safety of the governor, his family and those with him, we simply never discuss security procedures or resources,� said Rob Nichols, Kasich�s spokesman.

The Ohio Republican Party first paid for Kasich on his travels; the tab has since been picked up by New Day for America.

State law requires the patrol to protect the governor. Kasich is assigned around-the-clock security whether at his Riffe Center office, his home outside Westerville or traveling in or out of state for vacation or any other purpose.

Kasich is scheduled to announce his presidential candidacy on Tuesday at Ohio State University. A spokesman for New Day for America did not respond on Friday to messages seeking comment on the governor�s security costs.

Other governors seeking the GOP presidential nomination also receive state-provided security. The campaign of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that while the state pays the wages of his security detail, his campaign pays for their travel and meal expenses.

State payroll information posted online seems to show some core members of Kasich�s security detail earning increasing amounts of overtime as the governor�s campaign travels have quickened, The Dispatch found.

Some executive-protection troopers who typically earn less than $3,000 during a two-week pay period have received checks nearing or exceeding $4,000 in gross pay. The online records do not break out overtime-pay or comp-time amounts. The core security troopers earned a total of $713,455 last year.

The state also refused a Dispatch request for records detailing out-of-state use of patrol vehicles.

A Dispatch reporter saw members of Kasich�s security detail driving two unmarked vehicles with Ohio license plates while the governor campaigned June 16 in Lansing, Mich. Kasich rode in a vehicle that appeared identical to the patrol vehicle used to escort him around the Columbus area.

State Sen. Charleta B. Tavares, D-Columbus, plans to introduce a bill on Monday to end state payment of his security on political trips.

�No one is saying the governor should not have adequate security to protect himself and his family,� she said. �But, if he is running for president, Ohio taxpayers should not have to foot the bill ... when the trips are completely unrelated to his job as governor.�

Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper added: �Kasich�s attempts to stymie public requests for this information are ridiculous. And if it turns out Ohio taxpayers are paying for his out-of-state campaign security, the campaign should reimburse the state for every nickel.�

The liberal blog Plunderbund sued the Department of Public Safety in 2013 after the agency refused to release records of threats against Kasich, arguing that they were exempt security records involving his personal safety.

The blog argued that the exemption for security records involving a �public office� concerned only building blueprints, security schedules and similar matters.

The Ohio Supreme Court unanimously ruled in August that the security exemption extends to Kasich himself and that the records could legally remain secret to help protect the safety of the governor, his staff and family.
