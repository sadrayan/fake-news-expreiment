Trump makes historic visit to Western Wall
Jerusalem (CNN) President Donald Trump on Monday became the first sitting US president to visit the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in Judaism.

Trump, wearing a yarmulke, placed his right hand on the wall and swayed slightly back and forth with his eyes closed for nearly a minute. He then reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a noted on a folded piece of paper, and placed it into a crack in the wall.

He was flanked by his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and Western Wall Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovich.

First lady Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter, also prayed at the wall, at the portion reserved for women.

Trump visited the Western Wall without any Israeli government officials by his side despite requests from Israeli officials.
