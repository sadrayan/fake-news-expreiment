Redskins: Dan Snyder's net worth grows
There’s no question that Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder has learned lessons in being an NFL owner.

A savvy business owner to start, Snyder, a die-hard Redskins’ fan, has taken some lumps in being the owner of the Redskins.

Many of those early mistakes in spending have seemingly been rectified by hiring the right people to help from the football standpoint, leaving Snyder to focus solely on the business aspect.

The top “right football person” was the addition of Scot McCloughan as general manager last year.

And over the course the year, Forbes Magazine reports that Snyder’s personal fortune has grown.

“A lifelong Redskins fan, Dan Snyder bought the NFL team for $800 million after former Forbes 400 member Jack Kent Cooke died in 1997. The Redskins are the third-most valuable team in the league, worth $2.85 billion, thanks to a wealthy and passionate fan base, NFL TV deals and a $205 million stadium naming rights agreement with FedEx. Snyder, who owns 60% of the team, made his first fortune in marketing, when his fledgling company Snyder Communications sold advertisements placed on boards inside of buildings, and distributed product samples. The firm went public in 1996, making Snyder, then 32, the youngest CEO on the New York Stock Exchange. Four years later, French company Havas bought Snyder Communications for $2.5 billion in stock, netting Snyder an estimated $300 million in the process. The Maryland-native also owns private equity firm Red Zone Capital, mansions in Maryland and Colorado, multiple planes and a 224-foot yacht.”
