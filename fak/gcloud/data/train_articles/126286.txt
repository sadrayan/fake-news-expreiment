Picture of Tornado in the Villages

A village resident took this photo of the Tornado

(for those of you who don’t know, The Villages is a retirement housing area just a little north of Leesburg, FL, and we [they] had tremendous storms and tornadoes a couple of weeks ago – lots of damage and 20 deaths – no deaths at The Villages, but other places in the path of the storms)

Hey everyone, this is a picture of the tornado taken with a cell phone. In the right corner of the picture is the tower at Lake Sumter Landing. Jim got these from a victim of the storm.

Memphis Tornado

A friend of mine that works at the BNSF Railroad sent this picture to me a

few seconds ago. AWESOME!!! Someone in the tower took a picture as it

came through the yard and hit the Memphis ramp.
