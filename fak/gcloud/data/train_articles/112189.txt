Trump's comments came as he wrapped up a trip to Singapore, where he held a historic face-to-face meeting with Kim and signed an agreement committing the U.S. to unspecified "security guarantees" in exchange for the eventual denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

The president also said that he planned to invite Kim to Washington for future talks and predicted that they would meet again "many times."

Prior to his departure for Singapore on Saturday, Trump spoke about North Korea's potential to be a "great" country. But his comments on Tuesday put his experience as a real estate developer on full display.

"You have South Korea, you have China and they own the land in the middle. How bad is that, right?" he continued. "It’s great."
