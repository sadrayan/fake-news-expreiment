Trump: The Capitol a 'Living Monument to the American People'

Rep. Luis Gutierrez turned and left the State of the Union address Tuesday, just as Republicans broke into a "USA" chant.

President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building, which he then called a "monument to the American people."

In that section of remarks, Trump also praised veterans in wars from the Revolution, through World War II and today, mentioning sites like Saratoga, N.Y., Yorktown, V.A. and the Pacific theater.

As half of the gallery broke into a "USA" chant, Gutierrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber.

A Democratic member patted Gutierrez on the shoulder as he passed.

In a statement, Gutierrez - who announced his retirement this year - called Trump's speech "well-delivered [considering] whoever translated it from Russian did a good job."

Gutierrez also ripped Trump for what he considered the administration's mistreatment of Puerto Rico, saying that Trump is treating it like a "s***hole country."

"For the life of me, I can't figure out when democrats became so... anti-middle America," Deputy White House Press Secretary J. Hogan Gidley said.
