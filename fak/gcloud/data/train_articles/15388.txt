According to table 1 in the study below, which breaks it out by type of complication, vasectomy carries a 3.4% risk of infection. By contrast, A first-trimester abortion is one of the safest medical procedures and carries minimal risk—less than 0.05%—of major complications that might need hospital care. Complications of vasectomy are not the Institute’s primary area of expertise, so I would refer you to the Male Contraceptive Initiative for more in-depth information - https://www.malecontraceptive.org/.
