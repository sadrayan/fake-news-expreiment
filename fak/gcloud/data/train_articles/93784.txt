My System



A pal in S Carolina just emailed this to me.....



There recently was an article in the St. Petersburg , Fl. Times. The Business Section asked readers for ideas on: "How Would You Fix the Economy?" I think this guy nailed it!



Dear Mr. President,



Please find below my suggestion for fixing America's economy. Instead of giving billions of dollars to companies that will squander the money on lavish parties and unearned bonuses, use the following plan.



You can call it the "Patriotic Retirement Plan":



There are about 40 million people over 50 in the work force. Pay them $1 million TAX FREE apiece severance for early retirement with the following stipulations:



1) They MUST retire. Forty million job openings - Unemployment fixed.



2) They MUST buy a new AMERICAN Car. Forty million cars ordered - Auto Industry fixed.



3) They MUST either buy a house or pay off their mortgage - Housing Crisis fixed.



It can't get any easier than that!!



P.S. If more money is needed, have all members in Congress pay their taxes...



Mr.. President, while you're at it, make Congress retire on Social Security and Medicare. I'll bet both programs would be fixed pronto!













Live, Laugh, Hope - If that don't work Load, Aim and Fire.... __________________
