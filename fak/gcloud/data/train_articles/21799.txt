August 25, 2016 - Clinton Tops 50 Percent, Leads Trump By 10 Points, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Voters Like Clinton More Than Trump - But Not Much

PDF format



In the battle of the unloved presidential candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton tops the magical 50 percent mark among American likely voters, leading Republican Donald Trump 51 - 41 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University National poll released today.





When third party candidates are added to the mix, Clinton gets 45 percent with Trump at 38 percent, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson at 10 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4 percent, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University Poll finds. This survey of likely voters can not be compared with results of earlier surveys of registered voters.





Women and non-white voters propel Clinton in the head-to-head matchup. Women back her 60 - 36 percent. Men back Trump 48 - 42 percent. White voters back Trump 52 - 41 percent. Non-white voters back Clinton 77 - 15 percent.





A total of 44 percent of American likely voters like Clinton "a lot" or "a little," while 47 percent dislike her "a little" or "a lot," and 8 percent hate her.





A total of 35 percent of voters like Trump "a lot" or "a little," while 53 percent dislike him "a little" or a lot," and 10 percent hate him.





"We are starting to hear the faint rumblings of a Hillary Clinton landslide as her 10-point lead is further proof that Donald Trump is in a downward spiral as the clock ticks," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





"Trump's missteps, stumbles and gaffes seem to outweigh Clinton's shaky trust status and perceived shady dealings. Wow, is there any light at the end of this dark and depressing chapter in American politics?"





American likely voters give both candidates negative favorability ratings, 41 - 53 percent for Clinton and 33 - 61 percent for Trump. In fact, 37 percent of likely voters say they would consider voting for a third party candidate.





In this very negative race, 64 percent of Trump supporters say they are voting mainly anti-Clinton, while 25 percent say they are voting pro-Trump.





Among Clinton supporters, 47 percent are mainly anti-Trump while 32 percent are pro- Clinton.





While both candidates have negative scores on honesty, this is one area where Trump outscores Clinton. American likely voters say 53 - 42 percent that Trump is not honest. By a huge 66 - 29 percent margin, voters say Clinton is not honest.





But voters say 66 - 33 percent that Clinton is qualified to be president. Trump is not qualified, voters say 58 - 40 percent. Clinton leads on other measures, as likely voters say:

58 - 40 that she has good leadership skills, compared to negative 46 - 52 for Trump;

71 - 29 percent that Clinton has the right kind of experience to be president, compared to a negative 32 - 65 percent for Trump;

87 - 12 percent that she is intelligent, compared to 67 - 30 percent for him;

51 - 47 percent that she cares about average Americans, compared to a negative 41 - 57 percent for Trump.

American likely voters say 60 - 37 percent that Clinton believes she does not have to play by the same rules as everyone else.





Taxes, Bigotry, First Spouses





Trump should release his tax returns publicly, voters say 74 - 21 percent, including 62 - 31 percent among Republicans.





Voters also say 59 - 36 percent "the way Donald Trump talks appeals to bigotry."





In the battle of the first spouses, voters say 47 - 23 percent that former President Bill Clinton would have a positive effect on his wife's presidency. Melania Trump would have no impact on a Trump presidency, 65 percent of voters say.





From August 18 - 24, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,498 likely voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and the nation as a public service and for research.
