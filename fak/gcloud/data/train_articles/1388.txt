Our take on: Welfare drug tests

Drug testing Florida's welfare recipients isn't a new idea, nor is it necessarily a budget-saver. Still, it's come up in this year's campaign for governor. Republican Rick Scott backs it enthusiastically. Democrat Alex Sink's only concern seems to be the cost.

Did either candidate check the records?

If so, they would have found that in 1998, the Legislature approved a pilot project for the Jacksonville area and parts of Putnam County. The goal was to implement a drug-screening and testing program for applicants seeking temporary cash assistance.

The pilot examined 8,797 applicants who participated in the initial screenings over an 18-month period and came to a stark conclusion: Drug use wasn't a problem. Only 335 applicants showed evidence of having a controlled substance in their system and failed the test.

Drug testing welfare recipients may make a good sound bite, but given the growing costs of Medicaid and fraud in Medicare, Floridians would be better off if the next chief executive focuses on those problems.

It's not like there's big money to be made from abusing the cash assistance program that is the state's core welfare program. On average, those families get $240 a month, peanuts on the rip-off scale when compared to other social services, particularly Medicare fraud.

The costs to provide the testing don't add up, either. In the pilot program it cost almost $90 per test, which resulted in a $2.7 million expense. Those numbers will only go up if drug testing goes statewide, and the costs could exceed the tens of millions level if food stamp recipients are included. Currently, one of every six Floridians receives food stamps.

The next governor will have more pressing matters than starting a new initiative that only promises dubious results.
