About Attorney Stephen J. Meyer
About Stephen J. Meyer

Stephen J. Meyer is a sole practitioner dedicated exclusively to the representation of individual citizens accused of crimes in state and federal court. He was recently named by Best Lawyers In America as Wisconsin's 2016 Top Criminal Defense Lawyer. This follows his award in 2014 as Madison's Top White Collar Criminal Defense Lawyer. Both of these awards are, in part, a result of his accomplishments on behalf of clients over the last five years. Most recently he convinced the the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Weimert, 819 F.3d 351 (7th Cir. 2016) to vacate the wire fraud conviction of his client and to order the client's immediate release from federal custody. This win followed a not guilty verdict in state court after a two week jury trial where the underlying charge alleged that the defendant had engaged in abusive head trauma to a child, State v. Hartje , Juneau County case number 12 CF 34. Prior to these cases, attorney Meyer successfully discredited suspect forensic evidence in a high profile arson case and a handwriting case.



An adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, teaching evidence and trial advocacy, Mr. Meyer has been a frequent speaker and author on the rules of evidence and topics related to the practice of criminal law. He is one of the only Wisconsin lawyers who is both a Top 25 Wisconsin Superlawyer and listed in Best Lawyers of America (2001 - 2017). Active in community affairs, he is a member of the Board of Directors for Community Work Services Foundation, and is the past president of the Middleton Cardinal Booster Club.

Previously, Mr. Meyer has served as a special investigator and prosecutor for the Wisconsin Department of Justice and on the local investigative committee for the Office of Lawyer Regulation.



He has practiced law for over 39 years after graduating cum laude from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1979.
