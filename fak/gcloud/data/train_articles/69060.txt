Georgia Senate candidate invokes Syria attack in radio ad
A Republican candidate for Senate in Georgia has released a radio ad that uses the congressional debate over whether to attack Syria to score political points.

Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, uses President Obama's call for military intervention in Syria in retaliation for its use of chemical weapons against its own people to differentiate herself from Democratic frontrunner Michelle Nunn.

"On military intervention in Syria, there is a clear difference between Democrat Michelle Nunn and me," the ad says.

Handel says she opposes military action and attempts to tie Nunn to Obama, who remains unpopular in the red state.

The ad might be the first in the country to invoke the Syria debate, although some candidates, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have used the issue to make fundraising appeals.

Handel is one of seven candidates seeking the Republican nomination in Georgia, where Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss's retirement will leave an open seat.
