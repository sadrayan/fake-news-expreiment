What are bitters and how are they used in cocktails?
"Bitters are like the spice rack of the cocktail world," according to Ira Koplowitz, co-founder of Bittercube.

"When cooking with spices, drastically different flavor profiles can be achieved with varying spice blends," he said. "The same can be said for bitters."

More literally speaking, bitters are a liquid extraction of seeds, herbs, bark, roots, flowers, leaves and fruit of various plants. They are highly concentrated and are used by the dash to flavor cocktails.

Their history, according to Koplowitz, goes back to ancient times when bittering agents were used by apothecaries to cleanse the body of toxins and aid in digestion.

Today bitters come in little bottles with eyedroppers, and a drop or two can drastically change the flavor profile of a drink.

"When applied judiciously, they expose the diversity of aromas and flavors in a cocktail," Koplowitz said.

Each brand of bitters has its own qualities that bring unique flavors to cocktails. Angostura and Peychaud's are two old, esteemed brands that you may run across in classic cocktail recipes. Locally, Bittercube has been making handcrafted bitters in Milwaukee since 2009.

Bitters can add interest to simple drinks like a vodka tonic or balance the sour and sweet flavors of sours and fizzes. Koplowitz said bitters add needed complexity to stirred cocktails like the old-fashioned and the Manhattan, both of which call for Angostura bitters. Try garnishing a completed cocktail with five drops of bitters on top for added aroma.
