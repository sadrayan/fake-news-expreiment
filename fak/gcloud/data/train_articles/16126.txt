ACS for 2013 residents who moved into the MSA from someplace else within the year:

B07201: GEOGRAPHICAL MOBILITY IN THE PAST YEAR FOR CURRENT RESIDENCE--METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA LEVEL IN THE UNITED STATES - Universe: Population 1 year and over living in a Metropolitan Statistical Area in the United States

2013 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, Austin MSA

Total population 1 yr & over Same house 1 year ago Different house 1 year ago Moved from a different metro or non-metro area in the U.S. or abroad Same metro Elsewhere in the U.S. Abroad Total Percent 1,860,170 1,477,422 243,652 124,414 14,682 139,096 7.5%

There are also tables for people who were residents of Austin one year ago, giving numbers who moved to a different county, different state, etc., but I’m not getting numbers that match the figures from Bernstein. Also, there does not seem to be a table comparable to the one above (where movers within the metro can be separated out). I’d just need more time to sort out what tables Bernstein’s numbers came from, but don’t know that you need that. I have attached the two tables that I think he’d have been using.

The 5-year ACS data (2008-2012) is used in the Census Bureau product called the Census Flows Mapper (http://flowsmapper.geo.census.gov/flowsmapper/flowsmapper.html) which allows you to get county-to-county migration numbers (in, out and net). It does not cover international migrants. My colleague is working on a piece using this data and he’s given me the following for domestic movers: 112,430 move into the 5-county metro annually (308 per day) and 75,044 move out (206 per day), with the net being 37,386 (102 per day).
