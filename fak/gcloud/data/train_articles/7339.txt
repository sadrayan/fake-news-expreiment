Is Trump a Liberal Mole? The Donald Reacts to GOP Lawmaker's Claim
Donald Trump this morning commented on a lawmaker’s new theory that Trump might be a liberal mole.

Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) told the Miami Herald:

"I think there's a small possibility that this gentleman is a phantom candidate. Mr. Trump has a close friendship with Bill and Hillary Clinton. They were at his last wedding. He has contributed to the Clintons' foundation. He has contributed to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaigns. All of this is very suspicious."

Trump told the hosts of “Fox and Friends” that he’s the one person whom Hillary Clinton won’t want to run against.

He also explained past campaign contributions.

“I’m a businessman, I contribute to everybody … That’s part of the problem with the system,” he said, explaining that politicians do what’s best for donors and not for the country.

Trump then took a shot at Jeb Bush, asserting that everyone who has given the 2016 presidential contender money will expect something from him.

”Jeb Bush will never produce a job in his life,” Trump said.

The “Fox and Friends” hosts then played a quick round of “the name game” with Trump, asking him to describe a series of people in a few words. Read some of the responses below.

On Hillary Clinton:

“Nice person, has no energy, will never bring our country back.”

On Rick Perry:

“He was much nastier than he should have been, and really, he failed at the border.”

On David Letterman:

“A very funny guy […] and he came out of retirement to do a top 10 on me! So I think I’m honored, I don’t know if I liked it, but I think I’m honored.”

On his wife Melania:

“A beautiful, wonderful woman with a great heart.”
