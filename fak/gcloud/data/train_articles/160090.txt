A Day With the Oldest Woman to Ever Live
Michael Steverson

Luo Meizhen, who Chinese officials claimed was the oldest living person ever at 127 years old, died this past weekend. The retired farmer passed away after recently developing a string of health problems.

While it was not unexpected, I was still saddened by the news. I'd been fortunate enough to spend a few hours with Luo in her home this past February. She was a bit cranky the day we met, initially refusing to let me take any photographs. We talked for a while, but even that wasn't easy. Luo was a member of the Yao nationality and spoke very little Mandarin. The conversation went from me, to my wife Lilly, to a great-grandson, to a daughter-in-law, to Ms. Luo ... and then back. Asking each question, in this manner, took nearly an hour. She was easily distracted and would lose interest from time to time, but mentally she seemed to be right there with us. She was still feisty too, taking my hand at one point and then quickly throwing it aside, exclaiming to everyone that the foreigner was very fat! Luo warmed up after a while and in the end consented to having her photo taken.
