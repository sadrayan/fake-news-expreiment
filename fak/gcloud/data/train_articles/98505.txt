Stephen Harper ConservativePrime Minister

Mr. Speaker, of course, we have air forces that are in combat. We have not had a soldier killed behind enemy lines or, for that matter, killed by enemy forces. That is a reality.

These are the things we are doing to protect this country and to assist the Iraqis in doing a better job of safeguarding their own country.

I do not know what the policy is on the other side. I hear all kinds of reasons why we should provide humanitarian aid, which we are doing. I hear no compelling argument on the other side as to why we should completely ignore the very real threat to this country, which Canadians know exists.

This government understands it, and we are working with the entire international community, which understands it, to deal with it.
