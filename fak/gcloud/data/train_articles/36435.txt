Commodity Costs and Returns
Cost and return estimates are reported for the United States and major production regions for corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, grain sorghum, rice, peanuts, oats, barley, milk, hogs, and cow-calf. The series of commodity cost and return estimates for the U.S. and regions is divided into two categories: Recent and Historical estimates. Recent estimates date back to the point of the most recent major revision in accounting methods, account format, and regional definitions for each commodity. Historical estimates date back to when the series began. Cost-of-Production Forecasts are also available for major U.S. field crops. Organic Costs and Returns for corn, milk, wheat, and soybeans are also available.

Also, see the ERS Milk Cost of Production Estimates data product.

NEW! Recent Commodity Costs and Returns data are now available in pivot tables and machine-readable sheets for all commodities.
