Steven Seagal weighs in on NFL anthem protests: 'It's disgusting'
Steven Seagal has spoken. The action film star weighed in on the practice of National Football League players who “take a knee” and refuse to stand during the national anthem before major games.

He is not happy.

“I believe in free speech. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But I don’t agree that they should hold the United States of America, or the world, hostage by taking a venue where people are tuning in to watch a football game, and imposing their political views,” Mr. Seagal said during an interview with a British talk show on Wednesday.

“I think it’s outrageous. I think it’s a joke. It’s disgusting,” the actor told “Good Morning Britain,” dressed completely in black and sporting a well-trimmed goatee — and speaking from Moscow.

Though he still owns a home in Louisiana, Mr. Seagal was granted Russian citizenship in 2016.

His comments quickly made it into the top-10 trending topics list on Twitter.

The 65-year-old star also weighed in on the possibility of a shadow government undermining President Trump and his administration.

“We have these Democrats that have this whole other agenda. When I say Democrats it’s not just the Democrats. There are this whole group of left over Obamaites and people that feel they should overthrow Trump, and any decisions he makes. Anything he tries to do, he gets blocked often from the enemies within, so it’s very difficult for him to do anything,” Mr. Seagal said.

During the interview, he also dismissed ideas that Russian officials had interfered with the 2016 presidential election, and urged Americans to rethink their relationship with Russia.

“I think most of the people in the U.S. and most of the people in Russia want to like each other. We need each other. Russia and America should be great allies,” he advised.
