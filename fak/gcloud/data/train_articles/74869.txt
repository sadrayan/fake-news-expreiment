VIDEO: Dems "BOOED" Families Of Children Murdered By MS13
The State Of The Union Address Was Chalk Full Of Democrats Boo’s and Hisses

The mother and Father of a 16-year-old Long Island girl killed by members of the MS-13 gang were in the audience when President Trump delivered his State of the Union address.

Evelyn Rodriguez, whose 16-year-old daughter, Kayla Cuevas, was found beaten and stabbed in September 2016 in Brentwood, was also been invited to the White House to speak to president Trump.

Wow! “Tonight everyone in America is grieving for you”. These African American families were brought to the center of attention tonight but Pres. Obama would not have done this simply because their daughters were killed by illegal immigrants. #SOTU pic.twitter.com/z3gvc3lb04 — Obianuju Ekeocha (@obianuju) January 31, 2018

When the President introduced the families and gave a short summary of their horrible stories, the Democrats decided they were going to “BOO” when the president called for immigration reform to help protect Americans from illegals, and other people who come to our country to harm us.

Did Democrats just seriously boo the parents of a murdered child? This is a sick group of people.#SOTU — Dan Bongino (@dbongino) January 31, 2018

This just goes to show that Democrats would rather support illegals who cause harm to Americans rather than support actual American citizens. What does this say about them? They’re DemocRATS.

It’s been a mostly frosty night on the left side of the House for tonight’s State of the Union, but when President Donald Trump said that he wants to end chain migration, some Democrats were incensed.

During the president’s remarks on immigration, he said that the “fourth pillar” of his immigration reform plan “protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.”

Not only did Democrats object to Trump’s concept of the “nuclear family” – a term which alienates a vast swath of families in the United States – but they also fundamentally disagreed with the notion that people should not be allowed to immigrate with their extended families.

“Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children,” Trump expounded. “This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.”

Democrats were also nonplussed by Trump’s assertion that the plan was a “down-the-middle compromise”: Via

Dems just laughed when Trump called his immigration framework a “down the middle compromise” #SOTU — 🦅Andrew Desiderio🦅 (@desiderioDC) January 31, 2018
