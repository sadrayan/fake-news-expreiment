Dynamite? Pfffttt.. we should have called Hulk Hogan.

The colorful pro wrestler belatedly offered his explosive charms following the Georgia Dome’s demolition Monday morning.

More than 300 pounds of explosives collapsed the steel in the upper ring and about 4,500 pounds of dynamite crumbled the Dome’s concrete columns this morning, AJC sports writer Tim Tucker reported. The operation was almost completely successful (a little of the remaining structure still has to come down) but, crucially, Mercedes-Benz Stadium is A-ok. It could probably do with some window washing but was otherwise unaffected by the enormous explosion.

Here’s what the Hulk had to say later:

The first time the Georgia Dome exploded was Hollywood Hogan vs @goldberg. Now they had to implode it. They should have just called me and Bill again brother. HH pic.twitter.com/A9n3hr18Jl — Hulk Hogan (@HulkHogan) November 20, 2017
