Hillary Clinton writes letter to Sen. Joe Manchin to clarify remarks on coal mining
CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton took a break from her presidential campaign on Tuesday to write to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin to clarify comments she made about the coal mining industry.

At a CNN town hall session in Ohio, Clinton told the crowd that "we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."

In the letter to Manchin, Clinton said she was "mistaken" in her remarks and she wanted to help reform the industry.

"I wanted to make the point that, as you know too well, while coal will be part of the energy mix for years to come, both in the U.S. and around the world, we have already seen a long-term decline in American coal jobs and a recent wave of bankruptcies as a result of a changing market - and we need to do more to support the workers and families facing these challenges," Clinton wrote.

Clinton went on to discuss her history of supporting coal miners' rights.

"I feel so strongly that we need to stand with those who have kept America's lights on and factories humming for generations," she wrote. "That's why I've been outspoken over the course of this campaign about protecting the benefits that our mineworkers earned and deserve, and why our country must honor our commitment to those workers by passing your Miners Protection Act."

She ended the letter by expressing her desire to work with Manchin in the future.

"As this campaign continues, I look forward to consulting with you on how we can help coal communities in West Virginia and across the country build the future they deserve," she wrote.
