Thank you for your question. Indeed, in Canada, the agency tasked with Canada-U.S. border enforcement is the Canada Border Services Agency, with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in concert with the U.S. Coast Guard under the joint law enforcement "Shiprider" maritime security program in the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. The Canadian Forces, the name for the Canadian military, does not participate in border enforcement.

Thanks. Are you aware of specific countries that employ the military to secure the border?

As to your question about countries that do employ the military to secure their borders, as a general rule, countries do not prioritize their military forces deployment with border enforcement unless they are involved in cross-border conflicts that necessitate emergency border management procedures. Weak states in sub-Saharan Africa have most recently fallen into this category. One other special case is the DMZ separating North Korea and South Korea, which is patrolled by both countries' military forces.
