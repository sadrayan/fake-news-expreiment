Scott Walker on possible John Doe settlement talks: We can't comment on a Doe
Gov. Scott Walker didn't directly answer a question on Sunday's "Upfront with Mike Gousha" about whether his campaign might be in settlement talks with John Doe prosecutors in a secret investigation involving the campaign.

Walker was interviewed by host Mike Gousha on the show, which is produced by WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee.

Gousha asked whether people could infer there have been settlement talks, given a statement Walker's campaign made last week. The governor said:

"No, it would be per the point I mentioned inititally, which is the state law's pretty clear, even though there might be others who don't follow that law, regardless of what the purpose is. If someone knows about a John Doe investigation of any sort, not just on this issue, by law they're prohibited from talking about it. If they don't know -- as I've said repeatedly -- people who don't know, shouldn't be talking about it. So we haven't commented on that."
