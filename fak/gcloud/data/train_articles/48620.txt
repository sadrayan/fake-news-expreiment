Congressional Scorecard
To earn a score of 100%, a member of Congress must always vote with Planned Parenthood Action Fund's position on the legislation listed above.

For a state to be 100% supportive of women's health, all members of the delegation must have a 100% score. States with 100% delegations: TBD.

The Planned Parenthood Action Fund calculates a members' score by dividing the number of supportive votes over the last six years by the total number of votes taken by that member relating to women's health.
