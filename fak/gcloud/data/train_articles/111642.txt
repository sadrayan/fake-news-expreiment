Nike Once Made A Shoe For An Elephant
words // Brandon Richard

If you're a fan of companies that think and work outside of the box, this tidbit is for you.

Several years ago, Nike learned of an elephant that had one leg shorter than the others. To help the elephant find its balance, Nike manufactured this massive leather shoe, complete with laces and buckles at the heel. The elephant was fitted for the shoe using lifts. Pink remnants on the sides are what's left from the Swoosh logos that used to adorn the sides.

This information comes to us courtesy of Nike PR's Heidi Burgett. Check out a couple photos of the elephant's custom shoe below.
