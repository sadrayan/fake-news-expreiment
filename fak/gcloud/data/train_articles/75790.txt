Kasich disputes report that claims he dramatically increased state spending

WASHINGTON – Republican presidential candidate John Kasich on Sunday sharply disputed a report by a conservative non-profit organization that asserted state spending has dramatically increased since he entered the governor�s office in January 2011.

During an interview on Fox News Sunday, Kasich dismissed the report released last month by the CATO Institute, saying he did not �know who these folks are; another Washington group.�

�We have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years and in addition to that, our budget overall is growing by about 2 percent or 3 percent,� Kasich said.

�I pay no attention to folks in Washington,� Kasich said. �I want to move power and money and influence out of that town back to where we live like normal Americans.�

Kasich�s energetic push-back against CATO -– which a Kasich spokesman later acknowledged he knows -- goes to the heart of one of the major claims of his campaign for the presidency: his determination to reduce the $7.2 trillion in publicly held debt the federal government is projected to add during the next decade.

As the chairman of the U.S. House Budget Committee in 1997, Kasich was part of a compromise budget plan that ended 30 years of annual federal deficits and led to four consecutive years of budget surpluses. As governor, he had a major hand in wiping out an $8 billion projected budget shortfall in 2011 and transforming it into a $2 billion surplus.

The dispute between CATO and Kasich revolves around two completely different ways to calculate how much the state spends in its two-year budget cycles.

CATO cites what is known as the general revenue fund, which includes money Ohio collects in state taxes as well as federal dollars for such programs as Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low-income people.

The state plans to spend $71.2 billion in general revenue fund money during the 2016-2017 budget cycle. That is substantially higher than the $52.5 billion in general revenue spending for the 2011-2012 spending years, which was Kasich�s first two-year budget.

But Kasich and his aides prefer to cite what is known as the all-funds budget, a much larger pool of money which includes what the state collects through licenses and fees, and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants for education and the environment.

By pointing to the all-funds budget, Kasich can accurately claim that overall state spending will increase by 2.1 percent between the 2016 and 2017 spending years. But even under the all-funds budget, state spending increased by 7.61 percent between 2015 and 2016.

State officials say the rapid increase in general revenue fund spending for 2016 and 2017 is because Ohio has shifted a large chunk of Medicaid spending from the all-funds budget to the general revenue fund.

When state officials accepted hundreds of millions of federal dollars in 2014 and 2015 to expand Medicaid eligibility as called for by President Barack Obama�s new health law, they placed the money in the all-funds budget. For 2016 and 2017, Medicaid expansion dollars have been shifted into the general revenue fund.

�That substantially explains substantially why the (general revenue fund) grew,� said Timothy S. Keen, director of the state office of budget and management. �It�s not new spending. It�s an accounting change.�

Kasich appeared on Fox as a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows Donald Trump leading among Republicans with 19 percent followed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker with 15 percent and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with 14 percent.

By contrast, Kasich was tied for ninth with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at 3 percent.

To qualify for Thursday�s Fox debate in Cleveland, Kasich needs to be among the top 10 candidates in a series of polls.
