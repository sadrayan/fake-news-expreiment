Wisconsin State Climatology Office
The Wisconsin State Climatology Office is affiliated with the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Our mission is to:



support climate monitoring through graphical analyses of climate data,

provide climate information to Wisconsin residents, climate scientists and government agencies,

develop "value-added" products for users and impact applications,

conduct applied climate research.

Detailed annual summaries are found on the AASC web site.

This office is a partner with Midwestern Regional Climate Center in providing climate services to the public.

Collaborations with Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) research on climate impacts are now underway.

If you would like assistance finding the climate data you want, visit our Guide to Wisconsin Weather and Climate Data.

The office staff is currently an all-volunteer operation.

Short initial inquiries for data or staff assistance staff are free. More substantial efforts are covered by our Service Charge statement.
