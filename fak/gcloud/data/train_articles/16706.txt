… As far as the percentage of wild pigs in the U.S. that call Texas home, I think that metric is more likely between 20% and 33% of the U.S. population (8 to 9 million roughly—most other states have not applied much science in coming up with their state pig population estimates). I think the numbers you quotedwere a little too high. As far as where we got the population estimate of 2.6 million—there was a lot of guessing going on as to the population estimate without much science behind those guesses. You can find that number under the “Research Findings” of the attached publications—along with a bunch of other little nuggets of info—Such as we need to be harvesting 66% of the wild pigs in TX every year just to hold the population steady (neither increasing or decreasing). However, we are only harvesting about 29% annually based on the 2010 study I conducted and also reported in the attached. Good Luck!!
