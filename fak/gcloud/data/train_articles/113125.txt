The Bleach Makers
1. The bleach cycle starts with salt water, which is broken down by electric current into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and chlorine. 2. The sodium hydroxide is mixed with water. Next, chlorine is added to form sodium hypochlorite, the active ingredient in liquid bleach. The bleach is bottled and shipped to retailers. 3. Consumers use bleach in washing machines or on household surfaces. As bleach reacts with stains and soils, it begins to break down. The cleaning process turns nearly all of the bleach back into salt water. 4. Any remaining bleach is completely deactivated at a municipal treatment facility or in a septic system through biodegradation.
