121517 FEMA Responses to Austin American

FEMA responses to queries, sent 6:51 p.m. Dec. 15, 2017 (received by PolitiFact Texas and Austin American-Statesman from Bob Howard, media relations manager, Hurricane Harvey, Federal Emergency Management Agency)

--GLO says its partnership with FEMA to provide housing or housing repairs (“short-term housing solutions”) for Texas residents through six FEMA-overseen and federally funded programs adds up to the first time there’s been this kind of post-disaster partnership where a state agency takes the lead in confirming the eligibility of people in need. He said too FEMA views this approach as a pilot project for how the government will respond to future disasters. Accurate statement? Complete? If not, please elaborate. Who initiated this approach, FEMA or GLO, and how?

We have five direct housing programs:

Manufactured Housing Options (mobile homes and recreational vehicles); DALHR (Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair); Multi-Family Housing Leasing and Repair; Direct Leasing; and PREPS (Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering).

FEMA determines an applicant’s eligibility for direct housing need. The state agency is taking the lead in administering the programs for the first time, and this may become the blueprint for future housing mission responses.

--Phillips told us Monday Dec. 11 that as of the previous weekend—as of Dec. 8—over 670 Texas families had received direct housing assistance (MAQs or trailers) through the GLO-FEMA partnership. As of this past weekend, he said, GLO had 209 MAQs, 368 travel trailers in place. He said too that MAQs have been put in place faster than they were after floods in 2016. Are these figures accurate and complete? As of Dec. 8, how many households were waiting for either? Is this happening at a faster pace than after previous disasters? If so, please quantify.

MHU is short for Manufactured Housing Unit. It could sound like MAQ over the phone.

We now have 770 Texas families in a direct housing option.

We are researching when the first MHU/travel trailer was placed last year in Texas.

--Phillips said 664 households had been contacted about possibly applying for help through DAHLR with inspections completed for 182 households of 290 households that expressed interest and 13 currently having contractors at work under DAHLR. Phillips said per DALHR’s eligibility conditions, some 2,600 Texas homes are potentially eligible for the program.

Accurate

--Brittany Eck of the agency told us the figures came from a FEMA Daily Fact Sheet—which I am seeking from you now. Perhaps it’s the 12/8/17 fact sheet but if there is also one from earlier in that week, I would welcome that as well. I am hoping that the status of provided transitional housing—hotel rooms included—also appears on that sheet or those sheets.

Our FEMA news desk can provide this verbally to the media.

--Originally, Phillips said, FEMA projected 40,426 Texas households would need housing with housing recovery costing $3 billion. Now, he said, the costs are under $1 billion because of the “high rate of fallout,” people not qualifying or choosing not to participate in DAHLR (and other programs?) or being satisfied with FEMA’s initial aid check. He said FEMA says 31,000 have located other resources and don’t seek other help. All this accurate/complete?

Currently, only 8,057 survivors show a need for Direct Housing

Of that, 2,600 currently are under review for DAHLR

--Phillips said more than half of Harvey’s evacuees (or victims) were renters who wouldn’t qualify for either DAHLR or other FEMA housing reconstruction aid. Accurate/complete?

Not Accurate. Please refer to them as survivors. Renters available for Direct Housing, Travel Trailers, MHU, Direct Lease, but must have incurred major or destroyed damage.

--Phillips said that under the FEMA Direct Lease program, an apartment complex in Wharton has made 40 units available and corporate housing in Conroe has made, or will make, 120 units available. Accurate/complete?

Accurate.

--Phillips said the PREPS program doesn’t seem to work for Harvey-hit households because, GLO has found, it feels much like being left to camp inside your own home. Is this FEMA’s judgment as well?

The Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS) program provides basic emergency repairs to homes allowing survivors to shelter in place. FEMA determines if applicants are eligible and pairs them with the best available solution to meet their individual needs.

--Phillips told us the GLO started making calls to potentially eligible DALHR households on Nov. 18, 2017. Eck told us the agency’s outreach is governed by lists of possible applicants controlled and maintained by FEMA. Accurate/complete? Why or why not?

Accurate

--You have already confirmed completion of two DAHLR projects through last week, correct? From FEMA’s perspective, has the GLO-linked part of the program gotten off to a quick, slow or expected start? Please elaborate. Phillips told us that 678 households among those considered potentially eligible for the DALHR aid already have homes. Accurate/complete information?

We believe it is two projects at this point. Collectively, this joint venture has the potential to dramatically change how the federal family, in direct support of the state, delivers temporary housing to impacted survivors.

--Phillips made mention of a Harvey-connected “tent city” in Aransas County. Describe?

We have a dedicated field team that continues to visit survivors reportedly living in tents, cars, or other austere conditions. Every effort is made to ensure survivors are aware of available local, state and federal resources. Thus far, all tent-dwellers found by the field team have indicated that they prefer to remain in their current status or are not eligible for federal disaster assistance. Those not eligible have been referred to voluntary organizations active in disasters (VOAD) and local faith-based organizations to assist them with their unmet needs.

--Phillips called Harvey the worst natural disaster in US history. He said too that nearly 900,000 households have applied to FEMA for post-Harvey aid. Both parts of this correct?

Each disaster has its own unique challenges regardless of size. For those impacted, it is the worst disaster. If we use funding as a measure, Hurricane Harvey is in sixth place overall, with Hurricane Katrina still in first place. 894,606 people have registered for FEMA assistance as of 12/14/17.
