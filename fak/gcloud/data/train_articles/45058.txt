Mental Illness

Mental illnesses are common in the United States. Nearly one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness (46.6 million in 2017). Mental illnesses include many different conditions that vary in degree of severity, ranging from mild to moderate to severe. Two broad categories can be used to describe these conditions: Any Mental Illness (AMI) and Serious Mental Illness (SMI). AMI encompasses all recognized mental illnesses. SMI is a smaller and more severe subset of AMI. Additional information on mental illnesses can be found on the NIMH Health Topics Pages.

Definitions The data presented here are from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). For inclusion in NSDUH prevalence estimates, mental illnesses include those that are diagnosable currently or within the past year; of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV); and, exclude developmental and substance use disorders. Any Mental Illness Any mental illness (AMI) is defined as a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder. AMI can vary in impact, ranging from no impairment to mild, moderate, and even severe impairment (e.g., individuals with serious mental illness as defined below). Serious Mental Illness Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. The burden of mental illnesses is particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to SMI.

Prevalence of Any Mental Illness (AMI) Figure 1 shows the past year prevalence of AMI among U.S. adults. In 2017, there were an estimated 46.6 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with AMI. This number represented 18.9% of all U.S. adults. The prevalence of AMI was higher among women (22.3%) than men (15.1%). Young adults aged 18-25 years had the highest prevalence of AMI (25.8%) compared to adults aged 26-49 years (22.2%) and aged 50 and older (13.8%). The prevalence of AMI was highest among the adults reporting two or more races (28.6%), followed by White adults (20.4%). The prevalence of AMI was lowest among Asian adults (14.5%).

Mental Health Services — AMI Figure 2 presents data on mental health services received within the past year by U.S. adults aged 18 or older with any mental illness (AMI). NSDUH defines mental health services as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling, or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health. In 2017, among the 46.6 million adults with AMI, 19.8 million (42.6%) received mental health services in the past year. More women with AMI (47.6%) received mental health services than men with AMI (34.8%). The percentage of young adults aged 18-25 years with AMI who received mental health services (38.4%) was lower than adults with AMI aged 26-49 years (43.3%) and aged 50 and older (44.2%).

Prevalence of Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Figure 3 shows the past year prevalence of SMI among U.S. adults. In 2017, there were an estimated 11.2 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with SMI. This number represented 4.5% of all U.S. adults. The prevalence of SMI was higher among women (5.7%) than men (3.3%). Young adults aged 18-25 years had the highest prevalence of SMI (7.5%) compared to adults aged 26-49 years (5.6%) and aged 50 and older (2.7%). The prevalence of SMI was highest among the adults reporting two or more races (8.1%), followed by White adults (5.2%). The prevalence of SMI was lowest among Asian adults (2.4%).

Mental Health Services — SMI Figure 4 presents data on mental health services received within the past year by U.S. adults 18 or older with serious mental illness (SMI). The NSDUH defines mental health services as having received inpatient treatment/counseling or outpatient treatment/counseling or having used prescription medication for problems with emotions, nerves, or mental health.

In 2017, among the 11.2 million adults with SMI, 7.5 million (66.7%) received mental health treatment in the past year. More women with SMI (71.5%) received mental health treatment than men with AMI (57.7%). The percentage of young adults aged 18-25 years with AMI who received mental health treatment (57.4%) was lower than adults with AMI aged 26-49 years (66.2%) and aged 50 and older (75.6%).

Prevalence of Any Mental Disorder Among Adolescents Based on diagnostic interview data from National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), Figure 5 shows lifetime prevalence of any mental disorder among U.S. adolescents aged 13-18. 1 An estimated 49.5% of adolescents had any mental disorder. Of adolescents with any mental disorder, an estimated 22.2% had severe impairment. DSM-IV based criteria were used to determine impairment level.
