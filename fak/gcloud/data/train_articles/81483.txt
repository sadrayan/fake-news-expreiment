IOWA CITY - Presidential Candidate Barack Obama is trying to change political fashion. He gave a speech in Iowa City Wednesday and he wasn't wearing an American flag pin.



Those pins have become synonymous with politicians since 9-11.



Obama says he doesn't like how the pin has come to represent patriotism in America.



The senator told TV-9, "I decided I won't wear that pin on my chest, instead I'm going to try to tell the American people what I believe will make this country great. Hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism."



This was Obama's second visit to Johnson County in as many days.
