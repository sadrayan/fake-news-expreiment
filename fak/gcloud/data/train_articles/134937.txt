Photos: Vladimir Putin is pumping iron, sipping tea in $1,400 sweatpants
This post has been updated.

Russian president Vladimir Putin was joined by his prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, for a morning workout on a lovely Sunday, in an open-air gym at the Bocharov Ruchei state residence in Sochi.

It’s unclear whether the men planned their outfits—though not impossible, since this appeared to be a highly orchestrated, highly bizarre photo opportunity—but they managed to complement one another nicely, without being matchy-matchy.

Putin wore a pair of cashmere-and-silk jogger pants made by Loro Piana, and sold for $1,425—as opposed to the more pedestrian $800 sweatpants we’ve covered at Quartz. Putin paired them, as online retailer Mr Porter suggests, with a basic tee. (Former US president Ronald Reagan could have used this advice, but instead wore his with a tie.)

At one point, the men donned sweatshirts to match their pants. Putin’s Loro Piana version would bring the price of his sweatsuit to around $3200, putting it squarely in the realm of ath-luxury.

The men proceeded to have an athleisurely morning, grilling meat, and adorably toasting with their tea cups. Just another Sunday in Sochi.

This post has been updated to reflect the confirmation from a Loro Piana spokesperson: Putin is indeed wearing the brand’s Portland cashmere-and-silk sweatsuit.
