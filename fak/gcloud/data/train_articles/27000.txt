Stormy Daniels Announces Plans To Run For President
Porn star Stormy Daniels is considering running for President in 2020. And she would run as a Republican. She brought this up in an interview with the Chicago Tribune. She claimed that since she accused President Trump, her fanbase has changed. It has gone from porn-lovers to liberal women and gay men.

“This didn’t start with a political agenda. I think it’s really funny that most people don’t even know that I’m Republican,” she said. She went on to criticize the use of the term ‘porn star Stormy Daniels’.

“They make it political in the same way that they have to put porn star in front of my name. If I was a librarian, it wouldn’t be: Librarian Stormy Daniels,” she said.

When someone’s like, ‘You’re speaking out for all women and you’re going to save the world’ — what do you mean? I just wanted to stand up for myself, now I’m standing up for everyone. I guess there’s a reason for it,” explained Daniels.

Then the conversation turned to the ridiculous idea of running for President. At first she was resistant and then she changed her mind. I don’t know, should I run for president?… The terrifying thing is I might win,” she said. Yeah, right.
