What Is Water Vapor? (with pictures)
Water vapor is the gaseous form of water that permeates the Earth's atmosphere. This moist gas affects the Earth by altering the world's overall climate. The hydrologic cycle demonstrates how water becomes vapor. This cycle documents the change of water from gas to liquid to solid states.

The majority of the Earth is covered in ocean water. As the sun strikes the ocean's surface, water evaporates upward to create water vapor. This vapor forms clouds and possible rain storms. Water vapor condenses from the rain storm clouds, forming water droplets that fall onto the Earth's landforms. The vapor can also be excessively cooled while in the atmosphere, creating hail, ice, or snow.

This vapor is an essential component to creating rainfall across dry land areas. Plants and animals would not be able to survive without a water supply from the sky, filling lakes and rivers for consumption. Desert areas, with little or no rain, are good examples of how the world would appear if water vapor did not contribute to rainfall.

Vapor produces the humid and sticky effect felt on hot days. Tropical climates, such as those near the Earth's equator, have consistently warm days. The sun's warmth draws more moisture from the nearby ocean, forming more water vapor and producing excessive humidity levels in that region.
