Gov. Rick Scott puts SunRail on full stop
Gov. Rick Scott has slammed the brakes on Central Florida's $1.2 billion SunRail project, putting a hold on $235 million in project contracts. The contracts, flagged as "urgent" by the Florida Department of Transportation, include $168 million to design and build the first phase of the line and $39 million to buy cars, say documents released by the Governor's Office.

Scott's executive order immediately after he took office froze 900 regulations bound for approval and hundreds of contracts worth more than $1 million each, until he could give his okay. Scott has pledged to eliminate "job-killing" regulations. He has so far rejected no regulations and approved about two dozen.

The SunRail contracts are among the first Scott targeted for further scrutiny. He's also weighing 26 contracts, including $18 million for outpatient diagnostic imaging services, $1.2 million for energy-saving features at a Florida Department of Law Enforcement building, $1.3 million for solar panels on state buildings and $4.5 million for birth control devices.
