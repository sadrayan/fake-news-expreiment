Adult (Core) HIV/AIDS Surveillance
Core Surveillance, sometimes called routine surveillance, is the primary source of population-based data on persons â‰¥13 years old recently infected with HIV or diagnosed with AIDS. Core surveillance is conducted in every U.S. state and territory.

Core data are used to answer several important questions:

What are the characteristics of persons diagnosed with HIV?

What is the scope of the HIV epidemic?

What risk behaviors are leading to HIV infection?

This program collects lab reports and Adult Case Report Forms and enters them into the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS). This database creates the dataset that answers the above questions and enables our epidemiologists to produce fact sheets, surveillance summaries, maps (see below in Related Files or HIV Data in left sidebar menu) and respond to data requests (also see the left menu bar Reporting Forms & Data Requests). The documents and reports are important for planning and allocating HIV/AIDS resources throughout the state of Georgia.
