CNN is filing a lawsuit against President Trump and several of his aides, seeking the immediate restoration of chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's access to the White House.

There are six defendants:

President Trump

Chief of staff John Kelly

Press secretary Sarah Sanders

Deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine

The director of the Secret Service

The Secret Service officer who took Acosta's hard pass away last Wednesday (The officer is identified as John Doe in the suit, pending his identification)

The six defendants are all named because of their roles in enforcing and announcing Acosta's suspension.

Both CNN and Acosta are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

Correction: The original version of this post listed the former director of the Secret Service as a defendant; the actual defendant is the current director.
