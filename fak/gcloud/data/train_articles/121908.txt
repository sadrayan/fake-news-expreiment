First Lady Joins in With Chinese Folk Dance
Michelle Obama gamely joined in with a troupe of folk dancers as she visited the Chinese city of Xi'an on Monday.

The First Lady swayed to the music, having earlier accepted an invitation to jump rope and tested out her shuttlecock-kicking skills.

Obama was joined by her daughters Malia and Sasha and her mother on a tour of the city, which included a visit to the Museum of Terracotta Warriors and to the 14th century city wall.

Crowds three or four deep strained for a glimpse of the first family, according to a pool report.
