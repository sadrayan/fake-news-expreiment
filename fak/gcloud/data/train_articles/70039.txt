Bill Clinton speaks to 1,000 people in Phoenix on behalf of wife
PHOENIX - Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's message for Arizona voters was helped pushed out to locals by her husband and former President Bill Clinton on Sunday.

Clinton told about 1,000 supporters at Central High School, near Central Avenue and Indian School, that Hillary is the best choice for president.

"She's got specific plans to do it," said former President Bill Clinton.

Clinton told supporters Hillary is advocating for the middle class, has a plan to expand healthcare coverage, and wants to make higher education more affordable for millions of people.

"It;s just very touching, everything he touched on, and seeing Gabby Giffords, I'm from Tucson so to see Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly was really special," said Anna Federico, a Clinton supporter.

Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly told the crowd, Hillary would work to expand background checks on gun sales.

"In the White House, she will stand up to the gun lobby, that's why I'm voting for Hillary," said former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords.

Some supporters say the message resonated for them, especially when it comes to immigration issues.

"My father is a naturalized citizen, my mom a first time voter, we all going to be voting for Hillary Clinton," Isai Escobar said.

Arizona voted for Hillary in 2008, and Bill Clinton is asking for a repeat.

"I hope that between now and Tuesday, you will talk to every living soul you can, get every living vote you can, and make sure Hillary wins Arizona," he said.
