Hillary Rodham Clintonâ€™s views on same-sex marriage have evolved in the almost 20 years since her husband, Bill Clinton, then the president, signed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, saying that he had â€ślong opposed governmental recognition of same-gender marriages.â€ť This week Mrs. Clinton, who is running for president, said she hoped that same-sex marriage became a constitutional right.

1996: “My preference is that we do all we can to strengthen traditional marriages, and that the people engaged in parenting children be committed to one another and to the child. We also have to be realistic and know there are others who can do a good job, as well, of raising children,â€ťÂ Mrs. Clinton told The San Francisco Examiner.

Â

2000: “Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman,”Â Mrs. Clinton said while running for the Senate in New York.

2003: â€śWell, marriage means something different. You know, marriage has a meaning that I think should be kept as it historically has been, but I see no reason whatsoever why people in committed relationships can’t have many of the same rights and the same respect for their unions that they are seeking, and I would like to see that be more accepted than it is,â€ť Mrs. Clinton speaking to WNYC on the difference between gay marriage and civil unions.

2003: â€śI am, you know, for many reasons. I think that the vast majority of Americans find that to be something they can’t agree with. But I think most Americans are fair. And if they believe that people in committed relationships want to share their lives and, not only that, have the same rights that I do in my marriage, to decide who I want to inherit my property or visit me in a hospital, I think that most Americans would think that that’s fair and that should be done,â€ť Mrs. Clinton, in an interview with CBS, on whether she still opposed same-sex marriage.

2006: â€śMy position is consistent. I support states making the decision. I think thatÂ Chuck SchumerÂ would say the same thing. And if anyone ever tried to use our words in any way, weâ€™ll review that. Because I think that it should be in the political process and people make a decision and if our governor and our Legislature support marriage in New York, Iâ€™m not going to be against that,â€ť Mrs. Clinton telling Gay City News that she would not block legislation supporting gay marriage in New York.

2007: â€śI am very much in favor of civil unions with full equality of benefits,â€ť Mrs. Clinton told Ellen DeGeneres, explaining that she still believed the decision should be left to states.

2013: â€śL.G.B.T. Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones, and they are full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage,â€ť Mrs. Clinton said in a video released by Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group.

2014: â€śFor me, marriage had always been a matter left to the states. And in many of the conversations that I and my colleagues and supporters had I fully endorsed the efforts by activists to work state by state. And in fact that is what is working,â€ťÂ Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with NPR.

Â

2015: â€śHillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right,â€ť Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Hillary for America, said while Mrs. Clinton was campaigning for the presidency in Iowa.
