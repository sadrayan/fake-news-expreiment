Election 2010: Nevada Senate

Nevada Senate: Angle (R) Still Holds Small Lead Over Reid (D)

Despite President Obama’s weekend visit to the state to boost the candidacy of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Republican Sharron Angle remains slightly ahead in Nevada’s U.S. Senate race - for the fourth survey in a row.

The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey of Likely Voters in Nevada finds Angle with 49% support to Reid’s 45%. Four percent (4%) like some other candidate in the race, and two percent (2%) remain undecided with one week until Election Day. (To see survey question wording, click here.)

The race remains a Toss-Up in the Rasmussen Reports Election 2010 Senate Balance of Power rankings.

A week ago, Angle held a 50% to 47% lead in one of the country’s nastiest and most closely contested Senate races. Reid and Angle have been three points apart or less in eight of nine surveys since July. But Angle’s had the edge since the beginning of this month.

The survey of 750 Likely Voters in Nevada was conducted on October 25, 2010 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 4 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See methodology.

Rasmussen Reports will release new numbers from the Nevada governor’s race, pitting Reid’s son Rory versus Republican Brian Sandoval, later this week.
