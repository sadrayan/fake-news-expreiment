Welcome to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority
The EDA issues conduit tax-exempt private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are used to provide low-interest, fixed-asset financing. Borrowers must meet the eligibility requirements outlined in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in order to qualify. Taxable bonds are also available for a wide variety of businesses. Taxable bonds offer similar flexibility in structuring rates and terms but are not subject to the restrictions placed on tax-exempt financing under the IRC. Click here for more information.
