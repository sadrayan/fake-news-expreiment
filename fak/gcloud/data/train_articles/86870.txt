Donald Trump, Wavering on Immigration, Finds Anger in All Corners
For 15 months, even as Donald J. Trump vacillated on many other issues, he stuck to a simple, hard-line position on immigration: If elected president, he would form a “deportation force,” round up people who are in the United States illegally and send them back where they came from.

Yet even that promise, so central to his appeal to conservatives, now appears open to negotiation.

Mr. Trump faced anger, confusion and disgust from across the political spectrum on Thursday after indicating that he was open to letting some undocumented immigrants remain in the country legally provided that they paid “back taxes.”

The comments, made at a town-hall-style event broadcast the night before on Fox News, were strikingly similar to the views of former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, fellow Republicans whom Mr. Trump vanquished in the primaries with slashing attacks that they were soft on immigration.

His newest formulation also bore a close resemblance to President Obama’s approach to an immigration overhaul, which similarly calls for paying taxes as part of a program to live legally in the United States.
