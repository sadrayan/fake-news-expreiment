House Homeland Security Chairman says Chattanooga shooter WAS ‘ISIS-INSPIRED,’ warns of OTHER attacks
When I broke the story of an ISIS account posting a tweet with what appeared to be foreknowledge of the Chattanooga jihad slaughter, heads were exploding on the left that the time stamp was from a different time zone, and so after the mass murder began. Perhaps that is true, but the ISIS tweet was published well before we knew that the killer was a devout Muslim waging jihad. The tweet was published before he was named.

Garland was ISIS-inspired as well. Same ideology, same supremacism, same operation — pulling up to the target and opening fire. The only difference is that we were armed and the marines weren’t — that is a crime.

It’s not about being ISIS-inspired. It’s about being compelled to wage war in the cause of Islam, as commanded in the quran.

BREAKING! Homeland Security says Chattanooga shooter WAS ‘ISIS-INSPIRED,’ warns of OTHER attacks

The Right Scoop, Jul 17, 2015: According to Homeland Security, they have reason to believe that the Chattanooga shooter was inspired by ISIS to kill four Marines in a horrific attack yesterday. In addition to this, it’s being reported that he used to work at an Ohio NUCLEAR PLANT. Just imagine the carnage he could have caused if he had been radicalized while still working there. Meanwhile, his friends, family and acquaintances say he was very popular, happy, not marginalized at all. No one saw this coming. Should that make us feel better about “moderate” Muslims or worse?
