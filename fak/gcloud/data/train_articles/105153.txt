BREAKING: Broncos VP John Elway Storms Field, Fires 3 Kneeling Players on the Spot
According to sources inside the locker room, The Denver Broncos were brought together for a “policy meeting” on Wednesday of last week with none other than legendary quarterback John Elway. Elway, now VP of Football Operations for the franchise, made his decision on the subject very clear.

“There will be no kneeling during the national anthem in this stadium. I don’t care what your beliefs aree. You’re at work and your antics are costing us money. Don’t do it.”

Elway took the politics out of it and went right for what counts: the money. After giving them the choice, three players have stated all week that they will kneel regardless of the consequences. Mavius Malphner said he’ll follow in the footsteps of his “current hero,” Colin Kaepernick:

“Do what you believe, right? Kap has the idea. I’ll do what I want. What are they gonna do, fire me?”

Unfortunately for Malphner and two other teammates, Ladamian Brown and DeShaq Darq, Elway was waiting just inside the tunnel for the anthem to start. When he saw the players kneeling, he made his way across the field. Commentator Troy Aikman called the action:

“It looks like Elway is headed directly towards the kneeling…oh…he just gave them the ejection signal. I think he just fired those three players for standing up for what they believe in. Wow. That is not the John Elway I know.”

Whatever, Aikman, you has-been. Don’t you need to go cover for the horrible Joe Buck? John Elway did, in fact, fire all three players, in public, for breach of contract. It looks like the owners are going to sit back and let the refs and VPs sort it out.
