So, it still looks to me like ERCOT anticipates coal-fired plants retiring, as itâ€™s said, due to many regulations with the CPP playing a minimal role. Is that correct?

4:20 p.m.

Yes, ERCOT anticipates that some coal-fired plants will retire as a result of changes to environmental regulations. It is too early to tell what level role (minimal or otherwise) CPP specifically will play.

Thanks,

Robbie
