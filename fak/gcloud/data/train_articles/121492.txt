Dearborn Muslims react to Trump's anti-Islam stance
DEARBORN, MI -- Dearborn, a Detroit suburb with an estimated Muslim population approaching 40 percent, and its residents' feelings about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, are the focus of a video that is quickly going viral.

The video had been viewed nearly 350,000 within 4 hours of being posted by AJ+, which describes itself as a "global news community for the connected generation."

It appears administrators shut down the comment section.

"We get along," says a man at the opening behind B-roll of Muslims knelt in prayer at a mosque. "We live together in harmony and peace along with out Christian brothers and sisters.

"We are all Americans."

"Dearborn is what the world would look like if people learned how to get along," says another young man.

Donald Trump in December called for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims coming into America."

Dearborn, because of its high Muslim concentration, has at times become a focus for anti-Islam sentiment in the U.S.

Following the recent Orlando Massacre committed by shooter Omar Mateen, who allegedly pledged allegiance to ISIS before the killings, someone on Twitter threatened to kill Muslims at a Dearbron mosque. The comments sparked an FBI investigation.

Ten miles east of Dearborn is Hamtramck, another Detroit-area city with a large Muslim population.

While Dearborn Muslims mostly immigrated from the Middle East, many of Hamtramck's Muslim population are Bengali and Yemeni.

Hamtramck, a city with nearly 22,000 people once dominated by Polish and eastern European immigrants, now fills with the Call to Prayer at various times throughout the day and earned the title of becoming the first U.S. city with a Muslim-majority City Council.
