Height Differences in North and South Koreans
Update: The Dong-a has an editorial on this subject: Tall South, Short North.

Original Post: Height statistics for 1,075 North Korean defectors ranging in age from 20 to 39 were compiled by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, while equivalent South Korean statistics were obtained by the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

The article does not specify if the North Korean sample selected defectors to represent all of North Korea, which could skew the results as the provinces bordering North Korea – Hamgyong Bukdo, Hamgyong Namdo, and Ryanggang – have typically had “the highest prevalence of underweight children.”

And this is not a newly noticed phenomenon:
