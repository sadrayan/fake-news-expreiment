You should inform the immigration judge and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) trial attorney that you filed Form I-589 with USCIS and provide the status of your application with USCIS, including whether you have been interviewed or have an interview scheduled. If you have already appeared in immigration court and been provided with a UAC Instruction Sheet, please submit it to USCIS with your asylum application. If CBP or ICE has not made a previous UAC status determination in your case, USCIS will have jurisdiction over your asylum case if you were a UAC at the time that you filed your asylum application. The UAC Instruction Sheet, by itself, is not evidence that CBP or ICE has made a UAC status determination in your case. The Asylum Officer will make this determination by asking you questions regarding your age and unaccompanied status.
