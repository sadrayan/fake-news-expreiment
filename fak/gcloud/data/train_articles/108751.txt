Supreme Court Nominations Research Guide
Under Article II of the Constitution, the President has the power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint Judges of the Supreme Court. Since Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life, each nomination to the Supreme Court has a long-lasting influence on the Court and on the day-to-day life of every American.

This guide is designed to explain the nomination process and to suggest resources for further research on the nomination process. For help in researching the Court and individual Justices, consult the Supreme Court Research Guide.
