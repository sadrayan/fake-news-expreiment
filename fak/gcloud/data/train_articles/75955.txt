Overview

This is the sixth year that the World Bank and IFC's Doing Business Project has included the "paying taxes" indicator. The indicator measures tax systems from the point of view of a domestic company complying with the different tax laws and regulations in each economy. The case-study company is a small to medium-size manufacturer and retailer, deliberately chosen to ensure that its business can be identified with and compared worldwide. The indicator covers the cost of taxes borne by the case study company and the administrative burden of tax compliance for the firm.
