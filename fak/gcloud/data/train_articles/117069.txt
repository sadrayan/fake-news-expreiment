Obama’s new July 1st 2014 law will shock most Americans

Dear Reader,

We’ve been critical of several Obama Administration policies over the past few years…

But a new law set to go into effect on July 1st, 2014 (less than six months from now), might be the Administration’s worst decision yet.

On this date, Title V of House of Representative Bill #2847, known as “FATCA,” goes into effect.

We believe this could precipitate a huge collapse in the U.S. dollar… and a rapid decrease in our standard of living.

Of course, we’re not the only ones who believe this new U.S. law is going to be a disaster for our country and American citizens.

Andrew Quinlan of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity says: “FATCA is pound-for-pound the single worst tax law on the books.”

Even the normally liberal Atlantic Monthly magazine said: “FATCA seems to be turning into a nightmare and disaster.”

What does this law do… and why is it so bad for America?

The founder of our Research Firm has put together a detailed explanation of what is happening in America right now, and why this new law is something EVERY American should pay close attention to.
