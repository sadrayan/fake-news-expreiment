Jay Z and Beyonce are Trying to Purchase the Rights to the Confederate Flag
The Carters have spoken

In light of the numerous controversies surrounding the confederate flag, and its prominent display and use in American government and merchandise, several prominent politicians and public figures have come forward to express their discontent with the flag’s continued use, considering it’s oppressive origins. Last week, the flag was stripped from it’s position on South Carolina’s statehouse grounds by a heroic citizen, and yesterday, the South Carolina Senate voted to officially remove it.

Today, news has broken that Jay Z and Beyonce are currently attempting to purchase the rights to the flag, so they can help restrict it’s use and reproduction. An attorney for the Carters had this to say about their confederate mission.

My clients are adamant about purchasing the rights to the Rebel Confederate flag. They have expressed deep concern regarding the flag and how it is tearing apart our nation. Mr. and Mrs. Carter wants to assist in the abolishment of the flag by purchasing the resell rights to the Confederate flag. If my clients are successful, purchasing the rights would mean that anyone who wants to produce merchandise using the Confederate flag would have to get permission from Mr. and Mrs. Carter. My clients have expressed that they are not looking to profit from the use of the flag, but rather prevent any further use of the flag on merchandise.

It’ll be interesting to see how far they’re allowed to get. This will be no easy accomplishment by any stretch of the imagination.
