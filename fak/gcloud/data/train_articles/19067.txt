Anti-Drug Initiative
As a former teacher who was also a co-director of a program for at-risk teens, I have seen the devastation drugs can cause in the lives of our youth, their families, and our communities. I am saddened to see that the scourge of drugs continues to devastate too many lives in our counties. I’ve heard from job creators who tell me that too many potential new hires cannot pass a drug test. Military recruiters have told me they have to turn away good recruits due to drug use. Law enforcement reports most crime in our communities is related to drug use. And, sadly, I learned 25% of the record number of children in Missouri’s foster care is there due to their parent’s drug abuse. This has got to stop. It’s time to unite and take action against this menace to set a new path for individuals and families in our district—one that is drug-free.

I need your help. Our communities are made strong by those living in them. By bringing everyone together to combat a common problem, I am sure we make some real progress towards eradicating the looming and growing problem of substance abuse and addiction in the district.

This initiative aims to:

Join Forces

Raise Awareness

Find Solutions

Improve Lives

The kickoff conference for this initiative will be on October 19th at Camp CUMCITO in Warsaw. We will hear from panelists who will reveal the breadth and depth of the drug problem; ways communities are successfully addressing the problem; ministries which are helping people begin new lives. The half-day conference will end by hearing the personal stories of people who have overcome their addictions and are now examples for others wanting to be free of the control of drugs. I hope you all can attend. The journey must begin somewhere and I hope we can look back on this conference as a beginning point of a new day for our district. See you there.
