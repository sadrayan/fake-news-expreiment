Shuttle Crew Back for Third Try at Launch
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. â€” Five astronauts whose attempts to get to space have been thwarted by mechanical failures and a meteor shower returned to NASA's shuttle launch site Monday for countdown No. 3.

"And you thought you could get rid of us," shuttle commander Frank Culbertson Jr. joked upon arriving at the Kennedy Space Center.

Asked what he's been doing lately, Culbertson replied: "Building meteor shields."

The countdown clocks began ticking again Monday for Discovery's satellite-delivery and spacewalking mission. Liftoff is set for 6:10 a.m. PDT Thursday, almost one month late. Good weather is forecast.

The annual Perseid meteor shower, the cause of the latest delay, is expected to peak well before liftoff. Astronomers believe that the meteor shower may produce a rare storm of shooting stars Wednesday night, and shuttle managers opted to wait until after the shower to launch Discovery for fear that comet debris could damage the shuttle and endanger the crew.
