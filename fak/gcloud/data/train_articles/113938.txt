Vavi disputes government's claim of exorbitant salary bill
The rand has strengthened by more than 1% ahead of the mini-budget to be delivered by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni.

The minister has also highlighted the bloated public service wage bill claiming that government spends R8 for every R10 it has on salaries of government employees, which he says doesn't make sense.

The unions are disputing those figures and we might see them coming together in protest against what might be announced tomorrow.

Speaking to Bongani Bingwa, Saftu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says Mboweni's figures are not correct.

This is now a minister that is beginning to do the usual, shoot from the hip in order to impress the audience of big business that wants to hear the news in order to deliver even fewer services to the poor. — Zwelinzima Vavi, Saftu secretary general

The figure doesn't go anywhere close to 8 out of 10, we are somewhere from 4% going to 5% and we don't know where the minister is getting those figures. He is exaggerating deliberately. — Zwelinzima Vavi, Saftu secretary general
