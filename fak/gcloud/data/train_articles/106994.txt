As a former cheerleader and current assistant to cheerleaders, I have never witnessed anything like this.

A group of cheerleaders were doing their stunts and apparently the flyer, young lady in the air, was either scared for her life or ate the wrong thing at lunch. Whatever it was, she held back no punches. Im sure it was hard for her teammates to catch her without getting crapped on. But look at the black girl’s face! She was not having that.

Its a possibility that this photo was photoshopped. She seems to be falling wrong as well but the reaction on the stunt group as well as the other young lady’s face might make you think otherwise.
