EXCLUSIVE: Airlines settle $6M lawsuit in death of Bronx woman who was 'too fat' to fly home to the U.S.
They drove to the airport and arrived seven hours early to make sure there were no problems, the suit says. But when they tried to get on, "it became apparent that Delta did not have an adequate or proper wheelchair to transport Vilma to her seat." They were "forced to disembark" and told "there was nothing more Delta could do for them," the suit says.
