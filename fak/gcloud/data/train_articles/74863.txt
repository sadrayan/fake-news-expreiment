U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz Statement on Immigration Reform Proposal
WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) issued the following statement regarding todayâ€™s bipartisan immigration reform proposal:

I appreciate the good work that senators in both parties have put into trying to fix our broken immigration system. There are some good elements in this proposal, especially increasing the resources and manpower to secure our border and also improving and streamlining legal immigration. However, I have deep concerns with the proposed path to citizenship. To allow those who came here illegally to be placed on such a path is both inconsistent with rule of law and profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who waited years, if not decades, to come to America legally.
