Rattlesnake Envenomation Workup: Laboratory Studies, Imaging Studies, Other Tests
Coagulopathy commonly occurs with rattlesnake envenomation, although clinical bleeding is uncommon.[9, 10, 11, 12] Defibrination and/or thrombocytopenia most often characterize snakebite coagulopathy. Defibrination is manifested by low serum fibrinogen, elevated prothrombin time, and elevated fibrin split products (FSP). Venom-induced thrombocytopenia may exist in association with or independently of defibrination. Abnormal coagulation parameters may last for a week or more. Recurrence of coagulopathy after resolution with antivenom has been reported.

Rhabdomyolysis may occur from severe envenomation but is best described after canebrake (Crotalus horridus atricaudatus)[13] and Mojave (Crotalus scutulatus)[14] rattlesnake envenomations. Rhabdomyolysis may lead to myoglobinuric renal failure and subsequent electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, or hypocalcemia.

For respiratory difficulty, consider arterial blood gases (ABGs), although arterial puncture should be avoided if a severe venom-induced coagulopathy develops.

Obtain laboratory and other diagnostic data on a case-by-case basis. Factors to consider may include severity of envenomation, physician preference, and cost.
