Belgium – New Tax on Resident and Nonresident
The legislation includes an anti-avoidance clause to address, amongst other things, situations when individuals hold a securities account through a company in order to attempt to avoid the new tax.

The tax will apply to the total average value of securities accounts if their value is €500,000 or more, per account-holder. The tax will also apply with respect to account-holders having securities accounts with different financial institutions that collectively have a value of €500,000 or more, even though the value of each separate securities account with a specific financial institution would be less than €500,000. In such situations, the tax would be imposed on the value of all securities accounts of the individual taxpayer, except for nonresidents for which only Belgian securities accounts need to be taken into account.

For the computation of the €500,000 threshold and the taxable base, almost any security in a securities account will be considered as a taxable instrument, except derivatives (e.g., options, futures etc.), certain structured products (unless they qualify as bonds), and nominative shares (shares that are not held in a securities account). Also securities accounts held within the framework of pension savings/life insurance contracts are out of scope and do not need be taken into account.

In principle (similarly to the Belgian stock exchange tax), it will be Belgian banks and brokerages that are liable to pay and declare the tax due, if the average value of taxable securities on the securities accounts held with them is at least €500,000. Upon request of the account-holder, Belgian banks may also levy the tax on accounts having a value of less than €500,000 (e.g., in case, in total, the individual would reach the threshold of €500,000). In case the tax is not withheld by the financial intermediary, the individual would be required to declare and pay the tax himself/herself by means of a special declaration via an electronic platform.
