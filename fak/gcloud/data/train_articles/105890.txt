Another Alternative Health Doctor Killed, Found In Makeshift Grave » …
The mysterious doctor deaths are getting even more concerning. Now a Canadian alternative health doctor has been found. Canadian doctor, Linnea Veinotte, was found dead just a few days before Christmas. Even the police report says that the place Veinotte and her family resided ‘was a safe place.’

Doctor Bradstreet’s death led this rash of strange ‘suicides,’ but the number of strange death circumstances – most of alternative doctors – seems to be growing. [1]

According to HealthNutNews:

“Her body, partially decomposed, was found just days ago and buried in a makeshift grave near a small dirt road on the south end of the island. Last seen on Sunday, Dec. 6., Dr. Veinotte, “left the house at 8 a.m., wearing green running shorts, a purple tank top and her Adidas, with the family dog, Nico, in tow.” She was to go for a jog around a well-known residential community, but instead residents later reported hearing tires belonging to a dark-colored SUV screech, and a loud thump. Their dog was discovered bleeding at the scene, but Dr. Veinotte was nowhere to be found.”

Sylvan McIntyre, an assistant-superintendent with the Royal Grenada Police who has been an officer for 31 years, says he’s never seen a case like this. On an island of just 110,000 residents, people don’t go missing.

On Friday, just after midnight, a “person of interest” Akim Frank – who appears to have a record from 2008 for the offenses of burglary, causing harm, stealing, and wounding – turned himself in. The SUV that neighbors reported seeing was also found. It turns out the vehicle was just used by Frank, but it was not his.

Authorities are still unsure whether or not to call it a crime or accident. Dr. Venoitte was researching alternative ways to treat cancer.
