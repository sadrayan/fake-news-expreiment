Bob Casey’s record on sanctuary cities shows he cares more about catering to his left than protecting Pennsylvanians
Whether it is voting against legislation to crack down on sanctuary cities or campaigning and fundraising with pro-sanctuary city organization “Protect and Elect,” Bob Casey’s record on sanctuary cities and illegal immigration is the latest indication of Bob Casey’s leftward leap and his desire to cater to the socialist left than provide for the safety of Pennsylvania’s families.

Here is a brief run-down of Sen. Casey’s record on immigration and sanctuary cities:

According to a poll, 80 percent of voters oppose sanctuary cities.

That’s probably because, according to data provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement 90 percent of the illegal aliens they arrest have a past or pending criminal conviction.

In response, Republican Party of Pennsylvania Communications Director Jason Gottesman, made the following statement:

“When it comes to sanctuary cities and protecting Pennsylvanians, Bob Casey’s desire is to cater to the viewpoints of his radical left Party bosses and liberal donor base.

“Bob Casey’s priority in the Senate is not cracking down on these rogue municipalities and respecting the rule of law, but, rather, solidifying his liberal-progressive image with the socialist, obstructionist left and filling his campaign coffers.”’
