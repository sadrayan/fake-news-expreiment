Trump International Golf Club 2016
Trump International Golf Club, Dubai will be a world-class golf course, exceeding all expectations. The 7,205-yard, par 71 course will be located just ten minutes from Sheikh Zayed Road and sits at the heart of the 42 million square foot ‘AKOYA by DAMAC’ master development. World-renowned golf course architect Gil Hanse, who was also chosen to design the course for the 2016 Olympics, has designed this spectacular 18 hole golf course.



This extraordinary project features a 30,000 square foot club house which will be the largest of its kind in Dubai. Overlooking the 9th and 18th greens, the expansive club house offers four high-end restaurants, a luxurious infinity swimming pool, state-of-the-art wellness centre and high-end golf pro shop.



The pro shop will offer the latest in equipment and apparel, including high-tech swing analysis to fit members and guests with the perfect equipment for their game. The Golf Academy will integrate the most advanced technology from the United States with world-class professionals to help hone your game and improve your swing. The double-sided driving range, chipping facility and putting greens will emulate the undulations of the course to accurately reflect the challenges that await.



The course is scheduled to be completed in 2017, with the luxury villas and mansions that overlook the course following over the next couple of years.
