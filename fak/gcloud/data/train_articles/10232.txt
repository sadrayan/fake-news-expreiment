ATLANTA -- SunTrust today made the following statement related to certain account closures.

"SunTrust is pro-small business, and we are proud to serve more than 400,000 small business clients.

SunTrust fully supports all of the rights that Americans are granted under the Constitution, and we continue to maintain banking relationships with licensed firearms dealers.

It is consistent with long-standing industry practice to review relationships to ensure they satisfy a range of business and risk considerations. We have decided to discontinue banking relationships with three types of businesses – specifically payday lenders, pawn shops and dedicated check-cashers – due to compliance requirements.

We remain committed to serving the needs of our communities while meeting the standards of our industry."
