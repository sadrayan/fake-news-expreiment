A classier way to find cheap parking
In planning and conceiving the new Bentley Continental GT, Volkswagen executives have spent time learning about the mystique of the marque, from owners, dealers and the formidable Bentley Driver's Club. As a primer to the well-heeled world of Bentley ownership, none comes finer than Bentley - lighter moments with our heavy metal, a 186-page book recently published by the BDC's charitable wing, the W O Bentley Memorial Foundation. Among the short stories, illustrations and poetry from Bentley owners is this yarn from Joachim Wrang-Widen, which seems to sum up the derring-do of a typical Bentley owner...

A man walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. The man says he is going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000.

The loans officer says the bank will need some kind of security for such a loan, so the man hands over the keys and documents of a new Bentley Continental, parked on the street in front of the bank. Everything checks out and the bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. An employee drives the Bentley into the bank's underground garage and parks it there.

Two weeks later, the man returns and repays the $5,000, plus interest, which is $15.41. The loans officer says: "We are very happy to have had your business and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a rich man. You have a good-sized house in up-state New York, a sizeable equity portfolio and no debt at all. We are curious as to why you would bother to borrow $5,000?"

The man replied: "Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for $15!"
