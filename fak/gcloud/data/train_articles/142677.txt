Russian authorities released the passenger names on the official Death list, with several names raising immediate "red flags" as they appear to be directly involved with Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, UraniumOne and also the (fake) "Russian Dossier" used in an attempt to remove President Trump. The "Deep State" now seems ti ve scrambling to remove any "loose ends" who might testify against the Clintons. Sergei Millian, a Belarus-born businessman who worked with the Trump Organization, was allegedly the key source in the dossier which claimed ties between Donald Trump and Russia. Millian was also in the spotlight following the release of the testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.
