The Buccaneers' search for silverware continues after they lost 5-4 on penalties to Leopards in the Nedbank Cup round of 32 clash.

Despite exiting the cup, the Serbian insists his charges gave their all at the Thohoyandou Stadium.

“We are fully aware that penalties are a lottery and you never know what will happen, it can go either way," Sredojevic told SuperSport after the game.

“We tried out best throughout the game, from the start before conceding that goal against the run of play.

“Instead of taking the opponents to the counter-attack we conceded from the counter-attack. We paid from the silly mistakes we made later on.

“We tried our best in regular and extra time to attack and create chances, throwing all available attacking players forward but it was not meant to be whilst trying our best.

“We went to penalties and had the advantage. This was the fourth time we had the advantage in penalties and we missed them.

“It’s much more of a mental than football aspect, but it is very hard to accept especially knowing that we have given everything,"
