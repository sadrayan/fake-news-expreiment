What Is ICE and Why Do Critics Want to Abolish It?
WASHINGTON — Over the past several weeks, protesters, Democratic lawmakers and candidates, and even some federal agents have demanded an end to the government agency known as ICE, railing against President Trump’s immigration policies, which have produced heart-wrenching images of migrants being stopped at the southwestern border.

But the campaign against ICE may be conflating an alphabet soup of government agencies and their various roles in immigration enforcement. ICE, for example, was not separating migrant families illegally entering the United States from Mexico. Here’s an explanation of what it is doing.

What is ICE?

ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was created in 2003, as a part of the government’s reorganization after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

ICE is one of three agencies that absorbed and assumed the functions of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (which was previously housed under the Justice Department) and the United States Customs Service (which was part of the Treasury Department).
