Toomey finance report tops others'

Newly released financial disclosure forms show Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey is the wealthiest among the men who represent Northeast Pennsylvania in Congress.

Mr. Toomey, who won his seat in November, listed a 2010 personal portfolio that includes investments he holds jointly with his wife, Kris, and investments on behalf of two children valued at between $1,850,070 and $4,801,000 with between $8,816 and $38,900 in dividends and interest. Mr. Toomey earned another $25,800 in income from three organizations.

All members of Congress are required to file the forms annually. Congressional candidates also must file the forms in the year in which they run. Incomes and values of assets are listed only in ranges rather than with specificity.

The Toomeys' portfolio includes several diversified individual retirement accounts, but the senator's single most valuable assets are his stock in Bethlehem-based Team Capital Bank and a real estate partnership, Old Mill Partners. Old Mill owns undeveloped land on Block Island, a vacation hot spot in Rhode Island. Mr. Toomey is a native Rhode Islander.

The partnership and the bank stock each are worth between $500,001 and $1 million, according to his disclosure form.

Mr. Toomey also earned a $6,300 board fee from the bank and a $2,500 retainer from MJR Financial Group, an investment advice firm in Bethlehem that helped start the bank in 2005. The senator has an extensive background in finance.

He also earned a $17,000 retainer from the conservative Lynde & Harry Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee.

The foundation's website says it is "devoted to strengthening American democratic capitalism and the institutions, principles, and values that sustain and nurture it.

"Its programs support limited, competent government; a dynamic marketplace for economic, intellectual, and cultural activity; and a vigorous defense, at home and abroad, of American ideas and institutions."

All are principles Mr. Toomey has espoused repeatedly as a candidate and congressman.

Mr. Toomey, a pilot, also owns an airplane-leasing company, N-35727 Inc. N-35727 is the Federal Aviation Administration registration number for a Piper PA-34-200T, a twin-propeller airplane, owned by the company.

As of last year, the airplane company was almost halfway through paying off a 10-year, 7 percent loan of between $50,001 and $100,000 to the bank.

Mr. Toomey also has an ongoing contract for book royalties with John Wiley & Sons Inc, of Hoboken, N.J., which published his book, "Road to Prosperity," in 2009. He has not earned royalties on the book so far.

He holds no outside positions.

The portfolio of U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-11, Hazleton, and his wife, Mary Grace, is valued at between $1,189,111 and $3,879,500 and earned rental income, dividends and interest of between $73,058 and $175,800. That includes widely diverse investments they hold jointly and separately.

They earned $37,669 in capital gains from the sales of various investments. Mr. Barletta, who is in his first year in Congress, also earned $60,775 as mayor of Hazleton last year.

And the couple sold a Fort Myers, Fla., mobile home that they co-owned with Mrs. Barletta's parents. The Barlettas' share of the sale was valued at between $15,001 and $50,000.

They still own 322 Rocky Road in Hazleton, which they rent to a company that bought their road line-painting business. The property is valued at between $500,001 and $1 million and earned them between $50,001 and $100,000 in rental income. The figures are included in the portfolio totals.

Mr. Barletta listed himself as a member of the Luzerne County Community College Advisory Board, the Pennsylvania League of Cities and Municipalities and its Legislative Committee, the Federation for American Immigration Reform National Board of Advisors and the National Republican Committee Advisory Committee on Catholic Outreach.

Casey cash

Beside the $174,000 salary that all members of Congress are paid, Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey listed pensions, bank accounts and investments valued last year at between $159,019 and $563,000. The portfolio earned between $14,711 and $39,700 in interest and dividends last year. Mr. Casey had no outside income, according to Mr. Casey's statement.

Mr. Casey's most valuable individual asset is his Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System pension, valued at between $50,001 and $100,000. Before he was a senator, Mr. Casey served as state auditor general and treasurer.

Other than a pair of federal credit union bank accounts, most of his assets are held jointly with his wife or are in the name of one of their daughters.

Besides being a senator, Mr. Casey lists himself as a member of the Lackawanna County Bar Association and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

Marino extension

U.S. Rep. Tom Marino, R-11, Lycoming Twp., also a freshman congressman, has not filed a disclosure form for 2010 so far. Renita Fennick, a spokeswoman for Mr. Marino, said he requested an extension that allows him to file in August.

For 2009, Mr. Marino reported family income of more than $281,000 and assets, owned or co-owned by him and his wife, Edie, valued at between $276,024 and $942,000, according to his candidate financial disclosure form.
