Collins Dictionary's 10 words of the year, from 'Brexit' and 'snowflake generation' to 'JOMO'
'Brexit' has been named the word of the year by Collins Dictionary having been deemed "politics' most important contribution to the language for 40 years."

According to Collins, the first recorded usage of the word arrived in 2013 but this year saw a 3,400% rise due to the EU referendum in June and the ensuing fallout.

Collins' head of language Helen Newstead likened the term's importance to the way in which the Watergate scandal saw the word -gate added as a suffix "to make any incident infinitely more compelling."
