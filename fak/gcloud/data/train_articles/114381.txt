Bums: An Oral Histor of the Brooklyn Dodgers: Peter Golenbock: 9780809223954: Amazon.com: Books
Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers contains a lot of new info, but also omits some that would be of interest to the reader.

I was 6 years old in 1941 when the Dodgers won their first pennant in 21 years, after spending most of the intermediate years deep in the second division. Everyone in Brooklyn,where I lived, was excited about the Dodgers except for my father who couldn't have cared less. I got my information from my uncle and my older friends. In mid 1942, my uncle was drafted, and in early 1943 we moved to Queens,where I didn't have any older friends. In the spring of 1945 I dicovered the Dodger radio broadcasts with Red Barber and Connie Desmond on WHN. I listened to all broadcasts, and starting in 1948 all games on TV; except for the months of July and August when I was sent to camp.

Given this experience , I was most interested in the heroes of '41 and '42 and what players did in ''43, '44, and the summer of '45. The book has a lot of interesting info, especially on Kirby Higby, who was a big winner in '41, and after the war came back to pitch wery well for the Dodgers in '46. But it doesn't contain much on Whitlow Wyatt, who was the ace of the '41 and '42 teams and of Durocher's awful handling of him. In the summer of '42, Wyatt was pitching in a 1-1 game with the Cardinals going into the 15th inning. He told Durocher that he was tiring and losing speed on his fastball, and asked to be relieved. Durocher called him a quitter and sent him back in. He gave up a run and the Dodgers lost.Though they won 104 games, they lost the pennant to the Cardinals by 2 games. After the season Durocher blamed Wyatt, publically calling him a quitter.

I would have likes to have read about Dixie Walker's marvelous hitting in '44 and his competition with Musial for the batting title. More on outfielder Augie Galan who also played well at first, second, and third, while hiting over 300 every year. And more on Goody Rosen, who led the team in hitting in '45, while playing outstandingly in center field.

Errata:Ferrell Anderson started the 1946 season at catcher. Bruce Edwards came up in mid-season.
