Scientists have come up with a blue strawberry by splicing them with fish genes
Corn, Eggs, Chicken, Bananas... All of these things are genetically modified (GMO). Well enough isn't enough in today's world. If we did not genetically modify our food it would be much more expensive. Corn would be smaller, have less kernels, possibly be less sweet and become more easily diseased. Chickens would take more than twice the time to mature, meaning that people who raise chickens would need to feed them at least twice as much food and care for them twice as long. Bananas would be small and have a very tough skin. We'd feasibly be looking at food doubling to tripling in price, or possibly worse. Also, in a lot of cases genetically modified foods aren't produced in a lab but bred to be superior in the ways we like.

Lastly, just because it's natural doesn't mean it's good for you. Plants have evolved to protect themselves just like everything else and many are poisonous. The stems of tomatoes and the pits of cherries are poisonous but we've learned to eat around them. What is produced in a lab is carefully analyzed and tested, extensively before being approved by FDA. Whether you decide to eat a blue strawberry is up to you, certainly not all foods are created equal (naturally or otherwise).
