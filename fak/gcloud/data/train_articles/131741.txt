(1) Update with the situation tonight with Outback-... - Andrew-Amandâ€¦
Update with the situation tonight with Outback- the manager has apologized and is sending us a $100 gift card that can be used in multiple restaurants and stated a lady sitting next to our table felt scared for her life ! She said police are shooting people and she could have gotten shot in the parking lot and the manager had to walked her and her husband to their vehicle. We were told it was a policy they don't allow guns - if we would have known there was a complaint we would not have went anywhere! Seriously she was scared for her life ? We were joking and laughing with our server as we ordered then prayed . What was scary about that??
