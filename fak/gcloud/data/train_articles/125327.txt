US actor and comedian Adam Sandler has been found dead, aged 49, in an apparent suicide.

Marin County Police in California said he was pronounced dead at his home shortly after officials responded to an emergency call around noon local time … His publicist said he had been “battling severe depression”.

The local Sheriff’s office said Sandler was found unconscious and not breathing at his home near Tiburon, north of San Francisco.

“At this time, the Sheriff’s Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made,” police said in a statement.

In a statement, Adam’s wife, Jackie Sandler, said she was “utterly heartbroken” and asked that he be remembered for the joy he brought to the world.
