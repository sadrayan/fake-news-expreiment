‘No imminent threat’ though Crist adds Collier, Lee to oil emergency zone
 Gov. Charlie Crist declared a state of emergency Thursday in Collier and Lee counties after reports this week that oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster has made its way into the Loop Current.

Scientists said this week that a light sheen of oil and possibly tarballs have entered the powerful stream of warm water that loops through the Gulf of Mexico before heading south off Florida’s west coast, along the Florida Keys and up the East Coast.

Crist’s order added Charlotte, Lee, Collier, Monroe, Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties to the 19 Florida counties already covered by the state’s emergency declaration between Pensacola and Tampa Bay.

Collier County Emergency Management Director Dan Summers issued a statement late Thursday saying oil on Collier County’s shores is an “unlikely event.”

“The governor’s action today should not be interpreted to mean that the oil spill is now an imminent threat to our shoreline,” he said in the statement.

The Loop Current runs some 200 miles west of Southwest Florida, and scientists have said they don’t expect local shorelines to take a hit.

That would take persistent winds from the west or the formation of an eddy spinning off the main current to carry the slick closer to Florida, they said.

Still, fishing and diving businesses in Collier and Lee counties say the catastrophe unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico still could hit home.

Charter fishing boat Capt. Will Geraghty said his phone is ringing a couple times a day with questions from worried clients.

A man from Chicago called and wanted to cancel his trip this weekend after mistakenly believing that all of the Gulf was covered in oil.

“I had to beg him to come fishing,” said Geraghty, who runs The Grand Slam out of Naples.

What worries commercial fishing Capt. Tom Marvel is a ripple effect from devastated spawning grounds in the northern Gulf, closest to the source of the ongoing spill.

That’s where the king mackerel spawn that comprise his main catches in the winter off Southwest Florida.

Shrimpers on Fort Myers Beach say their shrimping grounds in the Dry Tortugas could be in harm’s way.

“It could, and I’m concerned about that,” said Grant Erickson, owner of Erickson and Jensen Seafood.

The Loop Current runs past that chain of islands west of Key West as it turns eastward into the Florida Straits. Shrimp boats ply those waters before they head to Texas when shrimp season opens in July.

The Dry Tortugas and the Florida Keys also are favorite destinations for divers and spearfishing and lobstering trips.

So far, customers still are heading to the Keys as normal, said Kevin Sweeney, owner of Scuba Adventures in Naples.

He worries that the region’s coral reefs could be wrecked and Florida Keys tourism along with it.

“It’s pretty scary,” he said.

At least 210,000 gallons of oil have been billowing up daily from a mile below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico for the past month from a damaged well, threatening fragile Gulf ecosystems and closing swaths of the Gulf to fishing. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20, killing 11 people. It sank two days later.

In statements this week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that in the time it would take for the oil to travel to the Florida Straits, the natural process of evaporation and chemical dispersants would “reduce the oil volume significantly.”

The weathered and diluted oil likely would appear as streamers of oil in the water or tarballs in isolated locations, NOAA said.

NOAA officials said it could take eight to 10 days for the oil to reach the Florida Straits.

The oil also could get caught up in another eddy in the middle of the Gulf and not be carried to the Florida Straits at all, NOAA said in the statement.

Earlier this week, a group of researchers at the University of South Florida using a set of computer models issued a preliminary forecast predicting the spill could reach Key West by Sunday or Monday.
