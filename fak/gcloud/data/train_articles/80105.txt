IISS statement on 2016 Mexico conflict fatalities
Armed Conflict Survey provides analysis of the political, military and humanitarian dimensions of all major armed conflicts.

Last month, the International Institute for Strategic Studies launched its annual Armed Conflict Survey, which provides analysis of the political, military and humanitarian dimensions of all major armed conflicts, as well as data on fatalities, refugees and internally displaced persons.

One of the findings that attracted attention and debate centred on the figures for Mexico, which placed the country second in terms of total estimated armed-conflict fatalities in 2016.

We accept there was a methodological flaw in our calculation of estimated conflict fatalities that requires revision. Our researchers are working to rectify this and we will share the results in due course. We anticipate this will result in Mexicoâ€™s conflict remaining among the ten most lethal in the world, by estimated fatalities attributable to an armed conflict.

The Armed Conflict Database and Survey do not measure homicides on either an absolute or per capita basis. We estimate deaths directly related to conflict. We do not provide an assessment of the levels of violence in any country.

We stand by the rigour of the overall research and analysis of the Institute. We also endeavour, as in this case, to be as transparent as possible when we have erred.

In the next edition of Armed Conflict Survey, we will make an extensive statement on the methodology for assessing armed conflict and our estimate of fatalities. We would aim for that statement to be seen as the industry standard for assessments of this kind.
