You may not know it, but the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) touches your life almost every day. From the gas pump you used to fill up your car this morning to the salsa you’re eating at dinner, TDA was there to help. From the healthy lunches at your child’s school to the scales used to weigh your luggage at the airport, TDA was there, too. From our role as the state consumer protection agency to administering school lunches and marketing Texas products, the TDA is a diverse and busy place. We work hard every day to serve you. Since I was sworn into office in 2015, I’ve also worked diligently to make this agency better. Please take some time to browse our website and learn about the many ways we’re working better, faster and more efficiently for you. As always, it is my honor to serve as your Texas Agriculture Commissioner and remind you that Texas Agriculture Matters! Your Servant, Sid Miller Texas Agriculture Commissioner
