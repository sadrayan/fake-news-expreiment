Iowa Insurance Division Response to Medica's Individual Market Decision
The Iowa Insurance Division has the following statement regarding Medica's individual market decision.

"We appreciate and understand Medica's desire to provide coverage in all of Iowa's 99 counties. That is our goal as well," Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen said. "We are concerned that Iowa has hit a point within our market's collapse that a 43% rate increase will drive healthier, younger, and middle aged individuals out of the market. Iowa's individual market remains unsustainable and needs a fix from Congress. Iowa will continue to move forward with the Proposed Stopgap Measure ."
