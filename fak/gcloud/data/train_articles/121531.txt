April 2014 Moon Phases Calendar
April 2014 Moon Phases

Shown below are the April 2014 moon phases (or "moon schedule"). This moon calendar is an easy tool for finding out the lunar phase for any given month. Simply select a month and year, and click "Go", and it will show you what the moon will look like for any day that month. The internal phase calculator is very accurate, but the images are approximations. The current month is always shown by default on the main moon phase calendar page (use that page for bookmarks and linking, unless you want a specific month).
