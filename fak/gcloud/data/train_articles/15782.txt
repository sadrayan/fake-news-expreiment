Subject: RE: Raw Milk

Thanks. I will review.

By email today, meantime, I fielded this reply from a state agency:

Gardner,

In 2015, raw milk was the suspected source of at least 10 reported cases of illness in Texas. As is frequently the case with foodborne illness investigations, we weren’t able to test the milk consumed by the people who got sick, so we can’t say 100 percent definitively that raw milk was the cause. Often, by the time someone gets sick and an investigation occurs, the food has been eaten or discarded, so there’s no longer product available to test.

Also, it’s worth noting that only a small percentage of foodborne illnesses are diagnosed and reported, so there may be additional cases out there that we don’t ever find out about. In case you want to dig into that more, CDC has done some modelling and estimates of the true number of cases of various foodborne illnesses:

Separately, our search yesterday of CDC’s database of foodborne outbreaks indicates Texas had two suspected outbreaks and seven illnesses (but no deaths) attributed to raw milk--all of that in March and April 2015.

10:03 a.m.

Thank you for your feedback and additional information. I will share these suspected cases with Representative Flynn. I do have concern how these suspected cases got added after we wrote our original letter.

Again, thank you for the information.

To re-iterate, we looked at that same database in July, before writing the letter. At that time, these two outbreaks that are alleged to have happened in early 2015 were not in the database. For whatever reason, DSHS had made no public statement at all about these alleged outbreaks, and thus we had absolutely no way of knowing that DSHS would now be claiming that they were linked to raw milk.

It looks like the count of suspected illnesses described by DSHS would have been available to anyone in July. I am providing the full email string below (best read from bottom up).

There’s not a specific date. The information is available once it’s entered into our reporting system by our central or regional offices or by the local health departments.

Subject: RE: Following up

At what date would the information about the reported and suspected raw milk illnesses have been public? Put another way, at what date did DSHS have that information available to anyone interested including reporters and legislators?

Thanks again.

Except that it wasn't available or else we would have found that information on the spreadsheet.

Keep in mind information flows from the state to the CDC, so the latter would get information later. As it is, CDC just told me all the 2015 state data was updated this September. Did the representative ask DSHS for figures related to illnesses suspected?

3:38 p.m.

I don't remember asking DSHS for statistics but I felt comfortable in using the data off CDC since it had been roughly 13 months since session ended and thought it would be updated. I cannot recall anyone in our office and anyone on the committee our bill was going through was notified of the outbreaks in April and May of 2015 during the committee hearings we were having on raw milk.

I no longer feel comfortable with this "gotcha" line of questioning when the problem is that licensed raw milk farmers and consumers who purchase that product are being unfairly targeted and harassed by DSHS officials who have a personal opinion against a legal product. This afternoon, our office has turned over everything we have relating to this issue, including correspondence with DSHS, hhsc, and our emails from today over to the Attorney General's office and I will await their response. If you have further questions please direct them directly to my boss at Dan.Flynn@house.texas.gov.

Subject: Following up

How did you get to your count of six illnesses attributed to unpasteurized milk? Maybe I misread. But the spreadsheet you shared seems to show two illnesses only—in February 2000.

3:25 p.m.

That is correct, the CDC database did show just two illnesses.

In April 2011, DSHS released a statement claiming that there had been 4 cases of salmonellosis allegedly linked to a dairy in Plano. Even though DSHS never reported that data to the CDC, we counted those illnesses in the total.

In other words, we made sure to include any illness that we had any knowledge of, when saying that there were six illnesses attributed to raw milk in the last twenty years.

Which goes back to the question: if there were two separate outbreaks in early 2015, why didn't DSHS make any kind of public report, just as it did in 2011?
