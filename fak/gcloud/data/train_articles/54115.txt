The United States Government's contract with ICANN does not give the U.S. any power over ICANN to regulate or protect speech on the Internet today. Right now there is nothing a!out ICANN or its contract with the U.S. Government that prevents a country "rom censoring or !loc#ing content within its own !orders.

•

ICANN is a technical organi$ation and does not have the remit or a!ility to regulate content on the Internet. That is true under the current contract with the U.S. Government and will remain true without the contract with the U.S. Government. The transition will not empower or prohi!it sovereign states "rom censoring speech.

•

Sovereign states have the authority to esta!lish rules under which the Internet operates within their !orders. NTIA%s authority under the IANA "unctions contract does not override other nations% sovereign authority to regulate any aspect o" the Internet within those nation%s !orders.
