Refugees on Greek island throw away their meals as they are dissatisfied with the food

A video that outraged many Greek people was released from the Moria refugee camp, from the island of Lesbos, Greece.

It shows angry migrants (or refugees in leftist language) throwing away meals on the street.

According to Greek news portal News One, the throwing of food was a way for the camp’s residents to protest against their living conditions.

For the Greek it’s very controversial, as currently, many Greeks cannot afford to satisfy even their basic needs like food and a home.

Earlier today we interviewed the mayor of the island and he said the locals have lost their faith in authorities:

“The local community is tired from this prolonged unresolved issue and also have lost their faith in what the central administration and the European Union have promised but not delivered,” Lesbos mayor Spyros Galinos said.

In May he said that on the island, “women are afraid to go out of their homes, we keep our children in our houses” as the island is exhausted from the ongoing dangerous situation with migrants.
