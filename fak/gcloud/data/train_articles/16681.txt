The post card reads something very similar to this:

FRONT:

We were wrong and we're sorry

BACK:

The mailer we sent to your home last week wrongly claimed that, like school district taxes, senior homeowners' County taxes are frozen under state law. Travis County does offer an $80,000 Over-65 exemption which provides a greater savings to the average homeowner than the $2/month tax impact of these bonds. But state law does not require a county tax freeze for seniors.

The mailer we sent to your home last week was misleading and we're sorry. Please help us set the record straight by sharing this with your friends and neighbors.
