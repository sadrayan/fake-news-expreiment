McCain cagey, or confused, about meeting Spain's Zapatero when pressed on the socialist leader
MADRID, Spain - John McCain either doesn't want to meet Spain's prime minister any time soon or isn't quite sure who he is.

In a radio interview broadcast in Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries Thursday, the Republican presidential candidate repeatedly dodged questions as to whether he would invite Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to the White House if McCain wins in November.

"All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us and standing up to those who are not," he said. "And that's judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America and the entire region."

He had been asked, however, about a leader outside the hemisphere.

McCain added, when that was pointed out: "I am willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights, democracy and freedom and I will stand up to those that do not."

Responding to the first of four questions on whether he would confer with Zapatero, McCain said he'd talk with leaders who are cooperative with the United States. Then he discussed Mexican President Felipe Calderon and his work in fighting drug cartels.

Shortly after taking power in April 2004, Zapatero brought home 1,300 Spanish troops that his conservative predecessor Jose Maria Aznar had sent to Iraq. The withdrawal chilled U.S.-Spanish relations and Zapatero has never had a formal, face-to-face meeting with President Bush.

Responding to McCain's remarks, Zapatero said, "I think it is logical that he show the necessary prudence, because first there has to be an electoral process."

He said he wants good relations with the United States, regardless of whether McCain or Democrat Barack Obama wins, and that even though he has never had a meeting with Bush, "this has not hindered the work we have done."
