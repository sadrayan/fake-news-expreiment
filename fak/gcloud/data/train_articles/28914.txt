Renewed calls to get rid of Fox News’ Shepard Smith after he’s unable to control his contempt for Trump
Fox News anchor Shepard Smith took a swipe at President Donald Trump and his assertion that the news media frequently under reports radical Islamic terror attacks.

Smith, a critic of the president, listed several terror attacks that were on the White House’s list of the attacks it believes weren’t reported properly and said that Fox News covered them extensively.

“The president’s assertion is false. The White House knows that it was false or could have known that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth,” he said.

Smith brought on Wall Street Journal associate editor John Bussey to help deride the president and took another shot at President Trump before he handed the attack to his guest.

“What they’re saying is not true … Again … Why bother?” he said.

Smith often angers his Fox News audience with his contempt for the president.

In July, Smith drew the ire of Fox News fans when he scolded former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal for saying “all lives matter.” Fans were so angry that they called for his firing in droves on social media.

After a presidential debate with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in October, Smith suggested that then candidate Trump was a fascist because he said he’d have his attorney general investigate Clinton’s use of a private email server.

Some of his other greatest hits include comparing Christians that supported County Clerk Kim Davis not issuing gay marriage licenses to supporters of Sharia law and his fervent defense of Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server.

Smith didn’t pull any critics to his side with his newest rant.
