Areas of Expertise

My research has focused largely on Mexico, exploring political corruption, political reformism, nationalism and national identity. Current work centers on a comparative study of political corruption in Mexico and the United States. A future project seeks to examine US perceptions of Mexico. Tentative titles to this companion to my book Gringolandia include . Tacoland or Tequilaland.
