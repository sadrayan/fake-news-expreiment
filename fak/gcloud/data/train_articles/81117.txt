Rock legend Bob Seger rips Wisconsin mine plan on new album
Another elder statesman of rock 'n' roll is weighing in about Wisconsin.

This time it's Bob Seger, whose latest album, "Ride Out," includes a song, "It's Your World," which is a commentary on climate change.

It includes a line, "Let's talk about mining in Wisconsin, let's talk about breathing in Beijing."

Seger told the Detroit News:

"The governor, Scott Walker, passed a bill through the state Legislature on a weekend that there will be no environmental oversight, 'we want this mine.' Well, the mine is right by a river that runs into Lake Superior, which is some of the cleanest fresh water in the world.

"But sorry, according to Scott Walker, there isn't going to be oversight, we're going to build this thing, and it's going to be 9 miles long. I read about it in The New Yorker."

Florida-based Gogebic Taconite first proposed the controversial iron mine in 2010. It spent liberally to influence the Legislature to relax state environmental regulations. Environmental testing is moving ahead.

Seger, 69, is a lifelong resident of Michigan, and a champion of Detroit. But one of his most well-known (and overplayed on classic rock radio) songs, "Turn the Page," about the downside of being on tour as a musician, was written in a motel room in Eau Claire.

That's from another new album/pre-tour interview Seger did with The Wall Street Journal.

Earlier this week, a contemporary of Seger's, Eagles co-founder Don Henley, sued Wisconsin-based clothing firm The Duluth Trading Co., claiming its email ad suggesting buyers "Don a henley and take it easy," amounted to trademark infringement.

(Fellow Eagles founder, and Michigan native, Glenn Frey provided backing vocals on Seger's first hit, Ramblin' Gamblin' Man.)
