Research Chemist, NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory.

Dr. Montzka is the project leader of the Chlorofluorocarbons Alternative Monitoring Project and is responsible for ongoing global atmospheric measurements of approximately 40 chemicals at multiple remote sites across the globe that influence climate, stratospheric ozone, and air quality. These data are integral to NOAAâ€™s Annual Greenhouse Gas Index and the Ozone-Depleting Gas Index, which are internationally recognized metrics of the atmospheric abundance of climate-active and ozone-depleting gases. The data obtained from the program he leads are regularly highlighted in international scientific assessments related to ozone depletion and climate commissioned by the World Meteorological Organization and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
