Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in a Radiation Emergency
Key Information:



In a radiation emergency, the choice of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) depends on Response role and specific tasks Risk of contamination

PPE can protect against 1 External contamination Internal contamination via inhalation, ingestion, absorption through open wounds Other physical hazards (e.g., debris, fire/heat, or chemicals)

PPE cannot protect against exposure from high energy, highly penetrating forms of ionizing radiation 2 associated with most radiation emergencies. Lead aprons worn in diagnostic radiology do not provide sufficient shielding against these kinds of radiation. See Types of Ionizing Radiation and Shielding Required

protect against exposure from high energy, highly forms of associated with most radiation emergencies. PPE should include a personal radiation dosimeter whenever there is concern about exposure to penetrating ionizing radiation. Direct-reading personal radiation dosimeters may be used to monitor radiation dose and can help workers stay within recommended Dose Limits for Emergency Workers. Direct-reading dosimeters should be worn so that a worker can easily see the read-out and/or hear warning alarms.

Recommended respiratory PPE includes a full-face piece air purifying respirator with a P-100 or High Efficiency Particulate Air ( HEPA ) filter 3 . Other respiratory protective equipment (e.g., a simple surgical facemask, N-95 respirators), non-fit tested respirators, or ad hoc respiratory protection do not deliver appropriate or sufficient respiratory protection. Environmental testing and hazard assessment by a safety professional can help identify hazards and risk levels and direct choices of permissible PPE.
