Iranian American Community Agrees with Experts: Iran Nuclear Deal Offers Best Chance for Peace
In just three weeks, Congress will return from its August recess to bring closure to a vigorous national debate by voting on President Obama’s Iran Nuclear Deal.

Nuclear scientists, former military commanders and national security advisors – serving both Republican and Democratic administrations – agree that the nuclear deal is the most effective and verifiable way for the international community to block the weaponization of Iran’s nuclear program and prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.

Sharing this view, and joining the national debate in support of President Obama’s diplomatic efforts, are strong voices from the Iranian American community – the large majority of whom favor the nuclear accord, which they view as the best chance for civic and economic reform to gain root in Iran.

In July 2015, the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA) launched a national communications campaign to lend support for President Obama’s diplomatic achievement.

PAAIA’s communications effort includes the release of a second digital video: A 60 second spot showing America’s top nuclear scientists and national security leaders, as well as former Israeli intelligence chiefs all believing in the nuclear deal with Iran as the best chance for peace.
