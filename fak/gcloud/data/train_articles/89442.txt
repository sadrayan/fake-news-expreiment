More than a decade since the idea was first proposed, the estimated cost of burying high-voltage power lines traversing the waterfront from Providence to East Providence has ballooned to $33.9 million.

The figure was recently announced by National Grid, which earlier this year hired an engineering consultant to provide an updated and more refined cost estimate. Not only has it leaped from $19 million in 2007, the estimate comes with a 25-percent contingency � meaning costs could reach in excess of $40 million, or less.

�That�s obviously disappointing for us,� said David Riley, co-chair of Friends of India Point Park, which has lobbied for the project for many years. But, he said, �We�ve been believers in this for twelve years, and we�re not going to give up now.�

He, along with the cities of Providence and East Providence, want to have another engineering firm scrutinize the study. National Grid customers in the two cities could see their rates hiked to cover the difference between the cost of the project and what has been committed to a construction fund, reported to be about $17 million a few years ago.

Burying the transmission lines underground and removing the poles and towers that support them would have numerous benefits, according to project proponents. Primarily, it would eliminate what they see as a visual blight on scenic stretches of waterfront along Providence�s Fox Point and the East Providence shore.

Apart from aesthetics, they argue that improving the appearance of these areas � highly visible from heavily traveled Route 195 � would make them more appealing and, therefore, more valuable and marketable. That�s more timely now than ever, Riley said, with Providence eager for the redevelopment of vacant land around Fox Point, some of it freed up by the realignment of Route 195.

His group also maintains that burying the power lines will help protect energy infrastructure from damage from storms, flooding and rising sea levels. In addition, the group cites the opportunity to address health concerns for those in close proximity to electromagnetic fields that emanate from power lines. Studies have not clearly shown whether exposure to electromagnetic fields increases cancer risks, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

A dispute over whether the power lines should be relocated underground led to a settlement in 2004 between National Grid, the attorney general, Providence and East Providence. It called for moving forward with the project if the money could be found.

The proposal calls for running power lines underground � and beneath both the Seekonk and Providence rivers � for about one mile, from a substation at Franklin Square, in Providence, to Mauran Avenue, in East Providence, near the Tockwotton Home.

After years of discussions over preliminary cost estimates and explorations by the two cities into the need for land acquisitions, the state Energy Facility Siting Board in December requested a construction grade estimate from National Grid. The board, which regulates energy infrastructure, held a hearing Oct. 22 for the presentation of the report by POWER Engineers.

For the first time, borings were conducted to assess the feasibility of the project, according to David Graves, spokesman for National Grid. The results, he said, demonstrated that �we can do it. The riverbed would be suitable.�

The utility, however, has always maintained that �this is a perfectly good transmission line,� that the project would be �enormously expensive� and that repairing underground lines can be �much more expensive,� Graves said.

To keep the project moving forward, the board asked for an update on exactly how much money, with interest, sits in the fund to pay for the project. The board also approved of the request by the cities to hire an independent engineer to review the cost estimate.

Riley admits to not having any �expertise,� but considers the estimate �overblown.� East Providence, too, has sent a letter seeking clarification on how POWER Engineers arrived at the estimate.

Riley said that the $33.9 million includes a questionable $5.5- million contingency fee and another $1.9 million for what might be unnecessary land acquisitions. In Providence, for example, all that may be needed is an easement through an undeveloped lot just south of Al Forno restaurant, he said.

Riley also said that since the project estimate has gone up, so too might the share to be paid by ISO New England, which regulates the regional energy supply and pledged to pay for the Seekonk River crossing. The estimate nine years ago was $1.5 million.

Ultimately, the ball could land in the hands of Providence and East Providence, since it would be up to the two cities to pursue a hike in the rate of their residents to make up the difference between what�s in the fund and how much it will actually cost.

Riley, however, still holds out hope that the cost could be spread across the state since other local projects to bury power lines have been paid for by all Rhode Island ratepayers. The settlement allows for the issue to be revisited, he said, and Rhode Island law permits such financing for underground power line projects when they �improve the socioeconomic fabric of the state.�

�We think it should be statewide, maybe Providence and East Providence paying a little more,� he said.

Meanwhile, several of the lawyers attending the October hearing before the board noted that the elections could cause turmoil. With races for a new governor, attorney general, Providence mayor and East Providence City Council, the lawyers said the political landscape could shift and their own jobs be eliminated in the new year.

CLARIFICATION:

The cost of burying power lines along the Providence and East Providence waterfront is $33.9 million, although that figure could be 25 percent higher or lower to reflect unknown risks. A previous version of this story misstated that costs could only run in excess of 25 percent. They can also run under.
