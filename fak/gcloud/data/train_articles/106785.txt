Help us not die of green gunk poisoning.
We've been using this Keurig for about a year, and we haven't always been the best at cleaning the water tank regularly. Recently I noticed a shiny green film around the rim of the black port at the bottom of the water vessel. I washed it immediately in scalding water and dish soap, and I thought I got everything. We continued using it, but this morning I found more of the film in a different spot. This time I poured boiling water into it, soaped it up, and poured it out. But I'm still not sure I got it all.



Is this just algae, or something more sinister? Is it from an alien source? If so, how soon before we stop worrying about our mortgage and student loans, and start planning the overthrow of your puny Earth governments and domination of your species?



Or, put another way, is this stuff going to kill us? How do we get rid of it? I really don't want to buy another Keurig. Does it help that the water is used to make hot beverages, or is that just wishful thinking?

Is this green film at the bottom of my Keurig water tank going to kill me?
