OTTAWA – The NDP is saddened to learn that 17,000 Canadians will soon be losing their jobs and has urged the Conservatives to ensure that Target treats them in a fair and equitable manner, after the company announced the closure of all its Canadian stores.

“The Conservatives approved Target’s takeover of Zellers, and it ended up turning into a real fiasco and costing thousands their jobs,” said NDP Deputy Finance critic Guy Caron (Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques). “We need to protect these workers by improving benefits and pensions when bankruptcy occurs. They need to be the priority over legal fees and other expenses”

Target’s announcement came only two years after the Conservative government approved its takeover of Zellers. All 133 Canadian stores will be closing their doors, and 17,000 employees will lose their jobs.

In Laval, this means that the Centre Laval and Notre-Dame Megacentre (Sainte-Dorothée) locations will be shut down.

“These store closures, including the megacentre location in my riding, will affect the income of many families in Laval and across the country. Losing these 17,000 jobs is just further evidence of the Conservatives’ failed economic strategy,” said MP François Pilon (Laval—Les Îles)

“We are saddened to learn about the closure of 133 Target stores in Canada, including the Centre Laval location. Several Laval residents will be losing their jobs, and we are very disappointed by this decision,” added José Nunez-Melo (Laval).

“This closure is further proof that we need to diversify the Canadian economic model to ensure long-term viability and to avoid further mass closures down the road. It is time that we elect a government that will take its responsibilities seriously, fight for the middle class, and protect Canadian jobs,” said Rosane Doré Lefebvre (Alfred-Pellan).

The Conservatives continue to way off target when it comes to foreign takeovers, and have simply failed to protect Canadian jobs and investments.
