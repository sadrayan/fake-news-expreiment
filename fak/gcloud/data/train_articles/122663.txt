Use your hands! New Yorkers respond to Sarah Palin, Donald Trump pizza-eating faux pas
Salvatore Olivella, 33, owner of Merilu Pizza Al Metro at Ninth Ave. and 52nd St., says that Trump and Palin were eating pizza the right way - if they were in Italy.



"I'm from Italy. In Italy, everybody eats with forks and knives," Olivella says. "But being that [Trump] is in New York, he looks so cheesy."



Dominic Accette, 57, co-owner of Sacco Pizza at 54th and Ninth, agrees.



"If [Palin] wants to impress people, she should be doing it the New York way," Accette says. "Just grab the bottom and double it up."



At least one New Yorker wasn't offended by Palin's pizza faux pas.



"I always eat pizza with a fork," Ivelisse Henriquez, a 19-year-old employee at Abitino's Pizza and Caf√© at Eighth Ave. and 56th St. said. "It's fancy. That way the sauce won't get into your nails."
