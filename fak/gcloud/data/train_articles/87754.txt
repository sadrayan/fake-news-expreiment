Romney snubbing pro-lifers, GOP platform

Personhood USA is calling on presidential candidate Mitt Romney to retract a statement he made this week about abortion.

Jennifer Mason is a spokesperson for Personhood USA, which supports proposed state amendments that define personhood at the biological beginning of life. She says her group also wants Romney to change course on Senate candidate Todd Akin (R-Missouri), who recently made a misstatement about children conceived in rape.

Mason, Jennifer (Personhood USA)“We have recognized that Mitt Romney has basically turned his back on the Republican Party platform by claiming that he will uphold abortions in cases of rape and incest,” Mason explains. “The Republican Party … our organization and pro-lifers nationwide believe that all life is valuable and sacred.”

Romney made his statement and call for Akin’s withdrawal from the race on Monday, after Akin admitted his statement for “legitimate rape” was wrong.

“While [his words] were insensitive, [Akin] has apologized for those, and he has basically been a 100-percent pro-life candidate,” the Personhood USA spokesperson notes. “So we’re calling on Romney to support Akin and not turn his back on him in this upcoming Senate race.”

It was after Akin’s verbal snafu that Romney announced he would not stand against abortion in cases of rape, which is contrary to the Republican platform. He also asked Akin to withdraw from the race and has declined to change his mind on that, even though Akin has apologized.
