Global 500 2011: Global 500 1-100
Editor's note: Chrysler Group was erroneously omitted from the Global 500 listing. With revenue of $41.9 billion, Chrysler ranks No.205 among all the companies in the world and 61st in the U.S. As a result, Bristol-Myers Squibb, which had ranked No.500, falls off the list. Updates may be found for the full list, rankings by country, and the list of arrivals. Fortune regrets the error.
