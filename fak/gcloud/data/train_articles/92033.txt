Office of the Governor
Statement by Governor Chris Christie on the Signing of Pension Reform Legislation

- Governor Chris Christie released the following statement upon signing S2, S3 and S4 into law:"The passage of today's set of bills is a solid start to reforming our pension system and I applaud the Senate and Assembly Leadership and the entire bipartisan efforts of the legislature for taking this necessary first step. It is clear that our state can no longer afford a system that is rife with abuse, that promises substantial payouts with little buy-in, and that provides benefits that are wildly out of proportion with the private sector. The costs in the system remain dangerously out of balance and additional reforms are necessary to ensure the future solvency of the system. I will continue to work with stakeholders, the legislative leadership, and members of both parties to bring about additional reforms to fix the system in a responsible, fair and fiscally sound manner for New Jersey taxpayers."
