Page 1 of the Excel workbook describes how the profiles were developed and the sources of information for each component of the model. Many people contributed to the development of the profiles and we acknowledge them on Page 2 of the workbook. Page 3 summarizes the level of income needed to pay for housing, food, child care, transportation and health insurance without reliance on public benefits. Locality profiles start on Page 4 and continue in alphabetical order.

Each profile includes 1) a line graph that shows monthly income remaining after taxes and expenses (child care, food, housing, health insurance, and transportation) projected across levels of income, 2) a pie graph showing monthly expenses when income is set at the minimum needed for self-sufficiency, and 3) a data table documenting information included in the model.
