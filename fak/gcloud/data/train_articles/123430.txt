A-Z Topics
At PepsiCo, we have embedded sustainability into everything we do through a governing philosophy called Performance with Purpose - our commitment to making healthier products, protecting our planet and empowering our associates and the communities we serve. We created this index to address the broad range of sustainability-related topics that matter to our business and our stakeholders including, investors, suppliers, customers, consumers, associates, communities, government agencies, NGO partners and other stakeholder groups. Click on each of our A-Z topics in the index below for more information.

To see how our A-Z topics align with our material topics as defined through our GRI Materiality process, see the GRI Material Aspects & Boundaries section of the A-Z Index below.

A number of topics in this index are related to our Performance with Purpose 2025 goals. Further detail about our goals, along with a complete GRI Index, can be found in our 2017 Sustainability Report.
