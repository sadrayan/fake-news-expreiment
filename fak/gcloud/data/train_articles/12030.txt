NOAA Research — Budget
Budget Process We receive many questions about the timing of the budget process. The timeline below is intended as a guide to help explain the process from budget formulation to execution. Click to expand budget timeline Updates White House Releases FY 2019 President's Budget Request On February 12 the President submitted his FY 2019 budget request to Congress. In FY 2019, NOAA requests a total of $321,651,000 to support OAR’s continued and sustained operations. This total includes Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF) and Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC) accounts and is composed of a net decrease of $192,400,000 in FY 2019 program changes. OAR’s FY 2019 request prioritizes OAR’s core functions and reduces extramural grants. OAR will continue to provide robust science that is instrumental to preventing the loss of human life, managing natural resources, and maintaining a strong economy. Summaries and detailed descriptions of the program changes below are in the NOAA Bluebook and Congressional Justification on the NOAA Budget Office page. Climate Research: $98,643,000 NOAA requests a decrease of $59,615,000 in FY 2019 program changes in the Climate Research sub-program. Program changes include: Reduce Competitively Funded Research: NOAA requests decreases of $8,472,000 from Regional Climate Data and Information and $39,782,000 from Climate Competitive Research to reduce competitively funded climate research. This will reduce NOAA’s funding for Cooperative Institutes, universities, NOAA laboratories, and other partners that advance understanding of the Earth’s climate system.

NOAA requests decreases of $8,472,000 from Regional Climate Data and Information and $39,782,000 from Climate Competitive Research to reduce competitively funded climate research. This will reduce NOAA’s funding for Cooperative Institutes, universities, NOAA laboratories, and other partners that advance understanding of the Earth’s climate system. Eliminate Arctic Research: NOAA requests decreases of $1,940,000 from Climate Laboratories and Cooperative Institutes and $3,745,000 from Regional Climate Data and Information. This reduction will terminate Arctic research focused on improvements to sea ice modeling and predictions that support the safety of fishermen, commercial shippers, cruise ships, and local communities. NOAA will also terminate modeling of ecosystem and fisheries vulnerabilities. Weather and Air Chemistry Research: $91,730,000 NOAA requests a decrease of $22,431,000 in FY 2019 program changes in the Weather & Air Chemistry Research sub-program for a total of $91,730,000. Program changes include: Close the Air Resources Laboratory: NOAA requests a decrease of $4,377,000 to close the Air Resources Laboratory (ARL). ARL’s research on air chemistry, mercury deposition, and atmospheric dispersion of harmful materials will be terminated, and its remaining research functions will be consolidated into other NOAA laboratories. NOAA will also no longer support upgrades to the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, a particle model that has emergency response applications, including tracking mercury deposition and anthrax bioterrorism.

Close the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program Office: NOAA requests a decrease of $5,339,000 to terminate the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Program Office. This program office coordinates UAS research and development, and provides intramural grants to explore the use of UAS for current and future weather, polar, and marine observing operations across NOAA.

End Vortex-Southeast: NOAA requests a decrease of $4,966,000 to terminate Vortex-Southeast, a program used to detect, respond to, and warn against tornadoes in the Southeastern United States.



End Support for Airborne Phased Array Radar: NOAA requests a decrease of $2,565,000 to terminate research and development on Airborne Phased Array Radar. NOAA will no longer work with the research community on developing a prototype system to examine methods of aircraft-based hazardous weather observation.



Terminate the Infrasonic Weather Monitoring Research Termination: NOAA requests a decrease of $479,000 to conclude infrasonic monitoring program. NOAA has completed an evaluation of this technology using congressionally directed funding in FY 2016 and FY 2017.



Terminate the Joint Technology Transfer Initiative: NOAA requests a reduction of $9,933,000 to terminate the Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI) used to transition the latest technological advances in weather research into products and services for communities and businesses.

Ocean, Coastal and Great Lakes Research: $93,144,000 NOAA requests a decrease of $99,286,000 in FY 2019 program changes in the Ocean, Coastal, and Great Lakes Research sub-program for a total of $93,144,000. Program changes include: Eliminate Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Demonstration Testbed: NOAA requests a decrease of $1,923,000 to eliminate the autonomous underwater vehicle demonstration testbed. NOAA will retain its fleet of autonomous vehicles, but will reduce funding for ongoing development, testing, and evaluation.

End Genomics Research: NOAA requests a decrease of $1,803,000 to eliminate the environmental genomics program at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), which studies genetic material to better understand how organisms are distributed and how they are affected by changing ocean conditions. This research supports coral monitoring and restoration, fisheries assessments for species such as Bluefin tuna larvae, and recruitment models of endangered species.



Terminate the National Sea Grant Program: NOAA requests decreases of $62,695,000 in the National Sea Grant College Program base and $9,436,000 in Marine Aquaculture to terminate the National Sea Grant College Program. This budgetary decrease will end Federal support for the network of 33 Sea Grant programs located in coastal States and territories and terminates Sea Grant’s Marine Aquaculture Program.



Reduce Ocean Exploration: NOAA requests a decrease of $16,319,000 to reduce mapping and exploration of unknown and poorly understood areas of the ocean. With its $19,561,000 request in FY 2019, NOAA will continue to fund a limited number of days for Extended Continental Shelf mapping and conduct a limited number of exploration missions. NOAA will prioritize activities that support the nation’s security, economy, environmental health, and increasing seafood demand.



Reduce Integrated Ocean Acidification: NOAA requests a decrease of $2,448,000 to reduce funding for the Integrated Ocean Acidification Program that conducts research to improve our understanding of ocean and coastal acidification and its impacts on marine resources, coastal communities, and economies.



Reduce Sustained Ocean Observations and Monitoring: NOAA requests a decrease of $4,662,000 to reduce funding for Sustained Ocean Observations and Monitoring (SOOM). NOAA will reduce external grant funding that the SOOM uses to leverage partnerships to develop a global ocean observing system.

Innovative Research & Technology: $12,134,000 NOAA requests a decrease of $934,000 in FY 2019 program changes in the Innovative Research & Technology activity for a total of $12,134,000. Program changes include: Termination of the Research Transition Acceleration Program: NOAA requests a decrease of $993,000 to terminate the Research Transition Acceleration Program, designed for the oversight and management of NOAA’s Research technology transitions program.

OAR Procurement, Acquisition and Construction (PAC): $26,000,000 NOAA requests a total of $26,000,000 to support Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction activities for OAR, reflecting a decrease of $10,134,000 in FY 2019 program changes in systems acquisition. Research Supercomputing: Terminate Mississippi State HPC Partnership: NOAA requests a decrease of $10,134,000 to terminate the Mississippi State Partnership established by congressionally directed requirements to develop a dedicated high performance computing facility
