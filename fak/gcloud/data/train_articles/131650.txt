Media fails to report that Antifa woman taken down by Marine was throwing IEDs

There’s been media coverage of a woman Louise Rosealma being wrestled to the ground by a man. Rosealma was part of the Antifa group in Berkeley, California that attacked pro-Trump marchers.

Nathan Damigo, a Marine veteran who was there saw that Rosealma was putting M80 explosive devices inside glass bottles and throwing them at the pro-Trump rally marchers.

So Louise Rosealma was literally making IED’s. This makes her no better than the Boston Marathon bombers.

According to Wikipedia

M-80s are an American class of large powerful firecrackers, sometimes called salutes. M-80s were originally made in the early 20th century by the U.S. military to simulate explosives or artillery fire; later, M-80s were manufactured as fireworks.

You can see in the picture (above right) that she has her weapon, a glass bottle with an M80 in it, in her hand as Damigo hits her in the face to subdue the bomb threat.

Marines are trained to run towards the fight not away from it, to put their lives on the line so others won’t get hurt. Perfect example of that here.



According to CBS Los Angeles , “The 20-year-old [Louise Rosealma] drove to the Bay Area with friends to march against the alt-right organized event. Rosealma, a member of the anti-fascist movement, says she had only been at the protest for about 20 minutes when a smoke bomb went off. At that point, she says, she and her boyfriend were charged.”

She was being charged by Damigo because she was a threat to the safety of others.

It seems the fakestream media never reports the truth anymore.
