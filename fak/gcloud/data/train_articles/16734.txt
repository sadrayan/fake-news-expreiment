Hello again.

I wanted to share with you that on Monday, Dr. Wells told me he reached the estimate of 1 million first by geo-locating a little over 330,000 homes identified starting from claims filed with private insurers from Harvey’s landfall through four to five days after that. In each instance, Wells said, “we could say this is a structure out there with a definitive address with an actual claim to an insurance company that they had water damage.”

Next, Wells said, he applied multipliers to the confirmed count of homes reported to have damage based on the prevalence of flood coverage in the counties hit by Harvey. In Houston and Harris County, he said, about 15 percent of residences have flood coverage so it’s reasonable to estimate that overall, nearly 1 million homes were affected--not necessarily destroyed, Wells said, but damaged to the degree to which a resident could make a flood insurance claim.

Wells, asked how many residents were left without homes, replied: “I don’t have a direct estimate of that.”

I am happy to field more information.

G.

Hi Gardner,

Good to talk with you. Your summary of yesterday's conversation is accurate, but today I can add a little more detail. Before reviewing the numbers, let's keep in mind that my figures apply only to building structures in Texas that were impacted or affected by water damage. The damage could range from minor (i.e., a roof leak following wind damage) to severely damaged and destroyed (i.e., flooded throughout the ground floor to a level 4-5 feet or higher). We also have information for several thousand wind damage claims in the landfall area that do not also include water damage, which I have not included in this assessment.

The best source of information for water damage comes from claims filed with FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and with private insurance companies. Street addresses accompanying the claims can be geocoded and reviewed with reference to aerial photography and satellite imagery collected at the time of regional flooding and in the aftermath when building contents were placed in curbside debris piles. While not all claims contain addresses that can be geocoded, most do, and the numbers and locations provide a good summary of the extent and magnitude of flood damage in the areas struck by Hurricane Harvey.

For the entire region of Texas impacted by Harvey, insurance claims were filed with private insurance companies for 254,229 properties through October 4, 2017. An additional 85,600 claims were filed by NFIP policyholders through September 30. The total number of affected structures with insurance claims for water damage is therefore 339,829. However, the actual number of impacted structures in the region is much greater. For instance, in Harris County only 15 percent of homeowners and renters purchase flood insurance of any kind (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/business/dealbook/flood-insurance-harvey.html?_r=0). Mark Hanna of the Insurance Council of Texas usually quotes a figure of 1-in-5 Texas homeowners with insurance for flood damage. You might check with him for an update. If the figure of 339,829 affected structures represents the insured population of homeowners, then the total number of impacted structures in the region would rise by a factor of five to nearly 1.7 million, including a large number with only minor water damage. This is higher than my original estimate of 1 to 1.1 million affected structures estimated from the insurance data available in early September.

Please have a look at the attached graphics that show the distribution of geocoded damage claims in the Greater Houston area and in the neighborhoods of West Houston near Barker Reservoir. There are thousands of claims for water damage located far from FEMA designated flood risk zones (shown in blue) in places where homeowners are not required to purchase flood insurance.

The distribution of the insurance claims, widespread floodwater detected in satellite and aerial imagery and the tendency for homeowners not to insure their property for flood damage lead me to estimate that water damage of some degree occurred to over one million properties in Texas as a result of Hurricane Harvey and perhaps as many as 1.7 million properties based on the best available data.

Let me know if this information is helpful.

Thank you,

Gordon
