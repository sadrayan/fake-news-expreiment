Campus Carry The University of Texas at Austin
General Information

On June 1, 2015, Gov. Greg Abbott signed S.B. 11, also known as the "campus carry" law. S.B. 11 provides that license holders may carry a concealed handgun throughout university campuses, starting Aug. 1, 2016. The law gives public universities some discretion to regulate campus carry.

The University of Texas at Austin and President Gregory L. Fenves take issues surrounding guns on campus very seriously and will strive to create policies that conform to the new law, protect the rights of citizens and ensure the safety and security of the entire campus.

S.B. 11 provides that after consulting with students, staff and faculty regarding "the nature of the student population, specific safety considerations and the uniqueness of the campus environment" the university may enact reasonable rules and regulations regarding:

carrying of concealed handguns by license holders on campus; and

storage of handguns in dormitories or other residential facilities

The law stipulates, however, that these rules and regulations may not either "generally prohibit" or "have the effect of generally prohibiting" license holders from carrying concealed handguns on campus.
