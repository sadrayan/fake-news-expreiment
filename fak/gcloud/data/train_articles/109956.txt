WASHINGTON — Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum on Friday said he thinks it would be wrong to allow women to serve in combat.

As one reason, Santorum cited “the emotions of men.” He said there is the potential that men will not be focused on their combat mission but on what he calls a “natural instinct” to protect a woman.

Santorum also questioned having women in combat roles because of what he says are “all sorts of physical issues” relating to the capabilities of men and women.

New Pentagon rules will place women in the military closer to the front lines, but the Pentagon will still ban women from the most dangerous combat jobs.

Santorum made the comments on CNN.
