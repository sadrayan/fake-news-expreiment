According to that web site you have below:

“over 238,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and November 30, 2017”

The above is over a six-year period, and four months, so roughly 39,000 per year bookings. Not all arrests lead to a jail booking, but let us assume they do. In 2015 there were 758,584 adult arrests in Texas. 39,000/758,584 is about 5%. So that does not match the 1.6% either.

Don’t know what to tell you is she is claiming that comes from DPS. Obviously DPS is not releasing a number for you except for this page. If you do my “back of napkin” calculation above, you get a higher percentage.
