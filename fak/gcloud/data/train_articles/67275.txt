Centrist Dem: Link Keystone pipeline to efficiency boost
Warner also talked up a major report recently released by a group he co-chairs called the Alliance Commission on National Energy Efficiency Policy, which laid out plans to greatly expand U.S. efficiency by 2030.



“There are a lot of recommendations in there that could be linked with [Keystone],” Warner said.



But while Warner wants Keystone’s approval tethered to beefed-up energy efficiency, he also wants action soon on the pipeline that would bring Canadian oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries.



Warner is among several Democrats on a new bipartisan letter calling on the State Department, which is heading review of the proposed pipeline, to approve the project soon.



The letter does not call for linking the pipeline to other energy policies.
