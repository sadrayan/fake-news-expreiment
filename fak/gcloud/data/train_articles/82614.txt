Gov. Christie Vetoes Bill Funding Planned Parenthood for Fifth Time
Governor Chris Christie has no interest in funding the Planned Parenthood abortion business with taxpayer dollars and, for the fifth time, vetoed a bill to do just that. On Friday, Christie vetoed the two family planning bills A4171/S2824 and A4172/S2825.

From the Star Ledger newspaper:

Even though he made some concessions to Democrats, Christie also stamped out their efforts to add $7.5 million to family planning centers and to expand Medicaid coverage for such centers, vetoing those two bills and a series of others. Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen), the sponsor of the bill that funds women’s health clinics (S2825), said six centers for women have closed since Christie first cut their state funding three years ago. “It is shameful that the governor is playing politics with the health of the women of New Jersey,” she said. “Women and families in communities across New Jersey have lost access to cancer screenings, pre-natal care, STD testing and treatment and birth control.” Christie said the bills “would deplete the state’s fiscal resources … and significantly alter the policy and spending priorities” negotiated in the budget this year. “While each bill may have merit, consideration of that merit is better accomplished in the context of negotiating a balanced budget, as we have done this year,” he wrote in a two-page veto message for all eight Democratic bills.

Christie vetoed the Planned Parenthood abortion business funding bills to the delight of pro-life advocates, including Marie Tasy of New Jersey Right to Life. Here is what she sent LifeNews:
