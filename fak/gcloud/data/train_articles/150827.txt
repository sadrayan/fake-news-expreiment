Two unusual cases of a foreign body in the oral cavity caused by eating raw squid.
Foreign bodies are often encountered by otolaryngologists, but the oral cavity is considered a place where foreign bodies are rare because of its structural and functional features. We here present 2 cases with a foreign body in the oral cavity resulting from eating raw squid. In one of these 2 cases endoscopic examination revealed a gastric foreign body. The foreign bodies in the oral cavity were removed using forceps, together with surrounding mucous membrane. These foreign bodies were identified as sperm bulbs and discharging tube of sogittated calamary (Todarodes pacificus Steenstrup). Larva migrans of anisakiasis are to be differentiated from sperm bulbs; it is important to distinguish between the shape and size of the foreign body in our cases. If sperm bulbs are stuck in the oral cavity, it is necessary to remove them completely to ensure that inflammation is prevented. We stress the importance of checking not only anisakiasis but also sperm bulbs in humans who like eating raw squid.
