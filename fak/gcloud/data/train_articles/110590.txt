Who would keep a dog shut up in a cold dark room, chained so tightly to the roof rafters above that she can’t lie down? Who would leave her sick from disease and infected wounds and unable to even reach water? Dogfighters… dogfighters do this.

Mia is her name, and she was one of the 14 pit-bull fighting dogs rescued from atrocious conditions by the NSPCA’s Special Investigations Unit in Atteridgeville last year.

In his sentencing, Magistrate Kruger said that the crimes that the accused were guilty of were both pointless and perverse and he must sentence accordingly to ensure that the punishment serves as a warning to others who may be involved in dog fighting or any of its associated activities.

Six men were sentenced to direct imprisonment for their involvement in this heinous crime.

The NSPCA has secured the conviction of 50 dogfighters to date with many more awaiting prosecution. Help us to put more of these abhorrent criminals behind bars.
