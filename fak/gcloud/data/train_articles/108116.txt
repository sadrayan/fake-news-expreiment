Congiopodidae is a family of scorpaeniform fishes native to the southern hemisphere, commonly known as pigfishes, horsefishes and racehorses.

Congiopids live on the bottom of shallow temperate and sub-Antarctic seas, at depths of up to 600 metres (2,000 ft). They lack scales, and have a projecting snout with a small mouth.[3]
