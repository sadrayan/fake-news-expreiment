Army drops use of term 'Negro' in document
The Army has dropped the term "Negro" from a policy document that called the word an acceptable alternative to "Black" or "African American."

The term appeared in a lengthy document called Army Command Policy, covering personnel standards and policies. A section on equal opportunity policy defined "Black" or "African American" as "a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa," adding that "terms such as 'Haitian' or 'Negro' can be used" also.

The Army issued a statement saying it removed the term "Negro" Thursday as soon as it realized it was in the document. It did not say when the term first appeared in the document, but it apparently was many years ago.

The Army offered an apology to anyone who was offended.
