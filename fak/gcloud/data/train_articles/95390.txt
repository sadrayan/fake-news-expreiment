VHHA Statement on Thomas Jefferson Institute Report on the Financial Health of Virginia Hospitals

Wednesday, September 10, 2014

RICHMOND. The Thomas Jefferson Institute released an analysis of the finances of Virginia’s hospitals today. The Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association also released a report today highlighting the many ways Virginia’s hospitals and health systems contribute to the Commonwealth’s economy while facing tremendous fiscal challenges and uncertainty. (http://www.vhha.com/documents.html?id=11 92 )

The Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association issued the following statement regarding The Thomas Jefferson Institute report:

“Virginia’s hospitals are facing enormous challenges. Due to changes in law and policy, primarily emanating from Washington, the fiscal health of many hospitals is fragile and getting worse. Reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, sequestration cuts, coding and overnight stay reductions are just some of the major negative financial changes having a greater impact every day. Unfortunately, the two-year old data used in the Thomas Jefferson Institute report released today take a rear-view look in the mirror, which fails to account for the fiscal headwinds Virginia’s hospitals and health systems face now and into the near future absent a compromise on expanding health care coverage to more Virginians and reducing uncompensated care. As prudent business leaders and major employers, hospitals and health systems need to look ahead and are making tough decisions affecting jobs and services in light of these current realities. As with any dynamic market, historical hospital financial strength, a major driver of Virginia’s economic well-being, is no guarantee of future success.

“Since the Affordable Care Act is intended to reduce the number of uninsured and uncompensated care, the law makes significant cuts to federal reimbursements. As a result, Virginia’s hospitals continue to face significant uncompensated care costs while at the same time incurring additional cuts to reimbursements. These looming cuts will have a significant financial impact on all hospitals in Virginia.”

A few recent reports detail the struggles hospitals currently are facing:

As reported in The New York Times in August 2014, Moody’s Investors Services released a report, stating that “Nonprofit Hospitals’ 2013 Revenue Lowest Since Recession, Report Says.” (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/business/nonprofit-hospitals-2013-revenue-lowest-since-recession-report-says.html?_r=0&gwh=018FD82897B196927A20121A97AB5C49&gwt=pay)

Forbes reported in August 2014 that “States declining Medicaid expansion will face financial challenges,” per a report from Fitch Ratings. (http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2014/07/20/hospitals-see-troubles-in-red-states-that-snubbed-obamacares-medicaid-deal/?partner=yahootix)

The American Hospital Association released a report detailing “The Financial State of U.S. Hospitals. (http://www.aha.org/content/14/fs-financialstate.pdf)

An August 2014 survey released by Gallup shows that Virginia is one of only three states whose uninsured rate has increased from 2013 to mid-year 2014. Virginia’s uninsured rate rose 13.3 percent to 13.4 percent. (http://www.gallup.com/poll/174290/arkansas-kentucky-report-sharpest-drops-uninsured-rate.aspx#1)

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute released an analysis in August 2014 projecting the effect on the 24 states that have not expanded Medicaid. For Virginia, in 2016 alone, there will be 268,000 uninsured residents who will not qualify for coverage. During the 10-year period from 2013-2022, Virginia would lose $14.7 billion in federal Medicaid funding, and hospitals throughout the Commonwealth would lose an additional $6.2 billion in Medicaid reimbursement for care provided.
