The Terminator�s famous warning rang true. Arnold Schwarzenegger came back to Columbus for the rededication of his bronze likeness in its new home, the Greater Columbus Convention Center.

During the ceremony, the former California governor and fitness advocate proclaimed that the Arnold Sports Festival, the athletic and fitness competition he started in 1989 with Columbus sports promoter Jim Lorimer, would always take place in Ohio�s capital.

�There�s no place like Columbus, Ohio.� Schwarzenegger said. �We have the most extraordinary people.�

State and city leaders at the rededication praised the Arnold Sports Festival for the amount of visitors and revenue it�s brought to Columbus, as well as a commitment to fitness and training. The statue was recently moved from Veterans Memorial on West Broad Street to the convention center. Veterans Memorial, where the festival has been held in the past, is to be torn down.

Andrew Ginther, president of Columbus City Council, said the statue not only memorializes the partnership between Schwarzenegger and the city, but the former governor�s accomplishments in the state of California, as well as his international promotion of leadership and healthy lifestyles.

�It reminds us of how much a single person can do in one lifetime,� Ginther said.

The festival, held Feb. 27 – March 2 this year, brought 175,000 visitors, and Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman predicted next year�s festival would see 200,000 guests.

�You�re our friend,� Coleman said to Schwarzenegger. �We want to memorialize that forever in front of our convention center.�

Gov. John Kasich also expressed his kinship with Schwarzenegger, describing the time he met up with the former governor, who was wearing his signature shades, in California.

�He�s a pal, he�s been a great friend of mine,� Kasich said. �There aren�t that many people like him on the Earth.�
