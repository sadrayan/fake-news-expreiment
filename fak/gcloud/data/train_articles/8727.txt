Diaz-Balart Statement on DHS Executive Order
WASHINGTON – Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart (FL-25) released the following statement in response to President Trump’s executive order pertaining to the Department of Homeland Security.

“I am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order, but who failed to challenge President Obama when he took similar action against Cuban refugees; especially since President Obama’s action was meant to appease the Castro regime and not for national security reasons.

“While it is always legitimate to express concerns with presidential executive orders, I understand the President’s primary responsibility is to keep the American people safe. The ban is only temporary until the Administration can review and enact the necessary procedures to vet immigrants from these countries. The ban is based on countries the Obama administration identified as ‘countries of concern’ and not based on a religious test.”
