White House Reporter
Jeremy Diamond is a CNN White House Reporter based in Washington, D.C., where he covers the White House and the Trump administration.

In his time covering the White House, he has reported on foreign policy, domestic policy and politics, breaking stories on the administration's policy on North Korea, behind-the-scenes details of West Wing strife and the impact of the special counsel's investigation.

Before covering the White House, Diamond reported on the rise of President Donald Trump, traveling across the country as an embedded reporter with his campaign from its inception through Election Day.

Diamond joined CNN Politics as a reporter in September 2014 after two previous internships with the network. Before joining CNN, Diamond earned his journalism chops as a reporter and news editor at the GW Hatchet, the independent student newspaper of the George Washington University. There, he broke a national news story after uncovering that university officials misrepresented the school's financial aid policy. For that story, he won the Institute on Political Journalism's Collegiate Journalism Award and a Pinnacle Award from the College Media Association.

He graduated Cum Laude from The George Washington University with a degree in international affairs. He is fluent in French and conversational in Spanish and Hebrew.
