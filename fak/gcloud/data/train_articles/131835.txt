Iowa Students Forced To Apologize For Wearing Red, White And Blue – A…
The students at an Iowa high school apologized to a neighboring school for wearing USA-themed clothing to a recent basketball game

The Valley High School students attire was deemed offensive to the rival schools’ players, as some of their families are refugees.

“Any normal person, any educated person can look at that and think what the hell are these kids thinking,” said Morgan Wheat, assistant coach of the Des Moines North team.

The Valley High students argued that wearing red, white and blue was not an attempt to taunt the Des Moines North players.

In a statement , student leaders at Valley High School apologized for their patriotism.

It has been brought to our attention that the decision by the Valley High School student section to wear U.S.A. apparel at our game last night was offensive to members of your community and fan base. We are deeply sorry if we have offended anyone in any way. We have traditionally dressed in such a fashion for great games such as the one last night. Everyone here at Valley has immense respect not only for your team and players but for your community as a whole. Please know that our intent was in no way to offend or demean—just to support our own team in a way we have done before. “

Unfortunately, having pride in your country is frowned upon by the left in today’s society. Stories like these have popped up more often than they should.

It’s about time we stand up to these refugees and immigrants. If you want to come to America, you should adopt our values – including the red, white and blue.

Bobby Jindal, the son of Indian immigrants, said it best:

“Immigration without assimilation is invasion.”
