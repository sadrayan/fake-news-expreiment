Full Text of Kim Jong-un’s Response to President Trump
Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, has responded to President Trump’s vow at the United Nations to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies. His remarks, released on Friday by KCNA, the North Korean state news agency, were believed to be the first time a North Korean leader directly issued a statement to the world under his name. Here is the full text:

The speech made by the U.S. president in his maiden address on the U.N. arena in the prevailing serious circumstances, in which the situation on the Korean Peninsula has been rendered tense as never before and is inching closer to a touch-and-go state, is arousing worldwide concern.

Shaping the general idea of what he would say, I expected he would make stereotyped, prepared remarks a little different from what he used to utter in his office on the spur of the moment as he had to speak on the world’s biggest official diplomatic stage.

But, far from making remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful to defusing tension, he made unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessors.

A frightened dog barks louder.

I’d like to advise Trump to exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the world.
