“Potholes, cracks, and bumps in the road can cause irreversible damage to your pizza during the drive home from Domino’s,” said the company in a release. “We can’t stand by and let your cheese slide to one side, your toppings get un-topped, or your boxes get flipped. So we’re helping to pave in towns across the country to save your good pizza from these bad roads.”

Domino’s is letting it known they are fixing potholes but writing, “OH YES, WE DID,” on the repaved area of the street.
