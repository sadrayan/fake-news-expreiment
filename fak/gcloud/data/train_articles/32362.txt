U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz tours plant, speaks in Waller County
HOUSTON - Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz toured the massive Daikin technology plant in Waller, Texas on Monday. The company calls the plant “The coolest place in Texas!”

Workers there manufacture heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The plant measures more than 4 million square feet.

"As a native Houstonian, there is nothing more wonderful than air conditioning,” said Sen. Cruz. He checked out the plant that sits on 500 acres in Waller County. The whole thing cost 500 million dollars.

He said companies like it are creating jobs. Sen. Cruz said, "Texas is real simple. We care about jobs. And I got to tell you that is uniform across Texas whether you're in East Texas, West Texas, whether you're in the Panhandle or the Valley. The No. 1 priority in Texas is jobs and what y'all are doing makes a real difference."

The Daikin plant plans its grand opening in May.

While Cruz talked about what Americans are doing at home, he talked with reporters after a town hall meeting at Daikin. He said working with the Chinese is a good approach to dealing with North Korea.

He said the North Korean leader is mentally unstable and is willing to use nuclear weapons against the United States.

"It remains a very dangerous circumstance. I'm glad to see the administration moving forward with putting anti-ballistic THAAD technology in South Korea to try to take out a missile launch. And we need to be prepared," Cruz said.
