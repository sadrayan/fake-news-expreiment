Manafort faces seven charges, including illegal foreign lobbying and conspiracy to launder money. The charges have no direct links to the Russia-oriented accusations against Trump.

Sam Patten, a former associate of Manafort, pleaded guilty last week to illegally acting as a foreign agent. He is now cooperating with the federal government.

Manafort was convicted last month on eight counts of bank and tax fraud.

Opening statements for Manafort's second trial are scheduled for Sept. 24, a week after jury selection begins.
