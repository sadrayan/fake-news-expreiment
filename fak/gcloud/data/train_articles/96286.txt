[APPLAUSE] MIKE: GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO OUR DEBATE WITH THE CANDIDATES FOR UNITED STATES SENATE. WE'RE JOINING YOU LIVE TONIGHT FROM ECKSTEIN HALL AT MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL, WHERE I WORK AS A FELLOW IN LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY. DURING THE NEXT 90 MINUTES, WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE MAJOR-PARTY CANDIDATES FOR U.S. SENATE. INCUMBENT REPUBLICAN SENATOR RON JOHNSON, AND HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER, FORMER U.S. SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD. OUR RULES FOR TONIGHT'S DEBATE ARE PRETTY SIMPLE. IT'S A CONVERSATION. I'LL BE ASKING THE CANDIDATES ABOUT THEIR VIEWS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE COUNTRY. WE'VE ASKED THEM TO ANSWER QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AND CONCISELY, AND TO STAY ON POINT. NO FILIBUSTERS. THE CANDIDATES CAN TALK TO ONE ANOTHER, BUT I WILL MANAGE THE TIME ON ANY GIVEN TOPIC, AND WILL HAVE THE FREEDOM TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION ALONG. TOWARD THE END OF OUR BROADCAST, EACH CANDIDATE WILL BE ASKED TO MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT. SO WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO TONIGHT, AND THE FIRST QUESTION GOES TO SENATOR JOHNSO SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US TONIGHT. SAME TO YOU, MR. FEINGOLD. SAME QUESTION TO BOTH OF YOU. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT TH RACE, AND A NUMBER OF RACES, HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT OVERSHADOWED BY THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST THIS YEAR. LET'S BEGIN BY GIVING THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM YOUR TAK -- THE PEOPLE WATCHING, AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, YOUR TAKE ON WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE. MR. JOHNSON: WHAT I THINK IS AT STAKE IS THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. RIGHT BEFORE PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT ELECTED, HE SAID IN FIVE YEARS, WE CAN FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM THIS NATION. I COULD DEPRESS THIS AUDIENCE LISTING ALL THE CHALLENGES, PROBLEMS, AND THREATS THAT FACE THIS NATION. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THOSE. WE HAVE TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. WE NEED TO RETURN TO OUR FOUNDING AND THE POLES OF A LIMITED GOVERNMENT PRIMARILY DESIGNED -- FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF A LIMITED GOVERNMENT PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM. WE NEED TO RETURN TO A FREE MARKET THAT PROTECTS THE BEST PRICE, BEST QUALITY, AND BEST LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. IT'S THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE FOLKS IN WISCONSIN WHO WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND WORK HARD. THEY NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND KEEP AS MUCH OF THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY AT POSSIBLE -- AS POSSIBLE. MR. FEINGOLD: I HAVE LISTENED TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE IN ALL 72 COUNTIES, AND THEY HAVE TOLD ME WHAT THAT STAKE. I SEE IT AS THEIR DECISION, WHAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE WORKING ON. WHEN I HEAR HIS MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WONDERING WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO GET A LITTLE FAIRNESS. THEY FEEL THEY CANNOT PAY THEIR BILLS. EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE AT THE TOP ARE DOING EXTREMELY WELL, WALL STREET IS THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN, UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOWER, BUT THEIR WAGES ARE STAGNANT. THEY ARE WONDERING WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO GET A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE, PAID FAMILY LEAVE, WHEN IS THE COST OF PHARMACEUTICALS GOING TO GO DOWN , WHEN ARE WE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT STUDENT LOANS? WHAT I SEE AS AT STAKE IN THIS RACE IS STANDING WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SENATOR JOHNSON HAS VOTED WITH CORPORATIONS, BILLIONAIRES, AND MULTIMILLIONAIRES WHO DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. TO ME, THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT ABOUT THE CHOICE IN THIS RACE. MIKE: DOES THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST HAVE ANY BEARING ON THE CHOICE IN THIS RACE? MR. JOHNSON: LISTEN, I HAVE HEARD THE FALSE ATTACK ADS SAYING I AM IN THE POCKET OF THE BUSINESS AND CORPORATE INTEREST. LISTEN, I STARTED OUT MAKING $1.45 AN HOUR AS A DISHWASHER AT A GRILL. I PROUD THAT HAVE HELPED BUILD AND GROW A VERY SUCCESSFUL WISCONSIN FAMILY BUSINESS. I NOT ONLY INSTALLED THE EQUIPMENT, I OPERATED IT. CONTINUING SHIFT OPERATIONS. THE FACT THAT SENATOR FEINGOLD CONTINUES TO ATTAC -- AND LET'S FACE IT. THIS CAMPAIGN HA BEEN ONE OF FALSE ATTACKS. HE SAYS HE IS FOR THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN THE MIDDLE CLASS. I AM FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. I HAVE BEE ALL MY LIFE. ON THI ISSUE, GROWING OUR ECONOMY, STRENGTHENING OUR SECURITY, FIGHTING ISIS, PROTECTING OUR BORDERS, FIDELITY TO THE CONSTITUTION, I THINK WE ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ISSUE. MR. FEINGOLD: I AM CONFUSED. WHY WOULD SENATOR JOHNSON RESPOND TO WHAT I SAID IN THAT WAY? ALL I SAID WAS WE HAVE DIFFERENT VOTING RECORDS. HIS VOTING RECORD IS WHAT I SAID. HE VOTES WITH CORPORATIONS. HE VOTES WITH BIG BUSINESS. HE VOTES AGAINST THE THINGS I TALKED ABOUT. THIS IS NOT A PERSONAL COMMENT. IT'S SOMETHING THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY. WHO IS THIS GUY GOING TO VOTE WITH? THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. I THINK I STAND ON FIRM GROUND THAT HE VOTES WITH BIG INTERESTS. MIKE: YOU HAVE TRIED TO TIE HIM TO DONALD TRUMP. IS THAT IMPORTANT? MR. FEINGOLD: I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE TRIED. IT'S NOT VERY HARD. SENATOR JOHNSON SUPPORTS A MAN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS KNOWS SHOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT. HE IS NOT QUALIFIED. HE DOES NOT HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT. HE HAS GOTTEN WHERE HE IS BY DIVIDING PEOPLE, SAYING UNFORTUNATE THINGS ABOUT LATINOS AND MUSLIMS, AND HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT SEEMS PRETTY INAPPROPRIATE. HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE -- SOME OF WHOM ARE IN PRETTY TOUGH RACES THEMSELVES -- REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THERE COMES A POINT . THEY HAVE ALL WITHDRAWN SUPPORT. BUT SENATOR JOHNSON CONTINUES TO SUPPORT HIM. WE NEED TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICA. THAT MEANS YOU DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM SOMEBODY LIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHO CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE PRESIDENT. MR. JOHNSON: FIRST OF ALL, EVERY VOTE I HAVE TAKEN, THE WAY I HAVE CONDUCTED MYSELF, IS ALWAYS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF WISCONSIN AND WISCONSIN WORKERS. I AM BEHOLDEN TO NO SPECIAL INTERESTS. WHEN I RAN IN 2010, I SAID I WOULD ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH AND VOTE MY MIND. I WAS HOPING TO GET A SERIOUS PRESIDENT TO WORK WITH ME TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH, ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, AND FIX THESE PROBLEMS. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, SO I AM RUNNING AGAIN. I AM ON THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND CHAIRMAN OF AFFAIRS, AND I WANT TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT SENATOR FEINGOLD IS TALKING ABOUT. NOR DOES HE, QUITE HONESTLY. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, I HAVE A RECORD OF BEING INDEPENDEN MINDED. COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR, I KNOW HOW MUCH HARDER THIS IS. I KNOW HOW MUCH HARDER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKES IT. HE IS RUNNING FOR A FOURTH TERM. IS HE WILLING T SAY HE WILL LIMIT HIMSELF TO FOUR TERMS? WILL IT BE FIVE? WILL IT BE SIX? I AM THE GUY WHO IS SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS COUNTRY AND WILLING TO VOTE TO SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS. MIKE: I WANT TO FOLLOW-UP. IN THE MOST RECENT MARQUETTE LAW SCHOOL POLL, 70% OF THE PEOPLE POLLED SAID THEY DID NOT BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP SHOWED GOOD JUDGMENT. SO, TONIGHT, DO YOU THINK YOUR PARTY'S NOMINEE SHOWS GOOD JUDGMENT. MR. JOHNSON: I HAVE BEEN VERY UPFRONT WHEN I DISAGREE WITH THE CANDIDATE. I AM NOT SURE THE SAME THING CAN BE SAID ABOUT MR. FEINGOLD. HE MAY BE THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO THINKS SECRETARY CLINTON IS TRUSTWORTHY. WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT HER DECADES OF LYING, HER DERELICTION OF DUTY THAT COST LIVES IN BENGHAZI, AND THEN LYING -- LOOK AT HER E-MAIL SCANDAL. PUTTING AMERICA'S TOP NATIONAL SECURITY SECRETS AT RISK BECAUSE SHE IS TRYING TO AVOID FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWS. WE SHOULD BE ASKING HIM ABOUT THAT. MIKE: HE WILL GET THAT QUESTION IN A SECOND. DO YOU THINK, AS YOUR PARTY'S NOMINEE HAS SAID, THAT THE ELECTION IS REG -- RIGGED? MR. JOHNSON: I THINK WITH THE BIAS OF THE MEDIA, THE ELECTION IS STACKED AGAINST HIM. THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGGED. I THINK WE NEED POLL WATCHERS. I DON'T WANT ANY LEGITIMATE VOTE MARRED BY A FRAUDULENT VOTE. IT'S A CONCERN. AND IT'S A POINT TO TALK ABOUT THE MEDIA ALMOST COMPLETELY IGNORING ALL OF THE CORRUPTION AND LIES OF SECRETARY CLINTON. MIKE: MR. FEINGOLD, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR SUPPORT OF YOUR PARTY'S NOMINEE, HILLARY CLINTON. YOU HAVE SAID SHE IS RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY. THE SAME POLL I REFERENCE TO SAID 66% OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS STATE DO NOT THINK SHE IS HONEST. HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT SOMEONE THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE IS DISHONEST ? MR. FEINGOLD: SENATOR JOHNSON TALKED -- DID NOT TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, SO I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIM. SENATOR JOHNSON COMPLETELY PIVOTED AWAY FROM TALKING ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT'S WRONG TO SUPPORT HIM FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SENATOR JOHNSON IS AN EXCELLENT BUSINESSMAN. THERE'S NO WAY HE WOULD HAVE EVER HIRED DONALD TRUMP AT HIS BUSINESS OR LET HIM RUN LOOSE IN HIS PLASTICS MANUFACTURING COMPANY, BECAUSE HE IS ANY RESPONSIBLE PERSON YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH. SO LET ME FIRST SAY, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. YOU CANNOT SAY I AM FOR THIS GUY AND DISTANCE MYSELF. HE HAS REFUSED TO APPEAR WITH DONA TRUMP. LET ME ANSWER T QUESTION ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF EXPERIENCES WORKING WITH HILLARY CLINTON. IT'S A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. I WORKED WITH HER WH SHE WAS FIRST LADY. I REMEMBER BEING WITH HER IN WISCONSIN AT A COLLEGE A WHILE BACK ON THE HEALTH CARE ISSUE. I WORKED WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS IN T SENATE. I ALSO WORKED WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WHAT I HAVE SAID IS THAT IN EACH A COUNTER THAT ENCOUNTER I HAVE HAD WITH HER, SHE HAS BEEN RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY. THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE. AS PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE SHE IS GOOD JUDGMENT, IS TOUGH . WE KNOW SHE IS NOT PERFECT, BUT ON BALANCE, SHE IS ABOUT IS QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS ANYONE. MIKE: TO HAVE ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY SHE HAS HANDLED THE E-MAILS -- DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY SHE HAS HANDLED THE E-MAILS, ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH WALL STREET OR HER FEELINGS ABOUT OPEN BORDERS? MR. FEINGOLD: I HAVE DISAGREED WITH HER ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. I OPPOSE THE IRAQ WAR. SHE WAS FOR IT. I HAVE DISAGREED WITH HER ON CAMPAI FINANCE REFORM. I BELIEVE HER PRESIDENCY SHOULD BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT. SHE REGRETS SOME OF THE THINGS SHE DID, AND SHE HAS BEEN OPEN ABOUT IT. SHE IS THE PERFECT, BUT SHE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP WHO, FRANKLY, I THINK WOULD DESTABILIZE THE WORLD. IF THEY SEE THIS PERSON BECOME PRESIDENT, IT WILL BE VERY FRIGHTENING TO THE WORLD. THEY WILL NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE UNITED STATES. MR. JOHNSON: TWO YOU REALIZE SECRETARY CLINTON DID NOT -- DO YOU REALIZE SECRETARY CLINTON COULD NOT GET A SECURITY CLEARANCE BECAUSE OF HER WRECK RECKLESS EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE E-MAILS? WE HAVE A TWO-TIER JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT'S OBVIOUS BY THE FACT THAT THE FBI DID NOT RECOMMEND INDICTMENT. SHE WOULD NOT BE CONFIRMED FOR ANY POSITION IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE BASED ON WHAT SHE DID WITH THOSE E-MAILS, AND YET, SENATOR FEINGOLD SUPPORTS HER FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF IS A FORMER FIRST LADY WHO LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAYS SHE IS DEAD BROKE , AND YEARS LATER, SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND A FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO CALLED HIMSELF MR. FINANCE REFORM - MR. CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM, ALL ABOUT CLEAN CAMPAIGN, AND WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING HE DID WHEN HE SET UP OFFICE? THREE POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES, 10 MILLION DOLLARS, TRIED TO RAISE MONEY HE SAID HE WOULD SPEND ON CANDIDATES. ABOUT 5% WHEN ON CANDIDATES. THE REST WENT TO HIMSELF AND HIS SHADOW CAMPAIGN. IT'S A MONEYMAKING MACHINE HE HAS RAISED ALL KIND OF MON, PRIMARILY OUTSIDE THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, USED THAT TO ATTACK ME FALSELY, RELENTLESSLY. LET'S HOPE WISCONSIN ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS HOW PHONY HE HAS BEEN ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM. MR FEINGOLD: EVERYTHING YOU HAVE HEARD IS SIMPLY FALSE. THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE KN ME AND KNOW THAT I AM AN ETHICAL PERSON, AND THAT IS HO I HAVE CONDUCTED MYSELF. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT OFF ON THIS. IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, YOUR KIDS, UNITY WITHIN THIS COUNTRY, THE WORLD BEING A STABLE PLACE, THE ONLY CHOICE IS TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON. AND THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD CAUSE CHINA, FRANCE, BRITAIN TO SAY WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH SOMEONE WHO CHANGES HIS MIND EVERY FIVE MINUTES AND ENABLES FLAT AMIR PUTIN -- SENATOR -- VLADIMIR PUTIN. SENATOR O JOHNSON HAS BASICALLY INVITED VLADIMIR PUTIN TO MESS WITH OUR ELECTION. MIKE: DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO WHETHER YOU CHANGED YOUR POSITION ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM? MR. FEINGOLD: SURE. I BELIEVE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WAS GUTTED BY THE CITIZENS UNITED DECISION IN 2010. THAT ALLOWED CORPORATE AND SPECIAL INTEREST S TO HIDE HUGE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO OVERWHELM THE POLITICAL PROCESS. SENATOR JOHNSON LOVES THAT SYSTEM. HE HAS FOUR TIMES MORE OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT ADS IN HIS CAMPAIGN THAN I DO. IN THE PAST, I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A MAJORITY OF MY CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM WISCONSIN. NOW THAT IS NOT THE CASE BECAUSE THE ENTIRE NEEDLE HAS CHANGED. BUT ASK YOURSELF TWO QUESTIONS. WHO HAS MORE SUPPORT FROM WISCONSIN? I DO. I HAVE 50,000 CONTRIBUTORS FROM WISCONSINITES. HE SAYS HE HAS 80,000, BUT HE HASN'T REVEALED IT. THAT'S THE FIRST THING. THE WISCONSIN SUPPORT IS FAR GREATER FOR ME. WHO HAS GREATER SUPPORT FROM OUTSIDE? SENATOR JOHNSON. FOUR TIMES MORE THAN MY CAMPAIGN. THE QUESTION IS WHO IS WISCONSIN-BASED AND WHO ISN'T? CLEARLY, I HAVE MORE SUPPORT. MR. JOHNSON: WHEN HE FIRST RAN, HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND LOOK FOR OUTSIDE MONEY. HE SAID HE WOULD RAISE THE MAJORITY OF HIS FUNDS HERE IN WISCONSIN. THAT WAS HIS PLEDGE FOR THE FUTURE. WHEN YOU PRESSED HIM ON THAT POINT, HE SAID IT WAS A PLEDGE FOR THIS TERM. LET'S FA IT . HE RAISED $10 MILLION, SPENT IT ON HIMSELF, PAID HIS CAMPAIGN STAF, PAID HIMSELF A SALARY, BOUGHT LEATHER BOUND BOO, AND SPENT IT ON CANDIDATES. HE SET UP THOSE PACS THA HE ACTUALLY TRIED TO OUTLAW. WHAT WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT BETWEEN SENATOR FEINGOLD AND HILLARY CLINTON, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR DRAMATIC CHANGE. I AM CHANGE AGENT. IF YOU WANT THE STATUS QUO, IF YOU THINK EVERYTHING IS WONDERFUL IN WASHINGTON, D.C., YOU WILL PROBABLY SUPPOR OF 34 YEAR CAREER POLITICIAN LIKE SENATOR FEINGOLD. IF YOU WAN TO RHEUMATIC CHANGE. IF YOU WANT OUR ECONOMY TO REALIZE ITS FULL -- IF YOU WANT DRAMATIC CHANGE, IF YOU WANT OUR ECONOMY TO REALIZE ITS FULL POTENTIAL, YOU SHOULD FOCUS ME. MR. FEINGOLD: PROGRESSIVES UNITED WAS CREATED TO FIGHT THE CORPORATE DOMINATION OF OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT SENATOR JOHNSON SUPPORTS. YES, IT GAVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES, BUT THAT WASN'T THE MAIN PURPOSE. THE MAIN PURPOSE WAS TO RAISE CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH E-MAILS FOR CANDIDATES DIRECTLY, WHICH WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. OR IMPORTANTLY, IT MADE SURE THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS -- FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SOCIAL SECURITY WAS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, PROGRESSIVES UNITED WAS SUCCESSFUL IN STOPPING IT. THIS ORGANIZATION WAS EFFECTIVE, 100% ETHICAL AND EFFECTIVE, AND ALL OF THE THINGS HE HAS SAID ABOUT IT ARE COMPLETELY FALSE. BUT HERE IS THE POINT. HE IS TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FROM WHAT MATTERS. THE FAMILIES OF THIS STATE WANT A SENATOR WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR THINGS LIKE RAISING MINIMUM WAGE AND DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE. MR. JOHNSON: I CAN QUICKLY CLOSE THIS OUT. HIS PACS WERE MONEYMAKING MACHINES THAT PROGRESSIVES UNITED SOLD TO THE FEINGOLD CAMPAIGN. 70% OF HIS CONTRIBUTIONS COME FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE. YOU CAN BE THE JUDGE. MIKE: DO YOU FAVOR ANY CHANGES IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM AND THE WAY CAMPAIGNS ARE RUN? MR. JOHNSON: WE SHOULD CERTAINLY GET BACK TO A SYSTEM WHERE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FLOW INTO A CAMPAIGN AND ARE ACCOUNTABLE. THAT IS ONE OF THE FAILURES OF HIS CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPOR REFORM, A PLAN THAT DID NOT WORK AT ALL. IT HAS BEEN A SPECTACULAR FAILURE. MR. FEINGOLD: SENATOR JOHNSON HAS BEEN IN OFFICE FOR SIX YEARS AND HAS NOT LIFTED A FINGER TO DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE CAMPAIGN-FINANCE BECAUSE HE LIKES IT THE WAY IT IS. HE IS BENEFITING ENORMOUSLY FROM THIS CORRUPTION AND HIDDEN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE NOT REPORTED. HE DOESN'T WANT TO CHANGE IT. OTHERWISE, HE WANTED. I WORKED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS WITH JOHN MCCAIN TO DO SOMETHING. THAT LAW STILL STANDS. POLITICIAN CANNOT CALL SPECIAL INTEREST DIRECTLY AND ASK FOR CONTRIBUTIONS. IF WE CAN OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED, WHICH I BELIEVE WE WILL IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THE MCCAIN-FEINGOLD LAW WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING THESE KIND OF CORRUPT CONTRIBUTIONS. AND I THINK CONGRESS SHOULD PASS A LAW REQUIRING THESE DISCLOSURES. THE SUPREME COURT SAID WE SHOULD KNOW WHERE THE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE COMING FROM. SENATOR JOHNSON DOES NOT SUPPORT THAT. HE COMPARED IT TO THE NAACP NOT HAVING THEIR MEMBERSHIP LISTS REVEALED. THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE DESERVE TO KNOW WHERE ALL THE MONEY SUPPORTING SENATOR JOHNSON IS COMING FROM. IT WOULDN'T BE PRETTY. MIKE: WANT TO MOVE ON TO A TOPIC THE BOTH OF YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. IT SEEMS LIKE A THEME WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT. SECURITY. THERE IS NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN POLICY, BUT THERE IS ALSO ECONOMIC SECURITY. LET'S WALK THROUGH A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES. I WANT TO BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT ECONOMIC SECURITY. THIS IS INTERESTING. SIX YEARS AGO, WE SAT IN THIS SAME ROOM AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS 7.8%. TODAY, IT'S 4.2 PERCENT. CLEARLY, THE ECONOMY HAS IMPROVED FROM WHAT IT WAS IN 2010. BUT RECENT SURVEYS SAY THAT PEOPLE FEEL A GROWING SENSE OF ECONOMIC ANXIETY. A POLL SAID 53% OF PEOPLE FEEL THEY ARE EITHER JUST GETTING BY OR STRUGGLING. I WILL BEGIN WITH YOU SENATOR JOHNSON. I GUESS, A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES YOU THINK PEOPLE IN THE SENATE CAN DO TO BETTER THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT ECONOMIC ANGST. MR. JOHNSON: FIRST OF ALL, THEY ARE FEELING REALITY. DURING THE EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, WAGES HAVE STAGNATED. THEY ARE RIGHT TO FEEL PINCHED. YES, UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOWER, BUT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE WORKFORCE. ECONOMIC GROWTH IS THE SOLUTION TO SO MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS. BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE SLOWEST RECOVERY SINCE WORLD WAR II. LAST QUARTER WAS 1.4% ECONOMIC GROWTH. FIRST QUARTER WEST .8%. ON AVERAGE, SINCE THE DEPRESSION, THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAS GROWN BY ABOUT 3%. EVEN WITH THE MEAGER ECONOMIC GROWTH WE HAVE HAD SINCE 2009, FEDERAL REVENUE HAS INCREASED BY $1.1 TRILLION. ALL OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARD UNLEASHING THE INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY OF AMERICANS. WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE REGULATORY BURDEN. IN MY COMMITTEE, WE WORK TO ENHANCE T SECURITY OF AMERICA. REGULATORY REFORM COST ABOUT $2 TRILLION A YEAR TO COMPLY WITH. THERE'S A BIG REASON . WE NEED TO REDUCE THE REGULATORY BURDEN. WHEN I ASKED FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE, WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE 14,000 800 DOLLARS FEEDING MASSIVELY INEFFICIENT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY OR YOUR PAYCHEC -- SENATOR FEINGOLD SUPPORTS THE GROWTH OF REGULATORY AGENCIES. HE SUPPORTS PUTTING THE EPA IN CHARGE OF 92% OF WISCONSIN LANDMASS, WHICH WOU BE DEVASTATING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. I WANT TO GRO THE PRIVATE SECTOR BY REDUCING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WISCONSINITES GET TO KEEP MORE OF THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY. MIKE: WHAT WOU YOU DO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ECONOMIC ANGST? MR. FEINGOLD: I THINK YOU DESERVE AN ANSWER. I THINK TRICKLE-DOWN IS NOT HAPPENING. AS I HAVE GONE TO ALL PARTS OF THE STATE, MILWAUKEE, CHIPPEWA FALLS, SUPERIOR, IT'S NOT HAPPENING. WE NEED TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT SENATOR JOHNSON HAS PROPOSED. WE NEED TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE SUBSTANTIALLY. SEVEN DOLLARS TWICE FIVE CENTS -- $7.25. FOR A FAMILY OF TWO OR MORE MEMBERS, THAT'S BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. SENATOR JOHNSON DOES NOT SUPPORT RAISING IT. HE HAS SAID IN THE PAST THAT HE DOESN'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. SECONDLY, WE NEED PAID FAMILY LEAVE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD, YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A FEW WEEKS OFF TO BOND WITH THAT CHILD. IT'S BETTER FOR THE EMPLOYER. WE COULD JOIN THE REST OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHO DO THIS SORT OF THING. IT WOULD MAKE A MEASURABLE DIFFERENCE TO A LOT OF FAMILIES. DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS STATE ARE? THEY ARE WORRIED SICK ABOUT THE COSTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINES. IT'S OVERWHELMING. SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE A $400 BILL AND THEY ARE TEMPTED TO CUT THEIR DOSAGE AND HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN STILL AFFORD FOOD AND RENT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO NEGOTIATE LOWER DRUG PRICES UNDER MEDICARE. ON ALL OF THESE MEASURES, HE HAS ZERO SPECIFICS BECAUSE HE WILL ONLY STAND FOR THOSE THINGS THE CORPORATIONS WILL ALLOW. MR. JOHNSON: ON YOUR SHOW, WHEN YOU ASKED ABOUT HIS PROPOSAL TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15 AN HOUR, ECONOMISTS SAY THAT WOULD COST JOBS. THERE ARE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. AS FAR AS ALLOWING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE PRICES, WE HAVE MEDICARE PART D. WE HAVE A SINGLE-PAYER GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT GOVERNOR -- THAT SENATOR FEINGOLD ONCE FOR ALL OF THE ECONOMY. THEY ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO ABOUT 82% OF DRUGS. MEDICARE HAS ACCESS TO ABOUT 95% OF DRUGS BECAUSE THEY ALLOW DIFFERENT PROVIDERS TO NEGOTIATE THE PRICES. THE C ERECTOR SAYS NEGOTIATION BY MEDICARE OR WOULD SAVE NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNTS OF CASH CBO DIRECT -- CBO DIRECTOR SAYS NEGOTIATION BY MEDICARE WOULD HAVE NEGLIGIBLE SAVINGS. SOME DISLOCATIONS BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15 AN HOUR IS CALLOUS. ESTHER FEINGOLD: THIS FROM A SENATOR WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD EVEN -- MR. FEINGOLD: THIS FROM A SENATOR WHO DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE WE SHOULD HA A MINIMUM WAGE ABOVE THE POVERTY LEVEL. 120 $3 BILLION IT WOULD SAVE TO NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES. -- $123 BILLI IT WOULD SAVE TO NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES. BY THE WAY, THE SENATOR HAS VOTED TO OPEN UP THE DOUGHNUT HOLE AGAIN. MIKE: WHAT DO YOU TELL A SENIOR IN THIS STATE WHO IS DESPERATELY SCARED ABOUT THEIR PRESCRIPTION, WELL, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT? MR. JOHNSON: I HAVE PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF WISCONSINITES WITH MIDDLE INCOME JOBS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR WORKING HARD AND SUCCEEDING. HOW YOU SUCCEED AND GROW AN ECONOMY IS GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY. REDUCE THE REGULATORY BURDEN. SENATOR FEINGOLD HAS ENDORSED THE POLICIES OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE COULD NOT PASS LAWS THROUGH LEGISLATION, SO HE IS PASSING THOSE POLICIES THROUGH REGULATION, CIRCUMVENTING CONGRESS. WE NEED TO REDUCE THE REGULATORY BURDEN, HAVE A COMPETITIVE TAX SYSTEM, AND KEEP WISCONSIN WORKERS COMPETITIVE. WE ALL WANT A GOOD ENVIRONMENT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE POLICIES SENATOR FEINGOLD PROMOTES MAKE WISCONSIN WORKERS LESS COMPETITIVE AND GLOBAL WORKERS MORE COMPETITIVE, AND COSTS US JOBS OVERSEAS. ESTHER FEINGOLD: LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. THIS IS MARY'S -- MR. FEINGOLD: LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. THIS IS VERY SIMPLE. SENATOR JOHNSON PAID HIMSELF FOR TIME AT HIS COMPANY AFTER HE WENT TO THE SENATE, AND HE DESCRIBED THAT IS REASONABLE. HE DOESN'T THINK RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE ABOVE SEVEN DOLLARS TRY FIVE CENTS AN HOUR -- SEVEN DOLLARS TRY FIVE CENTS -- $7.25 AN HOUR IS REASONABLE. THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN SHOULD SEE THAT. SENATOR JOHNSON: I HAVE PROVIDED GOOD PAYING JOBS, AND THAT'S A FACT. I LEFT THE COMPANY SO IT COULD BUILD AND GROW GOOD PAYING JOBS. IT'S SAD. MY BUSINESS PROVIDED GREAT PAYING JOBS, CAREER. SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STILL WITH ME AFTER 30 YEARS. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH A SUCCESSFUL FAMILY MANUFACTURER THAT EXPORTS TO ALL COUNTRIES. HE SEEMS TO DO THAT. BY T WAY, I HAVE NEVER SUGGESTED WE NOT HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT PROPOSALS. I AM NOT SUPPORTIVE OF DRAMATIC INCREASES THAT COST FAMILIE JOBS AND OPPORTUNITI. MR. FEINGOL NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS OR WHO YOU HIRED. I SAID YOU WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE ONE NICKEL. MR. JOHNSON: I HAVE JUST SAID I WOULD BE WILLING TO LOOK AT IT. MR. FEINGOLD: YOU HAVE VOTED CONSISTENTLY AGAINST RAISING IT AT ALL. THAT IS THE RECORD. THAT IS THE FACT. MIKE: OF INTEREST TO STUDENT IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT IS THE AFFORDABILITY OF COLLEGE. MR. FEINGOLD, YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE THEIR DEBT. YOU HAVE ALSO TALKED ABOUT FREE TUITION FOR FAMILIES MAKING UNDER 100 $25,000. -- 125 THOUSAND DOLLARS. FIRST, WHY DO STUDENT LOANS NEED TO BE TACKLED? MR. FEINGOLD: IT'S A CRISIS. EVERYWHERE YOU GO IN THE STATE, IT'S AN ISSUE. THERE IS THE FRIGHTENING ASPECT OF STUDENT LOANS. THE AVERAGE STUDENT IS ABOUT $28,000 IN DEBT. MANY PEOPLE COME IN WITH MUCH MORE. THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE. I HAVE HELD TOWN MEETINGS AND ROUNDTABLES WITH STUDENTS ALL OVER THE STATE WHO TELL ME THIS IS VERY DISTURBING. SENATOR JOHNSON SAID THEY THINK IT'S FREE MONEY. THEY DON'T. THEY THINK IT'S VERY DISTURBING AND A TERRIBLE WAY TO HAVE TO START THEIR LIFE. ONE YOUNG WOMAN SAID TO ME, SENATOR, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GO ON A FIRST DATE, THIS IS WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT. I SAY THEY DESERVE A BETTER ICE ICEBREAKER THAN THAT. WHEN ELIZABETH WARREN HAD A STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THE RENEGOTIATION OF INTEREST RATES, HE VOTED NO. IT WAS VERY CLOSE, BY A COUPLE OF VOTES. HE PREVENTED IT. I ALSO BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE A GOAL OF MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO GRADUATE COLLEGE DEBT-FREE, AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO TUITION. MIKE: WE HAVE A $19 TRILLION DEBT. WE HAVE AN AGING DEMOGRAPHIC. HOW DO WE PAY FOR FREE COLLEGE? MR. FEINGOLD: I HAVE OSCAR DAY FISCAL PLAN. -- I HAVE OFFERED A FISCAL PLAN. SENATOR JOHNSON DOESN'T DO THIS SORT OF THING. WHAT HE DOES IS TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH THE DEBT IS GOING TO BE IN 30 YEARS. I HAVE OFFERED A SPECIFIC LAND THAT'S ALL ABOUT CLOSING THE KIND OF CORPORATE LOOPHOLES HE HAS VOTED F, CUTTING SPENDING, NEGOTIATING PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES. THE JOB OF A SENATOR IS TO SAY OK, THIS IS HOW WE SHOULD PAY FOR IT. I HAVE DONE THE WORK OF PROPOSING WHAT WE WOULD DO. HE HAS NOT. MIKE: COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE STUDENT DEBT QUESTION FIRST? MR. JOHNSON: IT' ALL ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. SENATOR FEINGOLD HAS NOT SPOKEN ABOUT WHY COLLEGES SO UNAFFORDABLE. HE GETS 100 $15,000 TO LECTURE AT STANFORD. WHEN A COLLEGE HAS TO PAY THAT MUCH FOR A LECTURE, YOU UNDERSTAND WHY TUITION GETS HIGH. WHAT IS SO DIFFERENT IN THE EDUCATION STUDENTS NEED TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ON? THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POURED MONEY INTO HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR EVERY DOLLAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POURED INTO LOANS AND GRANTS, TO WISH AND INCREASED -- TUITION INCREASED BY $.65. DO THE MATH. IT HAPPENS TO BE THE AMOUNT OF STUDENT DEBT OUTSTANDING. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD THE BEST OF INTENTIONS. INSTEAD OF MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE, THEY MADE IT LESS ACCESSIBLE. THE SOLUTION IS TO DRIVE COMPETITION AND PRODUCTIVITY. MIKE: WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? MR. JOHNSON: OUR UNIVERSITIES AND K-12 ARE STILL BASED ON A 19TH-CENTURY MODEL. WE HAVE AN EXPLOSION IN TECHNOLOGY, AND WE SIMPLY DON'T UTILIZE IT. I WAS A VOLUNTEER IN EDUCATION IN OSHKOSH. WE DID THE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE INITIATIVE. HOW DO YOU TEACH MORE, DEBTOR, EASIER? I TYPED IN EDUCATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY. I DID NOT MISSPELL IT. I GOT ZERO RESULTS. WE NEED TO DRIVE THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY INTO HIGHER EDUCATION. MOVE AWAY FROM A DEGREE MODEL TO A CERTIFICATION MODEL. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. I DON'T CARE HOW YOU GOT EDUCATED TO PASS THE CERTIFIED COUNTY TEST. IT'S NOT EASY -- CERTIFIED ACCOUNTING TEST. IT'S NOT AN EASY TEST. IF YOU CAN PASS IT, YOU SHOULD BE CERTIFIED. THERE IS A BUNCH OF INNOVATION. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HIGHER EDUCATION ECONOM CARTEL, WE ARE NOT SEEING THOSE TYPES OF ADVANCES IN PRODUCTIVITY IN EDUCATION, WHICH IS WHY COLLEGE IS SO UNAFFORDABLE. AND I WOULD REMIND YOU, $8,000 PER LECTURE -- MIKE WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. SENATOR JOHNSON SUGGESTED WE GET RID OF PROFESSORS AND LECTURERS, PUT IN KEN BURNS TAPES, AND HAVE PROCTORS POKE PEOPLE. HE IS REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I TAUGHT AT THIS WONDERFUL LAW SCHOOL FOR A YEAR AND WAS PAID IN THE SAME WAY. HE IS DEMEANING THE WORK OF THIS WONDERFUL FACULTY THAT I HAD A CHANCE TO BE A PART OF. PROFESSORS ARE NOT PAID BY CLASS TIME ALONE, BUT THAT'S THE GAME HE'S PLAYING. IT'S NOT HONEST. LET ME FINISH, PLEASE. THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN WAUSAU, AND I HAD A CHANCE TO DO A PRESS CONFERENCE ON MY IDEAS ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY, A AFTERWARD , A YOUN MAN WALKED UP TO ME NAME KURT ALESHIN WHO SAID YOU TAUGHT ME RIGHT HERE A MARQUETTE AND I NOW HAVE MY OWN LAW FIRM RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM CITY HALL. THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING, TEACHING. SENATOR JOHNSON DEMEANS HIGHER EDUCATION. HE DEMEANS THE PROFESSORS. HE IS PRETENDING THAT WHAT THEY DO ISN'T REAL WORK, AND I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. MR. JOHNSON: THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH MINUTES IN THIS DEBATE FOR ME TO REFUTE ALL THE FALSE CHARGES AND ATTACKS OF SENATOR FEINGOLD. THE KEN BURNS TAPE I WAS USING AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE INITIATIVE IN HIGH SCHOOL. I SAID TEACHERS SHOULD USE THE EXCELLENT DOCUMENTARY, TECHNOLOGY, AS A BEST PRACTICE FOR TEACHING ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR. IT'S ABOUT USING A BUSINESS PERSON'S APPROACH. INNOVATE. PRODUCTIVITY GAINS. UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY TO LOWER THE COST. THAT IS WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I HAD TO COMPETE IN THE MARVEL WE CALL THE FREE MARKET. BECAUSE I HAD TO COMPETE, MY PRICES WERE LOWER IN MY QUALITY WAS HIGHER. WOULD WE LOVE TO HAVE THAT IN HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION? WE HAVE DRIVEN FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES OUT OF OUR ECONOMY. MORE GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THOSE THINGS WON'T WORK. I AM TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT WILL WORK. MIKE: YOU BROUGHT UP HEALTH CARE. I WILL BEGIN WITH MR. FEINGOLD. WE TALKED ABOUT HEALTH CARE A FAIR AMOUNT SIX YEARS AGO. WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT TODAY. YOU ARE A STRONG DEFENDER OF YOUR VOTE FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. A LOT OF CRITICISM HAS COME FROM DEMOCRATS. FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON SAYS I LIKE THE IDEA, BUT THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING. PEOPLE WHO ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OR DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES ARE GETTING KILLED BY RISING PREMIUMS. THE GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA SAID THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE. WOULD YOU CONCEDE IT HAS NOT WORKED EXACTLY AS YOU HAVE ENVISIONED? MR. FEINGOLD: I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY HAS HEALTH CARE THAT IS THE GOAL. THAT IS THE THING I MOST HEARD WHEN I WAS A UNITED STATES SENATOR AT TOWN HALL MEETINGS. THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE REQUEST. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID SOME IMPORTANT THINGS WE DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP. SENATOR JOHNSON WANTS TO COMPLETELY REPEAL IT. IF HE HAD HIS WAY, THE 20 MILLION PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT COVERED BEFOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WOULD NO LONGER BE COVERED. BY T WAY, NOT HAVING PEOPLE COME IN SICK OR IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO SAVE MONEY IN THE SYSTEM. IF WE REPEAL IT, WE WILL ONCE AGAIN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE C BE DENIED INSURANCE BASED ON A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. THAT MEANS CANCER, HEART DISEASE, OTHER CONDITIONS. PEOPLE WHO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAY ON THEIR PARENTS PLAN. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE SUCCESSES. BUT WE HAVE TO WORK ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER. THERE IS A FAMILY GLITCH WHERE THE EVALUATION OF ELIGIBILITY IS BASED ON AN INDIVIDUAL INSTEAD OF A FAMILY. WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE CADILLAC TAX. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE, AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT DEDUCTIBLES. THAT IS THE GREATEST COMPLAINT I HAVE HEARD. SENATOR JOHNSON WANTS TO GO BACK SIX YEARS, GET RID OF THE WHOLE THING, AND START OVER. THAT WON'T WORK. IT'S TIME TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE. MR. JOHNSO HE HAS SPOKEN A LONG TIME ON THE SUBJECT. MIKE: AND I WILL GIVE YOU PLENTY OF TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE OTHER NIGHT YOU REFERRED TO OBAMA CARE AS A MASSIVE CONSUMER FRAUD. MY QUESTION IS, IS THERE VALUE IN HAVING 20 MILLION PEOPLE INSURED TODAY WHO WERE NOT INSURED BEFORE? MR. JOHNSON: BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS IMPLEMENTED, 90 4% OF WISCONSINITES WERE INSURED. NOW IT'S 95%. IT HAS BEEN A DISASTER. IN THE AUDIENCE IS A YOUNG MOM WHO HAD TO QUIT HER PART-TIME JOB AND LEAVE HER KIDS AND GET A FULL-TIME JOB BECAUSE HER PREMIUMS WENT FROM $500 A MONTH TO $1200 A MONTH. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS NAME. THERE WERE PROMISES MADE. THERE IS NOTHING THAT WILL FORCE YOU OFF THE INSURANCE YOU LIKE. HE SAID PREMIUMS WOULD BE REDUCED. PRODUCED -- REDUCED BY UP TO $2500 A YEAR. IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP IT. NONE OF THOSE THINGS WORKED OUT. THOUSANDS OF WISCONSINITES LOST HEALTH CARE PLANS THEY COULD AFFORD. SENATOR FEINGOLD SAID HE KNEW WHAT WAS IN IT. HE SHOULD HAVE KNO THAT OBAMACARE ELIMINATED HIGH RISKS. THAT'S 20,000 WISCONSINITES RIGHT THERE. IT WAS A MASSIVE CONSUMER FRAUD. THE MANHATTAN INSTITUTE DID A STUDY. THE LOWEST COST INCREASE IS FROM ONE POINT EIGHT TIMES. IN OTHER WORDS, IF THEY WERE PAYING $1000, NOW THEY ARE PAYING $1800. THE HIGHEST $3000 -- 3%. I WOULD WORK TOWARD FREE MARKET REFORMS, PATIENT CENTERED, PUTTING PATIENTS BACK IN CHARGE, GIVING THEM THE FREEDOM AND THE CHOICE TO CHOOSE A HEALTH CAR PLAN INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE IMPOSED ON THE THROUGH THIS COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE SYSTEM THAT IS IN ITS DEATH SPIRAL. MR. FEINGOLD THE REAL PROBLEM IS TO PRETEND THAT THERE WASN'T A PROBLEM WITH PREMIUMS AND TO DR. BOWLS BEFORE THE HEALTH OF CARE -- PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES BEFORE THE HEALTH CARE ACT. THE IDEA THAT THIS STARTED IN 2011 IS RIDICULOUS, AND HE KNOWS IT. THE FACT IS, IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BROADEN COVERAGE, WHICH WOULD BE BETTER FROM -- FOR EVERYBODY. HE WON'T RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE BY AN. HE WON'T HELP OUT WITH STUDENT LOANS. HE THINKS 200 THOUSAND WISCONSINITES GETTING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IS JUST A LITTLE BIT. IT'S NOT LITTLE TO THEM. YOU JUST DISMISS IT AS IF IT'S NOTHING. IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. MR. JOHNSON: WE COULD HAVE EASILY COVER THOSE PEOPLE WITHOUT HAVING TO COMPLETELY REMAKE OUR INSURANCE MARKET. IT HAS BEEN A DISASTER. ON YOUR SHOW, SENATOR FEINGOLD SAID THE HEALTH CARE LAW IS NOT AS BAD AS SOME PEOPLE ARE PRETENDING IT WAS. TRUST ME, SHE IS NOT ATTENDING. PEOPLE WHOSE PREMIUMS WENT FROM $200 A MONTH TO $600 A MONTH ARE NOT PRETENDING. THE COUPLE WITH CANCER WHO LOST INSURANCE ON A HIGH RISK PLAN CALLED ME IN A PANIC BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT LOG ON TO THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE. COULDN'T EVEN SET UP A WEBSITE. SPENT ABOUT HALF $1 BILLION TRYING TO DO IT. PANICKED AND STRESSED. WITH CANCER, THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING. YOU BET, I WOULD REPEAL IT IN A HEARTBEAT. INTERJECT FREE-MARKET DISCIPLINES, HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, ALLOW STATES TO REGULATE AND A FINE INSURANCE, ALLOW PEOPLE TO PURCHASE INSURANCE ACROSS STATE LINES. -- AND DEFINE INSURANCE, ALLOW PEOPLE TO PURCHASE INSURANCE ACROSS STATE LINES. WE DID NOT HAVE TO SPEND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THIS ROUTE GOLDBERG SCHEME THAT IS A COMPLETE DISASTER AND HARMING REAL PEOPLE. -- RUBE GOLDBERG SCHEME THAT IS A COMPLETE DISASTER AND HARMING REAL PEOPLE. MR. FEINGOLD: HE JUST SAID HE WOULD REPEAL IT. HE WOULD ELIMINATE PROVISIONS THAT SAY YOU CANNOT BE DENIED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE BASED ON A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. THAT WILL STRESS OUT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE. MIKE I WANT TO ASK YOU WHAT HAS BECOME A BIG ISSUE IN THIS RACE AND THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST. AND I WANT TO ASK IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP ACT. THIS IS SOMETHING PRESIDENT OBAMA FAVORS. HE THINKS IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. WHEN YOU ANNOUNCED YOUR CANDIDACY, YOU SAID RIGHT OFF THE BAT, THIS IS A LONG, COMPLEX AGREEMENT. YOU SAID RIGHT OFF THE B, I AM AGAINST IT. WHY? MR. FEINGOLD THESE AGREEMENTS ALL HAVE A COMMON CHARACTERISTIC. THEY ARE CORPORATE HANDSHAKES. THESE ARE NOT LEGITIMATE DEALS BETWEE COUNTRIES, WORKERS, AND OTHERS THEY CLAIM TO REPRESENT. THEY ARE DONE IN SECRET AND THEY ALWAYS BENEFIT THE BIG CORPORATIONS. NAFTA HAS COST WISCONSIN 75 THOUSAND JOBS. THAT'S CERTIFIED BY THE GOVERNMENT. WE ARE CERTIFIED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE LOST THOSE JOBS BECAUSE OF THE TRADE. THERE ARE OTHERS AFFECTED BY WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED, BUT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO TRADE. TPP, THERE WAS TONS OF PUBLICITY ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS. THERE WERE PROTESTS AROUND THE WORLD. I COULD SEE WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS WAS THE SAME KIND OF THING. MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH LOWER WAGES WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE WORKERS A FAIR PRICE OR FOLLOW ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. SENATOR JOHNSON HAS REFUSED TO EVEN TELL HIS POSITION ON IT. THINK ABOUT THAT. HE IS A SENATOR OF THIS STATE WHO HAS HAD ACCESS TO IT SINCE LAST DECEMBER AND HE SAYS IT'S REALLY CAN'T LOCATED. I CAN'T COME UP -- REALLY CAN'T HATED, -- REALLY COMPLICATED , AND I CAN'T COME UP WITH A DECISION UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. MR. JOHNSON: UNLIKE SENATOR FEINGOLD, I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO TRADING AND EXPORTING. I EXPORT TO 25 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. I ALWAYS MAKE A DECISION BASED ON WHAT IS BEST FOR WISCONSIN WORKERS. IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP OVERSEAS MARKETS OPEN TO OUR MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS. YOU'RE RIGHT, SENATOR FEINGOLD, KNEE-JERK REACTION, SAID NO. I WENT THROUGH THE HARD WORK OF LISTENING TO PEOPLE. HE IS NOT LISTENING TO ANYONE. I WENT THROUGH THE COMPL 6000 PAGES AND LOOKED AT HOW IT WILL AFFECT A COMPLEX BUSINESS. THE FA IS, PAUL RYAN HAS SERIOUS RESERVATIONS. IT WILL PROBABLY NEVER COME UP FOR A VOTE. I AM HAPPY TO LET THE NEXT PRESIDENT NEGOTIATE A FAIR TRADE DEAL. I ALSO UNDERSTAND IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF WISCONSIN WORKERS TO KEEP THOSE MARKETS OPEN. TO DO THAT, YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS. I WILL INSIST ON FAIR TRADE DEALS. DONALD TRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY RIG WE HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. I AM HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. MIKE SENATOR JOHNSON HAS CALLED THESE DEALS CREATIVE DESTRUCTION. THAT'S THE FIRST WE HAVE HEARD OF ADMITTING THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED. MR. JOHNSO OTHER SENATORS AROUND THE COUNTRY, PEOPLE LIKE -- MR. FEINGOLD: OTHER SENATORS AROUND THE COUNTRY, PEOPLE LIKE ROB PORTMAN, HAVE COME OUT AGAINST THE DEAL. SENATOR JOHNSON IS HIDING. HE WILL NOT TELL WHERE HE STANDS. IT'S A GAME. A POLITICAL GAME. MIKE: FINAL WORD. MR. JOHNSO WE HAVE TO KEEP THESE OVERSEAS MARKETS TOGETHER. ONE THING I DO AND HAVE DONE REPEATEDLY IS BRING I THE UNIONS, BRING IN THE INTERESTS, AND FIND OUT WHERE IT IS. BUT AGAIN, WE ARE A LONG WAYS FROM THAT. I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A SNAP JUDGMENT BASED ON A 60 PAGE WIKILEAKS VERSION OF THIS THING. HOW CLOSED MINDED IS THAT? HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. HE BARELY UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT OVERSEAS MARKETS ARE TO THE ECONOMY OF WISCONSIN. MIKE: I WANT TO SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES ON THE SUPREME COURT. THERE ARE ESTIMATES OF AS MANY AS THREE APPOINTMENTS TO THE NEXT COURT. ARE THERE CERTAIN THINGS YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE OR CANNOT HAVE IN A NEW JUSTICE? MR. JOHNSON: I WILL ONLY VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGES, NOT LIBERAL ACTIVISTS OR SUPER LEGISLATORS WHO DON'T HAVE THE FIDELITY AND INTEGRITY TO THE WRITTEN LAW AND CONSTITUTION, PEOPLE LIKE SCULLY A. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS ELECTION IS -- SCALIA. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS ELECTION IS FOR ALL THE MARBLES. IT'S FOR THE SUPREME COURT. IT'S FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT. YOU HAVE JUSTICE GINSBURG CROWING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY HAS BEEN LOST. SHE CANNOT WAIT. AND THE LIBERAL WING AND SENATOR FEINBERG VOTED FOR THESE JUDGES . THEY CANNOT WAIT TO OVERTURN THE HELLER DECISION. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF RELIGION. THESE FREEDOMS ARE UNDER ASSAULT. I WILL ONLY VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGES, PEOPLE WHO HAVE FIDELITY TO THE LAW LIKE JUSTICE SCALIA HAD. EVEN IN THE FLAGBURNING CASE, WHERE HE WAS OFFENDED BY THE RESULT, HE REALIZED THE FIRST AMENDMENT TRUMPS HIS DESIRE FOR A CERTAIN RESULT. THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS ON THE LIBERAL WING, THE SUPER LEGISLATIVE WING OF THE COURT. MR. FEINGOLD: IT'S AMAZING THAT SENATOR JOHNSON WOULD ANSWER IN THAT WAY, WHEN HE HAS BEEN A KEY PART OF DENYING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HIS ROLE IN THE CONSTITUTION TO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT CONSIDERED. AND I DID TEACH A COURSE HERE AT MARQUETTE, AS YOU KNOW. IT WAS ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE SENATE IN THE CONSTITUTION. THE STUDENTS WER REAL GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T GIVE THE PRESIDENT AND THE SENATE THE OPTION TO DEAL WITH SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. IT SAYS THE SENATE SHALL ADVISE AND CONSENT. THE PRESIDENT SHALL NOMINATE. THE SENATE SHALL ADVISE AND CONSENT. SENATOR JOHNSON HAS REFUSED TO DO HIS JOB. JUST LIK THE TRADE DEAL. HE WON'T TELL US WHERE HE STANDS. HE SAID I WILL MEET WITH THE GUY, BUT I WON'T CONSIDER HIM. HE ALSO SAI IF MITT ROMNEY HAD RUN FOR REELECTION, IT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT STORY. HE'S PRETENDIN IT'S ABOUT THE NEXT ELECTION, BUT THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT CREATE A THREE YEAR FOR THE PRESIDENT. IT'S A FOUR-YEAR TERM. HE HAS BROKEN THE RECORD FOR NOT VOTI ON A NOMINEE. AND THE IDEA THAT I WOULD NOT VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE REPUBLICANS WOULD WANT? WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, I DID THE OPPOSITE. PRESIDENT BUSH HAD TWO NOMINATIONS TO THE SUPREME COURT. I MET WITH HIM FOR AN HOUR EACH, AND I MADE MY JUDGMENT. I VOTED AGAINST 1 -- AND BY THE WAY, I VOTED FOR CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS VOTED ON THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS DECISION THAT I AGREE WITH WITH JUSTICE SCALIA. YOUR STATEMENT ON THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE. I THINK JUSTICE SCALIA OH WOULD BE HORRIFIED TO SEE THE UNITED STATES SENATE DOING THIS TERRIBLE DAMAGE TO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS IN OUR COUNTRY. MIKE CONSTITUTIONALLY, ARE THEY REQUIRED TO HOLD HEARINGS OR TAKE A VOTE? MR. FEINGOLD THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THEY SHALL ADVISE AND CONSENT. IF THEY DO NOT -- THIS IS THE MOST EXTREME POLITICIZATION THAT HAS EVER OCCURRED. THE LONGEST WAS 120 FIVE DAYS. THEY ARE, OF COURSE, REQUIRED TO TAKE ACTION OF SOME KIND. ALL THEY HAVE DONE IS DENY THE PRESIDENT THE ABILITY TO HAVE A NOMINEE CONSIDERED. MR. JOHNSON: THERE ARE TWO POLITICAL I BRANCHE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. THE PRESIDENT HAS THE ROLE TO NOMINATE. OUR ADVICE WAS TO WAIT TO SEE WHO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ELECT. I WOULD NOT HAVE VOTED TO CONFIRM JUSTICE GARLAND BECAUSE I KNOW HE IS HOSTILE TO SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. OUR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IS TO ADVISE PRESIDENT OBAMA NOT TO SEND SOMEBODY DURING SUCH A POLITICIZED ATMOSPHERE. MIKE: IS IT GOOD FOR AMERICA -- I BELIEVE JUSTICE SCALIA PASSED AWAY IN FEBRUARY. THE NOMINATION CAME IN MARCH. IT IS POSSIBLE WE COULD GO ANOTHER NUMBER OF MONTHS. IS THAT A GOOD THING FOR AMERICA? MR. JOHNSON: JUSTICE BREYER, WHO IS PART OF THE LIBERAL WING OF THE COURT, SAYS THE SUPREME COURT IS FINE. IF THEY DEADLOCK FOR-FOUR, THAT SHOWS THE PARTISANSHIP, WHICH IS A REAL PROBLEM. IT'S A SHAME. IF PEOPLE HAVE FIDELITY TO THE LAW, THEY SHOULD BE UNANIMOUS. BUT IF YOU HAVE A SPLIT DECISION, THE APPELLATE COURT RULING STANDS. JUSTICE BREYER SAID THE SUPREME COURT IS OPERATING JUST FINE. THIS IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. I HAVE BEEN DOING MY JOB, PROTECTING WISCONSINITES SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS BECAUSE JUSTICE GARLAND WOULD DEFINITELY FLIP THE COURT TO HAVE A 5-4 LIBERAL ACTIVIST COURT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DEFINITELY DOES THREATEN YOUR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES, FREEDOMS, AND SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. MR. JOHNSON: HAVIN SOMEBODY -- MR. FEINGOLD: HAVING SOME BUT HE DECIDED IN ADVANCE WHAT JUDGE GARLAND'S VIEWS WOULD BE WITHOUT EVEN GIVING HIM THE HEARING, NOT EVEN DOING THE SIMPLE JOB OF HAVING HIM COME BEFORE THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE AND HAVE A HEARING, JUSTICE GARLAND I A WELL-RESPECTED JUDGE MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE VOTED FOR IN THE PAST. BUT SENATOR JOHNSON IS VOTING BASED ON IDEOLOGY INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE CONSTITUTION. THE CONSTITUTION CLEARLY SHOWS HE SHOULD DO HIS JOB. HE SAT ON HIS HANDS ALONG WITH OTHERS. MAYBE HE WILL BE FIVE WHEN WE GO TO SEVEN JUSTICES, MAYBE -- MAYBE HE WILL BE FINE WHEN WE GO TO SEVEN JUSTICES, MAYBE FIVE, MAYBE ONE. AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS DEMOCRATS WILL DO IT AS WELL. AND IT WILL DESTROY THE SUPREME COURT. I THINK YOU SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM OFFICE ON THESE GROUNDS ALONE. MR. JOHNSON: I AM DOING MY CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF ADVISE AND CONSENT. AT THIS TIME, I AM WITHHOLDING MY CONSENT. DONALD TRUMP HAS PROVIDED A LIST OF JUDGES. IT COULD GO THE OTHER WAY. I CANNOT THINK OF A MORE FAIR PROCESS FROM THAT STANDPOINT. MR. FEINGOLD: IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IF HILLARY CLINTON'S PRESIDENT, HE WILL DO THE SAME THING. BECAUSE HE DOES NOT HAVE REGARD FOR HER AS PRESIDENT. MR. JOHNSON: TOTALLY DIFFERENT SITUATION AT THAT POINT IN TIME. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN. MIKE: I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ON FOREIGN POLICY AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH ISIS RIGHT NOW. THIS IS A FAIRLY IMPORTANT MOMENT. IRAQI FORCES ARE TRYING TO RETAKE THE CITY OF MOST ALL. -- M OSUL. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE ALL TALKED ABOUT THE PROPER ROLE FOR THE U.S. IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH ISIS, AND I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ON THAT TONIGHT. MR. FEINGOLD, LET ME BEGIN WITH YOU ON THIS. WHAT IS THE PROPER ROLE AT THIS TIME -- ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO DEFEAT ISIS AND TO ASSIST IRAQI TROOPS OR COALITION FORCES? MR. FEINGOLD: THIS ORGANIZATION IS THE MOST DISGUSTING ORGANIZATION AND HAS TO BE DESTROYED, THERE IS NO QUESTION. I FEEL STRONGLY THAT MORE HAS TO BE DONE. THAT IS WHY HAVE I -- WHY I HAVE BEEN SPECIFIC, AS YOU KNOW. SOME PROGRESS IS BEING MADE, BUT IT NEEDS TO INCREASE. WE NEED TO HAVE SPECIAL OPERATIONS GREATLY INCREASED. IT HAS TO BE ACCELERATED. I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE ACCELERATED SOON. AND THE ONLY WAY IT'S GOING TO WORK AS IF WE HAVE GREATER HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, SPIES, ON THE GROUND IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA AND IRAQ, SO WE CAN IDENTIFY WHERE PEOPLE ARE. WE NEED TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN CUTTING OFF THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE A STATE OR CALIPHATE. THAT MEANS CUTTING OFF OIL SUPPLY. WE NEED TO CUT OFF THEIR FINANCES. I WORKED ON T INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE FOR FIVE YEARS AND WITH THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT ABOUT WAYS WE COULD DO THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T GET ARMS ACROSS THE TURKISH BORDER. THERE HAS BEEN SOME PROGRESS. THE BORDER HAS BEEN CLOSED, AS YOU INDICATED. WE HAVE TO MAK SURE WE DO ALL OF THE THINGS. AND BY THE WAY, WE NEED TO STOP LETTING SAUDI ARABIA SAY THEY ARE OUR FRIEND ON ONE HAND, AND ON THE OTHER HAND EXPORT AN IDEOLOGY THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO BELIEVE AMERICANS ARE EVIL AND SHOULD BE KILLED. SENATOR JOHNSON HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE FOR A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD CAUSE THE SAUDIS TO HAVE TO THINK TWICE ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING, AND HE VOTED NO. IT WAS A BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION, AND HE VOTED NO. SENATOR JOHNSON HAS NO PLAN. MIKE: WE WILL FIND OUT IF HE HAS A PLAN OR NOT. MR. JOHNSON: PRESIDENT OBAMA LAID OUT AMERICA'S GOAL TOWARD ISIS OVER TWO YEARS AGO. TO DEFEAT IT. SENATOR FEINGOLD'S PLAN IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN. IT'S NOT WORKING. IT'S NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE TO ADEQUATE ENOUGH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST TAKE MY WORD. LISTEN TO THE CIA DIRECTOR. HE SAID ALL OF OUR EFFORTS HAVE NOT REDUCED ISIS'S CAPABILITIES. THEY REMAIN A FORMAL, RESILIENT, AND LARGELY INTACT ENEMY. A MAN RIGHT HERE IN MILWAUKEE PLOTTED MURDER. ISIS IS A GROWING, EVOLVING, AND FROM MY STANDPOINT, A MORE DANGEROUS THREAT THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN, AND WE ARE NOT ADDRESSING IT. IN HIS PLAN ARE ELEMENTS OF THINGS HE VOTED AGAINST DURING HIS 18 YEARS IN THE SENATE. FIVE YEARS, THE AUTHORIZATION TO FUND OUR MILITARY WERE PASSED BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT. HE ONLY TWICE VOTED TO FUND THE MILITARY. HE VOTED AGAINST SOLDIERS THE TOOL THEY NEED TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. HE HAS A PHONY RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO THESE PLANS AND HIS SUPPORT OF THEIR ELEMENTS. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE HAVE TO LEAD. WE ARE FOLLOWING OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY SO WE CAN STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY. AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS VOID IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SENATOR FEINGOLD HAVE A PLAN CALLED PEACE THROUGH WITHDRAWAL. HE WAS THE FIRST SENATOR TO CALL FOR THE STRATEGIC BLUNDER OF WITHDRAWING AMERICAN TROOPS FROM IRAQ. WHEN WE LEFT A STABILIZING FORCE BEHIND IN GERMANY, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, THOSE WER SUCCESSES. WE SHOULD HAV DONE THAT IN IRAQ. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T, ISIS WAS ABLE TO RISE FROM THE ASHES OF AL QAEDA IN IRAQ. WE HAVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY. WE HAVE TO LEAD A WILLING COALITION. MIKE DO WE NEED AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD TO DEFEAT ISIS? MR. JOHNSON: WE HAVE 6000 TROOPS THERE NOW. THAT'S THE ESTIMATE. THOSE TROOPS WOULD NOT BE IN HARM'S WAY HAD WE LEFT A STABILIZING FORCE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE AIR COVER AND GET IT RIGHT. I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS EASY. IF WE LEAD TO MUCH, EVERYBODY SITS BACK, AND THEY DON'T JOIN THE COALITION. IF WE SIT BACK, IT ALLOWS ISIS. TWO YEARS HAS ALLOWED ISIS TO TRAIN ADDITIONAL OPERATIVES. LITTLE CHILDREN TO BECOME SAVAGES AND BARBARIANS. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN BY ALLOWING ISIS TO EXIST FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. THE PLANT SENATOR FEINGOLD SUPPORTS IS NOT GOING TO DO THE JOB. MR. FEINGOLD: YOU ASKED HIM TO GIVE HIS PLAN. HE HAS NO PLAN. OTHER THAN SENDING 100,000 TROOPS. COALITION TROOPS. HE SAID 100,000. HE ALSO SAID 25,000 AMERICANS AT ONE TIME. HE'S SAID 10,000. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. AND THAT'S THE SAME MISTAKE WE MADE WHEN WE WENT INTO IRAQ. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT ISIS WANTS. MIKE: CAN YOU BEAT ISIS WITH AIRSTRIKES? MR. FEINGOLD: NOT ALONE. THAT'S WHY I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU THE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. BY THE WAY, THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS. TONIGHT, OUR BRAVE PEOPLE IN IRAQ ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES. SENATOR JOHNSON MINIMIZES IT IS NOTHING. THEY ARE MAKING ENORMOUS PROGRESS. THEY NEED TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS. HE THINKS WE SHOULD SEND A FORCE THERE FOR A GENERATION. THAT IS THE WORST POSSIBLE IDEA. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT ISIS WANTS. HE HAS NOT LEARNED THE LESSON OF THE MISTAKE OF IRAQ, THAT WAS A MISTAKE. ISIS WAS CREATED BECAUSE WE WENT INTO IRAQ, NOT BECAUSE WE LEFT. MR. JOHNSON: I SENT THE STRUGGLE OF ISLAMIC TERRORISM IS A GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE -- I SAID THE STRUGGLE OF ISLAMIC TERRORISM IS A GENERATIONAL STRUGGLE, AND THAT IS TRUE. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. BUT WE HAVE TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO SUCCESS. SENATOR FEINGOLD HAS AN EVEN TOUCHED ON HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. THE WAY YOU DO HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS TO CAPTURE UNLAWFUL COMBATANTS AND PUT THEM IN GUANTANAMO. HE WANTS TO CLOSE DOWN GUANTANAMO. SO WE DON'T GATHER HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS. THE LONGER WE DELAY, THE LONGER THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN. LET ME REMIND YOU, TOO MILWAUKEE END NS WERE ARRESTED IN TEXAS TRYING TO GET TO SYRIA. MR. FEINGOLD: THE CHAIR OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY AGENCY HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE FBI BUDGET TO GET MORE AGENTS OUT THERE. HE HASN'T ACTED ON THAT. THEY NEED RESOURCES TO DO INVESTIGATIONS. HE HAS NOT ACTED IN THE WAY HE CAN. THE SAME THING GOES FOR THE INTELLIGENCE BUDGET, WHICH NEEDS TO BE INCREASED AS WELL. MR. JOHNSO WE ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR MORE FUNDING TO DEFEND THIS NATION AND THE HOMELAND. DEMOCRATS HAVE HELD UP A DEFENSE APPROPRIATION BILL BECAUSE THEY HOLD IT HOSTAGE FOR ALL OF THE DOMESTIC PROGRAMS THAT SIMPLY DON'T WORK. THAT H BEEN OUR CONUNDRUM. WE HAVE A DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY. THE FACT O THE MATTER IS, I AM FOR PRIORITIZING SPENDING TO THE TOP PRIORITIES OF GOVERNMENT. DEMOCRATS WANT TO SPEND MORE ON DOMESTIC PROGRAMS THAT IN MANY CASES DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. MIKE: I WANT TO ASK EACH OF YOU ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN SYRIA. THIS IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION. WE HAVE ALL SEEN THESE HORRIBLE IMAGES FROM ALEPPO. HERE IS MY QUESTION. HILLARY CLINTON HAS TALKED ABOUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SYRIAN REFUGEES ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTRY FROM 10,000-65,000. DO YOU FAVOR THAT? MR. JOHNSON: I THINK WE HAVE TO PLAY -- MR. FEINGOLD: I THINK WE HAVE TO PLAY A ROLE IN ALLOWING REFUGEES INTO OUR COUNTRY, BUT THE SCRUTINY HAS TO BE SERIOUS. WITH REGARD TO SYRIA ITSELF, THE HUMAN TRAGEDY THERE, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WITH RUSSIA IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. SENATOR JOHNSON HAS NOT PROVIDED LEADERSHIP ON THIS, AND THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO. I HAVE FELT FOR MANY YEARS THAT THE MODERATE GROUPS, THE REBELS, SHOULD BEGIN IN SOME ARMS. WE CAN BE RESTRAINED ABOUT HOW WE DO IT, BUT THEY CAN HAVE THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN -- SHOULD BE GIVEN SOME ARMS. WE CAN BE RESTRAINED ABOUT HOW WE DO IT. MIKE: DO YOU SUPPORT 65,000 SYRIAN REFUGEES? MR. FEINGOLD: I AM NOT INTERESTED IN A NUMBER. I AM INTERESTED IN PROPER SCRUTINY AND MAKING SURE WE KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE BEFORE THEY GET HERE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO FIGURE IT OUT AFTER THE FACT. MIKE YOU SAID ON MY SHOW THAT THE SCREENING PROCESS IS ROBUST. MR. JOHNSON: IT IS. AND AGAIN, THE EVENTS IN SYRIA WOULD NOT HAVE SPUN OUT OF CONTROL HAD WE NOT DONE THIS STRATEGIC BLUNDER OF LEAVING IRAQ. WE WOULD NOT HAVE SEE THE SLAUGHTER OF HALF A MILLION SYRIANS HAD WE NOT BUGGED OUT. THAT'S BAD JUDGMENT. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING, RATHER THAN TALKING ABOUT REFUGEES, IS STOP THE REFUGEE FLOW. LET'S PROVIDE SAFE ZONES, NO-FLY ZONES. LET'S ACTUALLY LEAD. BY THE WAY, I WAS THE U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TWICE. I MET WITH DELEGATIONS OF ARAB STATES AROUND THE REGION. THEY ARE BEGGING FOR AMERICAN LEADERSHIP. THEY WILL FOLLOW. THEY WILL PROVIDE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO NOT ONLY GAIN TERRITORY BUT HOLD IT. THESE ARE SUNNIS GOING TO THESE REGIONS. IF YOU COMPLETELY CHANGE THE DYNAMICS ON THE GROUND, YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT. UNLESS AMERICA LEADS AND PROVIDES THE AIR COVER AND THE NO-FLY ZONES, SETS U SAFE ZONE -- MR. FEINGOLD: I UNDERSTAND HE HAS GONE T MEETINGS, BUT HE IS IN THE SENATE. SENATORS CAN PROPOSE A NO-FLY ZONE. THEY CAN PROPOSE ARMS FOR THE REBELS. THE FACT IS WHAT SENATOR JOHNSON DOES IS CRITICIZED THE PRESIDENT. THAT WORKS WELL. CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT, BUT DON'T DO YOUR OWN JOB, WHICH IS TO LAY OUT LEGISLATIVELY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. PROVIDE THE PRESIDENT WITH THE AUTHORITY TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS. MAYBE HE WILL USE IT. MAYBE HE WON'T. SENATOR JOHNSON HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS, BUT HE HASN'T ACTED. MR. JOHNSON: WE ARE BEING BLOCKED FROM OFFERING AMENDMENTS TO DO WHAT SENATOR FEINGOLD SUGGESTS. SENATOR HARRY REID, MINORITY LEADER, IS BLOCKING THAT. THE OBSTRUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS FROM THE DEMOCRATS. THAT IS WHY WE ARE LEFT WITH CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS AND MASSIVE SPENDING BILLS. IT'S A TERRIBLE WAY TO ADDRESS GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE TRIED TO BRING APPROPRIATION BILL FORWARD. IT CONTINUES TO BE BLOCKED. BOTTOM LINE, THEY ARE THE OBSTRUCTIONISTS. WE ARE TRYING TO DO THIS. I WANT TO PRIORITIZE SPENDING. FROM MY STANDPOINT, I AM THE GUY IN THIS RACE WHO UNDERSTANDS GOVERNMENT. SENATOR FEINGOLD VOTED 11 TIMES AGAINST AUTHORIZING THE MILITARY. MR. FEINGOLD: I WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT APPROPRIATION. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER HE CAN EVEN INTRODUCE LEGISLATION. HARRY REID CANNOT STOP YOU FROM INTRODUCING A BILL. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN INTRODUCED A BUILT TO DEAL WITH THE SYRIAN SITUATION. EVERYBODY -- INTRODUCED A BILL TO DEAL WITH THE SYRIAN SITUATION. BY THE WAY, FOR T MILITARY APPROPRIATION, I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO VOTED AGAINST IT, SO DID JOHN MCCAIN, BECAUSE IT WAS LOADED WITH PORK AND SPENDING. IF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, WHOSE JOB IS TO REVIEW LEGISLATION, SEES A BILL LOADED WITH PORK AND SPENDING, HE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR IT FOR POLITICAL REASONS. THE IDEA THAT HE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR IT NO MATTER WHAT IS PURELY POLITICAL. MR. JOHNSO WHEN OUR MEN AND WOMEN ARE HARM'S WAY, YOU BET I GOING TO AUTHORIZE THE MILITARY. MIKE: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A LAN. THE TWO OF YOU HAVE VERY DIFFERENT DEALS -- ABOUT IRAN . THE TWO IF YOU HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE DEAL THAT WAS MADE. IT WAS DESIGNED TO STOP THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN EXCHANGE FOR THE LISTING -- LIFTING OF SANCTIONS. SENATOR JOHNSON, YOU THINK THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE. MR. JOHNSON: DISASTER. IT WAS DESIGNED TO MODIFY IRAN'S BEHAVIOR FOR THE B TTER. IT HAS MADE IT WORSE. IT IS CRAZY TO ENTER INTO A DEAL THAT INJECTS 1 MILLION DOLLARS PLUS INTO THE ECONOMY OF THE SELF-PROCLAIMED ENEMY OF AMERICA . THEY HAVE INCREASED MISSILE TESTS. WE CAN'T EVEN INSPECT. THAT WAS A TREATY. MY AMENDMENT WOULD HAVE DEEMED IT A TREATY SO THAT THE UNITED STATES SENATE WOULD STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND SAID YES OR NO ON A TREATY. HAD EVERY SENATOR UPHELD THEIR OLD OF OFFICE ON MY AMENDMENT , THERE -- UPHELD THEIR OATH OF OFFICE ON MY AMENDMENT, IT WOULD'VE PASSED 100-0. I DIDN'T EVEN GET 40 VOTES. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT IS A DISASTROUS DEAL THAT HAS EMBOLDENED OUR ENEMY. WE SHOULD HAVE RATCHETED UP SANCTIONS. WE SHOULD'VE BROUGHT THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. WE SHOULD'VE DISMANTLED FOR ALL TIME THE NUCLEAR WEAPON PROGRAM INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THEM IN 10 YEARS TO BE FULL FORCE, SPINNING, WEAPONIZE THIN ING. IT'S A DISASTROUS DEAL. MR. FEINGOLD: THERE'S NOTHING MORE POOR AND THEN MAKING SURE IRAN DOES NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. -- MORE IMPORTANT THEN MAKING SURE IRAN DOES NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THAT IS WHAT THIS DEAL WAS ABOUT. I BELIEVE THIS DEAL IS THE BEST CHANCE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IRAN CAN NEVER GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE CANNOT POSSIBLY TOLERATE. SENATOR JOHNSON AGAIN, JUST LIKE ON THE DEFICIT ISSUE AND ISIS, DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN. HE JUST WANTS TO SAY LOOK, LET'S JACK UP THE SANCTIONS. BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC IDEA. IT'S NOT A PLAN. THE REALITY IS, THE SANCTIONS ARE THE THING THAT GOT THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. I BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO WORK. I BELIEVE IRAN WILL NOT GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO FOR THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ISRAEL. AGAIN, YOU CAN BE NEGATIVE AND ATTACK SOMETHING IN A PARTISAN WAY, BUT ACROSS THE BOARD, MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE THIS IS A SUCCESS. IT HAS TO BE PROVEN OV TIME, BUT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. UNDER SENATOR JOHNSON'S ALTERNATIVE, WE WOULD GO TO WAR, INCLUDING HAVING A GENERATIONAL WAR IN IRAQ AT THE SAME TIME. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. MR. JOHNSON: RATCHET UP SANCTIONS AND BRING IRAN TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE IN GOOD FAITH. THE GOAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO DISMANTLE THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM LIKE OMAR GADDA E THEY DID IN LIBYA. I DON'T TRUS PRESIDENT OBAMA TO NEGOTIATE A GOOD DEAL. IT WAS A DISASTER. MIKE: I WANT TO TAKE THE REMAINDER OF OUR TIME TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN, AND THAT IS THE OPIOID AND HEROIN EPIDEMIC IN OUR STATE. YOU CAN TALK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FAMILIES ALL AROUND THE STATE, AND THEY KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM THIS. THEY KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS FOUGHT ADDICTION. THEY KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS DIED FROM THEIR ADDICTION. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE U.S. SENATOR IN DEALING WITH THIS? I WILL BEGIN WITH YOU, MR. FEINGOLD. MR. FEINGOLD: YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S AN EMERGENCY. AND LIKE YOU SAID, IT AFFECTS EVERY COMMUNITY IN THE STATE. POOR, RICH, DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE RESOURCES ARE THERE FOR TREATMENT, TO MAKE SURE DOCTORS ARE TRAINED AND THAT DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE PREVENT IT. MAKING SURE THERE ARE RESOURCES TO GET INTERVENTION WHEN KIDS ARE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL. WE HAVE TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THESE BIG COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN PUSHING THESE PAIN KILLERS HAVE A LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY. THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY HERE AS WELL, SOME OF THESE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. THIS ISN'T OPIUM ADDICTION. THIS IS PEOPLE WHO BEGIN TAKING PAINKILLERS AND THEN GET ADDICTED AND MOVE ON TO OTHER THINGS. WHEN THERE WAS A CHANCE TO VOTE ON THIS, 620 $2 MILLION IN MARCH, SENATOR JOHNSON HAD TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE, AND I GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR RAISING IT, BUT WHEN THERE WAS A BIPARTISAN AMENDMENT, HE VOTED NO. WE NEED RESOURCES TO FIGHT THE CRISIS. IT IS AN EMERGENCY. IT IS AT THAT LEVEL. MR. JOHNSON: WE PROVIDED FUNDING IN A COMPREHENSIVE FACT I SUPPORTED. THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE DISGUSTING AND FALSE ATTACKS SENATOR FEINGOLD HAS LAUNCHED AGAINST ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN. MY NEPHEW DIED OF A FENTANYL OVERDOSE THIS YEAR. WE HAVE HE HEARINGS, MEETINGS, ROUNDTABLES. I HAVE BEEN ACTIVE -- I UNDERSTAND WHAT AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE THIS IS. ALL OF THE WORK ON FIGURING OUT WHY OUR BORDER IS SO POROUS -- IT HAS TO DO WITH OUR DEMAND FOR DRUGS. WE ALLOW ALL THIS HEROIN TO COME IN AND DRAMATICALLY DECREASE THE PRICE OF HEROINE. AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS. MY A , THAT WAS CALLED THE MOST IMPORT PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO AN ACT ON THE SUBJECT, SO IMPORTANT THAT MEDICARE ACTUALLY PICKED UP MY PROP ACT TO IMPLEMENT REGULATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO DO IT, WHAT IT DOES IS, IT NO LONGER ALLOWS MEDICARE TO REIMBURSE BASED ON A SURVEY IN TERMS OF HOW PATIENTS VIEW THEIR PAI MANAGEMENT, WHICH HAS GIVEN INCENTIVES TO DOCTORS TO OVER PRESCRIBED OPIATES, A LEADING GATEWAY DRUG TO HEROIN ADDICTION. I HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY ACTIVE ON THIS. FOR SENATOR FEINGOLD TO ATTACK ME AND SAY I HAVE DONE NOTHING IS COMPLETELY FALSE AND A VERY DISGUSTING FALSE ATTACK. MR. FEINGOLD: I DIDN'T SAY YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING. MIKE A RADIO AD SAID SENATOR JOHNSON HAS ESSENTIALLY DONE NOTHING. MR. FEINGOLD: HE HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE AND HE DIDN'T ACT. AND HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE, WHICH IS PEOPLE BEING ADDICTED TO PAINKILLERS. IT'S ABOUT DRUGS COMI FROM MEXICO. IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE BEING ON PAINKILLERS, BECOMING ADDICTED, AND THEN HAVING A NEED TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM. THIS REQUIRES RESOURCES HE WAS UNWILLING TO VOTE FOR. THAT'S ON HIS RECORD. MR. JOHNSON: THEY ARE NOT THE RESOURCES SENATOR FEINGOLD WOULD WANT. I HAVE YET TO BE IN A SENATE HEARING WHERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMS WHERE THE SOLUTION WASN'T ANOTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. LIKE THE STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM. WE HAVE 38 OF THOSE AND MORE GOVERNMENT FUNDING. QUITE HONESTLY, IT ENCAPSULATES THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS R CE. SENATOR FEINGOLD ALWAYS HAS A PLAN THAT GROWS GOVERNMENT. I AM LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY WORK. I AM LOOKING AT THE REAL PROBLEMS WISCONSIN NIGHTS ARE FACING, THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY, THE SLOW ECONOMY , NONCOMPETITIVE TAXES. I HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY ENGAGED ON THE OPIATE ISSUE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED. AS CHAIRMAN OF HOMELAND SECURITY OVERSIGHT, TO ACCOMPLISH THINGS, WE PASSED 80 THREE PIECES OF LEGISLATION, 28 OF WHICH WERE PASSED INTO LAW. THE PROP ACT WAS ONE. MIKE: YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE POROUS BORDERS, AND THAT THAT WAS PART OF THE PROBLEM, IN YOUR OPINION. WHAT YOU DO ABOUT BORDER SECURITY? DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS TO BUILD A WALL. MR. JOHNSON: WE NEED TO AND INCENTIVES FOR IMMIGRATION, THE NUMBER ONE BEING PEOPLE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY TO WORK. MY SECURITY BILL WOULD HAVE A ROBUST GUESTWORKER PROGRAM WELL GOVERNED BY THE STATES. THEY CAN SET HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE GUESTWORKER PROGRAMS AND SET THE PREVAILING WAGES SO WE DON'T DEPRESS ANY AMERICAN EARNINGS. IT'S A COMMONSENSE APPROACH. ONCE YOU ELIMINATE THE INCENTIVE, YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT FEWER PEOPLE COMING TO THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. IN SO MANY AREAS -- MIKE: DO YOU NEED A WALL? MR. JOHNSO YOU NEED BETTER FENCING. I DON'T THINK WE NEED A 700 MILE WALL. WE NEED TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. AND WE NEED A COMMITMENT. WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. WE HAVE TO COMMIT OURSELV NOT JUST TO FIX THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM, BUT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THREE GRAMS AND HEROIN IN THE 1980'S COST ABOUT $3200. NOW IT'S ABOUT $150. THAT'S A VERY AFFORDABLE ADDICTION. MR. FEINGOLD THERE IS NO REAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE BORDER ISSUE. I VOTED WHEN I WAS IN T SENATE FOR BORDER AGENTS, AND I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE ISSUE IS THE 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. SENATOR JOHNSON HAS USE THE EXCUSE OF ONLY DEALING WITH THE BORDER ISSUE TO DEAL -- TO AVOID DEALING WITH THAT PROBLEM. UP IN GREEN BAY, I MET WITH A GROUP OF LATINOS WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW SCARY IT IS TO TRY TO GO TO WORK AT SOME OF THE COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE. IT'S BAD FOR THEM. IT'S BAD FOR OUR BUSINESS CLIMATE. BUSINESSES IN THIS STATE STRONGLY ONE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. DAIRY FARMS DESPERATELY NEED A LEGAL STATUS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT SENATOR JOHNSON HASN'T LIFTED A FINGER. HE HAS SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL WE CLOSE THE BORDER. YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO 100% CLOSE THE BORDER. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES OF OUR TIME. IT IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE. PRESIDENT BUSH ACTED ON IT. JOHN MCCAIN. EVEN MARCO RUBIO FOR A LITTLE WHILE WAS WORKING ON THIS THING. THAT WHEN HE CAME IN WITH THE TEA PARTY, THEY SHUT IT DOWN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES TO THE ECONO IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN IS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. HE HAS STOOD AGAINST IT AND ONLY TALKED ABOUT THE BORDER. MR. JOHNSON: THE REASON I VOTED AGAINST THAT COMPREHENSIVE BILL IS BECAUSE IT INCLUDED $260 BILLION IN BENEFITS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THAT'S CALLED INCENTIVE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. MY GUESTWORKER PROGRAM WOULD ADDRESS THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, IN WISCONSIN. I HAVE A PRACTICAL SOLUTION AND THE REALITY IS, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE PUBLIC WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT LEGALIZATION. ONCE WE SECURE THE BORDER, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COMMITTING CRIMES, GANGS, IN THE WELFARE SYSTEM, WE WILL TREAT THEM WITH REAL HUMANITY, NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. I HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE BILL. BUT A BILL THAT OFFERS $260 BILLION IN BENEFITS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS -- AND BY THE WAY, WHEN SENATOR FEINGOLD HAD A CHANCE TO MAKE SURE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WOULD NOT GET SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, HE VOTED TO TABLE AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED EXACTLY THAT. THAT'S THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO. MR. FEINGOLD: THAT'S FALSE. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN FALSE REPEATEDLY. BUT AGAIN, NO EFFORT BY SENATOR JOHNSON TO WORK WITH OTHER SENATORS ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION. HE JUST FINDS THE FLAWS AND SAYS I CAN'T VOTE FOR IT. WHERE IS HIS LEADERSHIP? HE IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE. WHY HASN'T HE INTRODUCED A COMPREHENSIVE BIPARTISAN BILL TO ALLOW A SOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THE 11 MILLION PEOPLE HERE HAVE A LEGAL STATUS, PAY A PENALTY, GET IN LINE FOR CITIZENSHIP. THAT'S WITH THE MANUFACTURERS AND LEADERS IN THE STATE WANT, BUT HE WON'T ACT ON IT. MR. JOHNSON: I HAVE BEEN ACTING. I HAVE BEEN TAKING A STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH. I PASSED THE BORDER METRI BILL, THE FIRST STEP TO SECURE THE BORDER. THE PROBLEM IS THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL ONLY SECURE THE BORDER WITH A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH ISN'T GOING TO WORK. WE HAD COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE REFORM. LOOK WHAT A DISASTER THAT IS. I DON'T LET PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. AGAIN, HIS FALSE ATTACKS ON ME ARE SIBLEY THAT, UNTRUE. -- SIMPLY THAT, UNTRUE. MR. FEINGOLD: THE ONLY CHANCE THEY HAVE IS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT SENATOR BECAUSE HE WILL NEVER WORK FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. MIKE: IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN, OR DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT PIECE BY PIECE? MR. FEINGOLD: THERE IS NO QUESTION. IT WAS ALMOST DONE EARLIER. BIPARTISAN EFFORTS WERE MADE IN THE 90'S. IT WAS ALMOST DONE WITH MARCO RUBIO AND SOME OF THE OTHER SENATORS. HE DIDN'T PARTICIPATE WITH THE GROUP. HE WANTED TO BLOCK IT. IT EVENTUALLY, I THINK THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. I THINK THIS ELECTION WILL CREATE A DIFFERENT SENATE, A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT, OBVIOUSLY, AND I THINK THERE WILL BE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WANTS THIS DONE. MR. JOHNSO I HAVE GONE THROUGH A LIST OF ALL THE BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED AND HOW THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION POPULATION HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE. THE BILLS HAVEN'T WORKED. WHAT SENATOR FEINGOLD PROPOSED WOULDN'T WORK. MIKE: I HAVE TO WRAP IT UP TO MAKE SURE YOU GET TIME FOR CLOSING STATEMENTS. WE FLIPPED A COIN TO DETERMINE THE ORDER AND WE BEGIN WITH SENATOR JOHNSON. SENATOR JOHNSON: I RAN IN 2010 BECAUSE I WAS PANICKED FOR THIS NATION AND I MADE TWO PROMISES. I WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH AND I WILL NEVER VOTE WITH REELECTION IN MIND. I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THIS NATION FACES AND NORMA'S CHALLENGES AND WE NEED PEOPLE COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO HAVE THE -- FACES ENORMOUS CHALLENGES, AND WE NEED PEOPLE COMING FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING IN LIFE. I HAVE PUT MYSELF IN POSITION TO A CALM PUSH SOMETHING. 83 PIECES OF LEGISLATION, 20 -- TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING. 83 PIECES OF LEGISLATION. 28 SIGNED INTO LAW. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, I WANT TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I WILL NEVER STAND FOR REELECTION AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES SENATOR FEINGOLD IS GOING TO RUN FOR REELECTION. MIKE AND NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM MR. FEINGOLD. MR. FEINGOLD: THANK YOU. I HAVE SO ENJOYED GOING AROUND THE STATE AND SEEING THE INNOVATIONS. TURNING SCHOOLS INTO BEAUTIF APPLIANCES. I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO VISIT SIX OR SEVEN OF THE CRAFT BREWERIES AROUND THE STATE AS WELL AS A VODKA DISTILLERY. THIS IS A GREAT PART OF THIS GREAT STATE. YOU HAVE TO BE POSITIVE ABOUT THE FUTURE. UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE HEARD GREAT CONCERN FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. PEOPLE AT THE TOP ARE DOING GREAT, BUT THEY ARE NOT DOING SO WELL. THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR JOHNSON VOTE AGAINST THEIR INTEREST, AGAINST THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE, AGAINST FAMILY LEAD. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE STUDENT LOAN PROBLEM. YOU DESERVE A SENATOR WHO WILL STAND WITH YOU, AND IF I AM ELECTED, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WILL DO, SO I ASK YOU FOR YOUR VOTE. MIKE THANK YOU, MR. FEINGOLD. AND WITH THAT, OUR TIME IS U WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE CANDIDATES FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT, AND ALL OF YOU AT HOME FOR WATCHING. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLED OUR EDITORIAL PARTNER, WISPOLITICS.COM, AND THE UPFRO NETWORK OF STATIONS CARRYING TONIGHT'S BROADCAST. AND PLEASE, GET OUT AND VOTE ON NOVEMBER 8. FOR WISN 12 NEWS AND THE MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL, I'M MIKE GOUSHA. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
