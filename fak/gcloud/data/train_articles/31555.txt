Educational Options (CA Dept of Education)
Continuation education is an alternative high school diploma program. It is for students who are sixteen years of age or older, have not graduated from high school, are still required to attend school, and who are at risk of not graduating.

Many students in continuation education are behind in high school credits. Others may need a flexible school schedule because they have jobs outside of school. Some students choose continuation education because of family needs or other circumstances.

Students who attend continuation high schools must spend at least 15 hours per week or three hours per day at school. They take courses that are required for graduation. They also receive guidance and career counseling. Some programs offer independent study, job-placement services, and concurrent enrollment in community college.

The California Department of Education is involved in the funding and management of continuation education programs.
