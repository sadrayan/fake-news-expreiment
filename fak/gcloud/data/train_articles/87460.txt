Pam Davidson for Georgia PSC
Pam Davidson



Fellow citizens and ratepayers, my name is Pam Davidson. I am a candidate for the District 5 post on the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) in the July 31 Republican Primary. I am running because Georgia needs new leadership on the PSC to effectively address rising energy costs and the need for ethics reform on the Commission.Over the past 18 years, the incumbent candidate has received about 95 percent of his campaign money from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating. This fosters a cozy relationship with those utilities, and Georgia consumers, quite literally, have paid the price.Garnering 48% of the vote in a 2008 election for the PSC against a similarly utility-backed candidate, I have proven that citizen-supported candidacy still works. I need your help to restore and protect the Commission from the corporate money that prevents it from operating as it was intended to. Let's take back this nation one office at a time and restore this nation to its former glory. The cronyism that plages the PSC threatens our households, our economy and our liberty.Thank you for visiting my campaign website, and I hope you will find the information inside helpful in making your decision in this election. If you have additional questions or concerns,. I want to put my experience in the energy field, dedication to good government and "can-do" attitude to work.I ask for your support and your vote in the Republican Primary on July 31, 2012.
