Frequency of the Serological Reactivity Against the Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Lentivirus gp135 in Children Who Consume Goat Milk
These results showed that the positive response to gp135 may be the result of a repetitive stimulation without viral replication or the result of CAEV replication in humans. CAEV gp135 is codified by the env gene located on the viral particle surface as well as gp50. Moreover, there are similarities between CAEV gp135 and HIV-1 gp120, so there is a possibility that CAEV replicates in humans and may participate in immunological cross-phenomena, but this should be further studied.
