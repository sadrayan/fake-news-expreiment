Child Care Quality Ratings
What is a Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS)?

QRIS is a general term used to describe a system that helps parents understand the level of quality in child care, preschool, and school-age care programs. QRIS was designed to help parents compare different programs by using the same set of standards. It also helps child care providers improve and communicate their quality to parents.

If your state has a QRIS, it is probably called by a different name. Check out our State by State Resource Map to learn more about your stateâ€™s specific program.
