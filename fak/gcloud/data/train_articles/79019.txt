Tax returns, disclosures offer snapshot of top Ga. Senate candidates' finances
ATLANTA â€” In just over two weeks, voters will decide among crowded fields of Republicans and Democrats vying for Georgia's open U.S. Senate seat. To gain insights into the candidates' personal finances, The Associated Press requested access to the last 10 years of tax returns of each of the top candidates who are leading in fundraising and polls ahead of the May 20 primary.

Republicans Karen Handel, Phil Gingrey and David Perdue each provided access to at least a portion of their tax returns. Republican Jack Kingston plans to release his but has yet to do so. A spokesman for Democrat Michelle Nunn says she plans to release information beyond her candidate's financial disclosure.

The following is a summary of each candidate's finances based on those disclosures and tax returns where available:

PAUL BROUN (R):

Broun's campaign spokeswoman said the congressman from Athens had filed detail annual financial disclosures since being elected. His last five, from calendar years 2008 through 2012, are available online. Broun and his wife listed assets in 2012 valued at between about $127,000 and $480,000. That included two condos in Naples, Florida, that Broun inherited that year. The two rental properties generated between $7,502 and $20,000 in income that year.

Their sole liability was a home mortgage between $250,001 and $500,000. Also included in Broun's filings is an April 2013 report that shows he purchased shares worth between $15,001 and $50,000 each of CSX Corp., Berkshire Hathaway and Norfolk Southern. Broun amended his 2008-2011 reports to list a personal, interest-bearing loan he made to his congressional campaign account between $100,001 and $250,000.
