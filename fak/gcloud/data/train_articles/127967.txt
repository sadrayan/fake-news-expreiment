Niagara Falls turning purple for Queen’s 90th birthday
NIAGARA FALLS — The Niagara Falls Illumination Board will acknowledge the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II on April 21 by bathing the Horseshoe and American Falls in purple — the colour of royalty — for 15 minutes beginning at 10 p.m.

Queen Elizabeth has sat on the throne as Queen of the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Canada since 1953.

In October of 1951, then Princess Elizabeth and Prince Phillip visited Niagara Falls, as part of a Royal Tour of Canada. According to the official website of the British Monarchy, "The Queen herself has a very personal involvement with Canada and Canadians in every region of the country. This involvement is based on a deeply held affection for and loyalty to a country that she first toured as Princess Elizabeth in 1951 and to which she has returned over twenty times since."

The site goes on to list Canada as the "country most visited by The Queen over her reign of over 60 years. She has often stated that it was her 'second home', feeling totally at ease in Canada, meeting as many Canadians as possible from all walks of life and backgrounds, in the communities where they live."

Established in 1925, The Niagara Falls Illumination Board is made up of representatives from the City of Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls, N.Y., Ontario Power Generation, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and The Niagara Parks Commission.
