Subaru's Response to September 11



The entire Subaru family is deeply saddened by the tragic events of September 11. Subaru and its parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. in Japan, promptly responded to the relief efforts through the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and other relief organizations.



To date, our combined contributions of cash and equipment total approximately $1 million. We realize the effects of September 11 will continue for a long time, and Subaru remains committed to be responsive to additional needs as they arise.



Subaru prides itself in supporting a variety of programs in the communities where Subaru employees live and work. The support includes employee volunteerism and financial donations through the corporation as well as Subaru of America Foundation, Inc. We believe we have a responsibility, as a responsible corporate neighbor, to help improve local communities, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We do not, however, issue press releases to publicize our numerous activities. Making our communities better places to live and work is the number one goal; promoting our own good deeds is not.



Although we choose to do so quietly, please be assured that Subaru will continue to support our communities and respond to other charitable needs as they arise.
