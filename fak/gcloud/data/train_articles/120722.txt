Patricia Leary Steuer

Steuer, 59, met Cosby at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1978 when she was 22. He was getting his doctorate in education and she was working at the university after having earned her bachelor's in music there. She told The Times she heard Cosby speak at an educator's conference and then saw him on campus the next day and thanked him for his speech.

He took her to a banquet that evening and for a drink, where he expressed interest in helping her launch her singing career. He then invited her to a dinner party at the family home in Shelburne Falls, Mass., which turned out to be just a dinner for two, Steuer said. She got sick after half a drink, and woke up naked in a bed hours later. Cosby was standing over her, told her she got sick, passed out and he had to wash her dress.

“And I believed him, I was so humiliated I thought I had embarrassed myself,” Steuer said. "I thought he'd never call again.”

But Cosby did call, checking in on her every few months, paying for an acting class and for a gym membership, because he said she needed to lose weight to have a career on screen.

She went to two events with him without incident until he invited her to go to Atlantic City, N.J., in 1980. After she arrived, he asked her to visit his penthouse suite but wouldn't let her in the door unless she took a white pill he was holding that would “relax her,” Steuer said. She said she passed out and woke up feeling as if she had been penetrated. This time she confronted Cosby. She said he called her ungrateful and they never spoke again. Steuer was one of 13 Jane Does who corroborated Andrea Constand's story in a civil suit against Cosby in 2005. She decided to reveal her name to New York Magazine after a deposition Cosby gave in that case became public.

Joyce Emmons

Joyce Emmons, a comedy club manager, met Cosby in 1977 or 1978 when her “unusual laugh” cracked him up during a live routine in Las Vegas, Emmons told The Times. Cosby made a pass at her that same night, but she told him no and they became “immediate friends.” She began to visit Las Vegas whenever Cosby was performing, always bringing employees from her club, the Laff Stop in Newport Beach.

She told The Times Cosby gave her a white pill he described as just a little stronger than a Tylenol for a headache sometime between 1979 and 1980. She said she woke up naked with Cosby’s friend, whom she had rebuffed the night before. She confronted both men. She said Cosby admitted he had given her a Quaalude and laughed at her.

“He was wonderful to me; I never thought he would do that,” Emmons said.

Masten was a Playboy bunny in her 20s when she met Cosby. She alleges that he drugged and raped her at the Whitehall Hotel in Chicago in 1979. She says he gave her a cocktail before dinner: “I took two sips and the next thing I remember I woke up naked with him next to me naked. I was bruised, battered and hysterical." She left immediately.

"This was not a sexual encounter, this was an extreme act of violence," Masten told The Times. "There was blood involved."

Masten said her supervisor told her not to tell anyone, because no one would believe her.

Cosby gives a speech as part of an NAACP commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education segregation case. He blames petty crime on bad parenting: "These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake! Then we all run out and are outraged, 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand? I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else. And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said if you get caught with it you're going to embarrass your mother. Not you're going to get your butt kicked. No. You're going to embarrass your mother. You're going to embarrass your family." He also brought up single mothers and young people wearing their pants too low. The speech drew the attention of comedian Hannibal Buress, and helped shape the judgment releasing his 2005 deposition in Andrea Constand's lawsuit against him, as the judge ruled the public moralizing made him a public figure.

In 2005, Andrea Constand tells police that Cosby assaulted her a year earlier at his mansion in Cheltenham, Penn. The former Temple University employee said he invited her home after a dinner, gave her pills for stress and tension, then helped her to a sofa when she became dizzy and sick. She awoke with her clothing in disarray. She said she drove herself home and decided not to report what happened to police because of Cosby's fame and her position as a women's basketball administrator. Instead, she said she contacted a lawyer. In July 2015, a judge released court documents revealing that Cosby admitted in 2005 that he got Quaaludes, a hypnotic sedative used recreationally as a party drug, with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with. In the court documents, he said he had given Constand three half-pills of Benadryl but did not admit to giving her Quaaludes.

Hannibal Buress stand-up routine goes viral

(Jimi Celeste / TNS)

Hannibal Buress, during a stand-up performance in Philadelphia that goes viral, renews the allegations against Cosby in a sketch about what he saw as Cosby's hypocritical crusade against hip-hop culture and the unraveling of the black family. Cosby had made a speech at the NAACP's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education segregation case. “Bill Cosby has the ... smuggest old black man public persona that I hate," Buress says. "He gets on TV: 'Pull your pants up, black people, I was on TV in the '80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom.' Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches. ... I guess I want to just at least make it weird for you to watch 'Cosby Show' reruns.” Within weeks, both Netflix and NBC had scrapped projects with Cosby, stand-up performances were canceled around the country, and TV Land pulled "The Cosby Show" from its lineup.

New allegations pour in

A flood of allegations begin surfacing. Currently, about 45 women have said they were assaulted by Cosby.

Pennsylvania authorities charge Bill Cosby with sexually assaulting a woman at his home 12 years ago — the first criminal charges brought against the comedian.

He is scheduled to be arraigned in the afternoon.
