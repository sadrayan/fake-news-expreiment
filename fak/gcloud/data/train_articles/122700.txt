CASTRO REJECTS NEW TIES TO U.S.
MIAMI, April 19 — Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba said to night that his Government was “in no way way” interested in establishing “normal relations” with the United States.

In a two‐hour speech in Ha vana that commemorated the 10th anniversary of the defeat of the United States‐sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion, Mr. Cas tro said that Cuba had come to “scorn relations with the imperialist Government of the United States, a Government of genocide and decadence.”

His speech was monitored here.

The Premier indicated that his statement was a reply to President Nixon, who said last Friday night that the United States would not normalize re lations with Cuba “as long as Cuba adopts an anti‐American line.”

Mr. Castro said that efforts “by imperialists to domesticate and appease Cuba “would fail because of his Government's “revolutionary intransigeance.”
