Jeb Bush says he'd release email, is writing an e-book
Email. Ebook.

Jeb Bush looked to sound tech-savvy in a well-timed interview with a Miami TV station. And he sent another strong signal about a run for president.

"Part of serving or running, both of them, is transparency. So I'll let people make up their mind," Bush said during the interview with WPLG Local 10, pledging to release 250,000 emails from when he was governor.

Those emails are the guide for his book, we're told. The emails are already available through public records but Bush plans to make them all available electronically.

Opponents have already begun to look into his record and Bush seems confident about standing up to scrutiny.

"I was digital before digital was cool, now it's commonplace," Bush told the station.
