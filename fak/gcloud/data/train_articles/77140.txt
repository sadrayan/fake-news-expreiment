Flint Hills Resources
Safeguarding the Environment

Beyond reducing emissions, Flint Hills Resources works to eliminate waste. Our philosophy is to make the best possible use of natural resources, leaving more available to meet other needs. We believe that industrial companies have a duty to respect nature. Our company partners with groups such as Great River Greening and Friends of the Mississippi River to help restore and maintain wildlife habitats. Some of our sites in Illinois, Minnesota and Texas have earned official certification from the Wildlife Habitat Council. The Environmental Protection Agency has named Koch Industries the number one U.S.-based parent company in pollution prevention initiatives for multiple years.
