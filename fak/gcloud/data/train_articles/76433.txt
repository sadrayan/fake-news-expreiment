Haemophilus influenzae type B
In 2000, WHO estimated that Hib is responsible for 8.13 million of serious illnesses and approximately 371,000 deaths per year.

In 2008, total number of children who died from Hib was estimated at 199,000 deaths globally, dropping from an estimated number of around 371,000 in 2000, mainly due to meningitis and pneumonia.. In 2008 as well, pneumonia was responsible for about 19% of deaths in children aged less than five years in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Of these, 20â€“25% of deaths are caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib). Hib diseases accounted for about 900 000 cases, resulting in more than 48 000 deaths in the same year.

Complications of Hib meningitis include blindness, deafness, mental retardation, learning disabilities, and death. The case-fatality rate of Hib meningitis is about 5%. Severe neurologic sequelae occur in 10% to 15% and deafness in 15% to 20% of survivors.
