Mayor Miner sets $15 minimum wage for Syracuse city workers
SYRACUSE, N.Y. - More than 60 city employees got a welcome raise today from Mayor Stephanie Miner, who increased the city's minimum pay rate to $15 an hour.

Some of the 61 employees who will get the raise had been paid as little as $8.75 an hour before the change. Among those who will get the raise are parking checkers, information aides and laborers, city officials said.

The new city minimum wage applies to all full-time employees who work at least 10 weeks per year. It takes effect immediately and is expected to cost the city an extra $222,432 per year, budget officials said.

Syracuse passed a "living wage" ordinance in 2005 that established minimum pay rates for some contractors doing business with the city, but the ordinance never applied to city employees. The current living wage rates are $15.08 per hour without benefits, or $12.77 with benefits.

New York state in July adopted a plan to raise the minimum wage for many fast-food workers to $15 an hour over several years. Miner expressed support for that decision, saying it might help decrease Syracuse's high rate of poverty.
