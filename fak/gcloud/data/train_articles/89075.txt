UPDATE: Crist website not scrubbed, monitoring service shows
UPDATE I: Video above includes clips from Gov. Charlie Crist being asked today about his U.S. Senate campaign, specifically if he would pull his support from a Republican who ran as an independent and his thoughts on Rep. Tom Grady’s letter yesterday.

UPDATE II: Grady says he has no proof that Crist “eliminated” anything from his website, but that it was fair to make the accusation. “This wasn’t a trial,” he said.

One of the fun things we use to cover Florida politicians is a website called ChangeDetection.com. It’s a free service that lets you know when content has been added to or deleted from a website.

We’ve been monitoring Gov. Charlie Crist’s campaign site for the past couple years and its data shows that no reference to “Republican” has been eliminated, as Rep. Tom Grady suggested in his letter to Crist last night.

We’ve not had a chance to talk with Grady yet today, so we don’t know what proof he has that Crist, who is considering an independent U.S. Senate campaign, might have scrubbed the site.
