In 1988, Oprah Asked Donald Trump If He'd Ever Run For President. Here's How He Replied.
Donald Trump wasn't always so sure he wanted to run for president.

Long before The Donald officially kicked off his polarizing 2016 run and became the Republican frontrunner, Oprah asked the business tycoon about his political aspirations on a 1988 episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show." Trump had originally appeared on the show to promote a new book and discuss his life as a businessman, but the conversation soon turned toward foreign policy and how Trump would take a tougher stance with America's allies.

"I'd make our allies pay their fair share. We're a debtor nation; something's going to happen over the next number of years in this country, because you can't keep going on losing $200 billion," he said on "The Oprah Show" back then. "We let Japan come in and dump everything right into our markets... They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs. They knock the hell out of our companies. And, hey, I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people. I mean, you can respect somebody that's beating the hell out of you, but they are beating the hell out of this country. Kuwait, they live like kingsâ€¦ and yet, they're not paying. We make it possible for them to sell their oil. Why aren't they paying us 25 percent of what they're making? It's a joke."
