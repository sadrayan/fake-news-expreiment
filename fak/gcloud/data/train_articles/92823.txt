Rubio: Delay individual mandate while Obamacare website problems addressed
Sen. Marco Rubio jumped on the continuing problems with the Obamacare website, saying he'll file a bill to delay the individual mandate until six months after the Government Accountability Office certifies the website is fully functional.

The bill would face certain opposition from Democrats, who control the Senate, but the problems are a serious challenge for the Obama administration and Democrats, who have spent years enthusiastically selling the overhaul. President Obama today conceded the rollout has been bad but also said the problems would be resolved with plenty of time before the coverage begins in January.

"It is not fair that next year Americans will be punished for not buying ObamaCare when the website they are supposed to buy it on doesn't work," Rubio said in a statement. "I believe this entire law should, and will, eventually be repealed and replaced. But until that happens, I will continue looking for ways to protect Americans from the disaster that is ObamaCare.

"The legislation, which will be introduced when the U.S. Senate reconvenes next week, would delay the individual mandate until six months after the GAO certifies the websites and all other sign-up options (phone, mail, fax) are fully functional. Thereafter, it exempts people from paying the mandate fines if they can prove that they tried to sign up but could not because of technical or customer service issues."
