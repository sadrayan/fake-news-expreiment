General Assistance (WorkFirst NJ)
WFNJ clients may receive Emergency Assistance (EA) in certain situations.



These benefits include, but are not limited to: essential food, clothing, shelter and household furnishings; temporary rental assistance or back rent or mortgage payments; utility payments (such as heat, water, electric); transportation to search for housing; and moving expenses.



Eligible persons include those who are homeless or at immediate risk of becoming homeless, and those who have experienced a substantial loss of housing, food, clothing or household furnishings due to fire, flood or similar disaster.

Emergency Assistance is limited to 12 months. However, extensions may be granted under certain hardship conditions, with specific limitations.

Unemployment Benefits

If you have been working in a regular job for at least 20 weeks and lose that job - through no fault of your own - you may be eligible for state unemployment benefits. You can file a claim at your local Employment Services Office (listed in your phone book).



If you are still out of work when your unemployment benefits run out, you may be eligible for welfare - as long as you still have time left on your five-year limit.
