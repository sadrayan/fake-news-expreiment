Emails, Jennifer Pett, communications director, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, July 19-20, 2016

Subject: Inquiry for a Texas fact check

Good afternoon.

Rep. Smith told Texas delegates to the Republican National Convention this morning: “: “One third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants.”

For a fact check, could you share with us how he reached that conclusion?

This Bureau of Prisons chart seems to show that about 22 percent of prisoners are citizens of other countries. It also doesn’t indicate the share of inmates not legally authorized to live in the U.S.

Thanks.

Mr. Smith was referencing the data shown in the PDF attached here.

Illegal immigrants accounted for nearly 37 percent of federal sentences in FY 2014.

You can access that data on the Sentencing Commission site:

1) http://isb.ussc.gov/Login

2) All Table and Figures

3) Primary Offense and Offender Characteristics

4) Citizenship of Offenders in Each Primary Offense Category

That was quick. Thanks.

What Smith said Tuesday referred to all inmates.

It looks to me, also, like the bulk of the people in the “illegal aliens” column of the chart you provided had primary sentences for immigration violations.

Anything else to consider as we assess this?

Appreciated,

Yes, we noticed that also. Fact remains though that of those sentenced to federal prison, over 1/3 were illegal immigrants.
