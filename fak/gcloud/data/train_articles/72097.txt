Nan Rich: Florida Republicans Take Federal Funds Only if It Promotes "Extreme Agenda"

Florida's Senate Democratic Leader Nan Rich isn't too happy today about the state's Republican leadership's rejection of $50 million in federal funds to protect people like at-risk kids and senior citizens, then turning around and accepting $2.6 million of federal coin to promote the state's abstinence-only program.

The Weston Democrat says the state's Republicans love to champion their refusal of cash from the feds but then have no qualm with taking the money if it "advances their extreme agenda."

Florida Republicans have long said they can't take money from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because it's just so darned unconstitutional. Problem is, the $2.6 million for the sex-is-the-devil program came from the same fund. Whoops.
