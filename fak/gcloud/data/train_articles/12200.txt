U.S. and Republic of Korea Conclude New Special Measures Agreement The Republic of Korea and the United States have concluded talks on a new Special Measures Agreement (SMA) regarding ROK cost sharing support (also known as burden sharing) for United States Forces Korea for 2009-2013. The SMA, first agreed to in 1991, establishes the sharing of non-personnel stationing costs associated with the presence of U.S. forces in the ROK.

Advancing from the previous two-year agreement, this SMA is a five-year mutually beneficial agreement which will further strengthen enduring Alliance commitments, planning and force presence, and continuity of operations. Notably, the SMA institutes an “in-kind” arrangement which significantly enhances U.S.-ROK collaboration on the execution of construction projects.

In the agreement signed in Seoul today, the ROK will provide 760 billion won (approximately U.S. $691.5 million based on the 2008 average exchange rate) in 2009 and will increase the funding level in the subsequent years by the rise in the Consumer Price Index, with a maximum four-percent annual cap. SMA funds are expended in South Korea and flow directly into the ROK economy and citizenry through payments for host nation civilian employee salaries, local logistics procurements, and construction performed by ROK construction companies.

The new SMA supports the efforts of both nations to achieve shared ROK and US goals for the defense of the peninsula for many years to come.
