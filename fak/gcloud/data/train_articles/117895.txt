Groom sues bride for not looking pretty without make-up
By Staff

An Algerian groom took his bride to court just a day after their marriage, accusing her of not looking as pretty as before the wedding and of cheating him with much make-up.

The groom, who is seeking $20,000 damages, told court in the capital Algiers that he was shocked when he got up in the next morning and found that his wife looked so different, that he could not recognise her.

Newspapers in the North African Arab country said the groom swore in court that he even mistook his wife for a “thief who came to steal his apartment".

“The groom told the judge that he could not recognise his wife after she washed the make-up off her face.

"He said he was deceived by her as she used to fill up her face with make up before their marriage,” the papers said, quoting a court source.

“He said she looked very beautiful and attractive before marriage, but when he woke up in the morning and found that she had washed the make-up off her face, he was frightened as he thought she was a thief.

"The groom told court that he is demanding $20,000 damages for his psychological suffering.”
