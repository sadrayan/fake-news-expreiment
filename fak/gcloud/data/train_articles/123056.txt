The KKK Just Showed Up At The Nevada Caucus To Support Trump

Donald Trump’s popularity with white supremacy groups has been widely documented. His particular brand of ethnonationalist rabble-rousing and the blaming of minorities for all of our nation’s problems has struck a chord with those misguided bigots who believe that white Christian males are a superior race, and Trump’s refusal to condemn them has only encouraged others leaning that way to embrace the hatred that Trump has made a key part of his electoral platform.

But nobody really expected his obscenely racist supporters to show up to the polls in such a dramatic fashion. Krystal Heath, station manager at KVXLRadio, a Biblical station in Nevada, was probably quite surprised to run into these folks outside of the Nevada caucuses.

This, America, is what the Republican Party has come to. It is absolutely appalling to see that the front-runner of one of our nation’s two major political parties has been spouting such absurdly discriminatory rhetoric that his supporters feel bold enough to show up to caucus dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan. The New England Benevolent Police Association is a police union that endorsed Trump directly after he proposed his abhorrent ban on all Muslims from entering the United States; it is unclear if these people are actually connected to the union.

That’s not the only report of shady dealings at the Nevada caucus:

So vote counters in Nevada are wearing Trump gear, people admitting to voting for Trump multiple times, and Trump supporters dressed as KKK. — Country Strong (@CountryLife87) February 24, 2016

This is quite possibly the lowest point that American democracy has ever sunk to. If you needed any more reason to vote blue this November, this should be enough to convince you.
