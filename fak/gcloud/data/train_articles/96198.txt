Scott Walker Rewards His “Cleaner”





Transition Chief Hid Report Showing Milwaukee County on Verge of Bankruptcy

MADISON-Following is the statement of Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Mike Tate following Scott Walker's appointment of Michael Grebe to head his transition team. Grebe killed the release of a damaging report on Walker's record in the days leading up to the election.

"Scott Walker has driven Milwaukee County to the point of bankruptcy and his campaign chairman did a good job keeping a report that detailed these facts from the public in the days before the election. It makes all the sense in the world that he would reward his "cleaner.""
