Escherichia coli infections

Escherichia coli is a bacterium that is commonly found in the gut of humans and other warm-blooded animals. While most strains are harmless, some can cause severe foodborne disease. E. coli infection is usually transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food, such as undercooked meat products and raw milk.

Symptoms of disease include abdominal cramps and diarrhoea, which may be bloody. Fever and vomiting may also occur. Most patients recover within 10 days, although in a few cases the disease may become life-threatening.
