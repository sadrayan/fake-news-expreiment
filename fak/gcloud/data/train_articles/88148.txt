Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais
We’re thrilled that Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais, in Mirebalais, Haiti, is open. The 205,000-square foot, 300-bed facility—called University Hospital for short—is filling a huge void, locally and nationally, for people who previously had limited access to quality health care.

This hospital is the culmination of a dream dating back a quarter-century and underlines our commitment to the country and people of Haiti, which is stronger than ever after the earthquake. —Paul Farmer

The hospital provides primary care services to about 185,000 people in Mirebalais and two nearby communities. But patients from a much wider area—all of central Haiti and areas in and around Port-au-Prince—can also receive secondary and tertiary care. We see as many as 700 patients every day in our ambulatory clinics. Learn more here.

And at a time when Haiti desperately needs skilled professionals, University Hospital provides high-quality education for the next generation of Haitian nurses, medical students, and resident physicians .

Thanks to incredibly generous supporters, we have raised funds to design, build, and outfit the hospital and residences, and we will continue to rely on our friends and supporters who believe we can—and should—provide health care to people everywhere, and especially to people living on the margin of extreme poverty.
