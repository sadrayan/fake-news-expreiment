In L.A., Obama urges donors not to take midterms for granted: 'We are seeing the consequences' of a political story based on fear
“There’s the story that is based largely on fear, and there is a story based largely in hope. There’s the story that says we’re in it together, and there’s the story that says there’s an us and a them,” Obama told DNC Chairman Tom Perez during a conversation at the event. Reporters were allowed in to listen to the 48-minute discussion. The rest of the event was closed to the press.
