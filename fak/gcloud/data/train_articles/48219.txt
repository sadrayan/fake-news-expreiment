NOTE: PACs with diversified interests are listed under their primary business (e.g., you'll find Boeing under "defense aerospace" rather than "aircraft manufacturers".). Also, for ease of identification, the names used in this section are those of the organization connected with the PAC, rather than the official PAC name. For example, the "Coca-Cola Company Nonpartisan Committee for Good Government" is simply listed as "Coca-Cola Co."
