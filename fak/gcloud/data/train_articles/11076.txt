All Network High Schools Boast Graduation Rates Above 70%

The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools today announced that according to data released by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), its network graduation rate has more than doubled since its founding in 2008 from 36% to 77%. This represents a 7-point increase from the previous year and a 41-point increase over the network’s seven-year history.

“We are proud that our collective efforts have yielded these remarkable results in some of the city’s highest-needs communities. Based on a combination of strategies that include a strong focus on academic rigor, leveraging community partners to support college access and heightened use of data to individualize instruction, we’ve more than doubled the percentage of students who receive a diploma each year,” said Joan Sullivan, Chief Executive Officer for the Partnership for LA Schools.

Mendez High School increased 12 points from 76% to 88%; and now exceeds LAUSD average by 5 points;
