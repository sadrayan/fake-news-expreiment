CHICAGO â€” A Chicago university is offering students post-election counseling if needed.

The Illinois Institute of Technology in Bronzeville emailed students to tell them counseling services were available to those who need "help process[ing] the election," according to a tweet from Eric Tendian. Tendian wrote that he goes to the school.

The school's Student Health and Wellness Center confirmed it sent the email but was not immediately available to comment.

Students are able to attend individual meetings or go to a "group process session," according to the email.

The presidential election, which ended in a victory for Republican Donald Trump, has upset some in Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the city woke up "despondent" over the results, and a large protest is planned at Trump Tower on Wednesday night.

IIT is not alone among schools offering election-related help. According to thecollegefix.com, some universities provided assistance before the election to deal with election day stress.

The University of Virginia provided six ways to cope with election stress, including limiting consumption of media, finding a healthy escape such as exercising, and connecting with friends and allies.
