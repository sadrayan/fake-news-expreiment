The focus on funding allocated for the four programs on Pojman’s list does not entirely capture how some of the women’s health services historically have been paid for. For example, primary care services for women that are now covered by EPHC were previously paid for using other stated-administered and federal programs (not included on Pojman’s list). By not factoring these programs into funding totals in previous years, the recent increase may seem larger than it actually is.

Also, funding allocations do not reflect how effectively these programs are serving women. In other words, there may be more total dollars set aside for services, but since quite a bit of this new funding has been going to organizations that do not have a lot of experience with family planning, the state is spending more but not necessarily serving more women.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Sincerely,

Kari

Thanks. Have you got (or are you aware of) a keener, dollar-to-dollar, analysis per your first point below?

I don’t know the dollar amounts for the programs. The Primary Health Care Program is administered by DSHS and has historically been awarded to FQHCs and public health departments/hospitals. Another key funding mechanism is the PHS 330 grant that FQHCs receive from the federal government; it is not administered by the state so those numbers may be harder to track down and tease out.
