Data Base of Social, Economic and Environmental Indicators for Latin America and the Caribbean
(15 September 2006) Beginning today, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) makes available to researchers and the general public its CEPALSTAT data base of social, economic and environmental indicators.

This new computational tool developed by the UN regional commission is posted on its website at the following link.

CEPALSTAT merges the suite of existing ECLAC data bases (BADEINSO, BADEPAG, BADEIMA and SIAGRO) and incorporates new statistics and economic indicators. Figures, estimates and projections not developed directly by ECLAC come from national statistics bureaus, central banks and other international institutions.

CEPALSTAT is organized in three sections:

Statistics and social indicators Demography Education Health Housing Employment Remuneration Poverty and income distribution Economy Millennium Development Goals.

Statistics and economic indicators Annual and quarterly national accounts Indicators of global and industrial economic activity Price indexes Employment and remuneration Monetary indicators External sector Public finance statistics Agriculture and agricultural products statistics.

Environmental statistics and indicators Air: consumption of substances that deplete the ozone layer, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and concentration of particles, gases and heavy metals Water: water quality and water residues Seas and coastal areas: fishing and aquiculture Land and soil: land use and agriculture Biota: protected areas, flora and fauna Energy: production, consumption and coverage of electricity networks Disasters: natural disasters Urban environment: human settlements, transport, waste Environmental management Reference statistics: demography and economy.



The CEPALSTAT data base updates and expands information released yearly by ECLAC in its Statistical Yearbook for Latin America and the Caribbean, also posted on the website.
