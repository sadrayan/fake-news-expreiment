Interns are an integral part of our Senate operation and contribute greatly to the senator's work on behalf of Vermont and the nation. Senate interns have the unique privilege of gaining an insider's perspective on the legislative and representative process. Our Washington and Burlington offices offer paid full- and part-time internships tailored for recent graduates and current students at the undergraduate or graduate level.

Internship experiences are generally consistent with the descriptions below, but change from term to term in accordance with the Senate calendar, office legislative and casework priorities, and intern performance.

Questions? Please call the Senator's Internship Coordinator at (202) 224-5141 or (800) 339-9834.
