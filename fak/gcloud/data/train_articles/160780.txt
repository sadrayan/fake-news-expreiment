The UK Express reported that the city of Stockholm, Sweden was rocked by a terrorist attack on Tuesday night when a masked man boarded a subway train and doused liquid on the passengers as the carriage doors slammed shut, trapping everyone inside. The attack occurred at Sankt Eriksplan station in the Swedish capitol.

One passenger who was on the train said commuters went into a state of panic as soon as the doors shut, with most of them suffering from breathing problems and others desperately rushing for the exits. Another witness identified only as Alexander, 22, was sitting at the back of the carriage as he headed home from work when he heard people screaming.

“Suddenly lots of people were running back toward me. They kept both their mouth and eyes closed and cried and coughed,” he said. “It seemed like pepper spray, or whatever it was that was thrown out, and we got huge respiratory problems.

“Then when the train arrived at Fridhemsplan they evacuated it,” he added.

Once the passengers were evacuated, the train car was thoroughly examined by police. The authorities are still unsure what exactly the liquid was at this time.

This disturbing incident reminds us of the chaos that has spread throughout Sweden since the country began taking in Muslim refugees. SHARE this story so we can show people what is REALLY happening there!
