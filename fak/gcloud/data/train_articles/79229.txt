IF YOU NOTICE SOMEONE WITH A BLACK DOT ON THE PALM, CALL THE POLICE!
The Black Dot Campaign started as a facebook trend to identify victims of domestic violence. In fact, if a person has a black dot on their hand, it means they are in trouble! If you ever see someone that has this sign on their hand, don’t hesitate to call the police!

What this campaign does is help victims show they’re in danger without being discovered by their abusers. The victims of domestic violence put black dots on their palms, so as to show they’re in danger and seek protection. So whenever you notice a person with a black dot on their palm, contact the police immediately and help a person in danger.

The organizers of the campaign said “The black dot on the palm lets professionals know you’re a really vulnerable domestic violence survivor and that you need help but can’t ask because your abuser is watching your every move. In just 24 hours, the campaign has reached over 6,000 people worldwide, and has already helped 6 women. Please spread the campaign, and post a picture of your hand with the black dot, to show your support to all survivors of domestic violence.”



This is a story that one victim of domestic violence shared with us:

“I’m heavily pregnant and the baby’s father is very abusive. With words, his hands. I’ve been petrified for so long and even more with the baby coming soon. I was at the hospital yesterday, he was with me, he never leaves my side anymore. I had to have an examination so the consultant asked me to lie on the bed and drew the curtain. I leant over and took the pen out of his pocket, pulled his hand over to me and wrote HELP ME. I didn’t have to say a word. This campaign gave me the strength and the idea how to ask for help. I am now safe somewhere else thanks to that consultant and the black dot campaign. Thank you, 1 week to go until my due date and I am finally safe.”
