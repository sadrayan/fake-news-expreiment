Virtual Reading Room Documents Search Results: U.S. Department of State
Please Note

Some of the documents in the Virtual Reading Room are those of other federal agencies. Any questions regarding other federal agencies’ documents should be directed to the originating agency.

The search results list sometimes displays “n/a” in the data fields, which stands for “not available”. The data is sometimes not available depending on the document itself or how the document was processed.

This search is based upon locating specified words in the electronic text of documents. However, in many cases, this is dependent upon the conversion of the text in paper documents to electronic text through optical character recognition (OCR). Because of age and condition of some paper documents, the OCR may not recognize certain characters and words correctly. Please keep this in mind when using full text search, as these anomalies may affect the results of your search for relevant documents using your search criteria.
