Forest Grove police log: Pokemon Go player stabbed, keeps playing
The following is a list of calls, provided by the Forest Grove Police Department, that officers responded to during the past week.

July 3

* Two dancers claimed they were being poisoned by a regular customer at the club. Officers were informed by medical staff that there were no signs of poison and their symptoms may be caused by their diet.

* A caller reported seeing a person in a rabbit costume oddly walking around. Police located the individual who was trying out a homemade wolf/dragon costume.

July 4

* A man was found throwing garbage onto the ground and into the street, stating he was looking for food and trying to raise awareness for the homeless. Officers told him to clean up the mess, which he did, however he was later arrested after allegedly overturning numerous shopping carts, ash trays, garbage cans, as well as throwing merchandise and firewood into the parking lots of multiple stores.

* A caller reported seeing a woman in pajamas who seemed distraught walking down the street with a suitcase. Officers were able to locate the woman, who had a warrant out for her arrest. She was taken to jail.

* A caller reported that a man in a parking lot of a local restaurant was asking about the caller's wife's vehicle, stating that he thought the wife might be cheating on him.

July 10

* A woman reported that a local ATM would not accept her card. Officers found the machine operating fine.

* Police responded to a pushing match between a man and his adult son about the son brushing his teeth too loudly and talking about religion. The son agreed to stop brushing his teeth and go to bed.

Officers responded to the store, where the 22-year-old man had come in to buy chips and beer, as well as find a Pokemon. The man was able to give a description of his attacker, who allegedly stabbed the victim as they passed each other near 19th Avenue and Filbert Street. The victim refused medical treatment and continued his Pokemon hunt. The incident is under investigation.
