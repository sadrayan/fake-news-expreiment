Jesse Jackson fathers child out of wedlock, asks forgiveness

Civil rights activist plans hiatus from public life

NEW YORK (CNN) -- Civil rights activist and CNN talk show host Jesse Jackson is asking for forgiveness after acknowledging Thursday that he had an extramarital affair that resulted in the birth of a daughter now 20 months old.

"I fully accept responsibility and I am truly sorry for my actions," Jackson said in a written statement.

Jackson, a Baptist minister and one-time aide to Martin Luther King Jr., admitted that he fathered the child and has provided "emotional and financial support" since her birth. "As her mother does, I love this child very much," he said.

'I was born of these circumstances'

"I was born of these circumstances," said Jackson, himself born out of wedlock, "and I know the importance of growing up in a nurturing, supportive and protected environment so I am determined to give my daughter and her mother the privacy they both deserve."

His New York-based spokesman, John Scanlon, told CNN that Jackson issued the statement in advance of tabloid newspaper reports about the child. "We decided to issue this statement so that our point of view could be reflected in this story," Scanlon said.

The statement does not reveal the name of the mother or the child, calling it "a private and family matter." Jackson says that "to protect all those I love I will not discuss it any further beyond this statement."

'I will be taking some time off'

The two-time former presidential candidate plans an indefinite hiatus from his activist activities, which included opposing the confirmation of President-elect George W. Bush's attorney general nominee, John Ashcroft. "I will be taking some time off to revive my spirit and reconnect with my family before I return to my public ministry," the statement said.

But Scanlon said Jackson's break from public life would not be immediate. "We'll honor some of the earlier commitments he had and ... take a look at what the other short-term commitments are," the spokesman said.

On Wednesday, Jackson visited Xavier University in Louisiana with his son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Illinois, and went from there to Chicago.

The elder Jackson is the host of the CNN talk show "Both Sides with Jesse Jackson," which airs every Sunday. CNN had no comment.

'Painful' for his family

Jackson gave no details about the extramarital relationship. Scanlon says the child is the result of an affair Jackson had with a woman who worked in the Washington office of Jackson's advocacy group, the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition.

In his statement, Jackson says his wife, Jackie, and their children "have been made aware of the child and it has been an extremely painful, trying and difficult time for them."

"I have asked God and each one of them to forgive me, and I thank each of them for their grace and understanding throughout this period of tribulation," Jackson said. "We have prayed together, and through God's grace we have been reconciling."

"This is no time for evasions, denials or alibis," Jackson's statement said. "No doubt, many close friends and supporters will be disappointed in me. I ask for their forgiveness, understanding and prayers."

Activism and controversy

Jackson was a steadfast presence at President Clinton's side as the president struggled with the public revelation of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and the impeachment proceedings that followed.

It was Jackson who went to the White House to pray with Clinton's family on a grim weekend in August 1998, as Clinton admitted the truth to his wife and daughter and, in a nationally televised speech, to the nation.

Last August, Clinton awarded Jackson the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. At that time, Jackson lavished praise on his wife, Jackie, and his five children for supporting him in his long civil rights career.

A fiery advocate for America's minorities, Jackson rose from poverty in South Carolina to win 7 million votes in pursuit of the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination eventually captured by Michael Dukakis.

He has been a powerful force in the Democratic Party in recent years -- although he enraged many in 1984 by referring to Jews as "Hymies" in a private-but-overheard conversation.

He drew fire for his support of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which some Jewish Americans consider a terrorist group, and for personal diplomacy trips to the Middle East and Latin America.

But he also brought about the release of a U.S. Navy pilot held by Syria and won freedom for 48 prisoners in Cuban jails.

Jackson first tasted prominence as a young firebrand in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. He was a devotee of King and was with him in 1968 when King was assassinated.
