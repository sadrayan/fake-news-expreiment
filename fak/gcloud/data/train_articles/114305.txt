Thin Sanitary Pads - Always Ultra
Always Ultra Thin Regular Non-Wing Pads

Always Ultra Thin Regular Non-Wing Pads absorb 60% faster* and move with you for great protection against leaks while the LeakGuard Core Plus RapidDry pulls fluid deep into the core and away from the edges. Use regular absorbency for days when your period flow is moderate.
