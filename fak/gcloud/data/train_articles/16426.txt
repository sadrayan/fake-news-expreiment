1. Yes, it’s true that “more Texans have jobs today than ever before,” see chart below. Data are here; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TXNAN

But except for periods during (and following) recessions, that has always been the case for Texas, see chart. So that’s really new or “news” – it more like the status quo in Texas, it’s always had steady job growth, going back to 1939 when the BLS started tracking state employment data.

2. It’s also the case that most US states now have more jobs than ever before, due to economic growth, population increases, and the post-recession recovery. I checked and only the following states have fewer jobs today than some period in the past: Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois (state budget problems), Louisiana, Michigan (auto related), Mississippi, New Mexico, North Dakota (slightly lower than the peak a few years ago), Ohio (loss of manufacturing jobs), Oklahoma/West Virginia/Wyoming (all slightly lower than a few years ago, due to energy), for various reasons listed above. But all of the other 37 states (and DC) currently have the highest employment levels in those states’ history.

3. I couldn’t find Labor Force Participation Rate data by state, but that figure peaked nationally in the 1997-2000 period and has declining ever since. Most of that decline is demographic-based, and the fact that people are living longer, and there are now more retirees than ever before, both in absolute numbers and as a share of the adult population.

For men, the Labor Force Participation Rate has been declining since 1948 when the BLS starting tracking those data. So while it’s probably true that “the share of Texas adults with jobs was higher in the 1990s,” that was also the case for the entire country, and it’s declined mostly for demographic reasons, not economic reasons.

Hope that helps, let me know if you need anything else!

Carpe Diem,

Mark
