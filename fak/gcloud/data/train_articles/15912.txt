This is the last analysis that was done by our office (it's the same information used in the Dallas Morning News story you sent):

http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Document/Teams/Public_Education/FY2014-Alpha_Order_Model_115%20District_run.pdf

It's a Fiscal Year 2014 estimate for the total maintenance and operations portion of the Foundation School Program (FSP), which is the principal mechanism for distributing state aid to school districts. The modeling was run last year using student count estimates (from TEA), property value growth estimates (from the Comptroller's office) and the property tax rates available at that time. It incorporates school funding decisions that were adopted by Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 1025 during last year's legislative session. The estimated Fiscal Year 2014 per-student funding is in the second column from the right...totals are at the bottom of the document.

Again, these are estimated numbers for total maintenance and operations (state and local) revenue in the FSP. They do not include other funding such as federal funding and other state non-FSP funding. TEA would have the other information you're looking for and an explanation of their methodology.
