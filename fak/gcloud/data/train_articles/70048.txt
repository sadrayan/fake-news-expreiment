Border Patrol detains 5 Pakistani immigrants, 1 Afghan immigrant along Arizona border
SONOITA, AZ - ABC15 has confirmed five Pakistani immigrants and one Afghan immigrant were caught near the Arizona border.

Sources said a sensor was triggered and Border Patrol agents responded to the location near Sonoita, Arizona.

"The group were with some Mexican Nationals and were being smuggled in to the country," FBI spokesman Kurt Remis said.

"This latest incident only reinforces the need to take our national security seriously on all fronts," Gov. Doug Ducey said in a statement released Thursday afternoon. "It's clear, our nation needs to up its game and improve border resources if we are going to protect our homeland."

He called the news of the apprehension "very troubling, especially in light of new threats on the United States from ISIS in a video released in just the last 24 hours."

U.S. Customs and Border Protection told ABC15, the agents, as a standard procedure "processed the six individuals and checked their identities against numerous law enforcement and national security related databases."

CBP said the "records checks revealed no derogatory information about the individuals."

The men are currently in federal custody.
