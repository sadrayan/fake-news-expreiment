Toni Braxton dies at 50
American singer Toni Braxton has died after been rushed to hospital on Tuesday night for feeling “unresponsive” at home, family tells the media.

According to the family’s spokesperson Anita Arthur, the cause of her death is not immediately known as the family awaits an autopsy report.

Braxton was hospitalized in 2016 due to complications with her lupus which led her to postpone Cleveland show.

Braxton revealed in 2011 that she was living with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the sufferer’s internal organs, joints and skin. She also appeared on “The Dr. Oz Show” in 2013 to talk about her diagnosis.

Her sister Traci Braxton who was kicked out of her upcoming tour “Sex and Cigarettes” solo tour amid family feud, said the singer “showed no sign of illness and never complained of Lupus”.

Braxton, who died at 50, began performing with her sisters in a family group known as The Braxtons in the late 1980s, who were signed to Arista Records.

Braxton attracted the attention of producers Antonio “L.A.” Reid and Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, later recording a series of songs for them before being signed to their Arista-distributed imprint, LaFace Records. Her self-titled debut studio album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, selling 10 million copies worldwide and seeing the international success of the singles “Another Sad Love Song” and “Breathe Again” . The album brought Braxton three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist.
