Can the Queen of UK be prosecuted in UK courts?
No, the Queen cannot be prosecuted for any crime - and it is not due to “sovereign immunity” as some writers have suggested, . Under the UK constitution, the monarch is the Fount of Justice: all justice derives from them, and they are responsible for its execution; centuries ago, monarchs would even pass judgement in person, acting as an ultimate court of appeal. This role can still be seen today throughout the UK judicial system:

Justice is executed in the Queen’s name

All judges are appointed by the Queen (magistrates are appointed by the Lord Chief Justice, who is in turn appointed by the Queen)

All judges and magistrates taken an oath of allegiance to the Queen

All prosecutions are brought in the Queen’s name, by the Crown Prosecution Service

Crimes are investigated by the Police, who all take an Oath of Allegiance to the Queen

Those who are convicted of crimes are held in one of Her Majesty’s Prisons, run by Her Majesty’s Prison Service

So, for the queen to be prosecuted, her own police force would have to investigate her, she would then need to prosecute herself, find herself guilty - and then lock herself up in own of her own prisons. That is, of course, unless she chose to pardon herself…

If a monarch did happen to commit a crime, it is likely that they would be forced to abdicate - after which, the justice system could treat them as a normal citizen.
