Perry also said: “These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations.”

Any information on that front as well?

In just the first week of June, a total of 10,114 undocumented immigrants were apprehended by Border Patrol, of which 8,284 were from countries other than Mexico. On a regular basis, undocumented immigrants from countries with ties to or which sponsor terrorism are being apprehended by Border Patrol.

We published a fact check overnight about the OTM tallies. I remain interested in information related to Perry’s statement about who the OTM individuals have been: “These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations.”

OK. Are there particular figures/counts that would support Perry’s statement the “other than Mexicans” lately crossing the border “are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations." I have yet to find any.
