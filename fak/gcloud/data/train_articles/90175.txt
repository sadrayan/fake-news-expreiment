Right-Wing Pastor Says Melania Trump Ordered White House To Be ‘Completely Exorcised’ Before Moving In
Last week, right-wing pastor Paul Begley, host of the “Coming Apocalypse” program, appeared on Sheila Zilinsky’s “Weekend Vigilante” podcast, where he claimed that First Lady Melania Trump ordered the White House to be “completely exorcised” before she moved in.

“When the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “At least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer. And I’ve got to say this, it might have started with the first lady.”

“The first lady, in that five hours when the Obamas and the Trumps went down to the Capitol and Trump was being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States,” Begley claimed, “Melania Trump said to her husband, ‘I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised.'”

Claiming that when the Obamas lived there, the White House was filled with “all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic,” Begley claimed that “Melania said, ‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests to go in and cleanse the White House or I will not spend on night in it.'”

“During that five hours when they were ripping out carpets and changing drapes,” Begley said, “there were people in there packing up every idol. The only thing that was left, Sheila, was one cross on one wall. They cleansed the White House. They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”
