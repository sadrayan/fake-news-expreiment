Fine unlikely for Avery Williamson of Tennessee Titans for wearing 9
Tennessee Titans linebacker Avery Williamson isn't expected to be fined for wearing cleats that paid tribute to 9/11 victims and first responders Sunday, a source told ESPN.

Williamson joined several other players, including New York Giants wide receivers Victor Cruz and Odell Beckham Jr. and Atlanta Falcons receiver Mohamed Sanu, in wearing the commemorative shoes.

Sanu told ESPN's Vaughn McClure that he doesn't anticipate a fine.

"One of the [team] equipment guys said it was cool," Sanu said of wearing the shoes. "If I get [a fine], that's fine. I'll be all right. "

Williamson said after Sunday's game that he is expecting to be fined. Two police union leaders from the New York area offered to pay the fine, but Titans coach Mike Mularkey said Monday he would pay the fine since he encouraged him to wear them.

Coaches and teams are not believed to be allowed to cover the costs of fines, however. The NFL did not immediately respond to a message seeking clarification.

The navy blue shoes Williamson and the other players wore had "9-11-01" on the back of the left shoe, with the "11" in the shape of the World Trade Center. The right shoe said "Never Forget."

The Nike swoosh was filled in with red and white stripes, and the laces were red.

Presuming Williamson hasn't been fined for a uniform violation before, he faced a potential fine of $6,076; a past violation would mean a fine of $12,154.
