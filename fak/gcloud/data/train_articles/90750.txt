Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC

Linked with:

Disclosure: Goldstein & Russell represent The NAACP Legal Defense Fund et al. as amici curiae in support of respondent.

Holding: The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment bar suits brought on behalf of ministers against their churches, claiming termination in violation of employment discrimi­nation laws. Moreover, because the respondent in this case was a minister within the meaning of the minis­terial exception, the First Amendment requires dismissal of her em­ployment discrimination suit against her religious employer.

Judgment: Reversed, 9-0, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts on January 11, 2012. Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion. Justice Alito also filed a concurring opinion, which was joined by Justice Kagan.
