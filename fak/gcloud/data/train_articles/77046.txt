UCR Reports
Uniform Crime Reports (UCR)

FDLE's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) system allows us to provide standardized reports on crime statistics based on data gathered from across the state. Reports that provide both summary and detail information are issued semi-annually and annually. Here you can find data from the most recently released Crime in Florida Report as well as links to previous years.Note: The data contained in data reports and spreadsheets available elsewhere on this website may include updates and/or late submissions from participating agencies that are not reflected in the various published reports; therefore, the figures in the two may not match. A discrepancy between published data and data contained in the data reports and spreadsheets does not necessarily indicate an error.The UCR Guide Manual (revised September 2017) and UCR Report Forms are available for download.Contact the UCR Program by email or telephone: ucr@fdle.state.fl.us (850) 410-7121
