Greek coastguards seize huge shipment of arms and ammo 'bound for Libya'
Greek authorities seized 5,000 shotguns and half a million rounds of ammunition found aboard the Haddad 1, a coast guard official said on Wednesday.

Videos released by the Hellenic Coast Guard show officers uncovering the arms, which it said had no accompanying documents and were concealed by furniture and gym mats.

Greek Marine Minister Christos Zois said: "The coast guard and other officers who participated in this operation deserve warm congratulations for their success in detecting and seizing the illegal weapons on this cargo ship.

“Their co-ordination, speed, high sense of professionalism and seriousness in the preparation and combination of information led to the identification of this ship and the large quantity of arms and ammunition.

“The weapons and ammunition is still being contined and we hope that soon we will have more information on this case."

The Turkish government claimed the weapons were destined for the Sudanese police force and were fully documented.

Foreign ministry spokesman Tanju Bilgic told Reuters: "If investigations by the Greek authorities show that the consignment is going to receivers other than those stated in the documentation, and if that is shared with us, naturally measures could be taken."
