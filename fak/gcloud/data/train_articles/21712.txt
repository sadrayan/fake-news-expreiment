Rep. Pocan Sets the Facts Straight with Rep. Duffy After He Refuses to Apologize
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) provided some facts for Rep. Sean Duffy (WI-07) after he dismissed Madison, WI, as a “communist” community on FOX News, got basic facts about the recount incorrect and refused to apologize for his alarming comments.

Rep. Duffy claimed only Dane County was doing a hand recount, but the state Elections Commission says 47 counties are conducting hand recounts and another 13 are doing partial hand recounts.

Communism is defined as an economic and political theory where all property and businesses are publically owned, but Dane County is responsible for 73% of the new jobs created in Wisconsin in the last decade.

Monica Moorehead the 2016 Workers World Party presidential candidate received 175 votes out of the more than 300,000 cast in Dane County.

Rep. Duffy has offered to send anyone in Madison who was offended by his comments a therapy dog to their “safe place” of choice. Yet he has not provided any details as to how his office plans to facilitate the transportation of so many dogs to the Madison area, nor has he specified what breed(s) of dog.

“I understand Rep. Duffy doesn’t want to appear weak by apologizing, but I want to make sure he at least has some facts next time he decides to shoot his mouth off on Fox News. Facts sometimes even matter there,” said Rep. Pocan.
