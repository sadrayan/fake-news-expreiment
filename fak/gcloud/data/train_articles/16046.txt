Your question intrigued me, so I did a little digging. Here is the legislation that brought Texas into the Union: http://thetexasrepublic.com/history-of-this-republic/1845-annexation-agreement/. If you look at the second section, under "Second" you will find the piece about Texas land. There isn't anything there that says the federal government must ask for permission to use Texas owned land for any purpose. I also did a little digging into the Texas "readmission" legislation, after it seceded from the Union during the Civil War, and there isn't anything there that is helpful.

So, and I'm certainly not a constitutional lawyer, but I would say that the claim that the feds need to ask for permission is incorrect.

WHAT WE DISCUSSED: "Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal gov't wants to create a park, they must ask permission!"

Iâ€™d appreciate any additional NPS guidance on this one.

Thanks.
