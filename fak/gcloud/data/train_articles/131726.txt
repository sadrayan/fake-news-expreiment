Nocturnus Libertus Launches Campaign to Defecate on Flag
Nocturnus Libertus starts the Sh*t on America challenge to incite members the groups. The groups went back and forth with Libertus for targeting a minor and calling her a terrorist. The Sh*t on America challenge was a response to this, to show the patriotic people who had gone back and forth with her that she didn’t care. She had grown very bold due to multiple failed attempts to prosecute her. People reported her countless times, nothing was ever done.

The post eventually went viral. It received 2,000 shares after vets found the post. People began searching for Nocturnus Libertus on the internet and instantly found the failsafe page we created in May 2015. It contained a list of all the terrible things Nocturnus Libertus did to people. If she ever went over the line people would find it. They did. It was our hope that if enough people found out they would fight back, and they did. The page received 20,000 views in the first couple of hours after the post. It will hit 100,000 today.

The backlash for this challenge was fast and furious. Tens of thousands of people reacted to Libertus. Some voiced their opinions while other people attacked her. Libertus incited it even further by posting pictures of people burning an American flag to incite the crowd. People became enraged, multiple people began showering her wall with pictures of the American flag. There were also explicit pictures shared that we cannot share here publicly. A battle between Patriots and Libertus raged on for several hours until Libertus lost in the early morning of July 11th. Noctunus Libertus’s main facebook profile was down by 5am EST 7/11/2015.
