Accused murderer spared abortion charge thanks to Cuomo’s new law
Prosecutors initially included a charge of abortion against the Queens man arrested Friday in his pregnant girlfriend’s murder — but rescinded it because of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s new Reproductive Health Act.

Queens District Attorney Richard Brown sent out a press release saying Anthony Hobson, 48, would be charged with second-degree abortion as well as murder in Sunday’s fatal stabbing of Jennifer Irigoyen, 35.

But a DA spokeswoman later told The Post that the abortion charge “was repealed by the Legislature, and this is the law as it exists today.”

Cuomo signed the RHA into law on Jan. 22, the 46th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.

The law removes abortion from the state’s criminal code and puts it into public health law.

It faced fierce opposition, with the New York State Catholic Conference warning that it “removes accountability for those who would harm unborn children outside the context of medical termination of pregnancy.”

Cuomo’s office did not comment on the murder case.
