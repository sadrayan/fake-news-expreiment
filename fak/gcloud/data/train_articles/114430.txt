Conversations With Tom Petty: Paul Zollo: 9781844498154: Amazon.com: Books
I am a dabbler in popular music. I like what I like but I by no means consider myself an expert. My knowledge of artists is also rather limited because I don't want my opinion of someone's personal life to play a role in what I think of their art. To wit, I tend to stay away from biographies of popular artists. On the other hand, I make an exception for autobiographies. I'm often interested in what an artist has to say about himself.



Of course, technically this is not an autobiography. But it is only Paul Zollo's book in the sense that he asked the questions. This entire book is a compilation of the author's interviews of Tom Petty and contains nothing but those interviews--no analysis, judgement, etc. Therefore, as a long time Heartbreakers fan, I decided to give this book a try. I'm glad I did because it is a fun and interesting read.



Admittedly, I enjoyed the first part of the book more than the second. I knew very little about Petty's life and hearing about his growing up and his first bands, his trip out to record his first record, was great. It was also fun to hear his opinions on his own fame and the people he met because of it. I always liked the persona he created in his music and I began to get a sense of where that came from.



The second part of the book had its pleasures too but, as a very amateur musician only, there was only so much I could get from the detailed discussions of the music, songs and albums. A true musician would probably have found this much more interesting. Still, it was interesting to get some of his feelings about his own work.



In the end, I'm glad I read this. I really felt I got an insight into Petty, his life and work (not always the case with musician's books). I'd highly recommend it to anyone with a real interest in popular music and for the Tom Petty fan, it is a must-read, of course.
