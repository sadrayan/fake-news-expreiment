[Hypothetical] Suing rapist for child support : legaladvice
For the purposes of the bot, I'm in Colorado, though I'm interested in laws for any jurisdiction.

I was futzing around on Facebook this morning. One of my friends had shared a meme stating that rapists cannot be sued for child support in any state, but they can sue for custody/visitation in like 30+ states. This seems suspicious so I thought I'd check with folks here. Four possible scenarios:

Can a female victim sue a male rapist for child support? Can a male rapist sue his female victim for visitation or custody rights with his child? Can a male rape victim sue his female rapist for visitation or custody rights with his child? Can a female rapist sue her male rape victim for child support?

I assume that for laws regarding a rapist to take effect (for example, for a rapist to be denied visitation rights), the rapist would have to have been found guilty of sexual assault for that law to become relevant. Which is a whole nother discussion. But unless someone has legally been found to have committed rape, a dispute for custody/child support is a dispute for custody/child support and the nature of the child's conception is not at issue. Yes?

Thanks.
