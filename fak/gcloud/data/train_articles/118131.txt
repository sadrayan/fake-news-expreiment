TWITTER Emergency services in Sweden after an attack on a train in Stockholm

The attack happened on a subway train at Sankt Eriksplan station in Stockholm, where emergency services rushed to the scene.



One passenger onboard said commuters were left in a state of panic, most suffering from breathing problems and others desperately rushing for the exits. Reports initially stated the man threw a rucksack into the carriage, but Swedish police have confirmed it was a noxious liquid instead – the motives behind the incident or the identity of the man involved are not yet known.

One witness, Alexander, 22, was on his way home from work and sat far back in the subway car when he noticed that people started to scream. He said: "Suddenly lots of people were running back toward me. They kept both their mouth and eyes closed and cried and coughed. "It seemed like pepper spray, or whatever it was that was thrown out, and we got huge respiratory problems. "Then when the train arrived at Fridhemsplan they evacuated it." The driver reportedly told a passenger a man in dark clothing and a hood sprayed something into the train then walked away. After passengers were evacuated off the scene, the train was moved to the Akeshov, where the carriage was examined.
