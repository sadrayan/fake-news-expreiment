HILLARY NEEDS HELP HANDLING STAIRS • REGATED
Like in 2008, when John McCain was constantly berated for his physical condition, this presidential race also has the terms “fit” and “stable” emerging as a buzzword for both campaigns. However, after yesterday’s photographs of Hillary Clinton apparently getting help in climbing up the stairs, the Republican campaign has a bigger leg to stand on.

The photos were published by Reuters — and they show Hillary; aged 68, two years younger than Donald Trump, attempting to climb the stairs of a home.

The images were taken this February in South Carolina, but did not emerge until Sunday, August 7th.

Definitely, not, looking good. (Cocktails in the car … lunch … or something else (?) … or just another, of a ‘thousand cuts’).” “Can’t walk, needs assistance, can’t think, often confused, can’t see, has double vision, wears long coats to hide her adult diapers, has multiple seizures on camera, left in middle of debate for unexplained reason, called Donald Trump her husband, massive coughing fits during speeches.” Clinton’s health has been a concern to some during this campaign after a variety of issues emerged.

So how will the Democrats attack Trump on his physical condition? One would think it would be easier since Trump is in his 70’s. However, it might be a little harder for them. Donald Trump is great at ascending stairs:
