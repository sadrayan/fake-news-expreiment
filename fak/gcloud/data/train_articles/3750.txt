Coast Guard rescue crews pull two from burning sailboat near Point Judith, R.I.
BOSTON – Coast Guard rescue crews pulled two people from their 60-foot sailing vessel after it caught fire Nov. 14, 2013, about two miles southwest of Point Judith, R.I.

Watchstanders at Coast Guard Sector Southeastern New England received notification from the vessel at about 6:30 p.m. that the pleasure craft had a fire in its engine room and that the vessel’s fire-fighting system had been activated.

Coast Guard Station Point Judith launched a crew with their heavy-weather capable 45-foot Response Boat-Medium to rescue the two aboard the vessel. Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod launched an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter. The two people were safely transferred back to Station Point Judith with no injuries reported.

The Coast Guard Cutter Ridley, an 87-foot patrol boat from Coast Guard Sector Long Island Sound, was diverted to watch over the sailboat overnight before salvage efforts could begin.

No pollution was reported.

Salvage efforts will continue Friday morning. Station Point Judith and local firefighters confirmed the fire was extinguished.

“The weather was against us last night,” said Lt. Bryan Swintek, the command center chief at Sector Southeast New England. “Our crews, worked together to make sure these two got home safe even with heavy seas and winds.”

A small craft advisory was in effect last night with seas reported at 4-6 feet and winds gusting to 25-knots.
