Disapproves of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leadership's inconsistent commitment to peacefully resolving the conflict in Uganda.

Urges the LRA and the government of Uganda to engage in good-faith negotiations to pursue a political solution to the conflict.

Encourages all regional parties to cease human rights violations and address, within the context of a broader national reconciliation process in Uganda, issues of accountability and impunity for those crimes against humanity already committed.

Urges leaders on both sides of the conflict in Uganda to renounce any intentions and halt any preparations to resume violence and to ensure that this message is conveyed to armed elements under their control.

Calls on the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and the heads of other similar governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations within the international community to continue efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda and to support a peaceful resolution to this crisis.
