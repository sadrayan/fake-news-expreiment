The Supreme Court's 2012 ruling on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed states to opt out of the law's Medicaid expansion, leaving each state's decision to participate in the hands of the nation's governors and state leaders.

Now, amid perennial debate over whether to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the fate of Medicaid expansion remains uncertain. However, the Nov. 6 midterm elections proved significant as voters in three conservative states decided to expand coverage to hundreds of thousands of people, while voters in Montana chose to allow their state's Medicaid expansion to expire in 2019.

In this latest iteration of our Medicaid map, we've determined each state's position position and outlined any possible expansion efforts.
