Speed limits
You must not drive faster than the speed limit for the type of road and your type of vehicle. The speed limit is the absolute maximum - it doesn’t mean it’s safe to drive at this speed in all conditions.

A speed limit of 30 miles per hour ( mph ) or 48 kilometres per hour ( km/h ) usually applies, unless you see signs showing otherwise.

Vans, car-derived vans and dual-purpose vehicles

Most vans:

have a lower speed limit than cars

must follow the speed limits for goods vehicles of the same weight

Vehicles under 2 tonnes laden (loaded) weight may qualify as a ‘car-derived van’ or ‘dual-purpose vehicle’. These vehicles have the same speed limits as cars.

Motorhomes

Motorhomes or motor caravans are classed as goods vehicles if they:

carry goods for exhibition and sale

are used as a workshop

are used for storage

Locally set speed limits

Local councils can set their own speed limits in certain areas, and these must be clearly signed.

For example:

20 mph zone in a built-up area near a school

zone in a built-up area near a school 50 mph (rather than 60 mph ) limit on a stretch of road with sharp bends

Speed limiters

A speed limiter must be fitted on:

vehicles with more than 8 passenger seats, eg buses, minibuses, coaches, stretch limousines

goods vehicles with a maximum laden weight of more than 3.5 tonnes

Speed limiters are designed to reduce accidents. They limit the maximum speed of a vehicle by restricting the fuel supply to the engine. Having a speed limiter may mean that your vehicle can’t reach the speed limit.
