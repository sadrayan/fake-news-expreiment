Russell is exactly right. Trump was hosting a barbecue for military families on July 4th 2018. Where do people come up with this shit and what is the purpose to send out a post like this? If you don't like Trump or any other person in politics there is

always plenty of true stories that you can find and I don't care if you are on the left or the right. When you post crap like this you just look like an idiot and too lazy to take 3 seconds to verify a story. Intellectual dishonesty folks. If you guys really hate Trump that bad you would be better off focusing on facts because every time you spew some nonsence like this post you lose a little more ground. If Democrats really want a chance next election the good common sense folks in the middle of the Democratic party better get a handle on the leftist agenda that is ruining your party. Most Democrats are decent people just like most Republicans are but the extremists on both sides can be pretty decisive. Grow up and think for yourselves folks!
