Schumer calls cops after forged sex scandal charge
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he was the victim of a fake news hit on Tuesday, and has turned over to Capitol Police a document that purports to detail lurid sexual harassment accusations by a former staffer.

Why it matters: This was an apparent effort to dupe reporters and smear a senator â€” both symptoms of an amped-up news environment where harassment charges are proliferating and reporters have become targets for fraud.
