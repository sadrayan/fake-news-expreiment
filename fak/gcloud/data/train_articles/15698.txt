To arrive at our statement that Travis County has the highest urban county tax rate, we used the attached information, which references the 6 largest cities in Texas, their counties, and the effective 2012 tax rate of those counties.

Based on our conversation today, it seems that the point of contention is what constitutes an urban county. Since there is no statutory definition of an urban county, we defined it as a county that has a "big city" in it that is often compared to other big cities around Texas. We chose to compare the 6 major population centers and the counties that contain them. These counties are often compared to one another when trying to determine best practices for other counties to follow.

Following up:

Meant to say "total tax rate" on spreadsheet, sorry about that.

Source for 2012 total tax rates: http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/proptax/taxrates/

Source for 2010 city population: https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/popcity12010.html

I seemed to have erred in transcribing Houston's population. It's slightly lower than my spreadsheet indicates: 2,099,451 (spreadsheet says 2100263)

As to the use of the word "now," and the political context, we were simply saying "At this very moment."

Thanks!

Jim
