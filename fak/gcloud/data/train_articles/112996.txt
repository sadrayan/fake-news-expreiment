BREAKING: Supreme Court Just Destroyed Every Muslim In America
The Supreme Court is deciding whether or not to allow Islam to be taught in public schools. Radical Islam and ways to stop it will most likely be taught to students. Neil Gorsuch said:

“The administration ought not to get involved with religion, but this is a whole different situation. In public schools, children are told that Islam is a peaceful religion, but reality contradicts these teachings.”

On Monday, the nine Supreme Court justices gathered to determine the faith of this case with close connections to Obama and Democrats. The High court ruled 5-4 and Neil Gorsuch gave the decisive vote. The decision was that only thing of the Islam history that will be taught to children in public schools will be radical Islam and how people and contribute for its destruction.

In his very first opinion for the Supreme Court, Gorsuch noted:

“THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY HAS NO BUSINESS BEING INVOLVED IN RELIGION, BUT THIS ISN’T A GOVERNMENT ISSUE OR A RELIGIOUS ISSUE. THIS IS ABOUT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH INTERPRETING THE LAWS AS THEY APPLY TO THE TEACHING OF RELIGION. WE SHOULD BE TEACHING ANY RELIGIONS IN THIS COUNTRY BESIDES STANDARD JUDEO-CHRISTIANITY, AS OUR FOUNDERS WANTED, AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULDN’T BE FILLING THE CHILDREN WITH LIES ABOUT ISLAM BEING A “RELIGION OF PEACE” WHEN THEY SEE THE CARNAGE ON THE NEWS ALMOST EVERY DAY. IT IS OUR DUTY AS AMERICANS FIRST AND JUDGES SECOND TO SAFEGUARD THE WAY OUR CHILDREN ARE INDOCTRINATED.”

After the victory of this case on appeal in the 17th district court, the government of former president Obama has remained ineffective and without influence and friends in the judiciary.

With this ruling, all lessons about Islam in public schools will come to an end. This is an addition to the vote to stop teaching Islamic beliefs or Sharia law as a part of world history.
