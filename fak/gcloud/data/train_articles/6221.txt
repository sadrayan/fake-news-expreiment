Gardner statement on the “Repeal of Obamacare Act”
WASHINGTON D.C. – Congressman Cory Gardner (R-CO) released the following statement on the bipartisan vote to repeal the President’s healthcare law:

“Today, the House sent a message to President Obama that his healthcare law is still bad policy despite being ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court. Opposition to the President’s healthcare law has only grown since it passed. Many Democrats continue to join us in the stand against higher taxes and additional mandates on job creators.

“Small businesses and the American people cannot afford President Obama’s countless new regulations and tax increases. There is a right way and a wrong to improve our country's healthcare system, and the President’s healthcare law just isn’t working. We need patient-centered care and lower costs. It is not too late to start over with a full repeal and replacement of the President’s healthcare law.”
