2014: Senate Bill 367 - Transportation Funding for New Hampshire

In 2014 the NH House and Senate approved a plan to raise the Road Toll by 4.2 cents per gallon and apply the money raised to the I-93 Expansion, and critical road and bridge projects across the State. The plan is working and the NHDOT is making great progress.

Senate Bill 367 raises approximately $34M per year - Where does the money go?

Most of the money has gone, or will be going directly to:

Background Information

What is Senate Bill 367?

Enacted into law in 2014, Senate Bill 367 addressed several important transportation issues. It eliminated certain ramp tolls on the Everett Turnpike; it established a committee to study the effectiveness of the NHDOT; and it raised the road toll (gas tax) by 4.2 cents per gallon to pay for the widening of Interstate I-93 and other critical road and bridge projects across the state. This is the first increase in New Hampshire's state road toll since 1991 and became effective on July 1, 2014. The tax and program will end in 2034.

The Projects

Projects include reconstruction and resurfacing of secondary roadways, bridge repairs on DOT owned bridges, municipal bridges, and Interstate 93. For specific information on the I-93 projects under construction please review the fact sheets for each project: 14633B, 14633D, 14633H, and 14633I.

The Revenue

The program is expected to generate approximately $34M per year in revenue starting in Fiscal Year 2015. Known formally as the “road toll” this increased revenue from motor fuel sales will be dedicated to infrastructure investments.

New revenues will fund

work on red-listed

municipal bridges.

Innovative Financing

Transportation Infrastructure Finance Innovation Act (TIFIA).

In 2016 the NHDOT secured a low interest rate loan (1.09%) from the US Department of Transportation which leverages the SB 367 funds to advance paving and bridge work. A $200M loan under the TIFIA program is being used to fund construction of four I-93 Projects: 14633B, 14633D, 14633H, and 14633I.

The following redlist bridges are anticipated to be funded under the TIFIA Pledged Bridge Program using SB 367 funds.
