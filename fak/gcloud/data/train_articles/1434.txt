Grand Homecoming Welcomes War-weary Marine Reservists Company Looks Forward To Settling Into Life`s Regular Routines
They were shot at, bombed, and told they would probably die, but on Monday, the Marine reservists who helped lead the allied drive to Kuwait City arrived home to cheering crowds at Miami International Airport.

Thousands of family members and friends carrying flowers and flags, yellow ribbons and signs greeted the 185 part-time Marines from the Anti-Tank (TOW) Company of the Marine Corps` 8th Tank Battalion.

It was a sight many of them thought they would never see after they were assigned to help lead the charge into Kuwait during the Middle East war, battling Soviet-made Iraqi tanks all the way.

The officers ``estimated our life expectancy would be one hour after the ground war started. I was going to be happy if I was going to come back in a wheelchair. I owe it all to God,`` said Lance Cpl. Steven Rodriguez, 19, a Miami-Dade Community College student.

The homecoming of the Marine company, which has members from Broward, Dade, Palm Beach and Monroe counties, was marred by flight delays. The delays angered some of the well-wishers, many of whom had taken time off from work and waited for hours in the sun.

The Marines, who were coming from Camp LeJeune, N.C., eventually were split up onto two flights, one of which landed at noon and the other at 5:20 p.m.

Becky Combs of Coral Springs wept when she found out her son, Ed Pickering, 21, would not be on the first flight. She and a dozen other well-wishers stayed until Pickering arrived on the later flight, to a smaller but just as emotional crowd.

``I`m so relieved and happy he`s home,`` she said. ``It was great. It was terrific.``

Fran and Erv Daigle of Davie spent hours in the morning with about 20 other friends and relatives, waiting for the arrival of their son, Lance Cpl. Joe Daigle, 21.
