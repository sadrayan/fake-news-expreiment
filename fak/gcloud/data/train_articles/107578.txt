There is no California Ban on .45 ACP Ammo
A story from a fake-news website has sent the internet and social media into overdrive. So, as they say in the Navy, “Now hear this”: There is no truth whatsoever to reports that California has implemented a state-wide ban on the sale and possession of all .45 ACP ammunition with a 60-day grace period to allow police to begin enforcing the ban. There was just enough detail and superficial knowledge represented in the fake news report to lure in the unsuspecting. Any development that big would not become law overnight and there would be tremendous opposition, as we saw in the recent and quickly withdrawn attempt by ATF to eventually ban 5.56 green-tip ammunition.
