CHI-maker meets 1,200 new positions head-on
Farouk Shami, CEO of the Houston company that manufactures the ultra-popular CHI hair styling device, has sold his South Korean plant and is on the verge of severing ties with China as part of his effort to bring at least 1,200 manufacturing jobs to Houston within the next year.

This week marked the grand opening of CHI USA, a $23 million, 500,000-square-foot manufacturing facility that will ultimately produce more than 50 different Farouk Systems Inc. products, including hair care and styling tools such as flat irons and blow dryers. The company is building the North Houston facility from the ground-up.

“As an American citizen, as a Houstonian, as a proud Texan, as a manufacturer, I’m proud to be bringing jobs back to the U.S.,” says Shami, who emigrated from Ramallah, Palestine, to the United States in 1965.

Although Farouk Systems was scheduled to hold a job fair at the new factory on 880 E. Richey Road on July 30, the shifting of the manufacturing jobs to Houston from overseas will take place gradually, with the bulk of the positions being relocated here by 2010.
