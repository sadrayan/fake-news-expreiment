WASHINGTON, DC – House Energy and Commerce Committee leaders today began an investigation following the release of a video revealing the Planned Parenthood Senior Director of Medical Services discussing the sale of fetal body parts. The sale of fetal body parts for profit is illegal.

“This video is abhorrent and rips at the heart. The committee will get to the bottom of this appalling situation,” commented full committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI), Vice Chairman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy (R-PA), and Health Subcommittee Chairman Joe Pitts (R-PA).
