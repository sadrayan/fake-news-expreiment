Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes Are Rumored to Hit Shelves in 2018, and We Can't Wait

The first of the rumors (and most exciting, TBH) is Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes. You may be wondering how General Mills will pull off using the name of Kellogg's hit cereal on the package. As it turns out, " frosted flakes" is not trademarked by the company. In fact, there are other generic brands that go by the same name. This explains why there's no sign of Tony the Tiger and his tiger stripes on the (rumored) box. But, let's be honest â€” with or without Tony, this cereal combo is gonna be GRE-E-REAT!

Next up, we have Cinnamon Toast Crunch Shreds: the classic cinnamon-toast flavor packed into shredded wheat bites, similar to Kellogg's Mini Wheats. Yummm!

If you thought it couldn't get better, think again. Peanut Butter Chocolate Shreds look like an amazing creation derived from Reese's Puffs. The texture of a Mini Wheat with the taste of Reese's will be too much to handle.

Lastly, there's the limited-edition Peach Cheerios. As a classic cereal that's hard to get sick of, we can only imagine that Cheerios with a splash of peach flavor will be just as fruity and delicious as it sounds.
