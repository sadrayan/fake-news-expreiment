Health care – Refugees
The Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP) provides limited, temporary coverage of health-care benefits to people in the following groups who aren’t eligible for provincial or territorial health insurance

protected persons, including resettled refugees;

refugee claimants; and

certain other groups.

The IFHP does not cover the cost of health-care services or products that a person may claim (even in part) under a public or private health insurance plan. The IFHP does not coordinate benefits with other insurance plans/programs so co-payments aren’t possible.

If you are a refugee selected for resettlement, you may also be covered for certain medical services before you leave for Canada. Find out:

if you are eligible for pre-departure medical services and
