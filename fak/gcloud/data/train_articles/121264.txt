Costs for Medicare drug coverage
You'll make these payments throughout the year in a Medicare drug plan:

Your actual drug plan costs will vary depending on:

The drugs you use

The plan you choose

Whether you go to a pharmacy in your plan's network

Whether the drugs you use are on your plan's formulary

Whether you get Extra Help paying your Medicare Part D costs

Look for specific Medicare drug plan costs, and then call the plans you're interested in to get more details.

Note If your drug costs are higher than what you paid last year, talk to your doctor. There may be lower cost drugs you can use instead. This could save you in out-of-pocket costs throughout the year. If you want more information on drug prices, you can look at dashboards that highlight which manufacturers have been increasing their prices and also show other year-to-year drug price information. These are general or total prices and increases may not match changes in what youâ€™ll pay.

If you have limited income and resources, your state may help you pay for Part A and/or Part B. You may also qualify for Extra Help to pay for your Medicare prescription drug coverage.
