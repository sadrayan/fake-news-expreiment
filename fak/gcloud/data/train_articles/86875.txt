What Donald Trump Got Wrong on Stop-and-Frisk
All right, as Mr. Trump said, let’s check it.

A Google search for “Historical New York City Crime Data” will bring you to a site with charts of serious felonies.

Frisks went down. So has murder, a steady decline that has continued, with slight annual variations, through this year.

In the word-fact-salad-spinner used by Mr. Trump, those details land upside down. Also, he repeated a more common mistake about the decline of the stop-and-frisk tactics, attributing it to a federal judge hearing a class-action lawsuit against the city, and to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, who succeeded Mr. Bloomberg in 2014.

“It was terminated by the current mayor,” Mr. Trump said.

Actually, no.

Last year, the city police conducted 22,939 stops, or about 63 a day. So stop-and-frisk was not terminated by Mr. de Blasio, or by anyone else for that matter. It’s true that the use of the tactic has declined. During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg, the number of reported stops skyrocketed, but then was scaled back as the city faced pressure from the class-action litigation, brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.

By the end of 2013, the year Shira A. Scheindlin, the federal judge hearing the case, ruled that the city’s wholesale search practices violated the Constitution, the number of stops had declined by 72 percent from its peak in 2011.
