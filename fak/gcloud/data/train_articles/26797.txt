Supreme Court rules against Islam being taught in public schools
It seems that it rests with the Supreme Court to decide the fate of Islam being taught in public schools. They have made a decision that students will be taught about radical Islam and ways they can stop it.

As Neil Gorsuch said, the administration ought not to get involved with religion, but this is a whole different situation. In public schools, children are told that Islam is a peaceful religion, but reality contradicts these teachings.

The nine Supreme Court justices gathered on Monday to make a decision about the case with close connections to Obama and Democrats.

The High court ruled 5-4, with Neil Gorsuch giving the decisive vote, according to Trenddify. The justices decided that the only thing of the Islam history taught to children in these public schools will be the one of radical Islam and how they can contribute for its downfall.

Justice Gorsuch, in his very first opinion for the Supreme Court, noted:

“THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY HAS NO BUSINESS BEING INVOLVED IN RELIGION, BUT THIS ISN’T A GOVERNMENT ISSUE OR A RELIGIOUS ISSUE. THIS IS ABOUT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH INTERPRETING THE LAWS AS THEY APPLY TO THE TEACHING OF RELIGION. WE SHOULD BE TEACHING ANY RELIGIONS IN THIS COUNTRY BESIDES STANDARD JUDEO-CHRISTIANITY, AS OUR FOUNDERS WANTED, AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULDN’T BE FILLING THE CHILDREN WITH LIES ABOUT ISLAM BEING A “RELIGION OF PEACE” WHEN THEY SEE THE CARNAGE ON THE NEWS ALMOST EVERY DAY.”

Gorsuch added,

“IT IS OUR DUTY AS AMERICANS FIRST AND JUDGES SECOND TO SAFEGUARD THE WAY OUR CHILDREN ARE INDOCTRINATED.”

Former president Obama’s government, following the victory of this case on appeal in the 17th district court, has remained powerless and without influence and friends in the judiciary.

This ruling brings an end of lessons about Islam in public schools, which is a huge blow for the Obama protected Muslims. It is an addition to the vote from a week ago that prevents the teaching of Islamic beliefs or Sharia law as a part of world history.
