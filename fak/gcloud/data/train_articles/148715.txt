Where do I find information on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE)?
The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) programme provides a legislative framework for the transformation of South Africa's economy. The Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act, [No. 53 of 2003], as amended, aims to advance economic transformation and enhance the economic participation of black people in the South African economy.

Information on the programme can be found on the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) website.

Other documents include sector charters, scorecards and codes of good practice.
