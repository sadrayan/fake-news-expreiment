Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD)
MEG Energy uses steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, technology to recover bitumen from the oil sands.

In SAGD operations, pairs of stacked horizontal wells are drilled into the reservoir about 400 metres beneath the surface. The top well injects steam to heat the bitumen, which separates from the sand and collects with the produced water in the lower well, approximately five metres below. The bitumen is then pumped to the surface, where it is separated from the water. The water is treated and recycled into the system.

The steam-oil ratio, or SOR, is an indicator of the efficiency of a SAGD operation. Generally, an SOR of less than 3 is considered to be an efficient operation. MEG achieved an SOR of 2.3 in 2017 at its Christina Lake project. Where implemented, the eMSAGP process has reduced the steam-oil ratio to an industry-leading range of 1.0 to 1.25. Lower rates equate to greater cost efficiency, as less steam-generating infrastructure is required. Low rates also mean greater energy efficiency, as less natural gas is used in the process.

In 2017, MEG recycled 90% of the water utilized to produce steam. Additional requirements are found from deep water sources that are not suitable for consumption or agricultural uses. No surface water is used in the process.

SAGD has several advantages over oil sands mining:
