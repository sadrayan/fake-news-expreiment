The Bethany Slavic Church hosted a three-hour funeral, which included a large choir, brass band, Pentecostal preaching and prayers for strength and healing.

The bodies of Alina, 23, Emmanuela, 3 and Avenir, 2, were together in a large open casket in the center of the church’s front platform.

Long lines of mourners filed by to view the deceased, who were well known in Sacramento’s Russian-American community.

Denis Bukhantsov, the husband and father, is now left with only his 6-month-old son Mark, who was not hurt in Tuesday’s attack.

Burkhantsov's 19-year-old brother, Grigoriy, was arrested Wednesday morning and faces murder charges.

Sacramento Sheriff Scott Jones spoke during the service.

“The person responsible for this will never hurt anybody again, but that is little comfort,” he said. “It does not bring joy or closure.”

Alina Bukhantsov's father spoke of her cheerful disposition and deep Christian faith.

“In God’s plan, the righteous person would be taken from this Earth,” Vyacheslav Oliferchik said. “How painful that is.”

Tears flowed freely as pictures of the happy, young family were shown on large screens.

”It’s just a very senseless tragedy,” said Ivan Yechenko, a family friend. “It’s hard to talk about and hard to comprehend it.”

The burial followed the service at Quiet Haven, a Russian community cemetery near the Slavic church.
