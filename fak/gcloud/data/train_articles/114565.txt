[Notes:ANCHOR VOICE]

One man's wish of spending eternity with what he loved most has come true.

90-year-old Lonnie Holloway was laid to rest Tuesday ... In his prized possession.

SOT: "I've been in the wrecking business (on cam) 30 years and this is the first time we ever buried anybody in their car."

Yes, Holloway was buried in the front seat of his 19-73 Pontiac Catalina. In the passenger seat ... Holloway's collection of guns.

SOT: He said that when he died he don't want to leave none of his guns here because somebody might...might take his guns and go shoot somebody. (Covered w/MS men pulling Holloway's guns out of a car) So he said he's just going to take 'em with him.

Some family members were surprised by Holloway's unorthodox decision.

Holloway is buried next to his wife -- who died two years ago.

Some family members say he left his house to his dog.
