100 Nevada Women for Hillary – Hillary for Nevada – Medium
100 Nevada Women for Hillary

With the Nevada Caucus just 100 days away, the Hillary for Nevada campaign is announcing 100 members of the Nevada Women for Hillary team, a group of civic, business, and community leaders endorsing and supporting Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.

“I am supporting Hillary Clinton because she has a longstanding record of fighting for women, children, and families” said first female Secretary of State and Attorney General of Nevada Frankie Sue Del Papa. “I have no doubt that Hillary will fight for us: for equal pay, affordable child care, and a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions. Women have made tremendous progress in expanding opportunity, but there are still many barriers to break down. I am proud to join Hillary in the fight to crack that highest glass ceiling.”
