SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Noteworthy Holtz
Seven memorable things that Lou Holtz has already said since arriving at Notre Dame, even before coaching his first game there:

On why he doesn't want his players dancing in the end zone: ''We like to act like they've been there before.''

On the pressure to win: ''One year at Arkansas, every time I smelled flowers I'd begin to look around for the coffin.''

On the pressure to win at South Bend: ''I went to a game here once, and the fans were unarmed.''

On the cowbell back: ''A cowbell back is one who carries the ball 20 times on Saturday and doesn't come to practice on Monday with a doctor, a lawyer or an agent.''

On his favorite play: ''It's the 22 play. When they blow the whistle, we want a pile of 22 players 8 yards downfield from where we snapped the ball.''

On Notre Dame's lack of team speed: ''If we ran a quarterback sweep, we'd get called for delay of game.''

On his own lack of speed: ''I'm so slow it takes me an hour and a half to watch '60 Minutes.' ''
