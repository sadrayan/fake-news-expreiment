There are many different schools of thought why crimes are decreasing nationally and the answer you'll get will vary dependent on which theoretical paradigm the criminologist subscribes to. The range goes from simple demographic changes (aging of the population) and effects of abortion legislation to better policing, security and surveillance technology (esp. cell phones), proactive policing, or mandatory minimum sentencing laws for chronic offenders. I personally do not believe that it is declining, but shifting. I think the decline is deceptive because it occurs only in traditional, "terrestrial" crimes (esp. street and violent crimes), but doesn't capture financial frauds, white collar crimes, and all crimes committed online which are sharply increasing.
