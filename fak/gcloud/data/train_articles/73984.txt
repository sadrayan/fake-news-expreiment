These women have accused Trump of sexual harassment
There are a number of allegations of misconduct against Donald Trump. This list represents the ones CNN has verified.

At the second presidential debate, CNN's Anderson Cooper posed a pointed question to Donald Trump in regards to the leaked 2005 Access Hollywood video that caught him saying of women that he felt entitled to "grab them by the pussy."

"For the record, you're saying you never did that?" Cooper asked.

Trump, downplaying his remarks as "locker room talk," denied he had ever kissed or groped women without consent.

"No one has more respect for women than I do," he added.

His denial, though, has opened the floodgates for women who are now accusing him of sexual harassment spanning from groping on planes to unwanted advances in the Trump Tower.

The presidential candidate has strongly denied wrongdoing, going so far as to threaten lawsuits against media outlets who published new claims.

For some of the women, they felt compelled to speak out against Trump after hearing him tell Cooper that he had not groped women without their consent. Here's what they have said so far:

The reality is this: for the media to wheel out a politically motivated Democratic activist with a legal dispute against this same resort owned by Mr. Trump does a disservice to the public, and anyone covering this story should be embarrassed for elevating this bogus claim."
