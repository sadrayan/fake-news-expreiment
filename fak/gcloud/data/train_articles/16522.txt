Below is the information provided by Auto Theft. Please let me know if you have any questions.

In 2016, approximately 41% of the vehicles had keys available.

In 2017, approximately 32% of the vehicles had keys available.

The percentages can vary significantly from month to month as evidenced in the Dec. 2017 statistics of 51%.

These statistics are only for the City of Austin and do not include Auto Thefts where the availability of the keys is unknown.

From 2016 to 2017 there has been a decrease, but still approximately one-third of the auto theft cases can be attributed to the availability of the keys.
