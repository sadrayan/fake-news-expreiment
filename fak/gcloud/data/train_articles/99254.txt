Notorious Pedophile ‘Crucified’ By Vigilante Gang As Warning To Child Abusers
A gang of vigilantes has captured a notorious child abuser and “crucified” him on a road sign to send a warning out to pedophile rings.

The rapist was snatched from police custody before being killed, maimed and then strapped to a wooden post and hung from a huge road sign at a busy intersection.

His castrated, naked body was found with a sign around his neck that read:

“This happened to me for being a child rapist and it is going to happen to all the pedophiles, scandalmongers, traitors… Be aware that this is not a game.”

Police believe the killing is the work of the infamous Knights Templar Mexican drug cartel who has recently appointed themselves as violent moral law enforcers in Mexico.

29-year-old Eduardo Cruz had been taken into police custody after being caught raping an 11-year-old boy.
