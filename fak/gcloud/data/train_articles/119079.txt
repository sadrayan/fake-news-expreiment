Report Copyright Violation I was hit by crazy Islamist bitch screaming Allah Ahckbar on the Strip! Best friend got knees clipped! Just heading to Absinthe; the show at Ceasars Palace. Was walking down the strip heading to our show; as we parked at the Paris for dinner and walked down the street to go to the show. As we were walking accross the street, this car comes flying through the red light, we had right of way and walking accross the intersection, she ran up on the sidewalk and smashed into a group of people walking accross the street and into the group of people at the corner. She did not slow down and appeared to accelerate as she hit the sidewalk. There's a huge row of plants and bushes seperating the sidewalk and the strip, she ran through both, probably 40-45 miles per hour. People were flying off the front of her car and people were smashing into other people as she plowed through the crowd. My friend was walking ahead of us as he was making a joke of the minion characters that were lined up on the sidewalk, wanted to pose for a picture, the car hit a bush and the bush smacked into his legs; he buckled from the impact and fell down in writhing pain. He is listed as one of the 36 injured but I will not name his name. We spent the last 5 hours on the strip giving our report to police and this is the first chance I've had to come on here and post. I've been following this story HERE as I know this is the only place to get the REAL news!



As this unfolded, the only thing I recall as this happened is the insane sound of her car accelerating and the voice from the car was screaming Allah Akbar! I've heard the sound enough times on the news and posts on here that I was waiting for a bomb to blow up or guns to start firing. My friends ducked into the Hard Rock Casino which is right by the Paris and waited to see if something else was going to happen. After 30 minutes we went back to the street with total chaos, cops and ambulances shutting everything down and a systematic closure of casinos closely. We were told to leave if able, and not to linger but more and more people gathered to see what was going on.



I thought this shit wouldn't hit Vegas but I am first hand proof that's it's here, in Sin City with evil Islam at its roots! This bitch was crazy and was screaming with both windows down! I didn't notice a kid in the car but after reading the news that a toddler was in there it makes me sick!



I'm coming down from an adrenaline rush like I've never had. I'm ex-Air Force and I wish I was active duty so I could FRY these fuckin radicals from my country! Watch yourselves people; they come out of no-where and will hit you where you least expect it! I don't think it's a coincidence it was in front of the Paris either, fuck these fucking terrorists!!

All her windows were down, I saw her front window completely smashed and she was screaming Allah Ackbar as loud as she could! I heard it twice before she was out of range, she rolled up on the sidewalk TWO more times before she took off, pretty sure she clipped a double decker bus which I thought would stop the car, but she reversed and kept going! Don't let the news fool you! They're saying it's not terrorist related but she was all terrorist!! Anti Terrorism units were ALL OVER the strip with FBI and other unidentifiable officials. We saw them all show up and they almost literally kicked most of the cops out of the area where we were.

I am not so assured either that it wasn't maybe an attack. Lots of people gathered in groups and just looking for fun. Not a speeding car running them down. I am waiting for the back story.

Makes sense for them to strike directly upon the heart of the problem. Vegas, by accepting the title of sin city, should not be surprised.

All my family lives here in Vegas and Boulder City. They were the first to know, but every time I pulled my phone out to talk to them, I was approached by cops and other officials that this is a no picture or video situation. Fox5 and other local stations were interviewing people. My buddy was getting checked out by paramedics and was cleared to leave the scene. They would let me talk on the phone but were very strict on everyone trying to take pics or video. I've been on such a rush these last couple hours that I've wanted to do nothing but retaliate against these evil FUCKS! I wish there was something more I could do right now!

In posters defence.

I just saw car on our news, and immediately thought to myself..."why is the front windscreen fucked n all the side windows ok?"

As she would have to be the one that shut them...that car should be treated as a crime scene...therefore it (correctly ) would be recovered as it was found. No wheels to turn no one to lay a finger on it and lifted onto a recovery vehicle with a hiab crane. Then placed in a sterile Soco bay at said recovery depot, then gone over with a fine tooth comb by investigating teams.

Which if you add 2 N 2 with the driver allegedly having windows down throwing snackbar. Then it would make sense she could also upped the windows after this n therefore no damage to them.

OP, one of these witnesses say the woman was black. Confirm/deny? Quoting: chrono_



She was black as far as I could tell, apparently had a kid in the car which I didn't see as it happened. I've lived in Vegas for 27 years and never thought this would hit so close to home, but it did. I don't know what to think or say. Could have been me if I were a minute behind in the crowd. I thought something else was bound to happen when I realized I was right by the Paris. Had just seen on here that there was a potential bomb on a Paris flight and had talked to my friends about it earlier in the day. It didn't make the main stream news so everyone was like whatever. All I know is it happened so fast it was surreal as she ran up the curb, people flying everywhere but she was still accelerating, like some shit I've seen on liveleak. Been hoping someone would post some video on here but haven't seen any videos at all, even though half the people around us were on their phone. If anyone was there and has video post them here.
