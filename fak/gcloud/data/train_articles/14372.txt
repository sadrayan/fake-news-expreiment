Chabot Statement on Obamacare Repeal
Washington, D.C. - Congressman Steve Chabot (R-Westwood) released the following statement on Thursday following House passage of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act:



"The American people deserve a whole lot better than what they’re currently getting under Obamacare. Premiums have been skyrocketing, deductibles are so high that many people who technically have health care coverage under Obamacare, can’t afford to use it, and insurance companies have been dropping out of the health care exchanges left and right. Quite simply, Obamacare is close to a death spiral, if it’s not already in one.



"The legislation the House passed today is the first step to getting our health care system back on the right path. The House bill takes the power over health care decisions out of the hands of the bureaucrats in Washington and returns it to doctors and patients. Additionally, in the place of one-size-fits-all federal mandates, it gives states the ability, if they choose, to craft health care solutions that work better for local patients, while at the same time guaranteeing that those with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied health care coverage."
