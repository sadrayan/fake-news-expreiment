Forgot but the study director submitted the manuscript to the Wildlife Society Bulletin, which is a publication of the Journal of Wildlife Management. You have a published abstract from the Wild Pig Conference. We can send you a copy of the manuscript after it is published. Until then it is CBI, otherwise we have no control of where it ends up.

Is independent research in order? Why or why not?

Not necessary. We do research under what is called Good Laboratory Practices, which is required by the EPA. No one can match the quality and integrity of the work.

I just saw the mention, at the link I provided, of possible missing data on Kaput. What did that reference? Scroll down to the link in my email below.

An EPA registered pesticide requires stability of the chemical in the formula available to the public. The product is stored in the marketing container on the shelf at room temperature over a one year period. The bait is analyzed every 3 months for the warfarin concentration. That analysis is done at the beginning and at 3, 5, 9, and 12 months after manufacturing. The goal is to ensure the bait is good after 1 year and the concentration of warfarin is plus or minus 10% of what the EPA label requires. In our case the concentrations was within 1% of the label requirements.
