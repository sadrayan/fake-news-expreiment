Does Mexico have a wall on its southern border?
Alternative facts again. There is no wall. Just some occasional fencing. Walls are reluctantly erected only when there is a major security threat or when countries are at war. Even Israel walled Palestine fairly recently, as terrorist attacks were getting out of control. Back in the 90’s you could easily cross between Israel and Palestine. I enjoyed shopping at Gazan markets and having delicious food and coffee in Ramallah more times than I care to count. Many Palestinians worked in Israel.

Mexico is not at war with any of its southern neighbours, neither the US is at war with Mexico. There are no terrorist attacks perpetrated by Guatemalans in Mexico neither Mexicans are blowing themselves up in the US.

Stop rationalizing silly and dangerous ideas. Get an education, travel the world, meet ordinary people and just don’t believe media and politicians whatever their agenda is.
