ABSTRACT: Food is heterogeneous mixture of complex chemicals that react with one another or with any other chemical comes into direct contact with them. Fresh and processed foods are exposed to various storage and processing conditions that may trigger reactions between chemicals or may facilitate movement of active micro molecules from the package surfaces into the food. The primary aim for packaging food is to extent it shelf life by protecting it wholesomeness in such a way that safe food will reach consumer’s table. This can be achieved by creating packaging atmosphere that will maintain the levels and quality of all the nutrients present, avoid changes in the chemical composition and prevent entrance of any foreign material. Interaction between food and packaging materials is highly undesirable and it draws more attention when the composition of the migrants is unknown or was not proved to be safe. Packaging materials are required to be absolutely inert so that they will not interact in any way with the food. Scientific evidences proved that food components can react with some packaging materials and produced chemicals that may be dangerous to consumers. Chemicals in some food contact surfaces do not really react with the food but they do release poisonous chemicals into the food when they come into direct contact. The extent of food contamination by package’s chemicals in both flexible and rigid packaging materials depend on nature and composition of the food, nature and composition of the packaging material and properties of the storage or processing conditions.
