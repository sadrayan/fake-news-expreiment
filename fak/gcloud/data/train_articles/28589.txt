Senator Ted Cruz visits Atec
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and his staff visited Atec headquarters in Stafford, Texas on Monday April 10, 2017. Atec’s recent awards from NASA and the Small Business Administration no doubt had his interest in our company at a high level. Sen. Cruz is chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Space, and he had recently pushed through the first NASA appropriations bill in eight years, along with the House Space Subcommittee Chair Brian Babin of Southeast Texas.

Senator Cruz received a presentation on our businesses in aeroengine test facilities and equipment, military engine and aircraft sustainment, space propulsion and vehicle systems, and energy service components. Next, he toured our Stafford plant, seeing the latest in 3D Metal and Plastic printing, 5 axis CNC machining, Cleanroom manufacturing, Cryogenic flow testing and Graphical display engineering. Atec’s airmen (employees) were impressed with the interest shown by Sen. Cruz and staff in so many work stations and employee skills.

Following the tour, Senator Cruz addressed all employees, took their questions, and held a news conference for the many media members on hand. Below are excerpts from social media and local new outlets. Altogether, it was a busy morning at Atec!
