Drug importation is not a new idea. – Partnership for Safe Medicines
Independent pharmacy inspectors are not accountable to anyone but themselves.

Companies like PharmacyChecker are for-profit ventures that operate outside regulatory structures. There is no way to trust their inspection process. There is no legal recourse for an American citizen if they are injured by counterfeit or substandard medicines purchased from an online pharmacy, whether or not an independent pharmacy inspector has certified it. Online pharmacies pay PharmacyChecker to be listed as approved on their site. Their customers are online pharmacies, not patients. Protecting the companies they proclaim safe is more important to them than patient safety.

In 2015, for example, the Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against CanadaDrugs.com, an online pharmacy certified by PharmacyChecker, for selling counterfeit and non-FDA approved cancer medications to American medical practices.

According to the indictment, Ram Kamath, then PharmacyChecker’s Director of Pharmacy Policy and International Verifications hid fake Avastin in his garage for CanadaDrugs.com subsidiaries until they could send it back to the United Kingdom. The same month, Kamath wrote a glowing inspection report for CanadaDrugs.com’s operations in Barbados, claiming that the company could ensure the quality of the drugs they sold. The company continued to list CanadaDrugs.com as a recommended site until it could no longer legitimately pretend to look the other direction: when the internet pharmacy and its CEO signed plea agreements in 2018.

Sadly, CanadaDrugs.com is not an isolated example. In a March 2017 blog post, LegitScript listed nine other cases of “Canadian” pharmacies certified by PharmacyChecker or the Canadian International Pharmacy Association (CIPA) that had been prosecuted for dispensing drugs—including controlled substances—without prescriptions, for misrepresenting the source of their medicines, or for selling counterfeit medication.
