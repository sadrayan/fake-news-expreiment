Rare $2 bill expected to go for $20,000 at auction
1954 $20 Queen Elizabeth asterisk replacement "Devil's Face" note Sells For: Around $7,000 in top condition More Info: Several months passed before the Devil's distinctive face was recognized on all $1 to $1,000 bills in the first series of Canadian currency featuring Queen Elizabeth, making front page news. The devilish image's source has never been conclusively solved. A metal die engraver re-cut the hair behind the queen's ear and new versions with a second combination of Bank of Canada official's signatures were applied by 1956. The $1,000 bills, Canada's highest-denomination note at the time, were modified several years later. Regular notes in top condition fetch good prices, but those with six-point asterisks — called "replacement notes" for those damaged or misprinted during production — sell for thousands of dollars, with $1 versions averaging $3,000. No $50, $100 or $1,000 asterisk notes were printed. (Image courtesy of the Online Canadian Paper Currency Museum)

1936 dot cent Amount Sold For: $402,500 U.S. on Jan. 4, 2010 More Info: With King Edward VIII's abdication in late 1936, production of new banknotes, coins and stamps was halted. To meet pressing demands for 1¢, 10¢, and 25¢ coins, the Royal Canadian Mint drilled tiny holes in the dies used to stamp out coins that year. The 1936 dot quarters are more expensive than regular 25¢ coins with that year's date, but for reasons shrouded in mystery and theory, less than five 1936 dot cents and dimes have surfaced — this so-called "King of Pennies" being in the finest condition. Another one sold for $207,000 in 2004.

1911 Queen Mary $500 bill Amount Sold For: $322,000 in September, 2008 in the U.S. More Info: : This $500 Dominion of Canada bill featuring the wife of King George V sold four years ago for the highest price ever paid for a Canadian banknote. Only one of three known to exist, it was destined for a paper shredder with a pile of old documents an Ontario resident was clearing from a late relative's office — until its presence was noticed. Despite creases and obvious handling marks, the exceedingly rare note was bought by a Canadian realty developer living in Dallas, Texas.

1925 Dominion of Canada $500 King George V note Amount Sold For: $235,750 in 2010 Geoffrey Ball Auction More Info: : Considered the highest-numbered of eight known examples two years ago — A013504 — was graded in almost-uncirculated condition, making its appearance attractive to well-heeled collectors and investors. Its survival is unusual, given the start of the Great Depression four years later, during which a full shopping cart of groceries cost about $5. Note the pen-signed signatures of federal Treasury officials, before security printers switched to using engraved metal reproduction signatures.

1910 Bank of Vancouver $5 bill Amount Sold For: $150,000 in Toronto in June 2010 More Info: What makes this century-old $5 bill so special for bidders at a Torex coin, despite some obvious wrinkling is its serial number — 000001. Printed in Ottawa by the British American Bank Note Company, which used typical symbolic images of commerce at a time when private banks issued their own currency, it is literally the first $5 bill issued by the Bank of Vancouver, which operated from 1910 and 1914.

1889 Union Bank of Newfoundland $50 bill Amount Sold For: $40,250 in the 2012 Geoffrey Bell Auctions spring sale More Info: Despite slight creasing and pinholes, this colourful private banknote is one of only three known to have survived. It is also considered the finest outside of the Bank of Canada collection in Ottawa. One of two private banks on "The Rock" to issue currency in the 1880s, from $2-to-$50, the Union Bank of Newfoundland crashed and went out of business in 1894.

1986 $2 Queen Elizabeth note Estimated value: $15,000-$20,000 More Info: This $2 bill of the last series the Bank of Canada issued before $2 coins replaced currency of that denomination looks like thousands of others that survived, but its AUH6303352 serial number ranks it as one of only five known with that combination of letters. Considered the finest-known, although not uncirculated, it will be hotly bid on at this weekend's Geoffrey Bell Auctions that coincides with the Toronto Coin Expo. Those with Thiessen-Crow signatures were supposed to be issued starting with AUK letters, but some have been found in series AUG to AUN. (photo supplied by Geoffrey Bell Auctions)

TORONTO -

Whoa — inflation at 10,000 times original value!

A $2 bill with a rare number-letter combination is expected to fetch up to $20,000 at a two-day Toronto auction.

The 1986-series bill with an AUH-prefix — the three letters before a seven-digit serial number — is one of only five known, said Canadian Paper Money Society vice-president Jared Stapleton, whose Toronto Coin Expo runs Friday and Saturday at the Toronto Reference Library, 789 Yonge St.

Geoffrey Bell Auctions is running a coinciding coin and currency sale on Thursday and Friday.

Some people are content with low-grade older bills, but condition is often rough because “you’re dealing with a paper product and they can get damaged and soiled easily,” Stapleton said Wednesday. Anyone seeking currency and coins for investment should “collect the best.”

Such guidelines can pay off.

A 1911 $500 bill featuring Queen Mary, wife of King George V, was saved from being shredded with old documents when the late owner’s relative spotted what turned out to be one of only three survivors. It sold for $322,000 four years ago.

Bell sold a 1925 King George V $500 note sold in 2010 for $235,750.

While some old notes are quite valuable, dedicated modern currency collectors and dealers hunt abnormal and rare serial letter-number combinations, Brian Bell, of Geoffrey Bell Auctions, said from Saint John, N.B.

The sale also features private notes that banks circulated.

The Bank of Canada took over release of all Canadian currency by the mid-1940s, compensating institutions for their bills as customers exchanged them for federal equivalents. A rare set of its 1935 first issue $1-to-$1,000 specimen notes in both English and French, with “00000” serial numbers, is estimated to be auctioned for up to $150,000.
