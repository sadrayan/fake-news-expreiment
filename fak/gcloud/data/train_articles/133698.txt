Under CAATSA Section 241, Congress required Treasury, in consultation with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to provide a report regarding senior political figures and oligarchs in the Russian Federation and Russian parastatal entities. Treasury worked closely with State and the intelligence community in drafting this report.

This report is not a sanctions list. The inclusion of individuals or entities in any portion of the report does not impose sanctions on those individuals or entities. Nor does it create any other restrictions, prohibitions, or limitations on dealings with such persons by either U.S. or foreign persons.

The names of senior political figures and oligarchs in the unclassified version of the report were selected based on objective criteria drawn from publically available sources.

The classified version of the report includes other items required by CAATSA Section 241.
