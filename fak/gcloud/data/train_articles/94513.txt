Cotton Releases New Ad: “Recovery”
New ad sets the record straight on disaster relief and calls out Senator Pryor for politicizing a horrible tragedy

U.S. Senate candidate Tom Cotton released a new ad Tuesday morning that sets the record straight on Senator Pryor’s false attacks regarding disaster relief and calls out Senator Pryor for politicizing the tragic storms that devastated the communities of Mayflower and Vilonia in April.

Faulkner County Sheriff Andy Shock narrates the ad, titled “Recovery.” In the ad, Shock says: “Despite what you’ve been told, Tom Cotton stood with us every step of the way. Tom voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA. Senator Pryor, start focusing on the real issues. Leave our community and our tragedy out of your campaign.”

The ad highlights Cotton’s votes in support of full funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including the FY2014 Department of Homeland Security appropriation, from which FEMA derives its funding. In addition, Cotton worked hand-in-hand with the rest of Arkansas’s federal delegation to get federal support to the communities affected by April’s storms, supporting all five disaster relief declaration letters of support.

Tom Cotton said: “Senator Pryor should be ashamed of his false attacks that politicize a horrible tragedy in an attempt to score political points. It’s no wonder Senator Pryor would rather hide behind attack ads and staged media events rather than debating the issues in front of voters.”

The new ad is a six-figure buy and is being run statewide starting Tuesday.
