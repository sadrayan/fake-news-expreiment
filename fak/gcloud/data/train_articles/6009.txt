ISIS supporters, on a well-known Telegram channel, shared the name and address of Barron Trump's school and are calling for backers of the terrorist organization to assassinate him, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute, or MEMRI.

The initial message, sent on Nov. 21 by an ISIS supporter on Telegram, "called for the assassination of Barron Trump, and shared the name of the school that Barron attends along with a Google map pinpointing its location," according to MEMRI, which shares images of this messages with reporters.

"Using the hashtag ‘handle the son of the mule of America,' the supporter, who uses the name "Dak Al-Munafiqeen,' Arabic for ‘striking the hypocrites,' wrote: ‘Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington,'" according to MEMRI.

"The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump," according to MEMRI's research. "To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post."
