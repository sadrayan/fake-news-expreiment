of Law and Public Policy

America is in a leadership crisis because our rulers have ignored God’s Word as the foundation for law and liberty. Sadly, few seeking office are offering hope for a return to the biblical principles that once made our nation great. More troubling still, most Christians involved in the political process as well as the legal profession are not prepared to lead in the ways of righteousness because they lack a full-orbed biblical worldview. While often well-intentioned, many are ill-equipped to champion a biblical approach to law and public policy because they are ignorant of America’s great Christian legal heritage.

Enter the Witherspoon School of Law and Public Policy, a four-day crash course designed to equip students, attorneys, lawmakers, pastors, and fathers with a Reformation understanding of the Scriptures as the source book for law and liberty and the only sure foundation for addressing the challenging ethical questions of the twenty-first century. The Witherspoon School is especially designed for young men who desire to influence our nation for righteousness and who recognize that, to do so, they must communicate an entire world and life view as dictated by Holy Scripture.

Witherspoon students will be exposed to distinctively biblical training under leading Christian attorneys and historians. They will study the Scriptural foundations for property, tort, and contract law; the influence of Christianity on the Constitution; the relationship between the case laws of Exodus and the Common Law; and the writings of Sir William Blackstone. This course will also feature a practical and biblical examination of options in legal education including law school, apprenticeship, correspondence
