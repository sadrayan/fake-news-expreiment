“Cash Me Outside” Girl Found Dead After Apparent Suicide -
After months of bullying from social media and peers at school, Danielle Ann was found dead in her room on January 23. The harassment began shortly after the Dr. Phil show released a clip onto their Youtube channel, in which a 13 year old Danielle appears on the show for stealing cars.

While on the show, Danielle began to get irritated with the audience and shouted “catch me outside, how about that?” Initially the airing of the clip was enough to handle. Then a fight with a fellow student leaked online of Danielle being drug out of a car and repeatedly struck in the head.

Just days after, Danielle was found unresponsive by her mother in her bedroom. She was then rushed to the hospital and later pronounced dead late Monday evening.
