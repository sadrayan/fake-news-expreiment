PERRIS: International group of skydivers sets new world record
They did it.

More than 200 skydivers — 202 to be precise — set a world record on Tuesday afternoon, Skydive Perris posted on its Facebook page. The group linked up together 7,000 feet above the facility to form the largest sequential formation of all time.

That sort of formation involves different groups coming together to form a gigantic lattice of airsuit-clad humanity.

The group that pulled off the feat, which smashes the old record of 122, included skydivers from 24 different countries, a sort of United Nations in the air that included Russians, Brazilians, Italians, Germans and U.S. jumpers.

“There is no political stuff,” said Patrick Passe, an accomplished skydiver from France who helped design the formation. “There is a goal to reach, fun to share. It’s all about that.”

Many of the skydivers arrived over the weekend, working on smaller batch jumps. Work toward the world record began in earnest Monday morning. The group set the record about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday.

About 80 percent of the skydivers who show up for such attempts are experts, said Patrick Passe, of France, the architect of the current world record-holding formation. The other 20 percent, he said, need coaching.
