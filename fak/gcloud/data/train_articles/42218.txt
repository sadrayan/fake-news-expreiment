Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin, the conservative group backed by industrialists Charles and David Koch, said Thursday it will launch a "seven-figure" TV ad buy against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.

The 30-second ad calls on Baldwin to support the tax reform plan unveiled last week by Republicans. The ad will run on local and cable networks statewide for three weeks beginning Friday, the group said.

"Senator Baldwin is standing in the way of a simple, fair tax system," a woman says in the ad.

Baldwin faces re-election next year. Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield are running for the Republican nomination.

Americans for Prosperity is also running similar ads against two other Democratic senators facing re-election next year, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Donnelly of Indiana.

Martha Laning, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said in a statement: "Out-of-state billionaires are attacking Tammy Baldwin on Wisconsin airwaves because they know she won't support a tax giveaway for CEOs and the super-rich paid for by hardworking Wisconsinites. Billionaire puppet Kevin Nicholson and right-wing extremist Leah Vukmir need to tell the people of Wisconsin why they support Trump and Paul Ryan gifting 80% of tax cuts to the top 1% over the next decade while one in four middle class families pay more."
