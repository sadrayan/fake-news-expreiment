Rates and volume numbers can be verified from the UCR Data Tool to 2014, 2015 and 2016 can be created from the data resident in the publication.

An offense rate, defined as the number of offenses per 100,000 population, is derived by first dividing a jurisdictionâ€™s population by 100,000 and then dividing the number of offenses by the resulting figure.

Example:

a. Population for jurisdiction, 75,000

b. Number of known burglaries for jurisdiction for a year, 215

Divide 75,000 by 100,000 = .75

Divide 215 by .75 = 286.7

The burglary rate is 286.7 per 100,000 inhabitants.

The number .75 can now be divided into the totals of any offense class to produce a crime rate for that offense.
