Houston residents and civilians turn to Zello app to coordinate rescue efforts

As Houston residents battle extreme flooding, some are turning to a bootstrapped startup to help communicate and coordinate rescue efforts.

Zello, a walkie-talkie app, has seen a 20-fold increase in usage in the past week, according to Bill Moore, the company’s chief executive. The app typically picks up in usage during natural disasters and has found particular use this time among the Cajun Navy, a group of civilians who have been using their own boats to rescue residents.

The app has also seen double the number of daily active users, with a baseline of eight million monthly active unique users and 100 million registered users.

“It’s ideal for situations where you’re solving problems or the stakes are high,” Moore said.

The app is free for consumers and operates using cell-phone data plans or WiFi. Users can either communicate one-on-one or in specific channels. For the flooding in Houston, there have been several channels created including “Texas Search and Rescue,” “Houston Midwives for Pregnant Mammas,” “Cajun Navy” and “Texas Navy.”

“Zello is the best option currently as cell service is not reliable,” the Louisiana Cajun Navy posted on its Facebook page Monday.

That Cajun Navy also directed those needing rescue to a newly set up website. In addition to Zello, social media appears to be playing a large role in civilian rescue efforts, with Twitter hashtags such as #harveysos and #harveyrescue.

Moore said Zello is being used both to coordinate efforts within the groups and for residents reaching out to the groups to ask for rescue.

He added that he believes the voice-based communication is essential in times of crisis, because it can be used on the move and because hearing someone’s voice can indicate if they’re frightened, as well as their overall well-being.

The Austin, Texas,-based company was founded in late 2011, and has never taken in venture funding. It has a staff of 25 and has been profitable for the past two years. The app makes money from its 1,000 enterprise customers, largely concentrated in the transportation and hospitality industries, which pay a monthly subscription for their employees to communicate on internal channels on the app.

Moore said the company began with the idea of being a one-on-one communications app that included messaging, similar to the WhatsApp model. However, the company soon realized that it could better compete with a focus on live voice.



The app has also seen surges in usage during times of political mobilization in Venezuela, Ukraine and Egypt, or “when the stakes are high,” Moore said.
