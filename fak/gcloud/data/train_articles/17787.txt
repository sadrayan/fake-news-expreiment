Jon Ossoff for Congress
I was born and raised in Georgia and grew up here in the Sixth District.

Today, I lead a company that investigates corrupt politicians and organized crime.

Our team has taken down human traffickers, exposed dozens of corrupt officials around the world, and uncovered atrocities committed by ISIS in Iraq. Previously, I was a senior national security staffer in the U.S. Congress, working with our military and intelligence community to keep Georgians safe while investigating wrongdoing by government contractors.

During five years as a Congressional aide, I learned how to get things done in Washington. On Capitol Hill and as a journalist, Iâ€™ve learned how to expose and fight the abuse of power.

I will use my experience and all of my energy to fight for Georgia.

Stay tuned!
