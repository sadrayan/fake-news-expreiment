Where Trump’s Travel Ban Stands
Judge Robart’s order allowed people from the seven countries who had been authorized to travel, along with vetted refugees from all nations, to enter the country.

What does the administration argue?

In its brief, the administration said that Judge Robart had “improperly second-guessed the president’s national security determinations.” The brief said the president had vast power over immigration under the Constitution and federal law.

What did the appeals court do?

The court declined to issue an immediate administrative stay, but it said it would consider the federal government’s emergency motion for a stay after receiving more briefs. The court set a very fast briefing schedule, asking the states to respond by midnight Sunday Pacific time, with the federal government to file a second brief by 3 p.m. on Monday.

How fast will the appeals court act?

There is every indication that the court will act promptly.

Who are the appeals court judges?

The appeals court’s order was issued by Judge William C. Canby Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. They are two of the three Ninth Circuit judges designated to hear motions in February. The third, Judge Richard R. Clifton, was appointed by President George W. Bush.
