5-Year-Old Badly Burned After Trying “Fire Fairy” Challenge
Young children are incredibly impressionable and will do just about anything they see on TV, or even worse— the internet. For this very reason, internet challenges go viral and are extremely popular, no matter how insane or ridiculous they may be. While most of these challenges are rather innocent and involve eating jelly beans or pouring a bucket of ice water on your head, others are much more sinister. Officials are now investigating a case where a child was severely burned after one viral challenge instructed her to turn on the gas stove in her home so that she could become a “fairy."
