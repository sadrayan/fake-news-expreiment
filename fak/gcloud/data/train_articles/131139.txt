Guns: We have the answer now!

In 1863 a Democrat shot and killed Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States .

In 1983 a registered Democrat shot and wounded Ronald Reagan.

In 2007 a registered Democrat named Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 people in Virginia Tech.

In 2010 a mentally ill registered Democrat named Jared Lee Loughner shot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killing 6 others.

In 2011 a registered Democrat named James Holmes went into a movie theater and shot and killed 12 people.

In 2013 a registered Democrat named Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people in a school.

One could go on, but you get the point, even if the media

do not.

Clearly there is a problem with Democrats and guns.

Perhaps it should simply be illegal for Democrats to own guns.
