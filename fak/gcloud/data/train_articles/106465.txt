I'm Now a Producer on the Holistic Doctor Death Film- See a Scene Her…
When Los Angeles director, Brian Hammers, first approached me with this proof of concept short film- I clicked on his link, not expecting much. I didn’t know him from Adam and I get many emails a day.

Then the film stopped me dead in my tracks.

My jaw dropped and I shed a few tears. I learned that Brian’s wife, Michelle Hammers, was basically playing the role of me. That alone was mind blowing, not to mention the sensitive subject matter.

I also learned that some actors were afraid to be involved with the project because of the recent deaths and potential dangers. I wrote to some of the family members of the deceased doctors and we agreed this project would happen regardless, so it might as well happen the right way. Brian is a talented, passionate director so I agreed to be a producer and help in any way I could to get the world out there. We’ve already had thousands of dollars donated toward the project and know it will be done.

Since the mainstream media has ignored over 30 doctors who have gone dead and missing in a matter of months, film sometimes has the power to get the word out.

Thanks to Brian and Michelle Hammers and everyone else involved. And special thanks to Thanks to Brian and Michelle Hammers and everyone else involved. And special thanks to MakeSomethingFilms
