NEW YORK TIMES v. SULLIVAN
We think that -- if that all impel a large and substantial verdict in this case which the jury awarded.

It was against a much smaller publication with a -- I think a circulation of about 2000, a -- a publication with obviously nothing like the prestige that this ad carried all the news it's fit to print, all the rest of it.

It would've been a slap on the wrist to the Times for this sort of conduct even -- even if you consider this as being entirely punitive damage.

We submit that in -- in the context of this case, a small verdict would have been a bagatelle.

It -- it was a -- a libel case and as I say, there was a $3,500,000 award in that case and the Times itself on the issue of reason said that this has a healthy effect.

It was a case in which this publication of --

But on the question of reason -- sir?

It has since we wrote the brief and cut to $550,000 by the appellate division.

In our brief, we have pointed out situations a New York verdict seven times as big, $3,500,000.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Well, we think that the -- that if this Court went into the question at all as we submitted has not heretofore done, the question would be whether there was any reasonable basis whatever for this verdict.

Justice William J. Brennan: But why 500,000 there is, but there wouldn't be a full $5 million, I don't follow it.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I -- well, I was going to say Your Honor that -- that we -- we would -- we will concede that at some point, you get into a question of whether there is any evidence at all that Thompson against Louisville test so to speak.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: The latest case on this question of damages that I know of is Neese against Southern Railroad where this case -- or where this Court expressly refused or declined to go into this -- this question.

This Court held that it -- it would not go into the question of the adequacy of that award.

The C. B. & Q. case against Chicago which I've cited earlier was the case where $1 was brought back in a condemnation case against the Railroad.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Yes, under the -- under the Seventh Amendment.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Your Honor, on that as we've argued in our brief, as we understand the cases of this Court, it has not heretofore gone into the question of the excessiveness or inadequacy of damages.

Justice William J. Brennan: (Inaudible) thousands with the 5 million and (Inaudible) the 5 million I take it, (Inaudible) on this record, could still be the (Inaudible)

Indeed, it makes no such argument in these briefs, in this Court and --

We -- we submit that certainly at this stage, the New York Times could not contend that there is any deficiency in the overall charge which the judge gave to the jury.

In this connection, we would like to point out again and answer to some of Mr. Justice White's questions to Mr. Wechsler with regard to charges that -- that the -- they were very precise exceptions made to the overall charge by the defendant, New York Times and none of them are related to any of these -- these matters.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: But in this case, there was no requested charge from the -- the jury -- to -- from the judge to the jury.

Justice Hugo L. Black: It was formerly or effective, I know in dispute.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: -- or I -- I've -- I've never done it and I've never seen it done but --

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I -- I don't know but sir, but I'm -- I'm not prepared to say it's been abandoned or --

We, the jury, find all of the issues in favor of the plaintiff and under those circumstances, it would've foreclosed all issues but a general verdict might not, was that -- was that proved and abandoned?

He could ask the Court, (Inaudible) the jury.

Justice Hugo L. Black: It was normally the practice so that the plaintiff did not want to take a risk on a general verdict referenced to some of the issues.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I don't believe that would be permissible, so we -- we ask for no -- I mean I -- we -- the plaintiff could've asked for a directed verdict.

Justice Hugo L. Black: That was normally the fact here.

Justice Hugo L. Black: Could the plaintiff has had asked for a charge if we, the jury find all the issues in favor of the plaintiff?

In other words, once all of the facts were on the table from the very early investigations through the retraction, through the conduct of the Times, attorneys in the trial where they conceded falsity, the Secretary nevertheless and in the face of all that, told the jury that this was substantially correct.

In the face of the cavalier ignoring of the falsity of the advertisement, the jury could not have -- but been impressed with the bad faith of the Times and its maliciousness inferable therefrom."

“On the other hand, during his testimony it was a contention of the Secretary of the Times that the advertisement was "substantially correct."

"On the other hand," during his testimony, it was a contention that -- that the Times mentioned that the -- I mean that the Court had mentioned this retraction that -- that we discussed.

They found it or they -- they found that -- that the -- that matter involving Mr. -- Mr. Bancroft.

It -- it made -- the Alabama Supreme Court made a specific finding that there was evidence in the record from which malice could be found.

Justice Byron R. White: The Alabama Supreme Court feels it's necessary to sustain the verdict to the (Inaudible)

And -- and there is no special verdict in this case and I know of no way to -- to determine --

The Times, and I think the individual defendants asked four special verdicts but the Court -- we've cited several Alabama cases in our brief which say that under Alabama practice, a jury has a right to bring back a general verdict.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Your Honor, under Alabama practice, a jury has a right to bring back a general verdict as distinguished from -- from the federal practice.

Justice Byron R. White: -- or any other -- or any other -- or any other Alabama courts about the questions (Inaudible)

Justice Byron R. White: What -- where in the record -- was there any way of finding out what the jury found or --

Public officials, as this Court pointed out in Pennekamp have a right to sue for libel when they have been defamed.

We submit that the -- this Court and no other courts had ever made a distinction between libel of public officials and libel of private persons.

That man certainly intended as he testified unequivocally to make this ad as devastating as possible because the purpose of the ad was to raise money and he wanted to use his phrase to make it as appealing as possible.

And certainly, the intent, we submit, of the author of this ad, the man who wrote it, sent it in and paid almost $5000 to have it published, it's a paid ad in the New York Times.

And then beyond that as Mr. Justice Stewart points out, we have the retraction for one and not for the other in precisely similar circumstances and that's the case that went to the jury.

And so at that stage, we say there was a recklessness that -- that was -- was illegal equivalent of intent.

They specified 16 stories and Mr. Redding said he didn't look at one of them before this ad was -- was sent off for publication.

He -- the Times specified in answers to interrogatories, 16 separate news articles which related to the subject matter purportedly described in this ad.

He didn't check with any of the -- the signers of the ad.

And then the -- the man who is in-charge of the department, Mr. Redding, who is -- who is in-charge of the advertising acceptability department, was put on the stand and he said he didn't do anything at all.

I even asked him whether he found any extravagant or superlative language and he said he did not even though the ad uses the phrase unprecedented wave of terror.

The first man said he scanned it horridly, this is Mr. Aronson, and didn't find anything offensive in it.

They brought down presumably the two people under that screening process who were supposed to look at this ad and see whether it passed master under the libel laws among other tests.

They're suppose to screen these ads under newspaper procedure, not under Alabama law, but under the procedure that -- that the Times has set up.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: After -- after knowledge came but I say, even before that, that that they -- they have as I was going say, these advertising acceptability standards.

Justice Potter Stewart: Well, then you -- don't you also say that the failure to retract --

We say that on the facts of this case, there was ample evidence from which a jury could find that there was the kind of recklessness and abandon and an inability to look at facts at the beginning before publication which could be the equivalent of -- of intent.

Justice Byron R. White: -- this case, say they knew it was false or (Voice Overlap).

It would have to be true.

Justice Byron R. White: But even (Inaudible) -- if it were held here -- it were held here that a newspaper could publish a (Inaudible) which -- this must be true, that would still (Inaudible)

We think that it would have a devastating effect on this nation.

I -- as I understand their contention and as I understand what they said it to be, if a newspaper charges or let's say a mayor or a police commissioner was taking a bribe that there is absolute immunity against the libel suit in that regard and we think that's something brand new in our jurisprudence.

And in an answer to one, I believe, it was Mr. Justice Stewart's question.

We -- we think that the defendant in order to succeed must convince this Court that a newspaper corporation has an absolute immunity from anything it publishes.

Justice Byron R. White: But that's the -- but that -- that's a question of the First Amendment whether the -- whether a -- whether you may publish a deliberate lie --

That is not the issue.

Justice Byron R. White: Oh, is that the issue?

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: We think this evidence on which a jury --

Justice Byron R. White: (Inaudible) to this case unavoidably presents the question of whether or not a -- a person may tell a deliberate lie about a publication?

Two of its three witnesses were --

And -- and/or beyond that, that the jury had before it a deliberate failure of the New York Times personnel of people who are put on the stand, who were brought down there and put on the stand by the defendant.

Justice Byron R. White: That's the -- the jury would get him up the stand though?

Do you say that knowing the statement is false at the outset if he refused to retract that, you know it's false?

They -- they -- that booklet is in evidence and --

The treatment of this plaintiff by the testimony of the Secretary telling the jury that it was not substantially incorrect after his own lawyers couldn't even plead truth, the failure of the Times to apply a very rigorous set of advertising acceptability standards as they called them.

We think that -- that the inconsistent treatment of -- of Governor Patterson and this plaintiff, the treatment of this plaintiff after investigations showed falsity.

On the question of malice and deliberateness to -- to get to a matter that Mr. Justice White raised earlier in the argument, we submit sir that there was plenty from which the jury could find deliberateness.

An argument can be made that private person's arrest but this doesn't mean that a jury as a matter of constitutional law has defined that arrest in that context don't relate to police.

We think that if you use the test of what a normal intelligent reader understands, that a normal intelligent reader understands that arrest are made by the police.

And -- and arrest, we don't think Your Honor that you got to say the police arrest in order to -- to contend the arrest refers to the police.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Well, police action, we submit is clearly described.

Not as much possibly but certainly he's liable and certainly, the reference we submit is clear enough for a jury to find especially when this testimony from the defendant's own witness that the association was made through the repeated use of the word "they".

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I would take the same position Your Honor and I would be in accord with Mr. Aronson of the Times.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I would take the same position.

Justice Arthur J. Goldberg: The whole point of your argument (Inaudible)

I -- I still think that the rest of --

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: That was the question I attempted to answer before.

Mr. Aronson's testimony that "they" refers to the same people, "they", arrest for loitering and speeding, as to the police that they're the same people who did that either participated in or -- or condoned the bombing and the rest of it.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: And then in the -- in the other paragraph as I've stated the repeated use of the word "they".

We think that the padlocking does refer to the -- to the police and --

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: In the first paragraph -- to the third paragraph, the first one that we complained about other than the unprecedented wave of terror in the preamble.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Well, in the first paragraph --

I think that -- that a great deal or more of the ad than that one sentence applies to this plaintiff and we alleged it into --

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I -- I certainly would contend that a retraction of -- was --was an order Your Honor.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: May -- may I be sure I understand the -- the question correctly.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Yes, but I will assume for the sake of the hypothetical what --

Mr. Wechsler stressed a later investigation which they asked, I believe a month or so later where it said that at one time, they were to forward in large numbers.

First report, the report from the key, the stringer said that a passing police car came by.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Your Honor, the -- the two reports Mr. Wechsler talked about one of them.

We say that all -- that --

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I believe there are a good many, sir but I -- I couldn't say exactly how many.

The accommodation which Alabama seeks to make with this freedom of the press and freedom of speech but --

And we submit that that this plus the Alabama defense of fair comment, plus the absolute defense of truth in Alabama are means which Alabama were they not only the constitutional command of the United States Constitution but the command of its own Alabama Constitution.

It's Title 7, Section 915 and -- and makes actual damages only recoverable where there has been a retraction.

We've cited the statute on page 68 of -- of our brief.

It takes out punitive and -- and general and leaves in special, I -- I'm glad you corrected me on that.

Justice William J. Brennan: At least punitive, is that it?

Justice William J. Brennan: (Inaudible) -- action of (Inaudible) take out of the case, especially in general damages?

It refused to do it in our case and if the Times had done it, the Times had done for this plaintiff what it did for -- for Governor Patterson, it would not be in the situation which it finds itself today.

The Times, we submit, has done this in the Governor's case.

I -- I understand from -- I believe it's Mr. Chafee's article that we've cited in -- in our brief that Alabama and Virginia were two of the earliest states which enacted these retraction statutes and that a -- that a defendant in Alabama can eliminate entirely special and general damages as I've described in -- by retraction.

And I would like to remind the Court that under Alabama law, there is a very broad retraction statute.

That is also allowed in Alabama and that is different from what I have just described as special damages and then of course in addition to that, there are punitive damages.

And of course, we also -- I -- I don't know to what extents Your Honor would refer to -- to what we call general damages that is damages for -- for injury to reputation, for hurt feelings to that sort of thing.

But we submit that the jury could fairly take into account future losses of -- of earnings of that sort or if the -- the occasion arose.

But in the sense of showing any actual out-of-pocket loss of money at that time, no sir, there -- there was no showing to that.

We think that -- that this -- this kind of thing certainly enabled the jury to find it in the future long after this man could come back into court and ask a jury to give him some special damages that he might be damaged especially in this regard.

And this man testified, his former employer that if he had believed the matters contained in this ad that he would not reemploy Mr. Sullivan.

Mr. Sullivan, as the record shows, had formally been in the Public Service Commission of Alabama in -- in the transportation safety field and after he left there, before he was elected Commissioner, he had worked for a truck line in -- in a similar capacity.

He was a former employer of Mr. Sullivan.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: To this extent Your Honor, one of the witnesses testified.

Justice John M. Harlan: Well, was there any effort to prove special damage (Inaudible)

But I -- I would think if the police commissioner could, an answer to an earlier question, I would reaffirm what Mr. Wechsler said the statute of limitations has one, that it's one year in Alabama and -- and there has been no suit by the police commissioner.

They're the ones who's suppose to run the city and when something like this happens, they are the ones that that people think of and -- and especially that at election time and that sort of thing.

I think that when something goes wrong in a massive sort of way like this that people think of the -- of -- of the mayor and the council.

Though I do -- I do say that -- that an elected official such as the Commissioner has a large notoriety and identification.

I would say that he could, yes sir.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: The question was asked earlier about the police chief.

I think sufficient on to the day if this matter arises but I don't think it would arise in Alabama because of the -- of the Court's restriction in this matter.

And I don't think we need to go beyond that.

We think it's very clear but certainly clear enough to warrant a jury finding that the charges of this sort of are terrible and -- and indefensible police action reflect on the man who is police commissioner of the city.

I think that the -- that the association is -- is certainly clear enough.

But I don't think we have that question in this case.

I -- I think that the community could not -- a member of the community could not.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: The cases which -- which the Supreme Court of Alabama has cited completely in these matters if we construe them, requires what -- what, as we submit most states do that where you've got this area of group libel or -- that has to -- that the group has to have a -- a bounds or -- and in Alabama reasonably -- small bounds in the context of your question Your Honor.

And that a person in an entire community, under Alabama law would not have standing to sue because the diffusion of -- of the attack, the diffusion of the invidious remarks would be so great that under Alabama law, it could not be applied to this man as a plaintiff, a member of a community with no other identification as a plaintiff in a lawsuit.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: -- which requires that a group be sufficiently small so that the identification can readily be made.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: The thing that would prevent in Alabama Your Honor is Alabama jurisprudence which requires -- which --

We do say that it's not only is a reasonable one but that it was indeed made by the Times own witness, Mr. Aronson who had had more than 20 years experience in a screening process of this kind of editorial type ad as the Times describes it.

We don't say that this is an irresistible connotation in all contexts.

There is no attempt made in this paragraph to differentiate in any manner that "they" who arrested for loitering and speeding from the "they" who bombed and that "they" who assaulted and the "they" who indicted for murder.

Now, this evidence went to the jury and it's our contention that a -- an ordinary reader of -- of normal intelligence knows that the people who arrest for loitering and speeding of the municipal police.

And after some backing and filling, he stated that it did or could be read that way.

I asked on cross-examination a witness with the Times, Mr. Aronson whether that "they" is used repeatedly in that paragraph refer to the same persons.

Now, here I'm not relying simply on my analysis or a hypothetical analysis.

The repeated use of the word "they".

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Your Honor, in paragraph 6, we would like to advert to an observation which Justice Clark made and which was -- was, I thought rather notably underplayed in -- in Mr. Wechsler's argument.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: He would in certain circumstances where -- whether -- order -- with peace and order were threatened, I'm sure he would.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Well, we -- we simply don't because the -- the respondent conceded at the trial that -- that he had no jurisdiction in that regard and made no contention whatever at the trial at that particular statement re -- referred to him.

And we say certainly that police authorities in state can -- can or reasonably connote to the average ordinary reader which is the test that the jury has before it that these statements have reference to the man who's in charge of the police.

But again sir, I return to the -- to the context, this is a question of whether a jury could reasonably make a connotation.

We don't say that a reasonable argument can't be made that state authorities in certain context don't mean police.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Your Honor, municipal authorities can reasonably be construed by a jury to the state authorities too.

It's a clear sort of police action that was -- especially in view of the earlier reference to -- to the police in there.

And Mr. Sullivan conceded at the trial of course that he had no academic disciplinary function and -- and that this expulsion of course does not refer to him.

If -- it -- we think can reasonably be read, in fact, irresistibly read as describing police action resulting from the singing of My Country, 'Tis of Thee from Capitol steps.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: In my opinion -- in my opinion, everything except the -- the academic discipline of expulsion from school refers to Mr. Sullivan.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: That's as -- that was the first thing he said Your Honor but then he said that they were on a par in this regard and that there was no -- I -- I assume the jury could -- could determine from that that there was no greater reference, no more precise reference to Patterson than there was to the plaintiff in this case.

They are put on a par Governor Patterson and this plaintiff, this is from page 779 of the record, "Yes, but there was a retraction for Governor Patterson and there was no retraction for this plaintiff, that is correct, isn't it?

But then he said -- then on cross-examination, he was asked whether the Governor and this plaintiff were not on a par.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: That's what he said first before cross-examination.

Now, on the matter of association, we certainly feel that --

And this went to the jury on the question of falsity.

They were exactly the same two paragraphs that this plaintiff complained about and we say as the Alabama Supreme Court said, "If it was false for Patterson, it was equally false for Sullivan."

The clear implication is that both paragraphs to use the words were erroneous or misstated.

Now, we say that there is no qualification there as to any part of those paragraphs being true.

"Since publication of the advertisement, the Times made an investigation and consistent with its policy of retracting and correcting any errors or misstatements which may appear in its columns herewith retracts the two paragraphs complained of by -- by the Governor."

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Could I call your attention to page 596 of the record about midway down, since publication of the -- for its -- its just before Folio 1715.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Your Honor, if -- if I might sir --

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Well the errors and misstatements Your Honor, I think are -- are different ways of saying that it's -- that it's false.

They simply say, "We don't think it can be read to refer to Governor Patterson but we're retracting anyway so to speak."

And -- and that was the basis for -- for my statement that there's no attempt in that to say that any of this ad was true.

We say that that ad -- that statement qualifies on the question of whether or not this ad can be read as referring to Governor Patterson, not as to whether or not the underlying subject matter of the publication itself is true or false.

The qualification there is a question of reference, not the underlying statements in the ad.

Justice William J. Brennan: (Inaudible) -- complained of by the Governor, the New York Times has never intended (Inaudible)

Justice Arthur J. Goldberg: (Inaudible) I'm reading it from page (Inaudible) of the petitioner.

And there was no -- nothing in the ads Your Honor even suggesting as we recall it that there was -- that there was any -- any truth in the ad.

It -- it said for errors and misstatements.

Justice Potter Stewart: (Inaudible) you said that -- as I understood you, that the -- that the retraction which the Times made at the request of Governor Patterson, admitted that the whole ad was false, did he say that?

Now, let's get to the question of the association of the police commissioner with these statements in the ad.

We submit that Mr. Wechsler should fail before a jury and certainly before this tribunal on the question of whether or not there was ample evidence to sustain a jury verdict of falsity.

Now, we submit that there is ample support in this record.

This matter went to the jury and the jury found that it was false.

Then six months later as -- almost, when this case came to trial, the Times with no plea of truth, with these investigations in the record, with live oral testimony from witnesses including the respondent that the matters were false, with the judicial admission, we submit of a failure to plea truth which is an absolute defense regardless of motive under Alabama law.

As I say, it stated that there were errors and misstatements in the ad.

It retracted the whole ad and it didn't simply apologize.

It didn't specify that any part of it was true.

The Times in its retraction stated that there were errors and misstatements in the ad and accordingly, it was retracted.

As to the second paragraph, he noted the four arrests for Dr. King for -- for speeding and loitering and -- and the bombing and the fact that he was under indictment for perjury charged on which he was later acquitted.

He advised the Times that the first paragraph to use his words, was virtually without foundation.

And this, may we remind the Court, was approximately six months before the trial and it was, the evidence shows after a second investigation had been made, this time by Mr. Sitton who was a regular full-time regional correspondent of the Times who was stationed in Atlanta.

Now, as Mr. Wechsler said, the Times retracted the same ad on the basis of the same demand where the Governor of Alabama used to do so for this plaintiff.

So we say that we come then to the question of the retraction.

And -- and certainly not an absolute presumption which cannot be rebutted by the defendant.

I -- I submit that this is what the -- the Court had in mind in as a prima facie presumption under Alabama law.

But in this case, the defendant didn't even plead truth.

This does not mean that the defendant cannot introduce evidence to show that it's true.

In other words, if a publication is libel per se, that's enough to get the plaintiff to the jury.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: The -- this is not an absolute presumption.

And then later on down he says, "So in the case at the time that we have here where the Court charges you that this is libelous matter, that this libelous matter is libelous per se, then falsity and malice I presume."

And then on page 824, he says, "Writings libelous per se carry the presumption of falsity and of malice."

Justice William O. Douglas: (Inaudible) because the judge charges at the bottom of page 823 that this is libel per se.

We don't say sir and no circumstances could -- could this Court review a state characterization.

It charges them with criminal offenses of the charges which certainly hold them up to contempt and -- and ridicule and disapproval and -- and we think, we are well within the -- the classic definition of libel.

But adverting to -- to some of Mr. Justice Black's observations in his questions, we say that when this kind of conduct is charged, this is within the normal usual rubric and framework of -- of libel.

Now, if we would certainly concede that if a statement was made that somebody had blonde hair and a state court held that this statement was libelous per se, well of course this -- this Court should -- could review it.

Up to now, as -- as we -- we read the cases, "The Court has left the characterization of publications as libelous or not libelous to the States."

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: Your Honor, I would -- I would answer that in two ways.

That -- that was a question that the Court decided but there we say that is a question of state law and -- and --

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: You mean the characterization of the ad as libelous Your Honor?

Justice William J. Brennan: The jury isn't the final answer on that I don't suppose.

Justice Byron R. White: But I suppose if -- (Inaudible) I gather it is that libel falls out the -- outside the protection of the First Amendment that someone has to finally decide what is libel that what -- what libel is that falls outside the protection of the First Amendment.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: -- protects state verdicts as well as -- as federal verdicts.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: State trial, yes, sir that that -- the jury verdict reexamined otherwise and in accordance with the rules of common law which is -- we understand the decisions of this Court --

There's no evidence at all to support it that the Thompson against Louisville situation --

Or in other words, we say that the Seventh Amendment protects this verdict unless this Court finds that there's no reasonable basis, whatever for it.

Justice Byron R. White: (Inaudible) -- you mean re -- you mean examine the facts?

No, it's devoid of reason, the Thompson test.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: We -- we say, no sir, unless there is no basis whatever.

What we say is, here's evidence that went to a jury on complete falsity, not just partial falsity.

We're not saying that the Times, at some point did not seek to justify as indeed with Mr. Bancroft's statement.

And -- and we say that's evidence to support a finding of falsity on the part of the jury, not just falsity in part but falsity completely.

It isn't, and this went to the jury.

This isn't true and the witness said no.

He brought out questions from these witnesses.

Justice William J. Brennan: And now you're suggesting that whatever he may have said, whatever you want to put on it in the way of interpretation that this was evidence to the jury?

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: He was the trial counsel, yes, but there were others.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I didn't mean to -- to address myself.

The -- the second and -- of the paragraph and the six I believe.

Yes sir, the two com -- paragraphs, we complained of, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Justice Potter Stewart: By the entire ad, you mean paragraph three and six?

And as I began by saying, this case comes here obviously, after a jury verdict and I'm saying that there's evidence in the record that the entire ad was false.

What I'm saying sir is that there was evidence from the Times itself from his pleadings from -- from statements of his counsel, from evidence in the case in addition to this which could justify a jury verdict that the entire ad was false.

As a matter of fact, as Mr. Wechsler pointed out, Mr. Bancroft, the Secretary of the corporation, who was there at the counsel table throughout the trial on the cross-examination, stated that he thought it was substantially correct with the exception of the padlocking statement.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I am not saying that there was no attempt made by the Times to justify.

That this was false not just in some particulars but completely false and that there was no attempt made at the trial by the Times to say that any of these was true.

I'm -- I'm saying that what went to the jury was an admission really by counsel for the New York Times from the very outset of this case, from the pleadings, from what happened during the trial and from the evidence which I will get to in a moment, sir.

1I'm addressing myself to Mr. Wechsler's contention as I understood it sir, that this ad was only incorrect in some particulars.

The type of question I have referenced to is whether the ad -- the words in the ad.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: I'm talking about -- I'm addressing myself to Mr. Wechsler's argument that this ad is -- is inaccurate in certain particulars, Your Honor.

And another question to the same witness, "You never thought it was true or had any idea it was true?"

Another example, to another witness, "You didn't believe that it was true, did you?"

That's at page 638 of the record.

I didn't think Mr. -- Commissioner Sullivan would do that.

Another example, "You didn't believe it to be true when you read it, did you Mr. Kaminsky?"

Answer: Yes sir, they know it's not true.

This is page 625 of the record.

"Isn't in a matter of common knowledge in and around Montgomery that we have been reading from this ad is not true."

An example, if I may be indulged in reading.

We have excerpted 10 examples of comments made by counsel during the course of the trial, suggestions to witnesses and comments to the Court in the course of objections to evidence and so on, suggesting in the presence of the jury, if it please the Court, that this ad was false.

We have excerpted in the appendix of our brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari on page 48.

Then we move to the trial.

It did not suggest in any one of its pleas that any part of this publication was true.

If the Times had felt this ad was true or any part of it was true, it could've set that out in its plea but it did not do so.

There was no difficulty in pleading truth in this case, we submit.

A plea which extends for almost three and a half pages of the printed record of this case, a plea which sets out the entire law of New York on libel, cite statutes as well as judicial decisions on the theory that the law of New York as a matter of choice of law should be applied to this case.

But we would like to call the Court's attention to the scope and detail of one of the pleas, pleas six which appears on page 102 of the record.

Mr. Wechsler made the argument that it might be difficult for the Times to plead truth because it might have to spell out its theory that there was some question in its mind as to whether the ad applied to the plaintiff.

Not one of those pleas, not one of the six had the slightest suggestion in it that this ad was true in any particular.

Then the lawsuit was filed and after certain procedural matters were out of the way, motions to quash and demurrers, the Times filed six separate pleas to the complaint.

There was still a refusal to retract.

This refusal to retract came, the evidence shows after an investigation made by a string correspondent in Montgomery in which he outlined the falsity of these charges.

The answer to the demand for retraction admitted at the outset that one of the serious charges contained in the ad was false, namely that the dining halls had been padlocked but there was a refusal to retract.

That was the point that I had in mind sir, yes, sir.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: C. B. & Q. which we've -- again, Chicago which we've cited in our brief Your Honor and other -- many other cases say that the protections of the Seventh Amendment which surround the reexamination of jury verdicts apply equally to state jury verdicts as they do to federal jury verdicts.

An answer was received and this is in the record.

A demand for retraction was filed as it had to be filed under Alabama law before the lawsuit began.

Now, on the issue of falsity, which is where Mr. Wechsler began, I would like to take this step-by-step as this lawsuit progressed.

We're here after a jury trial with all that that means in terms of the Seventh Amendment.

And we're not here as in Bridges on the question of whether a judge was correct when he decided a contempt proceeding.

We're not here like in Norris on a question of whether a judge in a pretrial proceeding correctly decided the question of whether there was discrimination against Negroes in the selection of a grand jury panel.

We say there was ample and indeed overwhelming evidence to support the jury verdict but we do remind the Court at the outset in view of the trend of the argument as it has gone up to now.

And we do not rely on there being something in the record to support it.

And I would like to do that in the context that this case is here obviously after a jury verdict, after the case has been before a trial court on a motion for new trial, after it's been before the high state appellate court.

I would like to address myself to what at the outset to what I consider to be a short difference between Mr. Wechsler's analysis of the facts and facts as I see them.

Mr. M. Roland Nachman, Jr: May it please the Court.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: No, we have not made that point, Mr. Justice.

Now, the (Inaudible) -- that was the main contour of the trial.

Our great exception was to the ruling that it was libelous per se and secondly, to the proposition that there was evidence that it was often concerning Sullivan.

When it came to the requests, I think this is where it came up.

The testimony of Mr. Bancroft was the story from the Times' point of view.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: There was in the testimony of course.

Justice Byron R. White: And then -- in a submission to the jury.

Justice Byron R. White: The way the case was tried, it's irrelevant whether it was true -- whether they knew it or not.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: That is not in the charge.

No -- no indication that the jury had to find malice in fact as libel are -- is thought of malice in order to justify punitive award.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: No, just -- well, yes, punitive damages are given to deter the offender and to deter others but no indication of the --

That request was made and denied and no -- there's no equivalent of that instruction in the charge that was actually given.

Now, that's I think is close as we come to it Mr. Justice White.

That is actual intent to do the plaintiff harm or that the defendant was guilty of gross negligence and recklessness and not just of ordinary negligence or carelessness in publishing the matter complained of so as to indicate a wanton disregard of plaintiff's rights.

I'm summarizing of course, could be returned only in the event that you, a jury -- it's at page 844 of the record, are convinced by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant, the New York Times Company, in publishing the matter complained of was motivated by personal ill-well.

It's requested charge 18 which is in the record and the -- that the essence of the charge was -- of the requested charge was that the jury -- that punitive damages could not be returned.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Well, no, there was an issue made but it didn't work that way.

Justice Byron R. White: The jury was supposed to decide that when (Inaudible)

Justice Byron R. White: Mr. Wechsler, was there an issue made out in the instructions or for the jury to decide about the knowledge of the Times that -- as the accuracy -- accuracy of these statements in regard with punitive damages or --

And that's what this was, that's what this case is.

I can't believe he had turned around and sustained that action if Mayor Thompson had brought the action instead of the City.

And I can't believe that in the State of Illinois where Judge Floyd Thompson wrote that great opinion, when the City of Chicago tried to sue for libel and got thrown out on the ground that you can't libel a city.

Main distinction, I say is that was not official conduct.

But I do believe it's a different case than this and it does involve a finding, a state court finding of danger of violence which is an important public end and which is not involved in this situation at all.

But if you ask me beyond that, Mr. Justice, whether I think Beauharnais was -- should be followed and was correctly decided, I do not.

It was deemed by the Court to be a different issue.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: I distinguish Beauharnais on the ground that it had nothing to do with official conduct and that the issue with respect to official conduct was expressly reserved in the majority opinion.

Justice Hugo L. Black: (Inaudible) he was one in the group, that there were a 175 or 200?

And many courts would rule -- I believe, I think most courts would rule that this document could not be libelous under the common law of the United States because the only references here that could be taken to refer the respondent are references to police that that's two larger group in the setting of this -- of this evidence, 175 to permit the statement to be read to mean either all policemen or to mean not all policemen but just the Commissioner in charge.

I believe this is a way a libel case would normally be tried.

And the first you have to do in deciding whether it's proved is to look at the document and ask yourself whether the document is reasonably susceptible of being read in a way that the innuendo charges.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: I -- I think that's a question of whether the innuendo is proved.

Justice Hugo L. Black: Would you say that it's the same that if -- if it by insinuation, in innuendo, it would not be equally chargeable if you are wrong on your first big, broad ground?

Suppose that the document as a whole showed that it was a charge intended to be the charge either by innuendo, insinuation or direct to the first statement that the police department has joined with a bunch of (Inaudible) to do the -- permit the -- what I was called offenses that are charged here.

Justice Hugo L. Black: (Inaudible) according to jury were to find -- to have treated these paragraphs separately?

It could be that one of those was accurately left, and it could be the record isn't certain about that sir.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: At the time of the four arrests that the evidence showed, I believe he lived in Montgomery.

Justice Tom C. Clark: At the time of the arrest, he lived in Atlanta?

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: At the time of this publication, he lived in Atlanta.

Justice Tom C. Clark: At this time he made (Inaudible)

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Well, he -- he at one time lived in Montgomery as I understand it but he left and moved to Atlanta.

Justice Tom C. Clark: Where is the (Inaudible)

Of course the ad doesn't say that they were made in Montgomery but in fact, they were made in Montgomery.

Four of those were made in a particular house.

Justice Tom C. Clark: Four of those were made in Montgomery.

Obviously, this was a recitation of all the grievances that this man has.

I don't accept the proposition that they have arrested him, that -- that they -- and they have arrested him as the same as that they may bomb his home.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Well, there are citizens to arrest certainly but, I -- I accept the proposition that that sentence can reasonably be tagged in this reference to police action if they had arrested them.

Justice Tom C. Clark: This was (Inaudible) arrested upon (Inaudible) arrested, isn't that correct?

Justice Tom C. Clark: This charge from the (Inaudible)

Justice Tom C. Clark: That's in the reference at paragraph six, isn't it?

But obviously, it is not explicitly important that the police arrested him.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: I -- in stating the case Mr. Justice, I accepted for purposes of argument, Commissioner Sullivan's statement that when you talk about arrest, you're talking about police.

Justice Tom C. Clark: And what if the (Inaudible) wouldn't that case, sort of place that (Inaudible)

In this -- in this document, there are two statements about the police and only two and ringing the campus was practically true.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Well, it isn't charged to be a continuant thing in Montgomery, Alabama.

Justice Hugo L. Black: -- particularly, if it's charged to be a continuant thing.

Justice Hugo L. Black: Wouldn't the jury have a right to adjourn, they have a right to determine that if the police of the city who were armed with shotguns, teargas bombs, go around and throw that -- wait around with all that that it shown that the chief of police, the man -- actually the chief of police was the Commissioner, wouldn't that be enough for a judge or jury reasonably define that the head of the department was responsible in part --

And there's not the slightest bit of a suggestion here in my submission that what the police did, they were ordered to do by Commissioner Sullivan as the city commissioner with jurisdiction over the police.

The reason -- well, the reason why they could not because the record shows if there are 175 policemen, that there was a police chief in addition to the Commissioner.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: In this case or in this statement, I most vigorously submit that the answer to that question is they could not.

The jury was -- couldn't find that that was a charge against him?

(Inaudible) and was there -- it was in evidence, (Inaudible) the evidence, Sullivan was a police commissioner, in-charge of the police, responsible for their actions, is enough to justify the jury in finding that the charge that the police acted terribly, terribly bad manner as to indicate injury.

Actually, if you start with the narrow grounds and work to broad ones because if there was no evidence sufficient to relate this publication to Sullivan, I submit we are constitutionally entitled to reversal, even if we knew it was false as a matter of history.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: You have to accept the Supreme Court's -- of Alabama's version also Mr. Justice on the other concerning point in order to get to the broad ground.

Justice Byron R. White: And the -- then the -- if you accept the Supreme Court of Alabama's aversions of -- we must deal with your broader first ground.

It says that we had in our files, dispatches, stories from our correspondents that would show that the statements were false but the record does not sustain that statement.

Now, I know that that is inconsistent with what the Supreme Court of Alabama says.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: The exact facts Mr. Justice are that at the time when the publication was made, the New York Times had nothing, by way of information, to indicate that the statements were false.

Justice Byron R. White: Mr. Wechsler, what is the fact of the record about whether the Times -- whether the Times knew these -- these statements which were involved?

Now, I should say in closing that, there's a separate submission on the jurisdictional point, I -- I must submit that on the brief.

And it is $500,000 award that from the point of view of the press of this country carries the hazard of course that this case entails.

We say there wasn't any evidence here for any -- any award but certainly, there wasn't any evidence for $500,000 award.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: It's a part of the argument on the sufficiency of the evidence really but it is an independent one.

Now, my point was whether that argument, that any of these three special grounds was all of them.

Justice William J. Brennan: Well, what -- what I really meant was, I -- I take it, one other thing that you think really trespasses upon First Amendment rights apart from anything else is the extent of which these practice, this jury completely at large in fixing -- in arriving at an award.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: The size of the award is part of our argument on the -- on the evidence exactly that the -- we say -- that we say, there was no evidence for a finding of threat or injury but we add to that that surely there wasn't any evidence to sustain a judgment of this sort which is a death penalty for any newspaper if multiplied.

Justice William J. Brennan: Mr. Wechsler, (Inaudible) is the size of the award peculiarly important?

In individual cases, you are making precisely this point in what seems to me an analogous context.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Certainly and as a matter of fact, I thought Mr. Justice Harlan that in your own opinion in one of the obscenity cases where you talked about individualized judgment.

Justice Arthur J. Goldberg: Are you saying the state (Inaudible)

I'm not saying it may make --

And if there is no threat of injury to individual reputation on the facts, then does it not follow under this general principle of the scope of review that we are entitled to reversal.

And here -- here, that fact is threat of injury to individual reputation.

This Court has the responsibility and the duty to satisfy itself that the record sustains the basis on which the constitutional right asserted has been held to be unsound, untenable discrimination, coercion in a -- in a confessions case.

But I think Norris and Alabama, we brought cases together at the be -- beginning of the second point in the brief make perfectly clear that this Court bridges in California as the perfect illustration.

I'm -- I am not making that we have the Thompson argument.

There was no evidence in the Thompson against Wilson?

Justice John M. Harlan: Are we entitled to review the evidence here short of findings.

And it's Fiske against Kansas or -- or one of the sedition cases in which the prosecution failed to make a record that warrants a finding of the jurisdictional basis for infringing the federal right.

And since that is the finding which justifies on this assumption, the suppression of a constitutionally protected freedom, we submit that the normal scope of Supreme Court review as to the facts on this obtains.

And then thirdly, on this point, we have of course the submission and we think there's a constitutional submission that there was in this record no evidence sufficient to support a finding that these particular statements in this particular advertisement threatened the -- this particular respondent's reputation in any tangible way.

There are all sorts of a -- of -- of accommodating (Inaudible) that are possible but are rejected by Alabama here.

In Massachusetts, there's no punitive damages and so on.

Judge Clark in the old Sweeney case suggested require limiting the action of proof of damage.

The qualified privilege rule might, is one way to work out an accommodation.

First, that even if -- even if I'm wrong, you have then a situation here where law should surely attempt an accommodation of conflicting interest, the interest in protecting official reputation and the interest and freedom of discussion, but there is no accommodation here.

But my further points are these.

And these actions are not brought, it's only when you encounter a monolithic situation of the sort that we encountered in Montgomery that there's any profit in bringing the action.

Then it has been the point throughout the history of law that these provisions are not enforced.

And indeed, Madison himself observed that if the law of libel hasn't been wise where it had been enforced, we'd never have had a Republic.

And that of course is what most mayors do and what the political history of the country has produced as I should say using the words in the different sense, common sense of American Libel Law, not that these actions are brought but that they're not brought.

What he'd have to, would be to make a speech using his official privilege as mayor to make a speech answering this charge.

And I make that submission because of the impact on Mayor Madison's report and other historic material about the First Amendment as applied to official, the criticism of officials.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: -- lesser submissions are because there are many that I think must produce --

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: That is the broadest statement that I made but I wish in my remaining time to indicate what the -- what the --

Justice Arthur J. Goldberg: (Inaudible) the First and the Fourteenth Amendment, no public official can sue or rely upon (Inaudible)

No, we asked for a directed verdict of course and our main grievance was that if the record verdict was denied.

No -- no submission on the matter at all, the jury, the instructions of the jury --

Justice Byron R. White: Was there any -- no -- no submission on this matter at all.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: It was free except that the evidence didn't support such a view.

Justice Byron R. White: (Inaudible) to believe that all these statements involved?

I think it's the Stromberg case but the other issue is it's so much broader.

And I think that leaves this in the position where there was -- we have basis for grievance. Really, if any of the statements are not enough.

The charge was, you must consider whether the statements refer to Commissioners, you must be satisfied that the statements referred to Commissioner Sullivan without referring to weak statements or whether any of the statements would be enough.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: The -- this issue was not clarified by the charge.

They could bring in a verdict against Times.

Justice William J. Brennan: What was the actual submission to them whether -- on -- on the premise that if they found that anyone of the statements which on its face was libelous under that rule, referred to Sullivan.

The jury did find that the statements referred to Sullivan but does that mean that all the statements referred to Sullivan or only some of the statements.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: We don't know what the jury thought --

Justice William J. Brennan: Well, wasn't that issue of the identification?

Justice William J. Brennan: (Inaudible) the jury finding, I take it was, this meant that Sullivan bombed King's home.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: -- to say that Sullivan bombed it, that was the difficulty.

Now, it was true that King's home was bombed but it was not true that Sullivan bombed his home or that we conceive that anybody in the world in his right mind could read this --

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: At -- and -- but beyond that and the point I'm trying to make Mr. Justice Stewart is that the plaintiff was contending that the statements said that Sullivan had bombed King's home.

Justice Potter Stewart: It went in -- in short, and putting it bluntly, the reason you couldn't plea that defense is that some of these statements were not true.

It must be as broad as the charge.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: And it has to be and it has to meet the charge.

And this of course is the rule of the Hallam case that Circuit Judge Taft wrote in late 90s in which pretty well-determined the black letter law in this point in the restatements and the books.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: You lose your privilege of comment unless your facts are right.

So, under the Alabama law, you lose your privilege of comment as indeed under the law of many states.

Justice Potter Stewart: Well, how about fair comment, that's suggested (Voice Overlap) --

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: It is a complete defense in Alabama but there's no privilege beyond that.

But it had to be litigated in terms of -- of whether the statements made an actionable reference to Commissioner Sullivan.

The -- we didn't think the ad said that, so the case had to be litigated in the trial court and it wasn't litigated under the happiest circumstances for the defendant anyhow.

And it is true that we couldn't plead truth and the reason why we couldn't plead truth was that we couldn't say that the ad said that Commissioner Sullivan bombed Martin Luther King's home.

And the jury was told that it was presumably false.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: -- have the issue of falsity submitted to it.

Justice Hugo L. Black: And they held it was false.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: The jury was passed on it.

Justice Hugo L. Black: And the jury has passed on it.

But the record shows how far it was true and how far it was false Mr. Justice.

Justice Hugo L. Black: I -- as I -- as I understood you had something to say about this.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Well, I don't think you can assume it was false here.

Justice Hugo L. Black: Suppose that the jury found that he did?

Now, that pictures everything of --

But if this is a valid rule of law, the proposition must be that it is constitutional to prefer the protection of official reputation against that diminution which arises from the criticism of your official conduct that it's constitutional to prefer that to the freedom of criticism or at least to do so was to criticism can be proved to be false.

It's criticism of his official conduct that's involved, not private and not his private life, though I admit that that's not an easy line to draw since obviously, private affairs do bear on officials -- on official competence and I'm not trying to oversimplify this.

We're not dealing with individual reputation here.

The issue is I think whether a state may constitutionally, for the sake of protecting individual rep -- I'm sorry, for the sake of protecting official reputation.

And the first is -- I -- I would like to emphasize what it comes to Mr. Justice.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Next to narrower and there were two.

Justice William J. Brennan: Need next to be narrowed.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Oh, I think it's posed because the -- the constitutionality of the rule by which the case was judged when challenged as this was challenged is surely an issue but there are different points that can be made and as -- does bring me to my -- my second --

Justice Byron R. White: So we -- we don't really need to -- I don't suppose that's really posed here.

Justice Byron R. White: But Mr. Wechsler, the -- we don't have here a case of a deliberate falsity --

Many of the -- of course in the historic period in which Madison was writing charges of bribery were common and it was this type of press freedom that he saw in the First Amendment.

Justice Potter Stewart: In your argument -- your argument would be the same and would cover the situation if -- if the New York Times or anybody else had accused this official of taking a bribe (Voice Overlap) --

But I believe that if James Madison were alive today, so far as anything that I can see, in anything he wrote or -- and particularly in the report on the Virginia resolutions that the submission that I am making was a submission he would make.

And this is the first time that we have had -- that the opportunity has arisen to make this submission in this Court.

In -- in short, this is a field of constitutional interpretation which is 35 years old, that is a fact of life.

But on the other hand, as I see our case, we're in the same position that the contempt cases were in, in the 1940 when the scope of the contempt power had never been considered by this Court, when obscenity was here and that issue had never been considered.

Now, I realized the weight of this argument at this time, the Sedition Act was never passed on.

We're talking about the full ambit of the First Amendment.

Justice Arthur J. Goldberg: And it was not -- were not arguing here (Inaudible) rule that applies (Inaudible)

Of course, or any --

And seditious libel was criticism of it in punishment for criticism of the Government and criticism of officials.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: The proposition is that the First Amendment was precisely designed to do a way with seditious libel.

Justice William J. Brennan: (Inaudible) to say then that the -- if the First Amendment gives it to -- in effect on absolute truth (Voice Overlap) --

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Well, if I take my instruction from James Madison, I would have to say that within any -- any references that Madison made, I can see no toying with limits or with exclusions.

Justice William J. Brennan: -- through official conduct, are there any limits whatever, which take it outside the protection of the First Amendment?

And we are actually making here in relation to this rule of law the same argument that James Madison made and that Thomas Jefferson made with respect to the validity of this Sedition Act of 1798.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: It's this rule as applied to officials, then the criticism of official conduct which we submit is what the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, I was not -- I will not say exclusively about, but was primarily about.

Well, in the particular rule, (Inaudible) circumstance (Voice Overlap) --

Justice Arthur J. Goldberg: Do you think that would (Inaudible) if the second (Inaudible) or that the statement (Inaudible) without offending the First Amendment?

And it was true in the Cantwell case as to breach of the peace and I should think --

That was certainly true in the Bridges case, it was the contempt.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Oh certainly, certainly we -- certainly we assume that but I shouldn't suppose that controversial.

Justice Arthur J. Goldberg: In this -- in the assumption (Inaudible) is the safe passing of the common law rule (Inaudible) that would probably (Inaudible)

We are attacking the constitutionality of the majority rule as it appears in the black letter of libel law.

So in that -- in that sense, I'd grasp that metal and say that does apply to this kind of a statement.

There's no qualified privilege in Alabama as there is in some states as the Court pointed out in Barr and Matteo, that -- that the -- the qualified privilege rule, it goes beyond allowing truth as a defense doesn't apply in Alabama and indeed, the writers say it's a minority rule.

If the Court finds that the statement tends to injure reputation, which the Court did find here and the jury finds that the statement makes a reference to him, and the only defense available is that the statement is true in all its factual material particulars.

Taking that rule, where it amounts to as to a public official is entitled to recover presumed in punitive damages subject to no legal limit and amount for the publication of a statement critical of his official action or even of the official action of an agency under his general supervision.

Our first proposition is that this action was judged in Alabama by an unconstitutional rule of law, a rule of law offensive to the First Amendment, and offensive on its face to the First Amendment.

Now, I come to my legal submissions and we have on the libel part of the case essentially two, perhaps three really.

It was over two hours.

I'm pretty sure it was two hours and a few minutes.

But I can't be sure the record shows it.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: I have it in my mind Mr. Justice that the jury was out two hours and I believe the record shows it.

And the record is absolutely clear on that.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Exactly that -- I would say the presumption if there's a real presumption was rebutted on the record because the respondent's own witnesses said they didn't believe it of him and they didn't think any less of him and he was asked if he could show that he'd been hurt in anyway and no way had he been hurt.

Justice William J. Brennan: (Inaudible) as these -- both from the supposed presumption of the --

Justice William J. Brennan: In any event, I gather there was no true fallback (Inaudible)

And I assume, therefore, that there is no requirement of state law that there be such a separation.

It's not adverted to in the opinion.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: We -- we prayed for a separation which was denied, argued that this was error in the Supreme Court of Alabama.

And our contention that the verdict and the judgment including of course the separate attack on the enormous award, work in abridgement of the freedom of the press were all rejected below.

If this doctrine is constitutional libel law and of course we submit that it is not.

And I've got to prove, I've got to prove truth and make my defense by proving true.

Though, I can't say that the New York Police tap wires for example, though I believe they do without giving Commissioner Murphy in -- an action against May since it's illegal for them to do it without a court order in New York and under the federal law.

Now, if you talk about the police, you're talking about the Commissioner.

But in any event, this comes very close if it does not actually become a kind of presumption.

I don't know what those legal patterns were.

And what the Court said is at page 1157 of the record and the substance of it was that in measuring the performance or deficiencies of groups like public groups like police, Fire Department, other municipal agents, put praise or criticism, is usually attach to the official in complete control of the body that this is common knowledge and as I said, has its origin and established legal patterns.

So that even on conventional grounds, there was any basis for a verdict.

It encountered the question on the issue whether -- either as a matter of state law or as a matter of constitutional law, there was here sufficient evidence connecting this publication with the respondent.

The -- the Alabama Supreme Court made its view quite explicit.

I think that emphasis was placed on the official position of Commissioner Sullivan.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Well, I can't say that the court went that far Mr. Justice.

There was no need for any proof of damage by the plaintiff, actual damage by the plaintiff whatsoever and that punitive damages were available.

That question was put to the jury and as to the rest the Court told the jury that when a statement is libelous per se, falsity and malice and special damage -- falsity of malice and general damages are presumed.

But the trial court did submit to the jury the question whether these statements which the jury was told, were libelous per se were made of and concerning Commissioner Sullivan.

No jury ever passed on whether these statements were libelous.

And that was a ruling made by the Court.

Then on the libel part of the case, they ruled that these paragraphs in suit where libelous per se testing that by the general test that whether they tended to injure reputation.

All they said about it was that the First Amendment does not protect libelous statements.

Now, the courts below denied our contention that this publication was protected by the First Amendment.

So that I suppose you get to New York Times in a few newsstands in Alabama the way you can get the Montgomery Advertiser at the Time Square in New York City if you look for it.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: 394 copies went to Alabama of which some 350 went to mail subscribers in Alabama being mailed -- put into the United States mails in New York and the balance went by carrier, by rail carrier and perhaps a few even airmailed, air carrier I mean, to newsstands, news dealers in Alabama who simply sell them.

Justice John M. Harlan: And with 394 copies you say?

Justice John M. Harlan: -- how many days did this advertisement published?

Justice John M. Harlan: Could I ask you one (Voice Overlap) --

Now, I come to the rulings --

And of course, the Supreme Court of Alabama made a great deal of this testimony of Mr. Bancroft on the appeal and viewed it as the, I should say the prime basis for sustaining the punitive award.

He considered that except for that padlocking statement, the material was generally the general tenure of the material was substantially correct.

The only other thing is that at the trial itself, Harding Bancroft, who was then Secretary of the New York Times, repeated what in substance had been said in the interrogatories earlier that while it was very hard to say what the New York Times thought about the truth of these statements since the Times is a large enterprise composed of many individuals that he could say that of all the knowledge that the Times had was embodied in these reports to which I have referred and that is, he read them.

And they asked to let him know if he would, how he did feel that it referred to him and of course he brought suit at that point instead of undertaking correspondence and that didn't surprise the Times which knew that he wanted to bring a suit.

The Times' counsel replied that so far as they could tell, the third paragraph of the ad was accurate except for the padlocking statement and they couldn't see how that or anything else referred to Commissioner Sullivan.

Now, Times didn't apologize to the respondent and indeed when he wrote a demand for a retraction.

But that would be an issue in that case if it ever went to trial as to whether he'd be entitled to any punitive damages.

Governor Patterson obviously didn't think it adequate because he sued $4 million after he got it.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: The -- the effect of it Mr. Justice was to bar punitive damages --

Justice John M. Harlan: What's the effect of the retraction under Alabama law?

In explaining why they did this, they said they did it in deference to the high office that he held as -- as Governor of the State.

The Times did retract the -- these two paragraphs formally at the request of the Governor of Alabama, the then Governor, Governor Patterson who claimed to have been libeled and the Times published their retraction saying that they didn't intend to imply by this statement any misconduct on the part of the Governor.

Now, I don't think any of the other facts in the record add significantly to the case.

On the contrary, what we claimed and claimed throughout the trial was that the -- this piece of paper couldn't be read to make the charge that Commissioner Sullivan had bombed Dr. King's home.

And of course, they didn't claim that it was true that Commissioner Sullivan bombed Dr. King's home.

Had worked overtime on it and so on which of course was not challenged by anybody and counsel for the defense called in this position, found himself saying, "Well, we don't claim that this was true."

And accepting this theory, the trial court permitted him solemnly to prove that he hadn't really bombed Dr. King's home and that the police in fact had done everything they could to solve that atrocious crime.

When it came to the testimony about this reading of this document, which I submit is fantastic, the respondent merely said that he considered that since these statements appeared in paragraphs that contained a reference to the police that they all referred to the same people or at least could reasonably be taken to refer to the same people and that he did take them to all refer to himself.

He acknowledges that that was the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education and he doesn't take that to allude to himself.

He says that the claim of libel was at the -- this publication charged Commissioner Sullivan with padlocking the dining hall, with bombing Dr. King's home, with assaulting and arresting him, with charging with perjury and indeed with everything that happened except that for some reason that I don't quite understand, he makes an exception for the expulsion of students.

Now, at this point, I think I should recognize that the respondent takes a wholly different view what this case is about and I wish to state his view.

But even if it could, what I have said, I think makes clear that any evidential basis for the claim of falsity must rest on very small discrepancies indeed between what was said and what the record shows to have been the case.

Now, we urge below and we argue here that such a reference is that to the police cannot be read as an allusion to the respondent as Commissioner in-charge in the context of prosecution of an action for libel.

And the only reference to the police is on the seven arrests which was wrong, it should've been fourth.

And the sixth paragraph of course makes no allusion to Montgomery at all as I indicated earlier in response to Mr. Goldberg's question.

If anybody has a grievance about it, it's the state authorities that are -- they referred to him those words and not the Commissioner of the City of Montgomery or any other local authorities even if this theory of reference to the individual could be accepted which I deny.

So far as the padlocking statement is concerned, I submit that from the context and this is the real grievance about this paragraph incidentally, the padlocking, I submit that that grievance has just absolutely nothing to do whether respondent did this.

Now, as far as the sixth paragraph is concerned -- oh, I -- I do want to say this.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: That these Montgomery Police, the record shows were deployed nearby.

Justice William J. Brennan: You said they were stationed nearby or something like that.

Justice William J. Brennan: -- proof of those who where there on this occasion were the Montgomery Police?

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: No, these were the Montgomery police who made that --

Justice William J. Brennan: What were the facts -- well, two days later, you mentioned the -- there were more police to the number of arrests, who were they?

It could be the state --

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: It could be the state police.

Justice Byron R. White: (Inaudible) the local police, could it be the state (Inaudible)

The rest of that paragraph refers to state authorities when they put -- entire student body protested to state authorities.

And I call to the Court's attention that there are only two allusions to police in the -- in the parts of the ad that are involved as the statement in the first paragraph that after their leaders were expelled from school, truckloads of police, armed, ringed the campus, armed with shotguns and teargas.

Now, I think the most helpful thing that I could do next is to emphasize what the reference is to the police in the police of activities are.

He apparently took a different view of the appropriate response to this type of publication.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: No he did not Mr. Justice.

That references to the police, brought this publication home to him because he was the Commissioner who had jurisdiction over the police and the witnesses who testified for him are the people in Montgomery, some of them friends of his, testified to just about that.

And this really is the basic claim of the respondent in the case on which he won.

And that he added that when they described police action or police activities, they were associated particularly with himself as the Commissioner who had jurisdiction of the Police Department.

Now, Commissioner Sullivan testified and what he said was quite simply that he felt that the statements in the advertisement that referred to events in Montgomery reflected on him, on the other Commissioners and on the whole community.

The mayor is his boss, in-charge of the whole show.

So it's something like the relationship between -- in a large city between the police commissioner and the mayor.

But the police chief reports to Sullivan and he's responsible himself or to Sullivan.

He doesn't supervise the police force daily in the sense as the police chief does and there is a police chief.

And he specifically, the Commissioner of Public Affairs and as such, his jurisdiction includes the supervision of a number of departments, police, fire, scales and cemeteries being the four are in -- as the record indicates.

But I think in order to understand Commissioner Sullivan's position fully and I would like to put it now as I understand it, let me say first that he's been a Commissioner, elected Commissioner of the City of Montgomery since October 5th, 1959.

Justice Potter Stewart: -- on one count, it's punishable by 10 years (Voice Overlap) --

Justice Potter Stewart: Then I suppose that's technically inaccurate and it says that the (Inaudible)

That point was not made by our opponents, they made almost every other point but they didn't make that one.

Justice Byron R. White: Likely, I supposed the ad really charges "eight", that's seven arrests of a certain type (Inaudible) now he is charged -- getting charged with (Inaudible) does that make the eighth?

Justice William J. Brennan: The only concession you're making is to enact it in using the word "seventh."

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: And those are the only --

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: The -- no, I don't concede any inaccuracy but I -- I say that the record shows a contrariety of evidence on the question whether Dr. King was assaulted.

Justice William J. Brennan: But do you otherwise?

Justice William J. Brennan: But you do, as I understood you so far, if in effect you had conceded or review their mistake or inaccuracy, the word "seventh."

We are at a loss to know precisely in what respect the respondent claims that he was libeled.

And under the Alabama practice, no innuendo need be alleged so that we are at a loss and it gives a -- may I say, a very unreal quality to this proceeding.

The pleading did not separate out any particular statement.

I would have to refer to what the respondent argued at various times of this case.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: I -- I would have to answer your question in this way Mr. Justice.

In other words, again and again, the Southern violators then started singing, speech of protests and intimidation to violence, is that (Voice Overlap) --

Justice William J. Brennan: May I ask Mr. Weschler, turning again to that sixth paragraph, is it every statement of every sentence to which the libel charge was addressed.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: I know that it is a state college under the State Board of Education where they -- where the Governor of the State, the ex officio chairman of the Board of Trustees.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: The words beginning again and again and down through the italicized words "10 years" on the eighth line.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Oh in -- it's the sixth, yes.

Chief Justice Earl Warren: You said it -- you said it to be in the fifth paragraph that they object to?

It would be easy to check.

I -- I'm reasonably confident of my recollection about the fifth.

I think perhaps it was on the perjury charge that he'd been in Atlanta and was arrested there.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: He was arrested four times in Montgomery and my recollection is that that didn't count another arrest in Atlanta.

And I'm glad you asked me that because it reminds me that I failed to call attention to the perfectly obvious fact that this sixth paragraph doesn't say a thing about Montgomery.

There actually was another one outside of Montgomery Mr. Justice but when I said four, I meant four in Montgomery.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: There were four in Montgomery.

Now, I come now to the theory, I -- I shall not permit myself to call it evidence that was relied on to sustain a verdict that these statements to which I've called attention libeled this respondent.

Now, these are the essential facts about publication that the courts below held unprotected by the First Amendment.

He was in fact subsequently acquitted of that charge.

And as I said earlier, he, at this very time, was charged with perjury and an indictment in two counts that did indeed carry a potential sentence of 10 years if he'd been convicted.

And he was arrested not seven times to be sure as the other paragraph says but it was established that he was arrested four times.

He claimed at least to have been assaulted on one occasion when he was arrested, though the arresting officer denied that there had been a physical assault and there was a controversy in the record about that.

One of the bombs failed to go off, the other did go off, he and his wife were home at the time.

Dr. King's home had at that time been bombed not once but twice.

Now, if I turn to the sixth paragraph, the Southern violators' paragraph, I have to say that it was shown by the evidence to be a lot more accurate.

The arrested students subsequently the record shows pleaded guilty and were fined in varying amounts for minor crimes like disorderly conduct.

And the superintendent of grounds called the police and they came in, the students had grown rowdy and they made some 32 arrests.

Their armament is not shown by the record one way or another and that it is true that after a subsequent, in a period of a few days, there was another demons -- student demonstration, this time on the campus.

And reverting to the first sentence which says that truckloads of police armed with shotguns and teargas ringed the campus, the evidence doesn't show that the police ever ringed the campus and that a literal sense, it shows that they were deployed near the campus in large numbers on three occasions.

The evidence says that it was not padlocked and of course, there was no attempt to starve the students into -- into submission.

There's no evidence that the dining hall was padlocked.

And they -- more than that, the ad was wrong in stating that their dining hall was padlocked in an attempt to starve them into submission.

They didn't refuse to reregister or at least only an infinitesimal number may have.

That I think is consistent with what the paragraph says but the statement was inaccurate in saying as it did that the students refused to reregister.

And of course when the expulsion took place, there was a student strike in protest.

I believe the minutes of that meeting showing their expulsion also appear in the record, they were proven independently by another witness by respondent.

They were expelled by the State Board of Education of which the Governor was ex officio chairman and at which he appointed the members.

Now, after this had happened, nine of the student leaders of this lunch counter demonstration were in fact expelled from college.

Justice Potter Stewart: At -- in or near Montgomery?

This was a protest against the earlier denial of lunch counter service in the courthouse building to some 30 students who had demanded service.

And massing on the steps, they said the Lord's Prayer and sang the Star-Spangled Banner and then they walked back to the campus.

Now, what it shows is that there was a big demonstration in Montgomery, a thousand students went down from the Alabama State College, the Negro College there, went down to the Capitol steps as a group.

They were then obtained on discovery by the plaintiffs and put into the record and they really constitute the -- I shouldn't say the whole because the respondent cuddles with this, but I say the heart of the case as to what actually occurred.

Now, I say the respondent's evidence which consisted principally of reports that were made to the New York Times by its investigators after this controversy started and the suit was threatened or instituted, the Times had Claude Sitton, it’s Atlanta correspondent and a lad named McKee, who was a stringer in Montgomery, investigate what had happened and these reports came in.

It might be -- be helpful if I said that it runs from pages 567 to 818, the whole case on the merits is in those pages.

The -- the evidence in the libel action was all in the second volume and it doesn't run to more than -- than a couple of hundred pages actually.

It was shown by the evidence which I might say consisted and it's a very imposing record which proves to be much less difficult than it seems because a great part of it consisted nothing but the reproduction of newspaper stories that were published by the New York Times in which the respondent's claim showed it was doing business in Alabama but about at least half of these five volumes consist of nothing but those stories.

Turning from the complaint to the record, the respondent's evidence showed that this third paragraph beginning in Montgomery, Alabama was indeed inaccurate in some particulars and I would like to state as faithfully as I can, what those inaccuracies were.

Those were the portions of the advertisement set forth in the complaint in which the action was based.

Now, the respondent claimed in the complaint and the Court and jury found that he was libeled by the third paragraph of the advertisement, the paragraph that begins in Montgomery, Alabama and by the first eight lines of the sixth paragraph, at the bottom of the middle column, the words that begin again and again, "The Southern Violators."

And reading it in this way, the -- noting the prominence of the name to some of the signatories, the employees of the Times who received it, received the copy and the order for its publication from a New York advertising agency who received it of course in New York, approved its publication as what is called a newspaper parlance in editorial type advertisement, and so that publication appeared.

But it names no names but Dr. King's and plainly makes no personal attack on any individual.

I suggest, therefore, that the text was thus a statement of protest, that ad coelum interwoven to be sure with a recitation of events.

They urged the importance of defending Dr. King and the need of a material help by those who, in the language of the advertisement, are taking the risks facing jail and even death in glorious reaffirmation of our Constitution and its Bill of Rights.

Then the paragraphs go on to praise Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a symbol and the inspiration of the movement to allege that his peaceful protest had been answered by what the ad calls the “Southern Violators” with intimidation and violence designed to remove him as a leader.

Now, the succeeding paragraphs recite a series of alleged abuses visited on student demonstrators in some dozen Southern cities including Montgomery, Alabama.

And it proceeds to claim that in their efforts to uphold these guarantees, they're being met by an unprecedented wave of terror by those who would deny and negate that document which the whole world looks upon as setting the pattern for modern freedom.

The text itself begins with the assertion that thousands of Southern Negro students are engaged in wide-spread non-violent demonstrations in positive affirmation of the right to live in human dignity as guaranteed by the United -- U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

The lead caption, "Heed Their Rising Voices" is a phrase that's taken from a New York Times’ editorial of some days earlier as -- is indicated at the top right hand corner where there's a quotation from the editorial, which indicates accurately the sympathy with which this newspaper has viewed the Negro protest demonstrations in the South.

The recitation in the text, these 10 paragraphs, the small type, is of course a statement designed to support this cause.

The funds for his defense for the support of the embattled students and the struggle for the right to vote, these are the stated goals of the solicitation.

And those needs are put as the defense of Martin Luther King who I should add was then facing trial for perjury in Montgomery, Alabama.

The object of the publication was to obtain financial support for the three needs and I'm now quoting, which was stated in the last paragraph, the paragraph beginning, "We urge you to join hands."

Some 60 names of well-known people, actors, lawyers, clergymen, politicians like Norman Thomas and the name of Mrs. Roosevelt.

The members appear under the statement, "Your help is urgently needed now."

The other offices of the Committee are listed at the bottom of the page that includes such names as Father Ford and Dr. Fosdick.

Chairman of the Committee was A. Philip Randolph, the President was -- the co-chairman was Gardener C. Taylor, Dr. Taylor of New York.

It was published on behalf of the Committee, the name of which is on the bottom which was called the "Committee to defend Martin Luther King in the struggle for freedom in the South."

This -- is the -- it’s reproduced as the way it looked in the Times when it was published as well as the text.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: -- which of course is a facsimile copy.

Justice William O. Douglas: Where is that printed here?

As it shows upon its face, it was an advertisement published on behalf of an organization --

Since in my submission, the case not only begins with the publication but ends there as well.

The publication which the respondent claims to have libeled him was attached to the complaint and it's most readily available, in facsimile form at the back of our brief.

Justice Arthur J. Goldberg: THe verdict of this came (Inaudible)

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: It's pending in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County on an -- is yet undetermined motion for new trial presumably, being held pending the decision of this Court here.

Justice Potter Stewart: And -- and what's the status of that case now?

And that case of course was not removed, that was after a verdict.

One of the three Commissioners.

Justice Potter Stewart: One of the three Commissioners is the mayor.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: He was the Commissioner who's called the mayor.

Justice William J. Brennan: Which was the -- which was the James case, is that another Commissioner of Montgomery or (Voice Overlap) --

And that case involving the order of remand is also pending in this Court on petition for writ of certiorari in Number 52 of this term.

The removal was sustained by the District Court but remand was ordered in a divided judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

The other three cases were removed by the Times to the United States District Court.

Of the other cases, only the James case, the case by Mayor James has gone to trial, there was the same verdict there but that's pending on motion for new trial in the State of -- in the Alabama Court.

But this was the first of the five cases brought to trial and it resulted in a verdict in a judgment against all defendants for the $500,000 claim.

They had dominance in these other suits, total $2 million.

I should say that similar actions based on the same advertisement were instituted by the other two city Commissioners by a former Commissioner and by the then Governor of the State of Alabama, Governor Patterson.

The complaint demands damages of $500,000 for libel allegedly contained in two paragraphs of a full page advertisement that was published in the Times on March 29th, 1960.

These are the petitioners in Number 40.

It was brought against the Times and four codefendants who were then residents of Alabama, four clergymen, the Reverends Abernathy, Shuttlesworth, Seay and Lowery.

The action was instituted by the respondent, Mr. L.B. Sullivan, one of the three elected Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama.

And second, how far a state may force a newspaper which publishes a thousand miles away to defend libel actions instituted in its forum because its correspondents go there on occasion to cover news of national importance as -- for a very small amount of advertising emanates from sources in the State and a very small circulation of the paper in this instance, 394 copies of the total daily circulation of 650,000 found its way into the State.

The questions presented are, in general, first, how far the civil law of libel may be used by state officials to punish the publication of statements critical of their official conduct or of the conduct of the agencies of which they are in-charge.

I was saying that the writ calls for review, a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama which in our submission poses hazards for these -- freedom of the press, not confronted since the early days of the Republic.

It summons for review a judgment of that court which poses in our submission hazards to the freedom of the press of a dimension not confronted since the early days as the Republic.

This case is here together with Number 40 on writ of certiorari granted a year ago to the Supreme Court of Alabama.

Mr. Herbert Wechsler: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.

Argument of William P. Rogers

Chief Justice Earl Warren: Ralph D. Abernathy et al., Petitioners, versus L. B. Sullivan.

General Rogers.

Mr. William P. Rogers: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.

Judge Pierce and I represent the four individual petitioners in this case which is a companion case to the one that was argued yesterday.

And if the Court will permit us, we would like to divide our time as far as the argument is concerned.

The courts of Alabama could have decreed that these four individual petitioners too, should be punished in a civil libel action.

No actual or special damages were awarded.

The trial court in charging the jury, merely said that punitive damages means such damages as are given as a kind of punishment to a defendant with the view to preventing similar wrongs in the future and that falsity and malice are presumed.

The jury responded by awarding a $500,000 punitive damages against these individual petitioners which was the largest such judgment in the history of Alabama up to that time.

I think it'd be --

Justice John M. Harlan: (Inaudible)

Mr. William P. Rogers: I'm not sure that's certainly in this case, there was no --

Justice John M. Harlan: (Inaudible)

Mr. William P. Rogers: Yes.

Justice Hugo L. Black: They can be, given the evidence.

Mr. William P. Rogers: I think it's interesting in that connection Your -- Your Honor that the largest fine that could've been imposed in a criminal libel action in the State of Alabama would have been $500.

Now, what did -- what did these petitioners do to deserve this punishment?

A precise recital of the evidence brings into sharp focus the petitioners' constitutional rights have been violated.

The petitioners are not in truth being punished for what they did or failed to do in this case or what they said and did elsewhere and who they are.

That the central fact of this case is that they are being -- drastically punished because they were Negroes residing in Alabama, who've had the courage to speak out in the struggle to -- to achieve the rights guaranteed by the Constitution for all citizens regardless of race or color.

Indeed, these petitioners, Dr. King and these four petitioners are the leaders of the civil rights movement in Alabama.

What was the proof in the case?

In the testimony offered by the plaintiff, there were only two brief references to the petitioners.

The first was that their names appeared in the advertisement as published by the New York Times in March 29th, 1960.

The second was that a few days before this suit was started, each received identical letters from the plaintiff demanding that they publish a retraction.

There was no evidence that the petitioner's authorized the use of their names in the advertisement.

There was no evidence that they were members of the group or committee that inserted the advertisement in the paper.

And there was no evidence that they had any knowledge of the advertisement at all that appeared in the New York Times.

That's all there was to the plaintiffs' case, no other evidence.

The defendants then proceeded to show that the total failure of proof by the plaintiff was not a mere oversight.

Mr. John Murray who is a volunteer worker for the Committee to defend Martin Luther King in the struggle for freedom in the South testified that on or about March 25th, 1960, he took the draft to the advertisement in question to New York Times and gave it to a Mr. Aronson, who was an employee of the paper.

Mr. Murray testified that in addition to the proposed advertisement with the names of a large group of individuals and a letter from A. Philip Randolph, saying that those persons were signed members of the Committee endorsed the advertisement.

Mr. Murray and Mr. Aronson, who were the two people who would know both testified at the trial and each testified that the names of these four petitioners were not on the list.

Mr. Murray further testified that the Executive Director of the Committee, a Mr. Rustin, some time later after the original advertisement had been submitted to the paper, decided that he wanted some prominent names from the South to be included among the sponsors.

So he proceeded to add to the original list submitted to New York Times, some names from a list he had in his desk of persons who belonged to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an entirely separate organization.

Now, because he was anxious to get the advertisement published, he decided not to take the time to ask the individuals for permission to use their names.

All of the petitioners testified, each as a spiritual and religious leader of his people.

All have been active in the cause for civil rights.

Each testified though that he had not been and was not a member of the Committee to defend Martin Luther King.

Non-authorized publication of the advertisement that appeared over New York Times or had any knowledge of the advertisement prior to its publication, the cross examination was brief and nothing was to develop -- was developed to cast any doubt on the accuracy of the testimony of these petitioners.

Why then, it might be asked, was such harsh punishment imposed?

It is stated that it is because the petitioners somehow ratified the publication of the advertisement.

After the publication of this advertisement, there was considerable publicity about it in Alabama.

It was finally decided that several lawsuits should be commenced by certain state officials but there was a difficulty.

Respondent and others like him obviously had no actual or special damages and a mere technical victory would have not have served their basic purpose of the litigation which was to intimidate.

So how could they accomplish the end that they sought whether it was decided to base the lawsuits on Title 7, Section 914 of the Code of Alabama which provides that a public official in order to recover punitive damages must make a written demand on the person who published the material demanding a public retraction five days before bringing a suit.

So few days before starting this lawsuit, the plaintiff wrote a letter to each petitioners demanding a retraction of the fall -- false and defamatory matter published by you in the New York Times on March 29th in this prominent public manner as the original publication.

Parenthetically, the letter only set forth two paragraphs from the advertisement and these were out of context.

Petitioner according to the testimony never saw the advertisement until the lawsuit was started.

Now, none of these petitioners, after they received this letter and during a few days before the suit was started, answered the letter or attempted to place an advertisement in the New York Times saying that they had nothing to do with the original advertisement.

This is the -- the basis, the sole basis for the claim of ratification.

What did the petitioner say about it when they were asked?

Well, Reverend Seay was asked why he did not reply to the letter.

He testified, and this on page 789 of the record, "Well in the first place, I was so amazed about the complaint and about the ad that I was afraid to make any reply to it until I had some legal advice for fear I might incriminate myself.

I had no knowledge of it whatsoever."

When Reverend Shuttlesworth, page 789 of the record, was asked why he did not reply to the letter, he said, "I had not written a
