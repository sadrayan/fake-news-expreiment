A Red, White and Blue Christmas
Thank you for joining us for A Red, White and Blue Christmas at the White House!

This years theme celebrates the patriotic spirit that unites us as Americans. During this hopeful season we are reminded of the blessings of freedom we enjoy, and we renew our sense of what is important in our lives. Family and friends gather to share old traditions and create new ones. Strangers exchange smiles and tidings of good cheer. Children happily sing along to the songs of the holidays and help bake holiday treats for their loved ones.

We are grateful to the White House Executive Residence staff, artists from around the country and many volunteers for decorating the White House red, white and blue! Thanks to their creativity and hard work, this years holiday decorations reflect the best of the American spirit.

May your holidays be filled with joy and happy memories.

George W. Bush | Laura Bush
