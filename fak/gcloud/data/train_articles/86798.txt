— The declaration on Thursday that Kim Jong-un is now the “supreme leader” of North Korea was an emotional turning point for the hermetic country — reaffirming support for the young heir after nearly two weeks of national mourning for his father, Kim Jong-il .

The naming of Mr. Kim as supreme leader was partly a formality — all signals have pointed to his taking over both the military and the powerful Workers’ Party — but it was also an important step in the push to strengthen his position in any power struggles that might follow.

Mr. Kim is young — believed to be in his 20s — and untested, making him more vulnerable to challenges.

The announcement on Thursday of Mr. Kim’s elevation was made by Kim Yong-nam, the president of the North Korean Parliament, who is considered the ceremonial head of state. It was followed by similar speeches by top party and military officials.
