Recovery Act: Smart Grid Investment Grants
GRID MODERNIZATION

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) - which President Obama signed into law on February 17th, 2009 - was an unprecedented action to stimulate the economy. It included measures to modernize our nationâ€™s energy and communication infrastructure and enhance energy independence. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) provided DOE with $4.5 billion to modernize the electric power grid. Under the largest program, the Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG), DOE and the electricity industry have jointly invested $8 billion in 99 cost-shared projects involving more than 200 participating electric utilities and other organizations to modernize the electric grid, strengthen cybersecurity, improve interoperability, and collect an unprecedented level of data on smart grid operations and benefits.
