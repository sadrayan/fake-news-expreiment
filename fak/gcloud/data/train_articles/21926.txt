Eye on the Bailout
On four separate occasions, the government offered aid to AIG to keep it from collapsing, rising from an initial $85 billion credit line from the Federal Reserve to a possible commitment of about $182 billion between the Treasury ($69.84 billion) and Fed ($112.5 billion). The "committed" number above only reflects Treasury's commitment, which came under the TARP.

On January 11, 2011, AIG, the Treasury and Federal Reserve executed a plan to extricate AIG from government support. AIG paid off the Fed's loans. To extricate the Fed from its investment in two AIG subsidiaries, the plan called for AIG to draw down approximately $20 billion more from the Treasury (for a total investment of $68 billion). AIG used that money to buy the stakes in the subsidiaries, which it then immediately transferred to Treasury. The plan also called for the Treasury to convert its other investments in AIG into AIG common stock - bringing its holdings to 92.1 percent of the company. To recoup the $68 billion, the plan called for Treasury to sell off its stake in the AIG subsidiaries and its AIG common stock over time. The "Events" notes to the left show Treasury's remaining equity stake in AIG as it sold off those shares.

On Dec. 11, 2012, the Treasury sold its last remaining portion of AIG stock, ultimately earning a profit of about $5 billion. The Federal Reserve ultimately realized a profit of about $17.7 billion from its role in AIG's bailout.
