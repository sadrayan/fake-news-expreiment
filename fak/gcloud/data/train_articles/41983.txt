Jason Kander’s Statement On The Proposed Plan To Close Guantanamo Bay
Jason Kander released the following statement in response to the Obama Administration’s proposal to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba:

“As I have said before, in our current national security situation we should not close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Our focus right now needs to be defeating ISIS, and we can’t risk the possibility that the terrorists housed at Guantanamo could rejoin the battlefield. These dangerous prisoners should not be transferred to the United States, and I strongly urge President Obama to reconsider this plan.”
