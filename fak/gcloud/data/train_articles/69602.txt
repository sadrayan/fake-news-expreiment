About Talkline

Talkline is a two hour call-in portrait of West Virginia, conducted by the state’s best known broadcaster. The Mountain State’s politics and history, prejudices and preferences are voiced by a native son and the people who phone in. Hoppy Kercheval often begins his discussion with an opening monologue or distinguished guest before opening up the phone lines. Since he is arguably as familiar to state lawmakers and members of the judiciary as they are to him, discussions can be both informative and highly entertaining.

Through Talkline, Kercheval provides his listeners with unparalleled access to newsworthy figures and events, as well as the reactions and insight of neighbors across the state. The result is fine journalism and often great fun.
