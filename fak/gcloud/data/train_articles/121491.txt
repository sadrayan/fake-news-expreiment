Jewish Michigan State student won't be charged for false claims in alleged hate crime case
LANSING, MI -- Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said a 19-year-old Jewish Michigan State University student who alleged he was assaulted last month because of his religion won't face criminal charges for false reporting.





Zachary Tennen , of Franklin, said he was at a party about 1:30 a.m. on Aug. 26 in the 500 block of Spartan Avenue, about a half-mile north of MSU's campus, when two college-aged men asked him if he was Jewish. When he responded in the affirmative, the pair beat him unconscious then stapled his mouth, he alleged.

A sophomore journalism major, Tennen said his attackers made Nazi gestures and said they were members of the Ku Klux Klan. When he regained consciousness, Tennen said he took a taxi cab to Sparrow Hospital as no one at the party helped him.





The case was closed Thursday, though, after authorities concluded there was no merit to Tennen's assertions of a hate crime. A police report on the matter detailed the accounts of multiple witnesses who said Tennen harassed and inappropriately touched women at the party, leading to his being punched in the mouth.





Dunnings said what Tennen did does not constitute filing a false police report.





"The charge here would either be assault and battery or ethnic intimidation," he said. "He was struck, and his jaw was broken, so under those circumstances it was not unreasonable for him to allege he was a victim of assault.





"It was not false."





All parties agreed the case should be closed rather than litigating the allegations of a hate crime, Dunnings said.





"I have spoken with the principals...and everybody agrees in the interest of justice it's just better that this matter just go away," he said. "I think this is the right thing to do."
