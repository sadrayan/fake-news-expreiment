About Patriot Journal

Patriot Journal is dedicated to giving America-loving patriots access to the news the mainstream media won’t report. We aim to give our readers the right perspective on the political news of the day, no matter how unpopular it may be, written by hardworking Americans for hardworking Americans.

Founded at the beginning of the historic 2016 election season, Patriot Journal grew from a small page to one of America’s most widely read online political journals, with a million Facebook followers. We had a powerful, wide-ranging voice in a critical time in our country to expose the lies coming from the media, pollsters and political spin machines, helping justice prevail for the American people on Election Day.

At Patriot Journal, we the editors and writers are committed to serving our readers with real, well-sourced, and timely news. In a day and age when ‘fake news’ is defined as whatever the Establishment Left decides it doesn’t like, we are firmly committed to providing only the real news and our journalistic perspective on it.
