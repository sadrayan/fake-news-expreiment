He is wrong. There are celebrations on Nov. 4 which is the anniversary of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy. So there is no such thing as a death to America national holiday.

Best,

Professor Boroujerdi:

Good afternoon. I write because I am trying to fact-check Sen. Ted Cruz, who said in a radio interview yesterday: ““Every year in Iran, they celebrate death to America day, which is the anniversary of Iran in the 1970s taking Americans hostage.”

Cruz said, more fully: “..every year, rather, Iran celebrates as a holiday what they call death to America day. That’s an actual holiday in Iran. Here, we have Thanksgiving, we have Christmas, we have the 4th of July. Every year in Iran, they celebrate death to America day, which is the anniversary of Iran in the 1970s taking Americans hostage.”

Is this so? I would like to draw from your expertise for this story.
