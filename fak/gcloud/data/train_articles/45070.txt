Homegrown Violent Extremists (HVEs)
In September 2016, Ahmad Khan Rahimi carried out a series of attacks and successfully interdicted bombings in Seaside Park (Ocean County) and Elizabeth (Union County), New Jersey, and New York City. No injuries resulted from the New Jersey incidents, but 31 people suffered non-life threatening injuries from the explosions in New York Cityâ€™s Chelsea neighborhood.
