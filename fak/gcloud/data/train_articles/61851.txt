Fact Check: Is This a Photo of Christine Blasey Ford and Bill Clinton?
The saga of photos allegedly linking Dr. Christine Blasey Ford to Soros and the Clintons continues.

One Facebook user posted a photo of a caucasian, blonde woman and Bill Clinton together with the caption, “Well Well Well. Look what was found on Facebook. Dr. Ford with the mother of all predators.”

(TWS questions whether or not the user meant “father” instead.)



If you, internet user, were to take a screenshot of the photo and upload it into Google’s search engine, you would quickly discover that the woman in the photo is, in fact, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.



Case closed.
