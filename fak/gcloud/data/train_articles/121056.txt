LP Ranch
Whitetail Deer Hunting

Along with our cattle and Quarter Horse operation, we at LP Ranch also pride ourselves with our whitetail deer hunts. Going on seven consecutive years, our deer have had protein and high-quality feed available year round. Our costs may go up but we believe in never letting our deer see the bottom of a feed bunk. Keeping feed out for them 365 days a year ensures the highest level of nutrition.

In 2007, we decided it was time to expand. So, we chose to high fence the headquarters in Irion County which allows for better management and maintenance of our deer herd. With a young deer herd, we feel extremely blessed to have had a great gene pool from the beginning.
