Subject: FW: Births, unintended pregnancies

Carrie:

We are looking into a claim that unintended pregnancies and abortions decreased in Texas after lawmakers moved to cut off aid to Planned Parenthood clinics. Has the agency analyzed this? Are there relevant figures for unintended pregnancies and abortions year by year? The legislative action took place in 2011 and took effect by the end of 2012, I believe. I am planning to get back to this next week.

Here is the data you asked about. I’m also attaching a rundown of abortion legislation from 2011 to 2015. I hope this helps.

Total Number of Induced Abortions Reported in Texas by Year, 2000-2013

Year Abortions 2000 76,121 2001 77,537 2002 79,929 2003 79,166 2004 75,053 2005 77,374 2006 82,056 2007 81,079 2008 81,591 2009 77,850 2010 77,592 2011 72,470 2012 68,298 2013 63,849 Total 1,069,965

We can also share provisional data for 2014. For 2014, there have been 54,191 reported induced terminations of pregnancy that occurred in Texas. This data is considered provisional – meaning it’s not final yet, will change, and may contain duplicates and/or other data errors.

Subject: RE: Births, unintended pregnancies

Thanks.

Does the agency (or another department) have data on annual estimated rates of unintended pregnancies? Any other research recommendations?

I fielded an email today (which I’m putting in bold italic below) in reply to my inquiry to the Guttmacher Institute; the email seems to suggest there isn’t data yet to gauge if the 2011 changes in Texas law affected either the incidence of abortions or unintended pregnancies. Feel free to let me know if any of this seems inaccurate:

There are no data on unintended pregnancy rates available for TX (or any other state or nationally) for 2013, the year in question. So that claim is unsubstantiated.

The latest data we have for TX is for 2010, when the state had an unintended pregnancy rate of 56 per 1,000 women of reproductive age. See Table 1 here: http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/StateUP10.pdf

Also, we know that the TX unintended pregnancy rate declined by 7.6% between 2002 and 2010 (see Table 2, same source as above).

The TX abortion rate declined in 2013, but there is no published evidence that we’re aware of to link it to defunding Planned Parenthood. We know that the TX abortion rate fell by 17% between 2008 and 2011, well before PP was defunded in the state. See Table 2 here: http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/psrh.46e0414.pdf

I hope this helps. I can get you in touch with our state policy expert in case you want to dig deeper on any of this.

The latest data we have for unintended pregnancies is from this 2011 annual report, pages 7-11:

http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/mch/default.shtm#PRAMS2.

Overall, 42.9 percent of pregnancies were unintended in 2011, with 34.0 percent of them being mistimed and 8.9 percent being unwanted—the distinction is important. Age breakouts for each of these can be found in the Texas PRAMS 2011 Annual Report at the above link. Please note that dash lines mean that the data are suppressed. See page 4 for an explanation. 2011 is the latest Texas PRAMS data available and reliable.

Thanks for checking.
