29 MINUTES LONG BUT IT GETSCOOKING AROUND MINUTE 17.

I'M NOT GOING TO SCREW AROUNDTONIGHT AS SOMEONE REMINDED ME

IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT --OBAMA![LAUGHTER]

APPARENTLY IF I UNDERSTAND ITCORRECTLY, NO ONE'S INTERESTED

IN MY [BLEEP] TONIGHT. SO LET'SJUST GET TO IT. FOR GOD SAKES,

I'M SURE THERE'S A FUNDRAISERHE'S GOT TO BE AT

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE 44THPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THEPROGRAM PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.

[CROWD CHEERING]>> THANK YOU.

>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I AM AMAZEDAND HUMBLED EVERY TIME I COMEOUT

HERE AND GET THAT OVATION.

I'M JUST HAPPY YOU WERE HERE TOWITNESS IT.

[LAUGHTER]WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO.

HOW ARE YOU?

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW? YOU HAVESENIORITUS, RIGHT?

WHAT DO YOU HAVE LEFT, ABOUT AYEAR.

>> YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVETHAT YOU'RE LEAVING BEFORE ME.

[LAUGHTER]IN FACT, I'M ISSUING A NEW

EXECUTIVE ORDER.

THAT JON STEWART CANNOT LEAVETHE SHOW.

[LAUGHTER][APPLAUSE]

IT'S BEING CHALLENGED IN THECOURTS.

>> Jon: YES.

I HAVE TO SAY FOR ME, THIS IS ASTATES RIGHT ISSUE.

THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOUSHOULD BE ... WHAT ARE YOU

GOING, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE RUNNINGOUT OF TIME.

>> I'M NOT RUNNING. CAN I BECLEAR ABOUT THAT?

>> Jon: BUT YOU DON'T HAVETHAT MUCH TIME TO TAKE AWAY

AMERICANS GUNS AND DECLAREMARSHALL LAW AND PUT HARD

WORKING AMERICANS IN FEMA CAMPS.

IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT, YOUBETTER GET STARTED.

ARE YOU FEELING, YOU KNOWTHERE'S AN EBB AND FLOW TO EVERY

ADMINISTRATION, TO EVERYPRESIDENT.

IT APPEARS THAT YOU'RE FEELINGIT A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW.

YOU'VE GOT THIS DEAL WITH IRANWORKED OUT.

YOU'VE GOT YOUR FAST TRACKAUTHORITY.

ARE YOU FEELING LIKE SEVEN YEARSIN WHATEVER.

>> I FINALLY KNOW WHAT I'MDOING.

[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I'M FIGURING THIS

THING OUT, IS THAT HOW YOU'RE...

>> THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT YOU GETBETTER AS YOU GO ALONG.

IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER JOB.

YOU GET MORE EXPERIENCE.

BUT WHAT I DO THINK HAS HAPPENEDIS THAT A LOT OF THE WORK WE DID

EARLY STARTS BEARING FRUITLATER.

AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED OVER THELAST COUPLE MONTHS THAT PEOPLE

ARE SEEING SOME OF THE WORK THATWE STARTED WAY BACK WHEN I FIRST

CAME IN.

SO IRAN FOR EXAMPLE, WE PUTTHOSE SANCTIONS IN AND

METHODICALLY BUILT PRESSURE OVERIRAN OVER THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE

YEARS TO GET THEM TO THE TABLETO NEGOTIATE.

AND BECAUSE OF THE GREAT WORK OFOUR TEAM, JOHN KERRY AND

SECRETARY ERNIE MONIZ WHOHAPPENED TO BE AN MIT PHYSICIST,

DID SOMETHING MORE THAN I DID.

>> Jon: HE EXPLAINED A LOT OFTHE INTRICACIES.

>> SO IT FINALLY COMES TOFRUITION.

BUT IT REPRESENTS A LOT OF WORK.

THE SAME IS TRUE WHEN IT COMESTO SOMETHING LIKE HEALTHCARE.

OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALLKINDS OF UPS AND DOWNS AND

KNOCKS, FIGHTS.

WHEN THE SUPREME COURT FINALLYSAYS I THINK DEFINITIVELY WE CAN

MOVE FORWARD ON THIS WITH A LOTOF EUPHORIA BUT WE'D ALREADY GOT

16 MILLION PEOPLE HEALTHINSURANCE THAT DIDN'T HAVE IT

BEFORE. THAT REALLY WAS ACONSEQUENCE OF THE WORK THAT WE

DID.[APPLAUSE]

SO THE WAY I'M FEELING RIGHT NOWIS I'VE GOT 18 MONTHS.

THERE ARE A BUNCH OF OTHERTHINGS THAT WE WANT TO GET DONE.

SOME OF THEM WE GOT STARTEDEARLY.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GOOD EXAMPLEWHERE WE DOUBLE FUEL EFFICIENCY

STANDARDS ON CARS, INCREASEDSOLAR POWER BY 20 TIMES.

AND NOW WE'VE GOT A PARISCONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE

COMING UP LATER THIS YEAR.

AND IF WE CAN GET CHINA ANDINDIA AND SOME OF THE OTHER BIG

COUNTRIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHATWE'VE ALREADY DONE.

AND FINALLY GET SOMETHING GLOBALAND START ADDRESSING WHAT IS

GOING TO BE -- BASICALLY.

>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU AQUESTION ABOUT IRAN.

WHOSE TEAM ARE WE ON? IN THEMIDDLE EAST. BECAUSE I

KNOW WE'RE FIGHTING WITH IRAQISTO DEFEAT ISIS ALONG WITH IRAN

BUT IN YEMEN WE'RE FIGHTINGIRAN

WITH IRAQIS AND SAUDIS.

>> THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT, BUTTHAT'S OK

>> WHO ARE WE BOMBING?>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING AFTER

ISIL AND WE'VE GOT A 60 COUNTRYCOALITION AND THAT'S OUR TOP

PRIORITY.

BUT WITH RESPECT TO IRAN.

THEY'RE AN ADVERSARY.ANTI-AMERICAN, ANTI-ISRAEL,

ANTI-SEMETIC, THEY SPONSORTERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS

LIKE HEZBOLLAH.>> SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PARNTER

FOR PEACE>> AS HAS BEEN SAID FREQUENTLY,

YOU DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH YOURFRIENDS.

SO THE ISSUE HERE IS DO WE WANTTHEM HAVING A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND

THE ANSWER IS NO.

THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE BESTWAY TO DO THAT.

AND THE DEAL WE PUT TOGETHER ICAN SAY THAT IRAN WILL NOT BE

ABLE TO GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

WE CUT OFF THE FOUR MAJORPATHWAYS FOR GETTING A NUCLEAR

WEAPON.

WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL UNANIMITYAROUND AN INSPECTION REGIME AND

A VERIFICATION REGIME THAT ISUNPRECEDENTED.

WE'VE GOT MECHANISMS IN PLACE TOMAKE SURE IF THEY'RE CHEATING,

NOT ONLY DO WE ARE MUCH MORELIKELY TO CATCH THEM BUT WE CAN

ALSO IMMEDIATELY PUT BACK THESANCTIONS THAT WE'VE GOT.

AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE CRITICSTALK ABOUT WELL IT'S A BAD YEAR,

WE COULD HAVE GOT A BETTER DEAL,YOU THEN ASK THEM WELL WHAT

REPRESENTS A BETTER DEAL.

WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THINK COULDHAPPEN.

TYPICALLY THEY ARE VAGUE ANDTHEY FALL BACK ON WELL IF YOU

BEAT YOUR CHEST A LITTLE BITMORE.

OR IF YOU BROUGHT DICK CHENEY TOTHE NEGOTIATIONS.

>> Jon: LET'S NOT GET CRAZY.

>> EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE.

>> Jon: BUT IT SEEMS TO MEOUR STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN WE'VE

TRIED INVADING A COUNTRY,THROWING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

MONEY IN TRAINING AT THEIR ARMY,BEING 100,000 TROOPS BEING

THE SAFETY NET OF THAT COUNTRYHOLDING IT TOGETHER.

WE'VE TRIED BOMBING A COUNTRY,LIBYA AND DEPOSING --

>> A VISCIOUS DICTATOR.

>> Jon: HONING THAT THAT -->> HOPING THAT WORKS OUT.

>> Jon: WE TRIED ARMINGMILITANT GROUPS IN THE HOPES

THAT IT GETS IN THE RIGHT HAND.

BUT THIS NEW THING, YOU CALLEDIT EARLIER DIPLOMACY.

[LAUGHTER]THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING.

[APPLAUSE]WE STILL GET TO --

[APPLAUSE]>> THE KEY ISSUE HERE IS THAT IF

WE ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATEPEACEFULLY AROUND NOT HAVING A

NUCLEAR WEAPON.

>> SURE.

>> THEY ARE STILL GOING TO CAUSEUS PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS AREAS.

WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVEENORMOUS DIFFERENCES WITH THEM

AND WE STILL HAVE TO WORK WITHCORE ALLIES LIKE ISRAEL AND THE

GULF COUNTRIES TO MAKE SURE IRANIS NOT SPONSORING TERRORISM OR

DESTABILIZING OTHER COUNTRIES.

BUT WE WILL HAVE TAKEN OFF THETABLE WHAT WILL BE A

CATASTROPHIC STRATEGIC PROBLEMIF THEY GOT A WEAPON.

PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUTIRAN HAVE LEGITIMATE REASONS TO

BE SUSPICIOUS.

I HAVE TO REMIND THEM, THOUGH,THAT WHEN WE NEGOTIATED TO MAKE

SURE THAT THERE WERE SOME LIMITSON NUCLEAR TESTING WITH THE

SOVIET UNION, THE EVIL EMPIREWITH MISSILES TRAINED ON US

WHERE PEOPLE WERE CRAWLING,SCHOOL KIDS WERE CRAWLING UNDER

TABLES.

>> Jon: YOU'RE FREAKING MEOUT.

>> FOLKS TEND TO FORGET THAT.

THAT POSES A MUCH GREATERTHREAT.

AND WE ACTUALLY HAD TO GIVESOMETHING UP AND YET HISTORY

SHOWS IT WAS A WAY FOR US TO ATLEAST MAKE SURE THAT THERE

WASN'T CATASTROPHES EVEN IF THESYSTEM THEY'VE BUILT EVENTUALLY

FAILS.

IN THIS SITUATION WE'RE NOTGIVING SOMETHING UP.

A PRESIDENT'S OPTIONS 10 YEARSFROM NOW, 15 YEARS FROM NOW

WE'LL BE BETTER BECAUSE WE HAVEINSIGHT IN THE PROGRAM.

THEY WILL HAVE SENT OUT A WHOLEBUNCH OF ENRICHED MATERIAL THAT

THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW.

THE BREAK UP TIMES WILL BELONGER THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW.

SO THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHEREWE'RE UNILATERALLY DISARMING OR

BEING TAKEN TO THE CLEANERS.

WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MAKING SURETHIS CRITICAL PROBLEM IS BEING

RESOLVED AND RECOGNIZE IS WESTILL HAVE MORE WORK TO DO.

IN TERMS OF THE MIDDLE EASTGENERALLY ...

>> YOU'RE GOING TO GET INTO THEMIDDLE EAST, I SHOULD TAKE A

COMMERCIAL BREAK.

>> ARE YOU SURE.

>> Jon: WE'LL TAKE A BREAKAND COME BACK.

WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE IRANPACT WAS EXCELLENT AND ONCE THE

SENATE SHOOTS IT DOWN, WE'LLTALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

[LAUGHTER]WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE
