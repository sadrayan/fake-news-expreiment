City of Greensboro, NC : Fair Housing
The Fair Housing Division of the Human Relations Department investigates complaints of discrimination in housing.

The City has a Fair Housing Ordinance that protects people from discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, handicap (physical and mental disability), and family status (families with children under 18 including single parents, adopted children, and pregnant women).



It is illegal for anyone to discriminate in any public or private residential real estate transaction, including buying, selling, renting, financing, and advertising.

If it is determined after a hearing that housing discrimination has occurred or is about to occur, civil penalties can be issued, in addition to actual damages for the complainant, punitive damages, injunctive or other equitable relief, and attorneyâ€™s fees.
