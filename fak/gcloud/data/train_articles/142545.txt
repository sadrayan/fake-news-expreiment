Hungarian PM nominates Janos Ader as president Updated: 2012-04-17 03:41:00 (Xinhua)

BUDAPEST, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Monday nominated Janos Ader to succeed Pal Schmitt who resigned over a plagiarism scandal as the country's president, said Orban's spokesman.

Orban made the appointment during a meeting with parliamentarians of the ruling Fidesz Party, of which Ader is a founding member, the prime minister's spokesman Peter Szijjarto told a press conference.

Fidesz parliamentary group leader Janos Lazar said Ader had agreed to accept the position, and the Fidesz group unanimously approved the nomination.

Given that Hungary's parliament elects the president and Fidesz holds a two-thirds majority, Ader, 52, is to be voted as the president for a five-year term on April 23, although opposition parties may boycott the election.

Ader would succeed Schmitt, who was forced to resign in a plagiarism scandal that saw his university doctorate revoked for essentially copying the work of other researchers.

Ader was Speaker of Parliament during the last Fidesz government between 1998 and 2002. A lawyer by profession, he is a respected career politician thought to be able to restore the prestige of the presidency sullied by Schmitt and the plagiarism scandal.

Ader is married and has four children, three daughters and one son. His wife, Anita Herczegh, is a judge by profession.

Though essentially ceremonial, the post of president in Hungary assumes some significant duties, including the right to dissolve parliament. Moreover, the president may refuse to sign laws and return them to parliament for reconsideration or to the constitutional court if he deems necessary.
