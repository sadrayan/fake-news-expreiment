Mexico Is Miffed At Trump and Is Now Withdrawing Promised Aid To Texas

Trump lacks common decency and has nobody (at least that he listens to) to inform him how to at least act like he has. Thus his inconsiderate behavior toward Mexico.

But wrt the trade issue (Mexico and Argentina trading on agriculture, freezing out American farmers), well sorry, but both the nativist right and protectionist left maintain that our existing trade agreement with Mexico is horrible, and that the one we would have had with TPP (which is an improvement over NAFTA, and would have served as its “renegotiation”) was horrible. So I don’t see either the right or left to have standing to criticize Trump actions that impact our Mexican trade such as that cited in the diary. Trump’s actions on trade are what the xenophobic right and protectionist/isolationist left demanded.

Or did people really think Trump was some grand negotiator, who’d be able to strike all these individual bilateral trade deals with “better” terms than TPP (nevermind that by their very nature, bilateral trade deals receive almost no press or public scrutiny compared to multilateral ones like TPP or NAFTA)? lol

As the US turns inward on trade, as called for by both progressives and xenophobes, the rest of the world will just continue to trade with each other, with the US sitting on the sidelines, secure in its arrogant delusion that it can and should dictate global trade terms that overwhelmingly favor the US and disfavor everyone else in a zero-sum game — a fantasy pushed by both the progressives and the xenophobes. And the US will end u shooting itself in the foot.

As I said before, whenever one finds her/himself siding with Trump over Obama on any issue, including trade, one must take pause.
