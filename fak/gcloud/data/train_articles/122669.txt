Hillary resting after surgery on broken elbow
WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Clinton is back home resting in her Washington mansion after two hours of surgery on her broken right elbow.

A statement released by the State Department says Clinton went under the knife yesterday morning at George Washington University Hospital.

She slipped in the State Department garage Wednesday and fractured her elbow on her way to a meeting at the White House.

She was expected to make a full recovery "without lasting damage to her arm," said Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills.

State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and noted Clinton's arm is in a cast - and will be "for a while."

Clinton, was expected to rest this weekend at home, where her husband and daughter joined her Wednesday night.

"She, President Clinton and Chelsea are grateful for the many prayers and messages of goodwill they have received these past few days," Mills said.

It was unclear if Clinton would be forced to cancel upcoming travel plans. "Decisions about her schedule and travel will be made and announced in the days to come," said Mills. Michael McAuliff
