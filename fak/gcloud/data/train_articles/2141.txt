Portland's revenue from parking tickets has grown by 50 percent since 2005
Revenue from Portland parking citations has grown steadily since 2005, when Portland collected $3.3 million from tickets compared with $5.1 million last year.

And that, of course, is before the Portland Bureau of Transportation announced yesterday that it would raise the cost of a basic ticket from $34 to $39.

That jump -- plus the creation of a new $140 fine for expired tags older than three months -- will add about $475,000 to the bureau's share of parking ticket revenue, estimates from the transportation bureau show. (Under a long-standing agreement, Multnomah County Circuit Court collects 60 percent of all ticket revenue, then passes it to the state.)

In any case, both governments might have collected more. In early December when transportation officials took a fee-increase proposal to the court system, they asked for increases on some tickets of $5, $10 or $15. Presiding Judge Jean Kerr Maurer of the Multnomah County Circuit Court authorized a $5 increase, however. "She thought $5 was sufficient," said Douglas Bray, circuit court administrator.

Basic parking tickets cost $24 in 2009, jumping to $34 in 2010.

Clarification: This article reflects a clarification published Dec. 23. An earlier version of this post said the court system collects 60 percent of the revenue. It then passes 60 percent of the revenue to the state.
