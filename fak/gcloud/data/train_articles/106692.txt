Barney! Barney! He`s Kid Dinomite

Not since Cabbage Patch dolls has there been such frenzied adulation over a creation of cloth and glue. Not since the kiddie entertainer Raffi has there been such wide dissemination of so many cloying children`s songs.

With the magnetism of Elvis and the personality of Mr. Rogers, a new mega-star of children`s entertainment has burst onto the scene. He is a giggling, galumphing, purple and green dinosaur called Barney, and if you don`t know him, you don`t spend any time in the vicinity of preschoolers.

Not since Bill Clinton went shopping during his southern California vacation has there been a scene like Barney`s mall tour, which has drawn as many as 15,000 to 40,000 fans and chaperones per appearance.

At first glance, the Barney craze seems puzzling. The children`s entertainment world is full of anthropomorphic animals, flowers, tea cups and other objects that attempt to amuse and educate through skits and songs. Some are clever, some are inane.

Barney, who appears daily on his own PBS television show, ``Barney & Friends,`` as well as in 10 home videos, seems pleasant enough, though his nerdy laugh, rudimentary singing ability and benign personality rate him rather shallow among many adults. And the show, while professional, is strictly low budget.

In short, there are few signs pointing to Barney`s immense popularity.

``You explain it to me,`` said Debbie Andrade, a North Side mother whose 1-year-old son, Vincent, is a fan club member and whose mother in New Jersey kissed the sales clerk who sold her a hard-to-find Barney doll after a two-week search.

But when Barney arrives at the mall, as he did last Saturday in Lombard`s Yorktown Shopping Center, Santa Claus was quickly squeezed out of business.

There, 35,000 people-big and little-crowded the aisles to catch a brief glimpse of an actor wearing the 6-foot-tall Barney costume. Parents and children waited for more than an hour, huddling on the floor in a scene reminiscent of a rock concert, except for all the diapers, bottles and napping babies.

When Barney finally appeared, surrounded by a phalanx of secret service agent look-alikes from the local police force, he spent two hours making several fast sweeps through the mall, reaching over police lines to offer hugs and kisses. He never spoke and whizzed past most children in about 15 seconds. Yet it was hard to find just one parent who resented having been trapped in a crowded shopping center at the height of the Christmas shopping season, surrounded not just by their own but thousands of other screaming, impatient children.

``The kids were just thrilled,`` said a smiling Patty Cochrane of Glen Ellyn, whose 3-year-old son, Andrew, got a hug from Barney.

Parents also have braved treks to numerous stores to find one that has a Barney doll in stock this Christmas season. While some toy and department stores have them on shelves, many others do not and may not see them again until after Christmas.

``They all just kept saying, `We`re out, we`re out; two weeks, two weeks,` `` said Andrew LeFevour of the North Side, who went to six stores to find Barneys for his children, Bridget, 3, and Andrew, 1.
