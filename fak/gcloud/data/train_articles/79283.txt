Rachel Greszler researches and analyzes taxes, Social Security, disability insurance, and pensions as senior policy analyst in economics and entitlements in The Heritage Foundation’s Center for Data Analysis. The goal is to achieve policies that promote economic growth, individual freedom, and well-being.

Greszler’s writing and research includes analysis of reforms to Social Security and its disability insurance program, with the goals of returning them to their original focus of poverty-prevention and reducing the government’s control over personal retirement savings.

She also focuses on federal tax policies, including cost estimates and dynamic simulations that take into account how individuals and businesses respond to changes in taxes and other policies.

Greszler has written on the need for pension reform in both the public and private sectors (including the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) to protect beneficiaries from massive cuts in promised benefits and to protect taxpayers from a huge bailout at their expense. Greszler also provides commentary on issues related to women in the workplace.

Before joining Heritage in 2013, Greszler was a senior economist on the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress for more than six years. She completed her graduate studies at Georgetown University, where she earned master’s degrees in both economics and public policy. She also holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Mary Washington. She is a former Heritage intern.

Greszler, who grew up in a small town in Western New York, currently resides in Bethesda, Md. with her husband and five children.
