Social Security, disabled veterans, military retirees get 2.8 percent COLA, largest in 7 years
Social Security recipients, as well as disabled veterans and military retirees, will see a 2.8 percent Cost of Living Adjustment in benefit payments next year, the Social Security Administration announced.

The increase, based on the Consumer Price Index for the third quarter of 2017 through the third quarter of 2018, is the largest increase in seven years. The higher monthly payments will begin on Dec. 31, 2018, first payable in January 2019.

The change means the average retiree will receive $1.461 a month, or $17,532 a year, up from the current amount of $1,422, or $17,064 a year. The average payment for a disabled worker - $1,200 a month, or $14,400 a year, will increase to $1,234 a year, or $14,808 a year.

Last year's COLA was 2 percent; the previous three years' was 2 percent combined. The increase failed to top 2 percent in 2013 (1.5 percent) and 2012 (1.7 percent) after a 3.6 percent increase in 2011.
