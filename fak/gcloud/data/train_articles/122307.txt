NHIF: National Hospital Insurance Fund
Accredited Hospitals

This comprehensive in-patient health cover has been introduced for NHIF contributors and their dependants. The actualization of this package is a culmination of continued reforms at NHIF. Such reforms include efficiency, arising from decentralization of NHIF services and continued partnership with health providers on enhanced quality services to all members. To enhance these benefits, NHIF has contracted hospitals under three Categories; A, B & C, to provide this in-patient medical cover and partial cover for surgical cases in some of these hospitals. Our members are at liberty to attend hospitals under any category. Under Category A (government hospitals), members would be able to enjoy full and comprehensive cover for maternity and medical diseases including surgery. In short, they will not need to pay for anything on admission provided they are fully paid up members of NHIF. Members admitted under contract Category B (private and mission) hospitals will enjoy full and comprehensive cover but where surgery is required, the contributor may be required to co-pay. Those visiting facilities contracted under Category C (private) will continue with the current system where NHIF pays specified daily benefits under the current arrangements. NHIF will continue to negotiate with other health providers not appearing in the list below to determine which category of contract they will sign. Members will be informed of additional hospitals as and when they sign the contracts. Below is a list of Hospitals, Number of Beds and Contracts covered by NHIF.
