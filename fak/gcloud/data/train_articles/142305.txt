Westlink Dismisses Hoax Email

24/3/2006



Westlink M7 has dismissed a hoax email currently circulating that claims that the motorway has implemented a secret speed fine based on the time a vehicle enters and exits the motorway.



Flan Cleary, General Manager of Westlink M7, said that the email was a hoax and that no secret speed enforcement system operates on the Westlink M7.



Westlink supports safe driving and urges all motorists to comply with posted speed limits.



However, the secret speed fine system detailed in the hoax email does not exist, Mr Cleary said.



Speed limits are enforced on the Westlink M7 through the normal policing measures that operate on all NSW roads.



Westlink meets regularly with the NSW Highway Patrol.



Mr Cleary said that Westlink will be installing signs that remind motorists that speed cameras are used in NSW.



These are the standard speed camera signs seen on roads across the state and do not mean that any new or secret speed system operates on the Westlink M7.
