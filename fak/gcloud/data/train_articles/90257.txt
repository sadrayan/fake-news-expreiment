Sen. Ellis reacts to lawsuit against Harris County’s broken criminal justice system
“Harris County’s overreliance on the inefficient and ineffective use of mass incarceration as a means of dealing with low-level and non-violent offenses continues to result in some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world. It’s an approach that wastes countless taxpayer dollars, has been ineffective at making our communities safer, and has a particularly devastating effect on communities of color and the poor.

The County’s continued failure to follow the law and principles of basic fairness when it comes to pre-trial bond and bail practices has translated into more than 70% of the jail population consisting of people who haven’t even been convicted of a crime. A vast majority of those people are stuck in jail solely because they are poor, not because they are threat to public safety. We’ve created two separate systems of justice: one for the rich and one for the poor. A system that keeps the Sandra Blands of the world, arrested for minor offenses, locked in cages with their lives at risk, and lets the Robert Dursts, arrested for murder, walk free. It’s a violation of our basic constitutional legal principles and our moral principles of justice.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Someone’s danger to the community should determine bail, not their wealth. The county can start fixing the this broken bail system and advancing a fair, effective, and efficient justice system today by simply following pre-trial services recommendations, requiring risk assessments, and utilizing proven alternatives to incarceration for low-risk arrestees like personal bonds, electronic monitoring, or simple check-ins. The county must also use more PR bonds, cease using a bail schedule, comply with Texas law, and assign counsel at magistration.
