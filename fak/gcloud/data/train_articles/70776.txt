Armatix GmbH: Smart System
COMPLETE SYSTEM

Smart System consists of a radio-controlled watch that is responsible for gun access and use. A Smart System gun will only shoot if it is within range of this watch. It is possible to release the safety mechanism via the radiocontrolled watch activated by means of a PIN code. As soon as the gun loses radio contact with the watch  e.g. if it is knocked out of the shooters hand or in case of loss, theft, etc.  it automatically deactivates itself.

GLOBAL INOVATION

Armatix is currently involved in advanced licensing negotiations with several gun manufacturers. In addition, Armatix offers a tried and tested smart system in the form of a development of its own: the iP1 pistol (.22 LR caliber) and the iW1 active RFID watch. The prototype from Armatix is proof that guns with integrated electronic intelligence are already possible and feasible today. How the technology can be incorporated into existing handguns needs to be checked in individual cases.
