"The Old Guard"



While visiting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier I watched along with many others as the tomb guard was changed. It was an impressive ceremony very fluid, intricate

and precise. When I got home and reviewed my photos and was very impressed with the Sergeant of the Guard who made all of his moments look effortless. I began

wondering how much precision there was in his moments. The 1st photo is of the sergeant saluting the grave of the unknowns, the middle photo is after doing an

about face while at attention the 3rd photo is photo 1 and 2 combined. The sergeant's pivots perfectly with no sign of movement except for his direction.

The sergeant made doing this photo very easy.

The "Old Guard," one of the oldest and most respected Infantry Regiments in the United States Army, has the awesome responsibility of both guarding the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, but also for escorting deceased Army servicemembers to their final rest in the "Gardens of Stone," as Arlington is sometimes called.

The "Old Guard" also serves as the Army's ceremonial unit

and, as an active and well-trained Infantry Regiment,

is responsible for the protection of Washington, D.C.
