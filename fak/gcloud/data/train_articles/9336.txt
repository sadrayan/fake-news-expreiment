Rick Scott won't say if he thinks man-made climate-change is real, significant

Florida Gov. Rick Scott won't say whether he thinks man-made climate change is real and significant.

"Iâ€™m not a scientist," Scott said when asked about anthropogenic global warming during a Tuesday stop in Miami. Scott then talked about money for flood control and Everglades restoration.

Scott's refusal to weigh in on the issue contrasts with his position in 2011, when he said "I've not been convinced that there's any man-made climate change... Nothing's convinced me that there is."

So is Scott repositioning himself now, believing more in man-made climate change? Scott wouldn't say.

"I'm not a scientist," Scott repeated, noting again his environmental record.

Scott's new position resembles that of another top Florida Republican office holder, Sen. Marco Rubio, who has also expressed skepticism. Rubio, too, says he's not a scientist and he won't answer the question about whether he believes humans are causing the planet to warm.

Unlike Scott, though, Rubio hasn't issued a blanket denial of man-made climate change and he gives a major reason for his skepticism: There has been a 15-year pause in surface-temperature readings despite an increase in carbon dioxide emissions world wide.
