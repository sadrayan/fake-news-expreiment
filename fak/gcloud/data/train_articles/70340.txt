Open Letter: Promoting Access to Affordable Medicines in South Africa through Patent Law Reform

Open letter to President Jacob Zuma and Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies—This is an open letter from individuals and organisations concerned with the ability of people everywhere to have access to medicines which save lives and enhance quality of life. We are writing in support of the South African government’s longstanding efforts to revise their patent laws in order to better safeguard and promote the availability of generic medicines at more affordable prices. The international community is behind South Africa—as it has been in the past—to prioritise the lives and wellbeing of its people over the private interests of pharmaceutical companies.We encourage the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to immediately release the final version of its National Policy on Intellectual Property, inclusive of clear language outlining reforms that advance South Africa’s constitutional right to have access to health care services.Admirable progress has been made over the past decade in addressing South Africa’s greatest health challenge, the HIV epidemic. Scale-up of antiretroviral treatment (ART) to millions of people living with HIV in South Africa would not have been possible without access to generic medicines, which brought down the price of individual treatment from over $10,000 per year to less than $1 per day. Today, even lower prices have been realised in South Africa for standard first-line ART.Without access to more affordable generic medicines, it will be difficult to address other significant health challenges in South Africa. Controlling the cost of medicines is vital for the public sector, medical aid schemes, and individuals who self-finance purchases through the private sector. Everyone in South Africa has the right to access to medical innovations, be it rapid and accurate diagnostics, lifesaving medicines, or treatments which significantly improve an individual’s enjoyment of the right to health.South Africa’s current patent laws and policies are prone to abuse by pharmaceutical companies. Companies prolong monopolies by filing multiple patents on the same medicine over time. This has a chilling effect on prices for a wide range of medicines, including those for high-burden diseases like drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), and non-communicable diseases like cancer. Abuse of patent rights also threatens affordable access to promising new therapies for HIV, DR-TB and Hepatitis C, and can limit research into optimal treatment combinations for these conditions. This does not bode well for the financial sustainability and future success of treatment programmes in South Africa.One year ago, the DTI released a Draft National Policy on Intellectual Property (DNPIP) for public comment. The DNPIP outlined bold reforms which, once implemented, would better ensure public health was not compromised by the enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights. The DNPIP recognised the need for laws and practices that would limit abusive pharmaceutical patent monopolies; promote generic competition and allow patent barriers to be overcome when critical medicines are priced out of reach; and incentivize models of medical innovation that do not rely on companies charging high prices in order to recoup research and development costs. All of these reforms are urgently needed in South Africa, and in line with the government’s obligations under international trade agreements, and as defined in the South African constitution.Government representatives have made several guarantees and announcements over the past year that the National IP Policy would be finalised and released during 2014, before this point in time. But we are not there yet.South Africa faces significant pressure from certain parties—specifically, the multinational pharmaceutical industry—to delay patent law reform. Numerous countries at the Executive Board meeting of the World Health Organisation, as well as civil society organisations and nearly 50,000 members of the global general public echoed the South African government’s condemnation of the January 2014 “Pharmagate” scandal. In 1998, 39 multinational pharmaceutical companies took Nelson Mandela’s government to court over national IP reforms made in the interest of protecting public health. International pressure helped force pharmaceutical companies to back down from the court case in 2001, and a similar global demand for social justice continues to support South Africa today to make needed legal reforms.If the South African government is to honour its history of supporting access to medicines, the best possible action it could take would be to release a final IP policy as soon as possible, which demonstrates a concrete commitment to safeguard public health and promote the constitutional rights of the people of South Africa. We await the finalisation of such a policy.Sincerely,AIDS-Free WorldHealth Action InternationalOxfam InternationalTreatment Action CampaignSECTION27MSF Access CampaignKnowledge Ecology InternationalUniversities Allied for Essential MedicinesAIDS Foundation of South AfricaAIDS & Rights Alliance for Southern Africa (ARASA)Student Stop AIDS CampaignStop Stockouts Coalition (South Africa)Action against AIDS GermanyEcumenical Advocacy Alliance (EAA)Christian AIDS Bureau for Southern Africa (CABSA)Brot fuer die Welt, GermanyThe Global Network of Sex Work ProjectsFoTAC UKTreatment Access Watch AfricaTreatment Action Watch CameroonCoalition 15%Church of Scotland HIV ProgrammeHealth Poverty ActionImpActAIDS (Scotland)The Center for Health, Human Rights and Development (CEHURD)Catholic Agency For Overseas Development (CAFOD)Health GAP (Global Access Project)Act Up-ParisConsumer Association the Quality of Life (EKPIZO)Results UKInternational Treatment Preparedness Coalition (ITPC)-South AsiaDelhi Network of Positive People (DNP+)Initiative for Health & Equity in SocietyDiverse Women for DiversityPositive-Generation, CameroonInitiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK)HIV i-Base, London, UKCAMEROON TB GROUPUAEM UKInternational HIV/AIDS AllianceAIDS OrphanAfrica Japan ForumSouthern African HIV Clinicians SocietySTOPAIDSThe Open Medicine ProjectCBSM (Consultancy Bureau voor Strategisch Management)MSF Southern Africa AssociationMSF South AfricaKEI EuropeCatholics for AIDS Prevention and Support, UKBolivian Network of People Living with HIV (REDBOL)Salud por Derecho (Right to Health Foundation)—SpainCongress Of South African Trade Unions (COSATU)Brazilian Interdisciplinary AIDS Association (ABIA)Group of Incentive to Life (GIV)-BrazilGESTOS-BrazilAIDS Law Project—KenyaAVERTBUKO Pharma-Kampagne—Germany
