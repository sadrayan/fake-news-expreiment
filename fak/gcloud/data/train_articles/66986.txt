Scott Brown won’t rule out Senate run in NH, says 'nothing's off the table'
Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) isn't ruling out a Senate run in New Hampshire next year.

"I'm not going to comment on that. Obviously I think it's important to continue to do my job here and challenge people to do things better," Brown said when asked on Fox News Sunday if he was mulling a run against Sen.

"Nothing's off the table and nothing's on the table. Right now I'm recharging the batteries and working hard."

Rumors have swirled that Brown, who lost a hard-fought election in heavily Democratic Massachusetts last year, might run next year in the state next door, where he owns a house and many in his family hail from.

His comments on Fox News are similar to ones he made in New Hampshire this weekend at a National Guard conference, when he touted "nine generations of ties" to the state.

"To think I don't have any right to be up here is quite a stretch," he said before saying he didn't think he was done with running for office.

Shaheen appears to be in good position for reelection, and on Friday former Sen. John Sununu (R-N.H.) ruled out a bid for the seat, eliminating one potentially strong candidate from the field. If Brown runs for the seat that would shake up its picture dramatically — though, while the centrist former lawmaker could have some appeal, he'd be vulnerable to charges of carpet-bagging.
