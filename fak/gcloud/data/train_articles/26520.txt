LeBron’s ‘I Promise School’ To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year
CLEVELAND, Ohio – You wouldn’t know from all the national coverage that LeBron James isn’t paying for everything at his new I Promise School in Akron.

He’s paying for part of it. A good part of it.

But it’s also a public school within the Akron school district, which means that taxpayers will pay for the bulk of the costs.

The exact breakdown of expenses for the new I Promise School is unclear, since the district and the LeBron James Family Foundationare still sorting out final details of their contract. But the district will pay more than half the costs – perhaps around 75 percent – once it is fully running.

Trump’s Friday missive was a response to King James’ shameless CNN interview with Don Lemon to promote his new “Promise” school in Akron where he also used the opportunity to accuse the president of using sports to divide America and other racially-inflammatory babble.

Immediately after the POTUS dunked on James, the entire anti-Trump universe immediately mobilized and formed a protective phalanx around the multimillionaire Los Angeles Lakers forward.

The media screamed racism as did political bottom-feeders like Hillary Clinton who never misses a chance to launch a bitter diatribe against the man who bested her in the election.
