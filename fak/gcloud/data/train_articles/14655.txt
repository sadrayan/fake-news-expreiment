First T.V. And Digital Ad In NE-02: Kara Eastman’s Liberal Agenda Means Big Price Tag For Nebraska Families
Kara Eastman’s out-of-touch, liberal agenda means more government spending and higher taxes for Nebraska families

WASHINGTON – Congressional Leadership Fund (@CLFSuperPAC), the super PAC endorsed by House Republican leadership, today released a new ad, “Price Tag,” in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. The ad highlights Kara Eastman’s extreme, liberal agenda that would cost trillions of dollars. The ad will run on television in the Omaha media market and on digital platforms throughout the district.

“Kara Eastman’s out-of-touch, liberal agenda would cost trillions and she wants hardworking Nebraska families to foot the bill,” said Courtney Alexander, CLF Communications Director. “Eastman’s far-left agenda of more government spending and higher taxes is out of touch with Nebraska families. Nebraskans can’t afford Kara Eastman in Congress.”

This is CLF’s first television ad in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. In addition to the ad campaign, CLF previously opened a field office in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. Each CLF field office is supported by a full-time staffer and hundreds of interns and volunteers who engage with voters on a daily basis through hyper-targeted phone banking and door-to-door canvassing.

SCRIPT

VO: We know Kara Eastman is a liberal.

But what does that really mean?

Thirty-two-trillion.

That’s the cost of Eastman’s plan to give everyone free health care.

Six-hundred-billion.

That’s the price of Eastman’s free college plan.

Twenty-five-hundred-dollars.

That’s how much more your family will pay after Eastman eliminates your tax cut.

Behind Eastman’s liberal agenda is a big price tag.
