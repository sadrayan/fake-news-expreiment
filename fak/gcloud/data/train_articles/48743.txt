Heiress said Edwards used her
Alex Forger's client, Rachel Mellon, gave $6.4M to organizations tied to Edwards. Heiress said Edwards used her

The 101-year-old heiress whose donations helped John Edwards cover up his affair thought the former Democratic presidential candidate used her for her bank account and should have spent his own money instead, the woman’s friend reportedly testified on Friday.

Interior designer Bryan Huffman told the courtroom that Rachel “Bunny” Mellon was unhappy that Edwards tried hiding his relationship with Rielle Hunter using some of the $725,000 that Mellon had funneled to him during the 2008 presidential campaign, The Associated Press reported.

“She thought maybe you should probably pay for your girlfriend yourself,” Huffman testified.

Many in the courtroom laughed — and Edwards even smiled, according to the AP.

Mellon also gave $6.4 million to organizations tied to Edwards’ presidential run, and after he dropped out of the race in January 2008, aide Andrew Young requested an additional $40 to $50 million for Edwards’ poverty foundation, Huffman testified.

“[Mellon] was rather apoplectic at the size of the figure they requested. She was really upset,” Huffman said. “She said, ‘I cannot believe that the senator really wanted me for my money all along.’”

Huffman testified that Edwards later called Mellon to apologize, claiming he didn’t know how much Young had requested. But the aide insisted it was Edwards’ idea, according to Huffman, and told the interior designer, “Just call me throw-me-under-the-bus-Andrew.”
