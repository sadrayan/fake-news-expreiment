Applicants should have skin like an Alligator, and a desire to suffer their way to make at least a thousand a week. Paid training to the right three people.

We do have an opening for a bright, energetic and dedicated individual who has a Masters degree and a minimum of 6 years' proven experience. These qualities have nothing to do with the available position, but we think they're nice. This position actually requires a room temperature IQ and the ability to identify and answer a ringing telephone (preferably within 8 or 9 rings.) We offer a salary (we have to, it's the law) and your own personalized coffee mug. (Coffee dues are automatically deducted from your minimal salary.)
