petition: Stop Texas Trophy Horse Hunts
Real or hoax? If he wanted attention he got it. If he is killing horses he needs to be stopped.



The number is a working number for Mr. Welderman.



The site is very disturbing.



These horses are killed as trophy's by game hunters and dressed out for food.



The finest equine specimens imported from all over the world or from local breeders. Many are organic and grass-fed. You will have the option of killing your horse traditionally (with a stick) by cross bow or by firearm of your choice. All horse meats will be processed at our facilites, so you will never get horse blood on your hands. The hunt is also filmed..
