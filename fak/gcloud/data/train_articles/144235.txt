H.R. 2393, Country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015
H.R. 2393 would repeal existing requirements for retailers of beef, pork, and chicken to inform customers at the final point of sale of the country of origin of those products. The repeal would not affect existing requirements for country-of-origin labeling for lamb, venison, goat meat, perishable agricultural commodities, peanuts, farm-raised and wild fish, ginseng, pecans, and macadamia nuts.

USDA inspects retail stores and audits supply chains through cooperative agreements with state agencies to enforce requirements for county-of-origin labeling. Based on information from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), CBO estimates that enactment of this bill would have an insignificant effect on spending subject to appropriation over the 2016-2020 period because USDA would continue to enforce compliance with labeling requirements for other commodities. In 2015, USDA received an appropriation of $5 million for country-of-origin inspections. Enacting H.R. 2393 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.

H.R. 2393 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.
