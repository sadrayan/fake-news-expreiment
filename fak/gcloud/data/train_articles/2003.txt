‘He Was The Most Hated Man In America In 1968, Now He’s The Most Loved’ – Rev. Bernice King On Her Father’s Legacy
Rev. Bernice King talks to the Tom Joyner Morning Show about the legacy of her father Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the importance of honoring her mother while celebrating Dr. King’s life.

On the rumor that Dr. King was a Republican:

“Never! Before 1960 a good percentage of African Americans were Republicans. It really wasn’t until John Kennedy did that change. Part of that was because my father was jailed in the middle of the night. He was protesting down here in Atlanta. Some kind of way Senator Kennedy intervened with his brother Bobby and he was released. My grandfather at the time endorsed Eisenhower.”

On keeping her father’s story alive in the media:

“A lot of the movement veterans that have started doing some stories, I’ve thought about doing it more in regards to my mother. She has been the key person in terms of why we even celebrate my father as an icon. If it hadn’t been for her I don’t think we’d be celebrating him like we do.”
