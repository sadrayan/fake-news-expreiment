Bernie Has Emily Ratajkowski and Killer Mike. Hillary Has the Delegates.
Just as Bernie Sanders was chowing down in Harlem with the Reverend Al Sharpton, a sobering detail came to our attention. The whole primary fight continues to be primarily about delegates, after all, and Hillary Rodham Clinton has a monumental lead by that measure already.

In the overall race for delegates, Clinton has 394, thanks in large part to endorsements from superdelegatesâ€”party officials who can support the candidate of their choice. Sanders has 42 delegates. It takes 2,382 delegates to win the Democratic nomination for president.

The superdelegates are a quadrennial pain, an institutional establishment firewall erected (some say) to keep democracy from breaking out entirely in the Democratic nominating process. The system is the product of the Hunt Commission in 1982, which was called to correct what was judged to be the "flaws" in the nominating process that had produced George McGovern and Jimmy Carter. Ever since, the number of superdelegates has increased. They always have been something of a land mine in the system, but, so far, the superdelegates have not yet determined a nominee, although they came close in 1984, when the difference in popular votes between Walter Mondale and Gary Hart was insignificant, but Mondale's edge in superdelegates helped him gain the honor of being squashed by Ronald Reagan. Sooner or later, though, they will frustrate a demonstration of the popular will and, when they do, the convention will not be pretty at all.
