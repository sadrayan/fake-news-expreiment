I've attached the chapter in question. I believe the Congressman relied on this statement (p. 196): "In spite of their small numbers--perhaps 1% of the general population--..."

But, I was talking about psychopaths, not sociopaths (in Google put in Hare psychopath sociopath). The 1% value came from me many years ago, and now is cited as truth. But this was an informed guess based on several things. Many investigators use a score of 30 (out of 40) on the PCL-R and a convenient research threshold for psychopathy. However, as the attached articles attest, the PCL-R measures a dimensional construct, so that cut scores are somewhat arbitrary. In prison settings the prevalence of male offenders with a score of 30 or higher is about 15-20%, whereas about 60-70% of these offenders receive a DSM-5 diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), a ratio of 3 or 4 to 1 in favor of ASPD.

In community studies about 3-4% of males meet the diagnostic criteria for ASPD. I reasoned that if the s ration in the community was similar to that in prisons, the estimate of those in the community who would have a score of 30 or higher would be about 1%. I've written about this several times, but need to track down the articles. However, several articles attached indicate that the estimate of 1% is not far off. But, as measured, psychopathy is dimensional and not a diagnostic category. So, about all we can say is that around 1% of the male population would receive a score of 30 on the PCL-R (or 18 on the PCL: SV). This reflects a large number of psychopathic features, and the use of the term psychopath merely makes this point.
