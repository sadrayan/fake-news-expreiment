A pizza vending machine takes convenience food to a whole new level, delivering fresh pies to customers in just three minutes 24/7.

The Let's Pizza unit invented by Claudio Torghele, an entrepreneur from Rovereto, Italy, mixes flour and water together and presses the dough flat to create a 10.5 inch base.

Desired toppings are then added and the meal is flash-cooked in a high temperature infrared oven at 380 degrees Celsius.
