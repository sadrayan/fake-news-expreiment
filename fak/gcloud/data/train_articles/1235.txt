Aetna Chosen As Subcontractor In Qatar's Universal Health Care Coverage

The Hartford health insurer was chosen to help the National Health Insurance Company of Qatar in developing a disease management program and to help generally in improving the country's health insurance program.

"We are honored to be chosen to play a significant role in the creation of a modern, efficient and integrated health insurance system," head of Aetna International, Sandip Patel, said in a prepared statement.

The national health care system will be built on a foundation of preventive and primary care, Patel said. Aetna will apply its clinical health management and technological capabilities to Qatar's national health care system.

The Qatari government on Monday announced the new National Health Insurance Company to manage the nation's health care system. An insurer in the country, Al Khaleej Takaful, will act as a third party administrator to manage administration of the insurance plan and Aetna is one of two subcontractors. The other subcontractor, GlobeMed, will manage enrollment, claims administration and call center functions.

Qatar's universal health care coverage program will be fully operational for all citizens, expatriates and visitors in 2015. Launched in stages, it will first provide coverage to girls and women 12 and older for maternity, obstetrics, gynecology and other related health care concerns. Coverage for Qatari citizens for all medical treatment starts in early 2014.

Aetna declined to say the value of the contract. Work related to the contract will be done in the Middle East, primarily by Aetna workers in Doha and Dubai.
