RACE AND NOW TO STEWART MOORE READY TO TALK TO THE CONGRESSMAN LIVE. WE ARE SET FOR THAT BIG ANNOUNCEMENT AND ALAN GRAYSON IS JOINING US LIVE FROM WASHINGTON. ARE YOU RUNNING FOR SENATE? I'M IN. YOU ARE RUNNING FOR SENATE. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN. OBVIOUSLY YOU WILL FACE OFF AGAINST A DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT IN THERY MARRY, PATRICK MURPHY. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU TWO? WELL, FIRST I'M UP BY 40 POINTS IN THE LATEST POLL BUT THE DIFFICULTENCE IS OUR DIFFERENCE ON SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AND MEDICARE, SENIORS DEF A RAISE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE UP TO SENIORS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE NEED TO HE ALMOST NATO THE DOUBLE TAX ADMINISTRATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY. YOU PAY TAXES WHEN YOU PAY IN AND AGAIN WHEN THEY PAY OUT. THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND IT'S IN THE FAIR. FOR MEDICARE I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT MEETS IS PROMISE OF MEETING ALL SENIOR HEALTH AIR NEEDS AND THAT INCLUDES EYES AND EARS AND TEETH. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED TO HEAR IT DENY COVER EYES AND EARS AND TEETH. WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT. I WILL ASK YOU ABOUT THAT, YOU ARE OUTSPOKEN, THE SENATE IS CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS, HOW WILL YOU REACH ACROSS PARTY LINES TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN FOR FLORIDA VOTERS? THE SAME WAY I HAVE. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I PASSED MORE AMENDMENTS IN THE TEA PARTY CONTROLLED HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAN ANY OTHER MEMBERS INCLUDING REPUBLICANS AND PASSED MORE BILLS THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER OF CONGRESS. OVER A DISGRAYSON BILLS ARE THE LAW OF THE LAND. WHEN YOU COME UP WITH A GOOD IDEA TO HELP PEOPLE THE REPUBLICANS CAN'T SAY NO. HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO RUN YOUR HOUSE OFFICE WHILE YOU ARE RUNNING FOR SENATE? OH, LIST THAN I DIDN'T THINK THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM AT ALL. PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DELIVER. AND WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THE SAME KIND OF DELIVERY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN FOR THAT OFFICE HELPING HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WILL KEEP PASSING MAJOR LEGISLATION, THE SAME WAY THAT I HAVE SINCE I RETURNED TO OFFICE. WE GET THINGS DONE AND THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ABOUT US, THE FACT THAT WE GET GOOD THINGS DONE. WE ARE WORKING HARD AND GET THINGS DONE. ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD BE ACTION FIGURES. I HAVE TO LET YOU GO, BUT REALLY QUICKLY, MURPHY PICKED UP MAJOR ENDORSEMENTS FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT LEADERS IN THE PARTY AND DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE. DOES THAT BOTHER TO YOU THAT HE HAS SUPPORT? HE HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR FOUR MONTHANCE 40 POINTS BEHIND. HE'S A REPUBLICAN, REALLY A REPUBLICAN, PRETENDING BE A DEMOCRAT. HE GAVE 23 HUNDRED TO MITT RIM'S CAMPAIGN. THAT'S EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PATRICK MURPHY. HE IS IN, RUNNING FOR SENATE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. AND PATRICK MURPHY REPRESENTS
