Estimates of Foodborne Illness in the United States
CDCâ€™s estimates of the burden of foodborne illness in the United States provide the most accurate picture of known pathogens and unspecified agents causing foodborne illness in the United States.

These estimates serve as a foundation for food safety by allowing us to answer important questions, such as:

How many foodborne illnesses occur every year?

These estimates are known as the burden of foodborne illness.



These estimates are known as the burden of foodborne illness. Which foods are responsible for the illnesses?

These estimates are known as the attribution of foodborne illness.

By estimating the burden of foodborne illness and attributing illnesses to specific food sources, CDC, regulatory agencies, industry, consumer groups, and others can better target prevention measures and improve food safety in the United States.
