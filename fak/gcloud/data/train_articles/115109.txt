Waiver instructions are available at http://onlineservices.bhcc.mass.edu or at the Student Payment Office. International Students may NOT waive health insurance coverage. International Students must purchase the College’s health insurance plan unless they can prove that they have obtained local coverage that meets state requirements. The waiver form is available by clicking here.

Outstanding Financial Obligations

Students who have any outstanding financial obligations to the College will not be permitted to register. Delinquent accounts must be paid in full. Unpaid balances will be referred to state intercept and to a collections agency. This means that your state income taxes will be intercepted and you will not receive your state refund. Furthermore, additional fees will be assessed and can be as much as 33% of the balance due.

Schedule Adjustments

Students that adjust their schedule (including adding a waitlisted course) must make full payment or make payment arrangements at the time of the adjustment. Failure to do so will result in the dropping of the course(s) you are adding. For example, if you registered and paid for 2 courses and receive a call that a seat is available in a course that you waitlisted, your registration now includes 3 courses. If you do not pay for that waitlisted course immediately following registration and pay for or waive the health insurance fee, you will be dropped from the course you added.

Refunds

Students may drop (cancel) a credit course and receive a 100% refund within the schedule adjustment period listed in the course booklet. There are no refunds after the schedule adjustment periods. Lack of attendance in a course does not constitute a drop. Students who register for a course and subsequently decide not to attend classes are responsible for officially dropping the course prior to the end of the schedule adjustment period by completing a schedule adjustment form at the Admissions & Registration Desk, B203 (courses may be dropped online through WebAdvisor until the last official day of registration for the semester/session, dropping courses on or after the first day of classes must be done in person).
