Trump Lawsuit Tracker: 76

Seventy-six Center Suits Filed Against Trump Since His Administration's Inception



The Center for Biological Diversity is resisting Trump in every way possible — especially in the courts.

From the moment he took office, our lawyers have been working feverishly to oppose every attempt he's made to worsen climate change, kill wildlife, endanger public health and destroy public lands.



So far the Center has filed 76 suits against Trump. Read on for details on every single one.

The Center for Biological Diversity and allies sued U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt for failing to ensure that Detroit, Indianapolis and other localities that are home to millions of people have effective plans for cleaning up asthma-causing sulfur dioxide air pollution.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, points out that the EPA has already determined that these 17 areas in 10 states have sulfur dioxide pollution at levels high enough to cause human health problems and to harm fish and forests. The polluted areas are in Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

The Center for Biological Diversity and ally conservation groups filed a lawsuit challenging Trump administration policies that gut protections for imperiled greater sage grouse and allow oil and gas leases on nearly 2 million acresof the birds' prime habitat. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Boise, says the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management violated the National Environmental Policy Act and Federal Lands Policy and Management Act when it approved eight massive oil and gas lease sales in Nevada, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.

Those leases were enabled by two Trump polices, one directive rolling back hard-won compromises to preserve dwindling sage-grouse populations across the West and another that cuts the public out of oil and gas planning on public lands.

Vaquita reside in only one place on the planet: the Gulf of California, a narrow body of water between Baja and the Mexican mainland. Fishing with gillnets is driving the vaquita to extinction because the small porpoise is easily entangled and drowned in these dangerous nets.

The multi-year plan to kill black bears and mountain lions in the Piceance Basin and Upper Arkansas River areas of Colorado is intended to artificially boost the mule deer population where habitat has been degraded by oil and gas drilling. The killing plans were approved despite overwhelming public opposition, and over the objection of leading scientific voices in Colorado.

The Center sued the Trump administration for denying Endangered Species Act protection to Pacific walrus. The lawsuit is being filed just as Arctic sea ice coverage is hitting a record low.

The Fish and Wildlife Service found in 2011 that the walrus warranted protection because climate change is destroying the sea ice it needs to survive. But a few months after Trump took office, the agency reversed course and found the species no longer merits protection.

The Center sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over the lack of protections for the streaked-horned lark, a songbird with distinctive feathered horns that has undergone massive declines across its range in western Oregon and Washington.

The lawsuit challenges the agency's October 2013 decision to protect the lark as "threatened" rather than the more protective "endangered" status and to create a "4(d) rule" that exempts all agriculture and airport activities from the prohibitions of the Endangered Species Act, regardless of whether they harm the lark.
