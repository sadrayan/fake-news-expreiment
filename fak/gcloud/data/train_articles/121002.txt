5 Things a Man's Finger Length Says About Him

Men with short index fingers and long ring fingers tend to be nicer toward women, according to a new study, to be published in the March issue of the journal Personality and Individual Differences. The finding could be a result of sex hormone exposure in the womb, scientists say.

In the study, more than 155 individuals (78 men and 77 women) filled out forms for every social interaction with a member of the opposite sex lasting five minutes or longer in a three-week period, using a checklist of "agreeable" or "quarrelsome" behaviors. Men with small digit-ratios (shorter index fingers relative to ring fingers) engaged in roughly a third more agreeable behaviors toward women, and a third fewer quarrelsome ones, than men with large digit-ratios, the reports showed.

Previous research has found that this "2D:4D" ratio — the ratio of the ­length of the second digit (the index finger) to that of the fourth digit (the ring finger) — reveals the amount of male hormones, mainly testosterone, a person is exposed to in the womb. The more testosterone, the longer the ring finger grows.

And studies have also linked this ratio to a host of other qualities.
