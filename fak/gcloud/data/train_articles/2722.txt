U.S. Senator Sam Brownback -- Iraq
IRAQ

Our military forces in Iraq continue to perform brilliantly against determined enemies. They are giving Iraq's political leaders a chance to make political compromises that will stabilize Iraq. Iraqi leaders must take advantage of this opportunity and reach a political equilibrium among Iraq's various groups.

The best way for Iraq's leaders to proceed is to embrace the concept of federalism. The Iraqi Constitution allows for the development of strong regional governments, much like the mostly stable Kurdish region already established in the northern part of the country. Keeping Baghdad as a federal capital city, Iraqis should form other regions where different factions could chart their own future within a united Iraq.

The first step towards federalism is to convene a conference for Iraqis to reach an agreement on a comprehensive political settlement based on federal regions within a united Iraq. Despite their differences, Iraq's sectarian and ethnic groups support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and should be given a forum to reach a political settlement. The international community must support the concept of a free, federalized Iraq. Iraq cannot function as a sovereign state if its neighbors continue to interject themselves into Iraq's affairs.
