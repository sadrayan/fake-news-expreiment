Executive Order # 117 Governor Jon S. Corzine Return to EO Index WHEREAS, the residents of New Jersey are entitled to a government that is effective, efficient, and free from corruption, favoritism, and waste; and WHEREAS, in pursuit of those goals, a series of actions have been taken in New Jersey since 2004 – through legislation, executive order, and regulation – to protect the integrity of government contractual decisions and increase the public’s confidence in government by prohibiting the awarding of government contracts to business entities that also are contributors to certain candidates and political parties; and WHEREAS, among those actions were the issuance of Executive Order No. 134 (2004) and the codification of its provisions into statute in P.L.2005, c.51 (C.19:44A-20.13 et seq.) (“Chapter 51”); and WHEREAS, since its adoption, Chapter 51 has significantly reduced the influence of contractor contributions in the process of awarding State government contracts and has proven to be an effective method of ensuring that merit and cost-effectiveness drive the government contracting process; and WHEREAS, this administration is committed to ensuring the highest ethical standards in government contracting and rooting out corruption, favoritism, and waste; and WHEREAS, experience has shown that additional measures are needed to ensure there is no dilution of the protections provided by Chapter 51 against the improper influence of political contributions on the process of awarding State government contracts and to ensure compliance with the provisions of Chapter 51; and WHEREAS, many State government contractors, particularly those that provide professional services, are business entities whose form of business organization and ownership structure are such that the political contribution limits in Chapter 51 apply to few if any of the individuals who own or control the entity; and WHEREAS, the strong public interest in limiting political contributions by businesses that contract with the State requires that the contribution limits in Chapter 51 be applied to such individuals and that those limits otherwise be applied in such a way that the purposes of Chapter 51 will be served regardless of the form of business organization of the State government contractor; and WHEREAS, because New Jersey’s campaign finance laws permit large, and in some cases unlimited, political contributions to flow between and among various types of political committees and State officeholders, the effectiveness of the restrictions in Chapter 51 can be, and have been, undermined by the current ability of State government contractors to make large contributions to legislative leadership committees and municipal political party committees; and WHEREAS, the Constitution of this State requires the Governor to manage the operations of State government effectively and fairly, uphold the law to ensure public order and prosperity, and confront and uproot malfeasance in whatever form it may take; and WHEREAS, it is the Governor’s responsibility to safeguard the integrity of the State government procurement process by ensuring that there is no dilution of the protections provided by Chapter 51 against the improper influence of political contributions on the process of awarding and overseeing the performance of State government contracts and that there be full compliance with the provisions of Chapter 51; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JON S. CORZINE, Governor of the State of New Jersey, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and by the Statutes of this State, do hereby ORDER and DIRECT: For the purposes of this Order:
