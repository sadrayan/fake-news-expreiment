Protect the Tax-Free Savings Account!
We announced that, as part of our low-tax plan for Canadians, a re-elected Conservative government will protect the TFSA and the recent enhancements to it that Canadians are enjoying.

Only a few years after the TFSA was introduced in 2009, 10.7 million Canadians had opened accounts, saving thousands of dollars. That number continues to grow. Our Conservative government recently increased the TFSA contribution limit, enabling Canadians to save even more each year and see their savings grow, tax-free, more quickly. Seniors, middle-income and low-income Canadian families have benefitted most from the ability to save through TFSAs.

For Justin Trudeau and Thomas Mulcair to threaten to take this option away from Canadians is irresponsible and puts Canadians’ future savings at risk.

We trust hardworking Canadians to make their own decisions about what’s in the best interest of their families, and we believe in empowering Canadians with voluntary savings options and low taxes.
