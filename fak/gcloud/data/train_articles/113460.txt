Baboon Beauty Queen South Africa
Description

This baboon was relaxing / posing in Cape Point, which is just outside Cape Town at the tip of Table Mountain.



There are loads of baboons in Cape Point and they can cause real trouble. If you leave a door to your house unlocked they can open the door, come in, and tear apart your home. We once found a baboon helping itself to some cornflakes!



They can also be pretty dangerous around children - so if you're in Cape Point make sure you keep everything locked. The alpha males have been known to take babies out of their prams - scary.



The baboons in Cape Point jump from rooftop to rooftop. People occasionally shoot them or poison them because they get so fed up, which is sad because there are only a few hundred left despite them having been in the area for thousands of years.



The Chacma Baboon troops on the Cape peninsula are the only protected population of this species in Africa.
