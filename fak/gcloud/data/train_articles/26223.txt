Bradley Cooper, Clint Eastwood to Star in ‘The Mule’ – Variety
Bradley Cooper may be reuniting with Clint Eastwood in his next film.

Sources tell Variety that Cooper is in talks to join Eastwood in “The Mule,” Eastwood’s next directing gig that he also plans to star in.

The film is a co-production between Warner Bros. and Imperative Entertainment, and will mark Eastwood’s first acting job since the 2012 baseball drama “Trouble With the Curve.” This could also be one of his final on-screen appearances.

The movie is based on a 2014 New York Times Magazine feature by Sam Dolnick and follows Earl Stone (Eastwood), a man in his 80s who is broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply requires him to drive — easy enough. But unbeknownst to Earl, he’s signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel, and also hit the radar of hard-charging DEA agent Colin Bates (Cooper).

Eastwood will also produce via his Malpaso banner, along with Imperative’s Dan Friedkin and Bradley Thomas. Ruben Fleischer, David Bernad, and Todd Hoffman are exec producing.

Cooper has been busy putting the finishing touches on his directorial debut, “A Star Is Born,” but sources say he has also been looking for his next project. He will next helm and star in the Leonard Bernstein biopic “Bernstein.”

Cooper had been linked to “The Mule” for some time as Eastwood is a big fan of his after working together on 2014’s Oscar-nominated “American Sniper.”

Cooper is repped by CAA.
