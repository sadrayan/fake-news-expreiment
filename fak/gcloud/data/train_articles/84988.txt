A Cuban flag used as wall art by volunteers for the Barack Obama campaign caused controversy for the candidate.

A video was posted on YouTube of an office in Houston run by Obama campaign volunteers.

Hanging on the wall, a Cuban flag can be seen with the image of Che Guevara superimposed on it.

Seen as a cult hero and a symbol of rebellion by some, Guevara was a Marxist revolutionary who was a top lieutenant under Fidel Castro.

He is reviled among South Florida's Cuban-American community for overseeing the public trials and executions of thousands in Cuba.

Obama's campaign released a statement calling the flag inappropriate. The statement stressed that the office featured in the video is only funded by volunteers of his campaign Â– it's not an official headquarters.
