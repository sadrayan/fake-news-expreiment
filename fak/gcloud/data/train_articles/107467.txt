Tanya McDowell agrees to plea deal in drug, larceny case
The Bridgeport mother charged with illegally enrolling her son in a Norwalk school has agreed to a plea deal.

Tanya McDowell was arrested last year on larceny charges for using a false address to send her son to Brookside Elementary.

She was later arrested on drug charges in Bridgeport and Norwalk.

Her lawyer tells News 12 Connecticut that McDowell, who was facing 40 years, agreed to a plea deal and will spend five years in prison to cover all the charges.
