OUR TEAM
"People think in pictures," is a common reminder from New Frame Partner Brian Lewis when discussing popular communications style.

At New Frame, Brian is one of four lobbyists for the firm's clients at the General Assembly. Brian combines his extensive political experience with his talent for telling the stories of individuals, small businesses, and nonprofits through film and video, an effective tool in collecting votes for legislation, communicating to the media, and explaining complex legislative issues to the public.

Brian also produces communications content and strategy for clients, including film and video for small business ventures and nonprofit agencies promoting services and products in the marketplace.

Brian has worked in NC politics and policy since 1996 and holds a master's degree in public affairs and bachelor's in political science from UNC Greensboro. He is a veteran lobbyist at the General Assembly and has been involved in some of the state's most high profile political discussions, communications campaigns, and policy debates over the last decade. However, New Frame is Brian's vision of lobbying and advocacy that is focused on finding common ground, putting aside partisanship, and making good public policy for North Carolina.

When Brian is not spending time with his wife and two kids in and around their home in Cary, NC, he can usually be found surfing at Wrightsville Beach's South End in the early morning. Brian is also an accomplished IRONMAN 140.6 and 70.3 athlete and marathoner.
