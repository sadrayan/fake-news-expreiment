Dr. Dean Lorich, 54, was the associate director of the orthopedic trauma service at the Hospital for Special Surgery who treated Bono in 2014 after the U2 frontman was badly injured in a cycling accident in Central Park.

Lorich was also a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College.

His death is being investigated as an apparent suicide, a New York Police Department official told ABC News.

Initial investigations did not find any signs of forced entry at his apartment, the official said. Authorities have not found a suicide note.

Police responding to a 911 call of an assault in a Park Avenue apartment at 1:05 p.m. Sunday found Lorich unconscious and unresponsive with a knife in his torso, according to the NYPD. Emergency medical service responders pronounced him dead.

There are no arrests, and the investigation is ongoing, according to the NYPD.

The Hospital for Special Surgery, New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine released a statement of sympathy Sunday evening.

"Dr. Lorich was a distinguished orthopedic trauma surgeon and teacher serving at Hospital for Special Surgery, New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine. We mourn this tragic development and extend our deepest sympathies to Dr. Lorich's family, friends and patients," the statement said.
