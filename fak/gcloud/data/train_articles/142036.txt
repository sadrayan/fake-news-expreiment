If you leave the phone off the hook in the United Kingdom, does it phone the police?
there is a scheme run by BT and i think by Age Concern,(or some similar organisation )where if the elderly person has severe health problems,it will buzz for so long then it automatically gets re-directed to the organisation concerned and they will come out and check up on the elderly person,if they don't get any response at the door then they will call in the police to force entry ,and to make sure the old person is ok or needs treatment.
