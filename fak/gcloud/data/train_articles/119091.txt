Mark Steinberg: Nike doesn't own the name 'Tiger Woods'
PALM HARBOR, Fla. – Tiger Woods’ manager Mark Steinberg released a statement on Wednesday contradicting a recent report that claimed Nike Golf has the rights to the former world No. 1’s name.

“I can’t imagine how this could have been communicated this way. It is wholly inaccurate and categorically false,” Steinberg said. “Tiger owns his own name and always had. He can use his name in any form he chooses. Nike would confirm that if asked.” Later Wednesday, a Nike spokeswoman did just that, saying, "Nike does not own the name 'Tiger Woods.' We can confirm that Mark Steinberg's comments are accurate."

In a story posted on Golf.com on March 6, Nicholas Mastroianni II – the developer of Woods’ South Florida restaurant, The Woods Jupiter: Sports and Dining Club, which is scheduled to open later this spring – said he was told that Nike “has the rights to the name Tiger Woods.”
