The End of a Coal Era?

Thecoal plant since 2010 -- GenOn Generation Station in Portland, PA -- has announced plans for retirement!

We are winning as city by city, communities are standing up and saying no to coal and yes to clean energy. Public officials and energy utilities are realizing the economics and health problems caused by our addiction to coal just don't add up.

Let's continue this trend by adding more coal plants to this list and to promote a clean energy future!

This plant is the largest source of pollution in Northwest New Jersey causing not only environmental problems, but also affecting the health of the community around the plant. With this terrific news now the people of New Jersey and the country can breathe easier. Not only that, but our efforts have led to the equivalent of 11 million homes powered throughout the nation by clean energy! This amazing milestone, no doubt one of many to come, represents the hard work of our allies and thousands and thousands of concerned residents just like you!
