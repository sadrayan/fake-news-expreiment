Race Details

With incumbent Rep. Matt Salmon retiring from Congress, this open seat features a very competitive four-way Republican primary. Arizona’s 5th Congressional District is strongly Republican, so the winner of this primary will likely become the next Representative.

The Republican Primary in Arizona’s 5th Congressional District was held on August 30. Nearly 86,000 votes were cast and Club PAC-endorsed candidate Andy Biggs holds a 9-vote lead over Christine Jones. That margin will trigger an automatic recount once the election is certified. All indications from recent recounts in Arizona show that the electoral system there is extremely accurate and the final tally isn’t likely to change.
