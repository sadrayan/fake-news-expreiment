Gallup International’s 41 Annual Global End of Year Survey:PUTIN LEADS GLOBALLY OVER TRUMP AS A CHOICE FOR COUNTRY LEADER, NEW CONSTELLATIONS OF NATIONS ARE EMERGING
Back < Prev Next > The World’s first (launched in 1977) and leading Global Public Opinion Barometer, covering this year in a representative way about 2/3 of the global population, done in partnership with WIN, shows: Choosing between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump over one quarter (29%) of the respondents globally declare to prefer as head of state of their own country the Russian leader. Donald Trump is preferred as country leader by 17%. There are nine countries among the 55 surveyed that give preference to Donald Trump as possible leader, among them leading are Kosovo, Albania, Philippines and the United States itself. Vladimir Putin won approval as potential country leader in 25 countries, Germany, France and Ireland are in that list as well along with those traditionally loyal to him. 20 countries reject both potential candidates for the position of their country leaders, this opinion is expressed by 45% of all surveyed respondents globally. Vladimir Putin is generally preferred in most of the regions except the USA. Even overall critical Europeans choosing between him and the present American President give preference to the Russian leader. In Africa, India and East Asia the two opponents score almost equal support. The survey results disclose that the American President is no longer perceived as absolute world leader. Thinking of global political leadership, should USA keep the leading role as arguably the most powerful state in the world? Or USA and Russia should exercise global leadership together? Every forth in the world (25%) votes for parity joint leadership, while USA supreme and sole leadership is preferred by 19%. Majorities in almost all of world macro-regions declare to prefer a joint leadership of USA and Russia, except USA itself where 40% of respondents believe their country should continue as global leader alone. The two options of global leadership split the public opinion in almost equal proportions in West Asia - in Republic of Korea, in Japan, in Hong Kong, in Philippines, in Thailand and in Vietnam. Generally, the dominant position of USA as world global leader no longer seems to look unquestionable. Kancho Stoychev, President Gallup International Association (GIA): «Just one year after Donald Trump entered the White House the world of international relations is no longer the same. While increasing the US economic and military strength President Trump is failing to attract sympathy around the world and the US global political leadership is no longer accepted among a predominant part of the world’s inhabitants. From bi-polar world during the Cold War through US dominated world after 1989 now the World seems to be transforming to a more colorful place. Different constellations of nations (or “constenations”) are emerging in front of our eyes as an expression of new regionalization of the World – not on geographical principles but on a shared view for the future.» Andrey Milekhin, Vice President Gallup International Association (GIA): «The choice between these two Presidents is not an easy one and at the end the candidate “against both” won. The complexity of the choice was defined by the fact that behind Trump stands the USA economic and military power, Putin on the other hand has 25 years of political experience being one of the most long-lived and sustainable among the world political leaders. The respondents also made a choice between the values represented by the two: stability and patriarchal spirit represented by Putin on the one side and Trump’s modern business-approach and supremacy of national interests in defining the world politics, on the other side. To the majority of world’s population, the conservatism and reliability of Putin seems to be more appealing. No doubts that these attitudes are also affected by spread by mass-media vendetta against Trump’s total personality and actions. We could say that 25 years of USA dominance didn’t result in global peace and harmony, on the contrary, gave rise to some new problems and conflicts. Multipolarity of the World is already quite clear and obvious. In several regions there are strong leaders that distinctly claim to form the world’s overall agenda. And this is not only Russia, but China, India, Brazil and Turkey as well. With new leaders, new political ideas and coalitions we see attempts of restauration of France’s and Germany’s world influence. It is interesting to see that in Russia a potential joint global leadership exercised along with USA is supported by less than half of the population (40%).» DONALD TRUMP VS.
