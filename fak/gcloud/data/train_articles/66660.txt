America will Pay More in Taxes in 2015 than it Will Spend on Food, Clothing, and Housing Combined
In 2015, America will pay $3.3 trillion in taxes to the federal government and an additional $1.5 trillion to state and local government. America’s total tax bill of $4.8 trillion is about 31 percent of the nation’s total income.

This is a significant amount and is more than America will spend on food, clothing, and housing combined.

No doubt that the taxes we pay go towards services that government provides, but it is important to understand how much those services cost the United States.
