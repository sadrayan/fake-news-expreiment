Public schools struggle with lessons about Islam amid renewed fears of terrorism
The academy's report said common student questions included whether Islam is a violent religion. The report suggested that teachers respond that "Islam (like Christianity, Buddhism, Paganism, etc.) is neither violent nor nonviolent. In the hands of believers, all religious expressions are capable of being interpreted in ways that can inspire the full range of human agency from the heinous to the heroic."
