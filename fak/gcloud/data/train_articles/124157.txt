Clearance Flow chart

The type and number of clearances required depend on the technology option and capacity of the project. Clearance is used in this context as a collective term referring to permits, licences, approvals, agreements and payments. All project developers will have to operate through a registered company (local or abroad) and have access to land (through purchase or lease). Registration of companies www.attorney-general.go.ke and land acquisition procedures www.lands.go.ke are not featured on this RE portal.Learn More â€”
