Table 1. Public high school 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate (ACGR), by race/ethnicity and selected demographic characteristics for the United States, the 50 states, and the District of Columbia
NOTE: The 4-year ACGR is the number of students who graduate in 4 years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class. From the beginning of 9th grade (or the earliest high school grade), students who are entering that grade for the first time form a cohort that is “adjusted” by adding any students who subsequently transfer into the cohort and subtracting any students who subsequently transfer out, emigrate to another country, or die. There are some differences in how states implemented the requirements for the ACGR, leading to the potential for differences across states in how the rates are calculated. This is particularly applicable to the population of children with disabilities. Black includes African American, Hispanic includes Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander includes Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and American Indian includes Alaska Native. Race categories exclude Hispanic origin unless specified. Variances of +/- 5% from year-to-year for any subgroup over 50 in cohort size were addressed with states through ED’s Coordinated Data Quality Review. With one exception, West Virginia, states provided explanations for the increase/decrease. The state comment was not accepted by the data steward (OESE) for California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, Utah and the District of Columbia. Those seven states and West Virginia received a letter from OESE to the state’s Chief State School Officer outlining data quality concerns that are expected to be addressed in future submissions.
