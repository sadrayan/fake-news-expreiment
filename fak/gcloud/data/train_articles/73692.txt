FitzGerald said he wasn't aware of $750 in donations from Michael Forlani
AKRON, Ohio -- Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald's name has surfaced tangentially again in courtroom testimony about public corruption, this time as FitzGerald ponders a run for Ohio governor next year.

An FBI agent testified Friday that crooked electrical contractor Michael Forlani used two intermediaries in 2008 to disguise his campaign contributions to FitzGerald, who at the time was mayor of Lakewood.

Special Agent Kirk Spielmaker said Forlani resorted to intermediaries to hide the source of the campaign checks, totaling $750. Neither Spielmaker nor federal prosecutors indicated whether FitzGerald knew the true source of the money.

Reached Friday night, FitzGerald said he was stunned to hear about this from The Plain Dealer because the FBI never talked to him about it. He said he had no knowledge that anybody had donated to his campaign through an intermediary.

At the time of the contributions, Forlani was already aware that he was a potential target of the corruption investigation. He has since pleaded guilty to racketeering and other corruption-related crimes and faces up to eight years in prison.

On a wiretap of a call to his secretary, Forlani said he could not write the checks himself to FitzGerald, so he asked her to get ahold of Vince Russo and Michael Nyman and have them write campaign contribution checks. He did not say why he could not write the checks. Listen to FBI wiretaps from the county corruption case.

Russo would later become implicated in the county corruption scandal. The son of then-County Auditor Frank Russo spent 18 months in a federal prison after pleading guilty in 2010 to charges involving illegal gifts to Maple Heights school officials in exchange for business contracts.

Nyman, of Moreland Hills, was identified in testimony as a friend of Forlani's.

FitzGerald's chief of staff, Matt Carroll, said that the county executive had not been aware that Forlani was the source of the campaign contributions until a call Friday evening from The Plain Dealer.

Carroll said FitzGerald donated the $250 from Russo, who had signed his name to the check, to a veterans charity group immediately after learning that Russo had been implicated in the county corruption case.

Now that FitzGerald knows that Forlani was the source of a $500 donation from Nyman, he will also donate that money to a charity, Carroll said.

FitzGerald echoed what Carroll had said -- that the $500 would be donated to a veterans charity. He said that he did not know Nyman and that this was the first time he had heard his name.

FitzGerald said he wished he had more time to investigate what the FBI had found out so that he could more thoroughly respond. All he could say Friday night was that he did not know Forlani was the source of the money or why he would donate the money through intermediaries.

"There's no way to predict that a contribution made to a campaign four years ago would be involved in a corruption case," FitzGerald said. "So each person has to decide what he's going to do with the money, and in my case, I give it to that charity to avoid any appearance of impropriety."

FitzGerald said he is not worried about any impact on a run for governor, '"because we uphold ourselves to the strictest standards."

Neither Russo nor Nyman could be reached Friday night for comment.

FitzGerald's name came up in the testimony during the fourth day of Forlani's sentencing hearing, which will resume on Monday in U.S. District Court in Akron.

On Friday, federal prosecutors played a recording of an FBI wiretapped conversation in which Forlani told his secretary at Doan Pyramid that he couldn't write the checks himself to FitzGerald. He instructed her to tell Russo and Nyman to write the checks.

Prosecutors used the contributions to FitzGerald as examples of how Forlani routinely used friends and employees at Doan Pyramid to disguise his campaign gifts to political candidates, including some who were later convicted of corruption, such as former county employee J. Kevin Kelley, who prosecutors said received $19,000 from Forlani, and former Cleveland City Councilwoman Sabra Pierce Scott, who received $3,600.

The disclosure comes the same week that FitzGerald spoke to Democratic leaders from across the state about his potential run for governor, which could pit him against incumbent Republican Gov. John Kasich.

"I'm very, very serious about it," FitzGerald, 44, said afterward. "I'll be saying something pretty soon."

FitzGerald was in his first term as mayor of Lakewood when he ran for the newly created county executive job in 2010 and won.

Last year, FitzGerald's name surfaced in the trial of Dimora, the former county commissioner who was convicted of racketeering and 31 other charges and is serving a 28-year sentence in federal prison.

Prosecutors at the trial played a wiretapped recording of Dimora calling FitzGerald on behalf of businessman William Neiheiser in 2008. FitzGerald, a former FBI agent, agreed to talk to Neiheiser, who later struck a deal to lease Lakewood's city-owned ice rink.

After his name came out in court, FitzGerald said that FBI agents assured him he had done nothing wrong, and Lakewood city leaders maintained that Dimora had no influence on the deal, which turned out well for the city.
