Lanier student was sitting alone before shooting, students say
A student at Lanier High School in North Austin fatally shot himself at school Tuesday, officials said.

The student’s name has not been released. Officials said the incident occurred a little after noon.

Students have been released early, and parents can pick them up at the back of the school at 1201 Payton Gin Road near U.S. 183, officials said.

The district will provide counseling services for students, parents and faculty until 6 p.m., officials said. People needing help are also encouraged to call Austin Travis County Integral Care’s crisis hot line at 512-472-4357.

"Our deepest sympathies go out to the family," Superintendent Meria Carstarphen said at the school.

Alex Hernandez, a junior, said the student was sitting alone in a courtyard outside the cafeteria during lunch when he pulled a handgun from his hoodie and shot himself. Hernandez didn’t see where he was shot.

Austin police, district police and Austin/Travis County Emergency Medical Services crews responded.

Officials are still investigating how the student got a gun onto campus, Carstarphen said.

Friends of the student say he had posted a letter on Facebook that included a photo of him with a gun to his head.

Dorothy Rivera said one of her three daughters who attend the school witnessed the incident.

"She’s pretty shaken up," Rivera said. "It’s just a terrible thing."
