You Won’t Believe The New Stamps The Post Office Is Selling…
As we all known, the post office receives submissions for new stamps all of the time. Many of the ideas are immediately thrown out or deemed unacceptable by the public, while others are carefully reviewed and process.

According to reports, Michelle Obama has now submitted an idea, and the post office is actually looking into it to see whether the stamp is worth producing.

Of course, the stamp aligns with Michelle’s agenda to push health and fitness, in hopes of helping people understand the importance of living a healthy life. These stamps have never made it into circulation, although they cost nearly $100,000 to print. The delay is due to the fact that some of the stamps show children who aren’t wearing appropriate safety gear.

If they are sold, the profit will be around $20 million.
