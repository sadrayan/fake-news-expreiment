Wellmont Health System is reducing staffing at three of its hospitals in Southwest Virginia.

According to a statement released Wednesday, This week Wellmont cut 50 positions at Mountain View Regional Medical Center, Lee Regional Medical Center and Lonesome Pine Hospital.

A Wellmont spokesman says staffing reduction were spread across a number of departments.

The health care provider said the cuts were made due the requirements of healthcare reform, an era of reduced Medicare reimbursements, cuts from the federal sequester and the lack of Medicaid expansion in Virginia.

Wellmont issued the following statement Wednesday afternoon on changes to operations at its Virginia hospitals:

Wellmont Health System is revising its operational and care models in Virginia to meet the needs of today's patients and respond to a rapidly changing healthcare landscape.





These changes by Wellmont enable the health system to respond to the requirements of healthcare reform, an era of reduced Medicare reimbursements, cuts from the federal sequester and the lack of Medicaid expansion in Virginia.





Such outside forces are major contributors to an anticipated reduction of at least $25 million in revenue for Wellmont during the next fiscal year. Reductions in Medicare reimbursements present a significant challenge, as about 60 percent of patients the health system serves are covered by this federal program.





These economic realities and changing utilization of healthcare services resulted in this week's reduction in the number of staffed positions by about 50 at its three Virginia hospitals – Mountain View Regional Medical Center, Lee Regional Medical Center and Lonesome Pine Hospital. The employment changes have been spread across a number of departments.





Fred Pelle, president of Wellmont Health System's community hospital division, which includes these three hospitals, made it clear that none of these hospitals is closing and that patients should continue to access them for their healthcare needs. He also said there will be no change in the ratio of bedside caregivers to patients.





Instead, Lee Regional is reducing its inpatient services and no longer offering its intensive care unit due to lower patient volumes. Intensive care services are still available at other nearby Wellmont hospitals.





Lonesome Pine and Mountain View Regional are consolidating several leadership positions and staffing to meet patient trends. No services are being changed in Wise County.

"We wish we did not have to take these actions, but the healthcare system in our country is changing significantly and abruptly," Pelle said.





"We need to respond with the most efficient model of care that still addresses all our patient needs. The speed of the changes being forced upon us by reduced federal reimbursements requires us to make difficult decisions to ensure we have the resources to continue to provide superior care."
