More than 100 trucks contracted by Florida Power & Light were staged at the Flagler Executive Airport on Thursday in preparation for Tropical Storm Hermine to make landfall in the Big Bend area of northwest Florida.



“We have a memorandum of understanding with FPL that allows them to store equipment at the airport,” Airport Director Roy Sieger said in a media release. “That way crews can be deployed to the impacted area immediately after the storm passes.”

Pike Electric and Heart Utilities are just two of the companies contracted by FPL to assist with any necessary tree removal and power line work needed once Hermine passes through the state.



Pike Electric sent 45 trucks and 65 people from Fort Pierce. Crews from Lewis Tree of Miami were told Tuesday they would be deployed Wednesday. Flagler County is “staging site 4,” the release states.



Tim Wilson, an FPL employee working in the capacity of “site lead vegetation manager,” said crews are well prepared as he checked in with his team members.



Four large tents will be brought in and set up on airport property Thursday to accommodate security, inventory, meetings and dining, the release states.



The greatest impact of the storm is expected to be in north Florida.



“This is the first time I’ve seen them activate since I’ve been here,” Sieger said. “It’s great to see this come together; it’s just one of the many services the airport offers.”
