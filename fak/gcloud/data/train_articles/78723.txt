This is what the world's newest Islamic caliphate might look like
The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also known as ISIS, has declared huge parts of Syria and Iraq a new Islamic caliphate. ISIL also ordered all Muslims around the world to follow Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the new caliph for their self-declared nation.

Using a map ISIL posted on Twitter in March, we've created this map to show where the borders of the new Islamic caliphate would be if ISIL gets its way.
