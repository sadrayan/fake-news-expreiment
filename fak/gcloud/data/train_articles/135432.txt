Latin Cross
The so-called “Latin Cross” is the most common variety of cross, with the cross piece placed slightly above the centre of the intersection, and resembles in its general shape a man with his arms open.

Many early crosses have elaborate designs and flared arms. Teardrops and serifs were added to the end of the arms. Hardstones, pearls, and pendant crosses were dangled from the arms. A plain Latin cross is the most typical cross found today in Protestant churches, where the glory of images does not need to represent the glory of the Word.
