Clinton Campaign Statement Regarding State Department Email Review
Friday began with the printing of a story that was false. Entities from the highest levels of two branches of government have now made that clear.

We have had a chance to review the statement released by the Inspectors General of the State Department and Intelligence Community outlining their concerns with regard to the State Department's review and release of Hillary Clinton's work emails. We want to ensure that appropriate procedures are followed as these emails are reviewed while not unduly delaying the release of her emails. We particularly do not want their release to be hampered by bureaucratic infighting among the Intelligence Community. More emails are slated to be released by the State Department next week, and we hope that release is as inclusive as possible.

There have been recent examples, such as the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on torture, where release of information was delayed because of disagreements among agencies, and we hope that will not happen here.

Finally, earlier this week we were pleased for Secretary Clinton to receive an offer from Congressman Gowdy to appear before the committee in a public hearing in October, and yesterday accepted his invitation. -Nick Merrill
