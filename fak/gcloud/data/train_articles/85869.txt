Listen to David Matthau's Report:





The fight between Governor Christie and the democrats - about money that had been designated in the budget to fix the state's aging computer system - keeps getting uglier.



After MVC computers recently crashed twice in the span of a few weeks - infuriating customers - the Governor blamed democrats for cutting 35 million dollars out of the state budget that he said would have been used to update the Agencies computers.



Democrats responded that Christie had improperly funneled tens of millions of dollars out of the MVC - to pay for other programs- and now he was trying to spin the story so he wouldn't have to take responsibility for not addressing the problem.



During a news conference in Hasbrouck Heights yesterday, the Governor said instead of the democrats holding hearings about how to improve the state's IT infrastructure - which are planned for later this week and in September - "what would have been helpful is if they wouldn't have taken the 35 million dollars out of the budget that I submitted to improve our information technology and computer systems."



When Christie was asked about democratic claims that 5-point-5 million had been removed from the budget- not 35 million - he replied "the actual figure is 35 million - now that things are going bad, they're trying to change the numbers and change the story…

this is what happens when you rush and do a budget in the last week- mistakes get made, and I think if they had it to do all over again they wouldn't take the 35 million out when computers are crashing twice at the MVC's."



The Governor also said when he first got elected and sat down at his desk in the Statehouse, he couldn't believe how old his PC was.



"I felt like there was going to be a crank next to it" he said, "I mean the technology that I had at the US Attorney's office- at the federal government - compared to what we have at the state government- is a joke - a joke!"



Christie added maybe the democrats should - "instead of holding hearings about it - maybe they should put a supplemental appropriation forward - admit they were wrong- put the 35 million dollars up and then I'll consider it…they could step up to the plate and just say I was wrong - they could just say it - we were wrong to cut the money out- Governor you were right."



He also said he believes residents of the Garden state "have a lot better things to do than to listen to the majority in the Senate and the Assembly bloviate about things that they could have fixed at the time of the budget… they're just yelling into the wind - they like doing that - that's fine - they can do that all they want - I'm out here talking about real things…they always want to play the blame game - a hundred percent of their time on blame, zero percent of their time on responsibility when it comes to this information technology business…we are too dependent on computers now to not have the state have the type of technology infrastructure that will get people the answers they need from their government, and it's unfortunate that they took that money out of the budget, but you know, if they want to pass a supplemental and come back - I'd certainly be willing to consider it in the context of the other things we put forward."
