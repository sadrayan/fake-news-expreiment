Marlboro Parent Company, Phillip Morris, to Stop Producing Cigarettes
The international tobacco giant behind Marlboro and other major brands like L&M, Parliament and Chesterfield, made a major announcement on New Year's Eve - the company plans on phasing out the manufacturing of cigarettes and move into other smoke-free products.

The company said they've chosen to do "something really big" and move away from cigarette production and instead focus on devices like IQOS, which heats tobacco rather than burn it. It claims the product could potentially reduce the number of noxious chemicals by 95 percent, but research is still being carried out.

"If we stop selling cigarettes, some else is going to sell them because people buy them,” Andre Calantzopoulos, CEO of Phillip Morris International, told Sky News. “So I don’t think that will have any impact on public health or the health of people."

"At the end of the day, the ambition we have is to replace cigarettes as soon as possible, with better alternatives for the people who continue smoking," said Calantzopoulos.
