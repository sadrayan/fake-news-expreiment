(SACRAMENTO)—No on 56—Stop the Special Interest Tax Grab today announced launching a 60-second radio ad, “Grab,” that points out the flaws in Prop. 56, including that the initiative is backed by wealthy special interests and cheats our public schools out of at least $600 million each year.

“The wealthy special interests behind Prop. 56 are trying to use the ballot box to increase their profits,” said Beth Miller, spokesperson for the No on 56 coalition. “This radio ad is part of our ongoing effort to educate voters about the true nature of Prop. 56, its flaws and why the initiative deserves a ‘no’ vote on Election Day.”

“Grab” explains how Prop. 56 will increase special interests’ profits and was purposely written to make sure schools get none of the new tax revenue as required by Proposition 98 and the State Constitution, cheating them out of at least $600 million each year.

The ad is part of the coalition’s efforts to educate California voters about the significant flaws in Prop. 56, the $1.4 billion special interest “tax grab hike” on the November ballot.
