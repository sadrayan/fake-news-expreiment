NEW YORK, NY - Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, who is setting records for number of events, size of crowds, and breadth of travel on the campaign trail, determined in light of increased scrutiny of candidates’ health, it was important to have a detailed physical examination for all the various standard tests attributable thereto.



This examination took place on Friday, September 9, 2016, and was administered by Dr. Harold N. Bornstein of New York City, who has been Mr. Trump’s personal physician for over 30 years. All of the detailed results are enclosed.



We are pleased to disclose all of the test results which show that Mr. Trump is in excellent health, and has the stamina to endure — uninterrupted — the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign and, more importantly, the singularly demanding job of President of the United States.
