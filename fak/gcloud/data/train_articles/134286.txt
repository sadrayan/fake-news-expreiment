Capcom sets up human meat market
Taking creepy marketing strategies to a whole new level, Capcom is setting up a human meat market in East London this weekend.

The exhibit, entitled Wesker & Son Resident Evil Human Butchery, features real meat fashioned into human body parts. Items include the likes of peppered human & lemon sausages, J’avo caught human thigh steaks and pots made of red and green herbs. Yum.

All proceeds go to the Limbless Association, a charity for people who have lost limbs. No, I’m not kidding.

For a more educational weekend, you can head over to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital Pathology Museum for a lecture on how the Resident Evil games connect to real life.

This isn’t the first time Capcom has pulled a crazy marketing stunt for Resident Evil, as it also opened a restaurant in Japan based on the series. I think I’m seeing a pattern here.

Check out the grisly photos from the exhibition:
