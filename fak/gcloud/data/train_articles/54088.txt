GMO food labeling lets Rhode Islanders decide

By Donna M. Nesselbush

I don't know about you, but I like "choice," and so do an increasing number of

Rhode Islanders who care deely about what they eat. !hether it is arents looking for

the best food for their children or our to chefs interested in the freshest ingredients, "buy

local# aears to be gaining traction. $reat organi%ations like &arm &resh RI and the RI

&ood 'olicy (ouncil are working to make local food sources more re)alent, more

sustainable and more affordable. !e are roud of our reutation as a leader in this area.

I feel strongly that "you are what you eat." *nowing this truism, eole across

Rhode Island are telling us they want more information about the food they ut in their

shoing carts. +ne of the most sirited issues right now surrounds genetically modified

foods. ,re they good for us or bad for us- .he roblem is that we really don't know.

In an a)erage grocery store, roughly /0 ercent of rocessed foods contain

"genetically modified organisms" or $M+s. 1nfortunately, Rhode Islanders shoing at

their neighborhood 2haw3s or 2to 4 2ho or Da)e3s don3t know if the food they are

buying contains $M+s, because there is no labeling re5uirement. .his needs to change.

In the sirit of Roger !illiams, Rhode Islanders ha)e a "right to know" what we are

eating, and we, as a state, should 6oin the growing coalition of states re5uiring labeling of

$M+ foods. 7ermont, Maine and (onnecticut ha)e already assed $M+ labeling

legislation, and a similar bill in Massachusetts has the suort of /0 ercent of the

legislature. ,dditionally, o)er 89 countries, from Russia to Italy :and almost all of the

de)eloed world; ha)e enacted similar legislation. .he <uroean 1nion has re5uired

$M+ labeling since =>>/.

$enetically engineered food is re)alent in grocery stores, yet the 1.2.

go)ernment does not erform or re5uire indeendent safety testing. 'erhas this is

because the biotech industry allegedly, according to the &ood and !ater !atch, has sent

?0@/ Million lobbying (ongress from =>>>AB99>. .o make matters worse, according to

the same organi%ation, o)er C99 former (ongressional and !hite Douse staff members

are now emloyed by biotech firms as lobbyists. .his doesn't smell right, alongside a

growing body of e)idence linking $M+s to ersonal health risks and en)ironmental

imacts. !hile further research is needed, ublic oinion olls reeatedly show more

than >9E of ,mericans want to be able to make informed decisions about whether or not

they urchase and consume $M+s.

Desite the o)erwhelming suort of the ,merican eole, the $rocery

Manufacturers ,ssociation, reresenting the largest chemical and food rocessing

comanies, are fighting labeling re5uirements here and in other states, because they

would refer to kee consumers in the dark about what they are eating. 2o much for

"you are what you eat" and "the customer is always right.# .hey claim that ro)iding

factual information about our food will confuse consumers and raise food rices.

&ortunately, we don't ha)e to rely on industryAfunded assertions of imossibility

and imracticality. Do%ens of countries ha)e labeled $M+s without increasing food

costs, and state after state is considering 6uming on the bandwagon. I belie)e that e)ery

Rhode Islander deser)es to know whether food contains $M+s, and the time is now for

our state go)ernment to ste in.

I ha)e filed legislation in the 2enate that would create a $M+ labeling

re5uirement in Rhode Island, and I thank Reresentati)es Raymond Dull, Dennis (anario

and Blake &illii who ha)e also filed $M+ bills in the Douse. .here are differences in

the )arious ieces of legislation, but the oint is to re5uire that roducts containing

$M+s be lainly labeled, so that consumers can simly decide for themsel)es whether or

not to buy them and eat them. I ha)e nothing ersonally "against" $M+s, I 6ust think

eole ha)e a right to know if they are eating them.

Fet3s make Rhode Island the neGt state to 6oin the trend toward a transarent food

suly for all Rhode Islanders where the ingredients are not masked by the huge

cororations that, not surrisingly, may be moti)ated more by money than by health.

Donna M. Nesselbush is a Democratic Rhode Island state senator representing

District 15, which includes portions of Pawtucket and North Proidence. !he introduced

legislation this week to re"uire labeling of food containing geneticall# modified

organisms.
