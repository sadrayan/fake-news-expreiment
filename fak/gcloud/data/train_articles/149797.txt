Arsen Avakov: Interpol didn't issue search notice for Yatsenyuk - Apr. 29, 2017
Interpol has dismissed Russia’s request to post an international search alert for former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said.

“I would like to state with pleasure and respect that in accordance with its protocol, Interpol, as an adequate and reputable international organization, has taken my letter into account and dismissed Russia’s absurd request,” the minister said on Facebook.

As reporter, Russia requested Interpol to issue an international search notice for Yatsenyuk. Avakov, in turn, wrote a letter to Interpol on the groundlessness of the Russian side’s accusations.
