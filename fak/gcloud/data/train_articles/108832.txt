White Lighters are Bad Luck, and Heres Why... A Look into Stoner History.
Everyone knows that white lighters are Bad Luck. Most people understand it as a fact, even though they may not believe it. But does anyone know the real reason behind it? There are multiple reasons in history why white lighters are considered bad luck. The first reason, is because when disposable lighters first came out, they only came in two colors. Black, and White. Now, when people would try to pack bowls down with their lighters, the ash would often get stuck to the bottom of their lighters. So when they were being investigated by police, white lighters would show signs of smoking and ash burns, and black lighters wouldn't. Another reason revolves around Four Famous Musicians (and Fellow Stoners), Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrex, Janis Joplin, and Kurt Cobain. All four of them were left-handed, and they all died at the age of 27. The coincidence was that all four of their autopsies showed that when they died, they had White Bic Lighters in their pockets. So next time that you are in a sesh, and someone pulls out a White Lighter, throw that shit away or brake it. I have had several personal cases where bad things happened, and every single time we had used a white lighter. Still don't believe me? Keep using your white lighters and you will find out soon.
