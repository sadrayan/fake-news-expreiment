[Madison, WI] — Just how expensive would it be for Wisconsin families if Tony Evers became governor? Evers has laid out how he would raise a variety of taxes on hard-working Wisconsinites – be it the gas tax, income taxes, or property taxes. However up to this point, he’s refused to say just how high taxes would skyrocket under his leadership.

“Thanks to Scott Walker, Wisconsinites are seeing real tax relief. In fact, the governor has cut taxes by over $8 billion since taking office,” said Alec Zimmerman, spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin. “Tony Evers is a Madison liberal who would take us backward and hike taxes on the hard-working families of our state. He shouldn’t wait any longer in answering the question – how much will Tony Evers cost taxpayers if he’s elected governor?
