Who We Are - What We Do for You
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is an independent federal regulatory agency that was created in 1972 by Congress in the Consumer Product Safety Act. In that law, Congress directed the Commission to "protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products."

We have jurisdiction over thousands of types of consumer products, from coffee makers to toys to lawn mowers. Some types of products, however, are covered by other federal agencies. For example, cars, trucks and motorcycles are covered by the Department of Transportation; food, drugs and cosmetics are covered by the Food and Drug Administration; and alcohol, tobacco and firearms are within the jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury.

What We Do

CPSC works to reduce the risk of injuries and deaths from consumer products by:

developing voluntary standards with industry

issuing and enforcing mandatory standards; banning consumer products if no standard would adequately protect the public

obtaining the recall of products and arranging for their repair, replacement or a refund

conducting research on potential product hazards

informing and educating consumers through the media, state and local governments, private organizations, and by responding to consumer inquiries.
