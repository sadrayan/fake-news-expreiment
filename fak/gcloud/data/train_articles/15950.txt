Gardner,

Yes. And DPS is committed to protecting any state official that may be under threat conditions, especially considering that the threat environment has changed dramatically over the last decade.

The Texas Government Code, Section 411.002(a) charges DPS with enforcing the laws protecting public safety and providing for the prevention and detection of crime. This includes any threat or attempt to physically harm any state official. The department deploys resources to detect and prevent such an act from occurring. Protecting the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker, attorney general and other state officials is a critical mission of the department, and DPS has a responsibility to perform these and other security related missions, such as protecting the state Capitol.

Is Dewhurst the first lieutenant governor to have a security detail?

If not, which past lieutenant governors had such details?
