Tracking Republican House Retirements
Democrats have a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the midterm elections in November. One reason that has gotten a lot of attention is the large number of House Republicans who have decided not to seek re-election.

With the announcement that Tom Garrett, Republican of Virginia, will not seek re-election, 40 House Republicans have said they’ll retire at the end of this term. That’s much more than would typically do so by this stage, according to data compiled by Daniel Donner of Daily Kos Elections.

Why is that important? Incumbents are simply tougher to topple. Over the last decade or so, they have run about seven percentage points ahead of non-incumbents from the same party in similar districts.

But the exodus of House Republicans hasn’t brightened Democrats’ prospects quite as much as the total number of retirements might suggest. A relatively high number of Republicans have retired in competitive districts (defined here as districts that lean less than 10 percentage points toward Republicans or Democrats in presidential elections). But that number is not very far out of the ordinary.

Democrats, who need a net gain of 23 seats to take control of the House, have many of their own vulnerable incumbents retiring.

The good news for Democrats is that several of the Republicans retiring from the most competitive districts were particularly strong incumbents. They are longtime, moderate incumbents with a history of running far ahead of the national party in their district. Many won re-election without any serious challenge, even when Barack Obama won their districts in 2008 or 2012.

In a strongly Democratic political environment like this one, Washington’s Dave Reichert and New Jersey’s Frank LoBiondo were arguably the two most valuable possible retirement for the Democrats. Democrats got both.

In a more competitive national environment, Florida’s Ileana Ros-Lehtinen might have been the most valuable retirement, and she is leaving, too. Pennsylvania’s Charlie Dent is another valuable retirement for Democrats. In some cases, the retirements have moved safely Republican districts all the way to tossups.

The retirement of Dave Trott in Michigan’s 11th is less useful to Democrats: He won by 13 points last time in a district that voted for Donald J. Trump. The seat was pretty competitive before, and it remains so now.

Rodney Frelinghuysen’s retirement in New Jersey is somewhere in the middle. He was vulnerable before his retirement, but most analysts still believed he had an edge after his comfortable re-election in 2016. The district is now a tossup, or even leans to the Democrats.
