McKinney Resigns as Chief of Staff

Dr. Mike McKinney, chief of staff for Governor Rick Perry, today announced that he will be stepping down from his position.

McKinney, a family physician, former head of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and a former state representative, has served as Perry’s chief of staff since August 2001.

“Dr. Mike brought immense talent, expertise and experience to my staff,” Perry said. “When he agreed to leave the private sector and come back to work at the state, he committed to serve until after the November elections. He has served the state tirelessly, and I am grateful for his service to the State of Texas.”

McKinney will remain on the job to help his successor make the transition into the post. McKinney’s successor has not been named.

“I thank Governor Perry for the opportunity to serve him and the state over the past 15 months,” McKinney said. “I want to make the transition to the next chief of staff as smooth as possible. With the start of the 2003 legislative session just two months away, my departure at this point will give Governor Perry’s next chief of staff time to prepare for the work of the Legislature.”
