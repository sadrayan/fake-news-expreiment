It is 2015 now, believe it or not. Rhode Island muddles along, perpetually over-taxed, under-employed, and struggling to keep up economically with both our neighbors and the rest of the country.

Our unemployment stands at 7.1 percent, 47th out of 50 states. The 2015 budget projects a $200 million deficit, which is a pretty incredible feat considering Rhode Island is one of the most highly taxed states in the union.

Our state needs something new, something to boost us up and out of the rut we always seem to find ourselves in. The Marijuana Regulation, Control and Taxation Act could very likely be exactly what Rhode Island needs to turn itself around.

Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs are what Rhode Island needs, and they are what marijuana legalization would provide. A 2014 Open Doors Report estimated between $21.5 million and $82 million in tax revenue for the state. Another report from 2010 by Harvard economist Jeffrey A. Miron estimated that Rhode Island spends $40.5 million annually fighting pot.

That means between $62 million and $122.5 million dollars annually both saved and earned to plug that $200 million deficit, just from legal marijuana sales directly. That isn�t even counting the additional taxes from increased retail sales of smoking accessories, such as glassware and tobacco wraps, plus new payroll tax revenue off hundreds or thousands of newly formed jobs in the industry. Tourism would probably increase as well, bringing in even more dollars to our beautiful state.

So even conservatively thinking, we would be looking at enough revenue to at least halfway fill our deficit, potentially even much more than that. Sound too good to be true? Just look at Colorado, and see how it has fared since legalization in 2012.

Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year, plus saved most if not all of the $145 million the Harvard report estimated it spent each year fighting marijuana. Crime and motor vehicle incidents are down. Tourism is way up, and while Colorado saw an 8 percent unemployment rate in 2012, it now sits at 4.1 percent and continues to drop.

Legal pot has created thousands of jobs for growers, trimmers, tenders, bakers, and chocolatiers, as well as numerous jobs wholesaling, distributing and retailing the products out to the market. These are jobs, plain and simple.

Rhode Island could easily reap the same benefits, with just a little common sense. Hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs for Rhode Islanders would be created immediately upon introduction of the new industry. More jobs would presumably follow, as more and more people switched over from black-market purchases to retail, taxable sales. Greater demand creates a need for a larger supply chain, and more jobs are created to fill the void.

As it sits now, marijuana is bought and sold on the black market at an astonishing rate, unregulated, and with criminals in charge of both quality control and profits. Some $40.5 million is spent annually fighting a plant 50 percent of legal aged Rhode Islanders have used in the past year, according to a 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

It is easier for children to get marijuana than alcohol or tobacco, simply because pot is so readily available on the black market. Legalization, regulation, and taxation would keep marijuana out of the hands of children, keep the money made out of the hands of the criminals, and straight into the taxpayers pocket.

Come on, Rhode Island, let�s be the model for legal marijuana on the East Coast. Colorado has shown it can be done, with enormous benefit for both the state and its residents. The time for Rhode Island to act is now. Let�s lead common sense east of the Mississippi. Rhode Island deserves to shine.

Jim Aubin, of North Smithfield, is a member of Common Sense Citizen, which he formed to fight for legalization of marijuana in Rhode Island.
