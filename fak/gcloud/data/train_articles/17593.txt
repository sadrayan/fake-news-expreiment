All Seahawks players stand during the national anthem against Rams
Just one week after nine Seattle Seahawks players remained seated during the national anthem against the Indianapolis Colts, the entire Seahawks team stood during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” ahead of Sunday’s matchup against the Rams in Los Angeles.

The Seahawks defensive line, who sat against the Colts, all stood with interlocked arms on Sunday. The Rams also locked arms during the national anthem while linebacker Robert Quinn raised a fist.

Here’s a closer look at Seattle during the anthem via Dusty Lane of Q13 FOX:

Defensive end Michael Bennett, who pledged to sit during the national anthem for the entirety of the 2017 NFL season to protest social injustices, also joined his teammates in standing on Sunday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. This marks the first time that Bennett has stood for the national anthem this season.

Two weeks prior, the Seahawks remained in the locker room during the national anthem following the remarks from President Trump, who urged NFL owners to fire players who chose to kneel or sit in protest.

While it’s unclear if Seattle will continue standing throughout the season, the team has made it apparent they will stick together.
