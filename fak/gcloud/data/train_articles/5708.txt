Research Report for 2015/2016



Professor Patrick Hartigan continued his research into the formation of stars, stellar jets, laboratory astrophysics, emission nebulae, and the physics of shock waves in 2015. Non-technical summaries of main research papers and a full list of publications are available on the Web. This research page, with active links, is mirrored at http://sparky.rice.edu/~hartigan.

Extrasolar Planets and Star Spots: Led by Rice faculty member Chris Johns-Krull, Hartigan and a team of scientists and students from Rice and Lowell Observatory continued a search for radial velocity perturbations that might be caused by planets around young stars. Sensitive searches for older planets have turned up many such objects, but finding them around young stars is difficult because starspots, which are common when stars are young, often mimic the radial velocity signatures of planets. Our most recent data show an intriguing signal in the infrared velocity curves of one object. There is clearly something going on within a few stellar radii of the star, and we are exploring the different ways we might explain the data. The project makes use of data from telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Mauna Kea, and McDonald Observatory.

Laboratory Experiments: Hartigan continued a collaboration with scientists at Los Alamos, Rochester, Imperial College, and AWE to study shock waves in collimated jets using high-powered lasers. Funded by the DOE, one project uses the Omega laser to launch jets and observe what happens when strong shock waves intersect. A separate project explores what happens to shock waves in a plasma where magnetic field strengths are large. We completed the intersecting shock work at Omega last year, and have submitted a paper summarizing the several years of work to the Astrophysical Journal. Part of Rice graduate student Andy Liao's MS thesis described numerical work related to a new experimental design of a planetary magnetosphere. We obtained the first data with this platform last year, and have also initiated a new series of experiments in collaboration with C. Kuranz at the University of Michigan to study magnetized accretion columns. As part of these efforts we have been characterizing the parameter space of density and velocity to determine where experiments will see the onset of shock waves, and where magnetic fields have a dynamical effect. We will be exploring new plasma physics codes that incorporate multiple fluids in the coming year as a tool to aid in the experimental designs.

Massive Star Forming Regions: Hartigan completed a large work related to molecular hydrogen emission in the Carina star-formation region in collaboration with Megan Reiter and Nathan Smith at Arizona, and John Bally in Colorado. The survey, just published in the Astronomical Journal (2015, AJ 149, 101), provides a broad overview of the photodissociation regions throughout the entire nebula. Additional data exists on the CygOB2 and IC 1396 region. and undergraduate Scott Carlsten is analyzing those to determine the degree to which the observed spatial offsets between the optical and infrared emission depend upon the ambient ultraviolet irradiation field. This work, combined with numerical models, will comprise Scott's undergraduate senior thesis.

ALMA Studies of Photodissociation Regions: With Rice assistant professor Andrea Isella, Hartigan is obtaining deep maps of a bright region of photodissociation in the Carina Nebula at millimeter and sub-mm wavelengths with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile. The array has recently been configured to operate at high enough frequencies to observe emission from the 600-micron line of C I. Together with existing H2 observations and new ALMA CO and CS maps of the region, we will have the first high-resolution maps that trace gas from where it is molecular deep within the dark cloud, to its atomic stage, to where it becomes ionized at the dissociation front. This process occurs in all regions of massive star formation, and we will be able to observe it in exquisite detail once the data arrive later this spring.

Numerical Simulations of Jets and Shock Fronts: Hartigan and ex-Rice undergraduate Anna Wright identified a means to measure magnetic fields in shock waves by only using observed emission line ratios and a resolved cooling distance. This work is the culmination of several years of effort, and was published this year (2015, Astrophysical Journal 811, 12). Motivated by the results, we have obtained observing time on the adaptive optics system with the 4-m telescope SOAR in the southern hemisphere. The observations should commence sometime later this year.

Hartigan has also been collaborating with professor A. Frank and University of Rochester graduate student Eddie Hansen to develop models of magnetohydrodynamic flows of pulsed supersonic jets, and to investigate the intersection surfaces of overlapping bow shocks. Two refereed papers resulted from this work in 2015, one published in the Astrophysical Journal (2015, ApJ 800, 41), another in High Energy Density Physics (2015, HEDP 17, 135). Another paper that compares the simulation results directly with observations from the Hubble Space Telescope is nearing completion, and we will also be working on another paper that compares non-LTE emission line cooling routines in 3-D codes with those predicted from steady-state 1-D codes.

Campus Observatory Activities: It was a busy year at the campus observatory, with two large events that both garnered a great deal of public interest and press coverage. In late June, the planets Jupiter and Venus were very close in the evening sky and made for a beautiful sight for several weeks. We opened the observatory on the night of closest approach, and once the skies cleared one of the visitors was able to obtain a series of photos of the pair as they set over the Houston skyline. Hartigan later connected these into a time lapse movie, and also created a popular website to describe the event, and a more detailed description that sets the conjunctions into a wider historical perspective.

The second major event was the total lunar eclipse in late September, notable because it occurred near the time of closest approach of the Moon to the Earth (the press calls this a `supermoon'. I learned that the opposite of it is a `mini-moon', ha). There is not much of an effect from the Moon being close to the Earth, but it was a nice long eclipse at a convenient time of the evening. Unfortunately it was also cloudy... But attendees still enjoyed a visit to the dome and hopefully got something out the public lecture. As part of this event, Hartigan put together a summary of all the lunar eclipses that will be visible from the Houston area out to the year 2060.

The Rice University Campus Observatory (RUCO), dedicated in 2002, moved to the roof of Brockman, the new physics building at Rice. The campus telescope continues to be the workhorse for our undergraduate major and nonmajor courses. Instrumentation includes both a spectrograph and a CCD imager for use by students as part of their undergraduate training. Details about current observatory schedules can be found on the observatory website.
