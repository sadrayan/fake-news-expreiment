I think the term “underperforming” is really squishy. If one has exceedingly high standards for education, then every school is always underperforming.

AYP is an odd standard of performance. It required every school to make progress toward 100% proficiency on state tests by 2014. Any school where less than 100% of the students are passing the STAAR/EOC exams would be underperforming by this measure, assuming AYP had been calculated. I’ve scoured the TEA website and can find no evidence that they calculated AYP for the 2012-13 or 2013-14 school years. Most researchers are highly critical of AYP as a measure of performance, so schools that are performing badly by this measure are not necessarily underperforming as most folks understand the term.

In December, TEA released new accountability ratings. Those ratings indicate that 7,831 of the 8,574 campuses either met standard or were not rated. (Early education campuses, for example, cannot be rated because there are not students in tested grades.) Campuses that were rated as “improvement required” or “not rated due to data integrity issues” (namely, Coahoma J.H.) enroll 7.25% of the students in Texas.

Hope this helps,
