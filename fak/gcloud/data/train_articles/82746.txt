Health Effects of Ozone and Particle Pollution
Two types of air pollution dominate in the U.S.: ozone and particle pollution.1 These two pollutants threaten the health and the lives of millions of Americans. Thanks to the Clean Air Act, the U.S. has far less of both pollutants now than in the past. Still, more than 166 million people live in counties where monitors show unhealthy levels of one or both—meaning the air a family breathes could shorten life or cause lung cancer.

So what are ozone and particle pollution?

Ozone Pollution

It may be hard to imagine that the most widespread pollutant in the U.S. is also one of the most dangerous—and invisible. Learn more about ozone.

Particle Pollution

Ever look at dirty truck exhaust? Overwhelming evidence shows that particle pollution—like that coming from that exhaust smoke—can kill. Particle pollution can increase the risk of heart disease, lung cancer and asthma attacks and can interfere with the growth and work of the lungs. Learn more about particle pollution.

Focusing on Children's Health

Children face special risks from air pollution because their lungs are growing and because they are so active. Learn more about children and air pollution.

Disparities in the Impact of Air Pollution

The burden of air pollution is not evenly shared. Poorer people and some racial and ethnic groups are among those who often face higher exposure to pollutants. Learn more about disparities and air pollution.

Living Near Highways

Being in heavy traffic, or living near a road, may be even more dangerous than being in other places in a community. Learn more about living near highways and air pollution.
