​​​​​The building and paving industries in California consume large quantities of aggregate, and future demand for this commodity is expected to increase throughout California. Aggregate materials are essential to modern society, both to maintain the existing infrastructure and to provide for new construction. Map Sheet 52 is a statewide overview of projected future aggregate needs and currently permitted reserves. The purpose of the map is to compare projected aggregate demand for the next 50 years with currently permitted aggregate reserves in various regions of the state. The map also shows the projected years of permitted reserves remaining and highlights regions where less than 10 years of permitted aggregate supply remain. Map Sheet 52 was originally published in 2002 and subsequently updated in 2006 and 2012; this 2018 release is an update of the version published in 2012.
