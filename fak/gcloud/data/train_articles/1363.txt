Our Position: Other States Stand To Benefit From Florida's Success In Regulating Predatory Lenders.

Indeed, North Carolina's General Assembly ranks among the first to seek guidance from the measure that Florida lawmakers approved and Gov. Jeb Bush signed into law.

Because Florida has succeeded in resolving the problem of so-called payday advances -- high-priced loans than can become an extra burden for already cash-strapped consumers -- consumers in other states stand to benefit.

Like most states, North Carolina has a problem with payday-advancers, some greedier than others, who have lured customers with promises of quick, easy cash. But the money comes with steep interest rates and fees that can cost borrowers several hundred percent on an annual basis.

It's no wonder, then, that many consumers get bogged down, often taking on so many advances that they can't hope to repay them.

Thanks to a different approach and some creative thinking, Florida consumers have relief from the burden of such predatory-lending practices. The regulations were carefully negotiated, with ideas gathered from consumer groups and the payday-advance business. The rules provide sensible guidelines: strict limits on the number and dollar amount of loans, rates closer to the mainstream and a degree of consumer responsibility in seeking credit counseling.

North Carolina may well wish to use that approach or select some aspects of it in crafting its own restrictions. Most important, consumers there and elsewhere in the United States need help similar to what Florida borrowers have obtained. Only lawmakers can deliver that essential protection.
