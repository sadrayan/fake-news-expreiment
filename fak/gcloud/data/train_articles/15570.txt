Here is the statement from Winstead PC:

Neither Winstead nor Dan Branch have ever represented the AFL-CIO. The representation of workers’ unions or similar organizations has never been a material portion of our firm’s practice. In those very few instances where our firm did represent any affiliate of a union organization (including the instance you are asking about), the representation consisted of transactional work with respect to investments or federal regulatory work before the Energy Department.
