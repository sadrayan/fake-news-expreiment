Trump and Real Housewife Host Fundraiser for Crist
We have some rich friends, honey.

Speaking of Gov. Charlie Crist's fundraising skills...

This weekend for $1,000 a pop, Crist fans in Sag Harbor, New York, can attend a party hosted by his celebrity pals: Jill Zarin, one of The Real Housewives of New York City, and Donald Trump.

Zarin is close friends with Crist's wife, Carole Rome, who never really gave up her New York social life when she wedded Florida's most unlikely bachelor. (Here at the Juice, we were betting Crist was more the Clay Aiken type, but that was just us.)
