Klein Calls For JCOPE Investigation Of Allegation Against Him
Independent Democratic Conference Leader Jeff Klein on Thursday called for an investigation by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics into the allegation of sexual misconduct made against him by a former legislative aide.

In the letter, Klein points to the attorney he hired after he was initially contacted last week by The Huffington Post about the allegation by Erica Vladimer.

“My attorney conducted a series of interviews with current and former staffers present at the time of the alleged incident, none of whom observed the complained of conduct,” Klein wrote. “These interviews and others showed that I have never engaged in such conduct and have been a proponent and advocate of fair and equal treatment for women, in and outside of the workplace.”

The letter comes after elected officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Senate Minority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, called for an independent investigation into the claim, alleged to have occurred in March 2015.

Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan earlier in the day said in a statement the Senate Ethics Committee did not have the jurisdiction to the review the case.

JCOPE is composed of appointees by the legislative leaders of the Assembly and Senate as well as the governor. Klein himself does not have an appointee on the commission.

The entity, which regulates lobbying and ethics in state government, has come under criticism over the years for the opacity of its rules and processes as well as transparency. The panel previously investigated cases of harassment involving Assemblyman Vito Lopez and Assemblyman Dennis Gabryszak.
