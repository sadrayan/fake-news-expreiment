Hello from Austin. I write hoping you can help us accurately describe the website moviecastingcall.org where I spotted information on casting calls for Star Wars movies.

Weâ€™re gauging the accuracy of this web post, which seems to me to be fake news at moment.

THANKS.

My website posts accurate information. That link you gave me is a hoax. All you have to do is read their disclaimer - http://wbn12.com/disclaimer/

My website is an informative and resourceful website, which is geared specifically to posting Disney and Marvel casting and auditions information. The link you sent me is one of several that has resurfaced, making false claims that the next Star Wars film will be shooting in Texas. The same hoax has been posted over the years, making the same claim, but stating filming would take place in other areas of the United States.
