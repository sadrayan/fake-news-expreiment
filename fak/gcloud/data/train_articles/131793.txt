Drunk school principal defecates in front of students during pledge of allegiance
Springfield, OH | An intoxicated school principal at Franklin Middle School was arrested this morning after literally defecating in front of hundreds of students during the pledge of allegiance.

Andrew Whitmore, 53, was visibly under the influence of alcohol when he decided to throw down his pants and defecate on the schoolyard in front of bewildered students and school personnel.

Whitmore also embarrassed himself even more after losing his balance and falling to the ground in his own pile of feces before eventually being carried away by local police officers.

“He started yelling something about Trump being a racist pig and a fascist cunt or something,” one student told local reporters.

“He dropped down his pants and everybody was shocked, but then he started to crap on the grass, fell down and started puking all over himself. It was truly disturbing,” said another student, visibly disgusted.

Franklin Middle School secretary, Hillary Johnson, says she was shocked by the behavior of the principal and had never seen him this mad

Highly intoxicated

Whitmore later admitted to police officers that he had spent his night drinking and smoking crystal meth.

“He said the situation with Donald Trump and the national anthem had really pissed him off and that he didn’t remember doing the things he had done,” Deputy Sheriff Tom Hannity told local reporters.

“He allegedly had a blackout and does not remember defecating in front of the whole school,” he explained.

Mr. Whitmore made local headlines last June when he allegedly uploaded a faceless video of himself masturbating on Facebook at 3 am, telling President Donald Trump to “suck on his cock” before taking down the video hours later, claiming his account had been hacked.

Whitmore was arrested on charges of public intoxication and faces six counts of obscenity and could face up to 18 months in jail believe legal experts.
