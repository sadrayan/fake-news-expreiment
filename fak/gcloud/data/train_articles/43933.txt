State Smart: Federal Funds in Florida
How Federal Money Gets to Florida

There are four basic ways that federal dollars flow into Florida, impacting you and your neighbors.

1. Federal Dollars in the Florida Budget

Every state budget in the U.S. relies on money from the federal government, and many local budgets do too. Nationally, the percentage of state revenues that come from federal dollars jumped from 27.8% to 35.5% between 2008 and 2010, as Recovery Act money trickled down. In 2013, the most recent year on record, federal money made up 30% of revenues collected by the 50 states.

In 2013 Florida got $24.2 billion dollars from the federal government, which is 31.5% of its total revenue.

That $24.2 billion funds public assistance programs like Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and Community Development Block Grants.

Here's a breakdown for some of that money. To see these amounts over time and compare them to other states, visit the Federal Priorities Database Grants to States dataset.

On top of the federal money going to the Florida state budget, an additional $4.6 billion went directly to local governments within the state. This money funds everything from Community Development Block Grants to housing and disaster assistance to public transit improvements.

2. Federal Aid to Florida Residents

In 2014, Florida residents received about $138.3 billion in direct benefits from the federal government. That's about $6,950 per person.

Most of that money is Social Security and Medicare benefits, but it also includes food stamp benefits, unemployment benefits, and federal education assistance like Pell Grants.

3. Federal Contracts in Florida

In 2014 the U.S. paid about $451.5 billion to vendors to perform contracts ranging from supplying the military with weapons to building websites. These contractors performed work in every single state, including $13.8 billion worth in Florida, about $692 per resident.

Agency-wise, the biggest spender in Florida was Department of Defense, which oversaw 65% of federal contract money in the state. Rounding out the top five list are Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration.

In the last five years, the total amount of money spent on federal contracts in Florida has decreased. The Federal Priorities Database has details and maps comparing Florida contracts to the rest of the country:

4. Federal Employees in Florida

227,647 people in Florida worked for the federal government in 2014. The average annual compensation for these workers - in other words, wages plus benefits - was $91,189. When compared to the average compensation for all jobs in the state, that's higher.

In total, those 227,647 federal workers in Florida received $20.8 billion in compensation, about 4% of all wages and benefits earned by people who worked in the state. Compare that to Washington D.C., where federal workers represent 38% of all earned compensation , and Hawaii, where federal workers earn 20% of all compensation in the state.
