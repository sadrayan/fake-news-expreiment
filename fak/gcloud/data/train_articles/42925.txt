The Court continued its practice of deferring to congressional factual findings in reviewing the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 Pub. L. 102–385 , see Tables for classification]. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. 512 U.S. 622 (1994) (Turner I) and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. 520 U.S. 180 (1997) (Turner II). At issue in the Turner cases was’ legislative finding that, absent mandatory carriage rules, the continued viability of local broadcast television would be ‘seriously jeopardized’. The Turner I Court recognized that as an institution, ‘is far better equipped than the judiciary to “amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data” bearing upon an issue as complex and dynamic as that presented here’, 512 U.S. at 665 66 . Although the Court recognized that ‘the deference afforded to legislative findings does “not foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearing on an issue of constitutional law,” ’ its ‘obligation to exercise independent judgment when First Amendment rights are implicated is not a license to reweigh the evidence de novo, or to replace’ factual predictions with our own. Rather, it is to assure that, in formulating its judgments,has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.’. Id. at 666.
