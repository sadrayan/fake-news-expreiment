Senate Debates Rewrite of '78 Law That Created Secret Intelligence Court
The bill would require that the secret FISA court approve procedures for intercepting foreign nationals' e-mails and telephone calls. Spying on U.S. citizens, including those overseas, would require individual warrants from the same court.

It also would establish the FISA law, and the secret court it created, as the final legal authority on government spying. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), the party's presumptive presidential nominee, have cited the exclusivity provision as the main reason they supported the bill. They said it is a rejection of President Bush's stance that his wartime powers gave him authority to approve the defunct warrantless wiretapping program.

The telecom immunity provision continues to be the bill's source of conflict.

"This bill will effectively and unjustifiably grant immunity to companies that allegedly participated in an illegal wiretapping program," Feingold said.

Under the bill, the nation's largest telecom companies could have the more than 40 lawsuits they face dismissed by a U.S. district judge if they prove they received written assurance from the Bush administration that the spying was legal.

Supporters and opponents of the legislation consider the court review a formality. Rockefeller's committee has released a report showing that the companies received such letters earlier this decade.

In yesterday's preliminary vote, 31 Democrats and one independent voted to debate the bill.
