What the Friday: World's first hotel for sheep opens in Japan
The life of the ludicrously rich in Japan is indeed tough. You get to go on exotic vacations constantly, but each trip requires you to find a house sitter for your pet sheep. Thankfully, though, the well-off Japanese businessman has a new, elegant solution: Hotel Sheep Apparently, owning a pet sheep is the latest luxury for the wealthy and fashionable in Japan. The animals are prized for their gentle demeanor. And because they're insanely cute and cuddly, they're adored to the point where luxury away accommodations are a must.Lest you think this is just some hastily constructed sheep shelter, the folks at the extraordinarily opulent Hotel Sheep have created a marketing video for you to watch explaining the hotel's amenities. Sheep parents can rest easy knowing that their pets' rooms are equipped with television sets.Sadly, though, the hotel cannot accommodate your pet ram. "Ram can be harsh, to accommodate sadly we cannot," explains the presentation.(Note: Before you make your reservations, Tecca regrets to inform you that Hotel Sheep is, in fact, a late April Fool's joke. Still, if you ask really nicely, we're sure a number of really nice hotels will accommodate the globe-trotting traveler with pet sheep.)[via BornRich
