The Seattle Office of Labor Standards Announces 2019 Minimum Wage Increases for All Employers

The Seattle Office of Labor Standards (OLS) announces that the 2019 minimum wage for all large employers (employing more than 500 workers worldwide) will be $16.00 per hour. In past years, there was a two-tier system under which large employers that contributed toward individual medical benefits paid a lower minimum wage than those that did not. This two-tier system ends in 2019.

Also, beginning on January 1, 2019, small employers (with 500 or fewer employees) must pay at least $15.00 per hour. Small employers can meet this requirement by paying no less than $12.00 per hour in wages and contributing at least $3.00 per hour toward an employee's medical benefits and/or reported tips.

Seattle's Minimum Wage Ordinance went into effect on April 1, 2015. The Minimum Wage Ordinance applies to overtime-eligible employees who work in Seattle.
