Candidate Tracking System

The Florida Department of State's Candidate Tracking System tracks candidates throughout the elections process presenting candidate status, campaign finance activity, personal photos and contact information. This information is updated regularly as candidates update their information.

The Division of Elections offers this tracking system as an unofficial reference of candidates for federal, state, and multicounty offices. Although federal candidates are required to register with the Federal Election Commission once they receive contributions or make expenditures in excess of $5000, federal candidates who may or may not have reached this threshold but have notified the Division that they wish to have their name and information placed on the Division's website prior to qualifying for office are listed as a courtesy to the candidate and voters. For information on county or municipal candidates, please contact your local Supervisor of Elections.
