If you would like to know who has given to the Clinton Foundation -- which, as Hillary Clinton's announcement of a presidential run approaches, is an increasingly popular past time -- the Foundation has a page that will let you do so. It's here, with donors separated into groups based on the range they've given over the history of the organization.

The problem, though, is that if you're looking for, say, Jim Johnson, who you think may have given a few hundred dollars a few years ago, you'd have to peruse hundreds of pages of entries in order to find him. (This is not unintentional, of course.) Or, a bit more importantly, perhaps you're wondering if the government of Algeria gave, while Clinton led the State Department. We can't tell you the 'when' of the donations, but we can make it easier for you to find the 'who' and the 'how much.'

So without further ado: Search. (All typos are from the original Foundation data.)

Some things you might want to search for:

Clinton

Lewinski (note the spelling)

The names of sitting elected officials

Rush Limbaugh

Since all of the donations are given in ranges, it's hard to tell specifically how much was given. But the number of contributions and the amounts put the range somewhere between $700 million and $2 billion. The breakdown of donations above $25,000 looks like this.

We've called out the $25 million-plus folks separately, because we figured that was the least we could do for them.
