Improving the Lives of Farm Animals
Together, we can reduce the suffering of animals raised for meat, eggs and milk.

On factory farms, egg-laying hens are packed into battery cages where they can't even spread their wings. Baby calves are taken from their mothers and confined in pens so small they can barely move and pigs are locked in gestation crates the width and length of their bodies, unable to even turn around. We are working to end this suffering.
