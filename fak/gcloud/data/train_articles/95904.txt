Fact Check: Did the GOP Oppose a Bill Ensuring Military Paychecks During the Shutdown?
“Republicans Just Killed The Bill To Make Sure Troops Get Paid During Shutdown,” or so ran a headline from Addicting Info, flagged as potential fake news by Facebook users.

The article explained how a resolution from Senator Claire McCaskill “would have ensured that pay for military service members and death benefits would not be disrupted.” after the Senate failed to pass a measure to keep the government from shutting down on Friday.

“That sounds reasonable enough, right? Well, not to Mitch McConnell. For some reason, the Kentucky Republican objected to McCaskill’s resolution,” the piece said.

It’s true that McConnell objected to the resolution from McCaskill, but the article fails to mention why.

“I ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration … .that the amendment at the desk providing for continuing appropriations for pay and death benefits for members of the armed services be considered and agreed to,” McCaskill proposed.

When asked if there was a debate over the resolution McConnell spoke up.

“We passed similar legislation during the government shutdown back in 2013. My hope is that we can restore funding for the entire government before this becomes necessary. I’m going to object for tonight, but we’ll discuss again tomorrow.”

Military paychecks are set for February 1. The Senate voted overwhelmingly to end the shutdown on Monday afternoon. If the House follows suit, there will be no disruption to military pay. But if something happens and the legislation does not end up on the president's desk, or legislation similar to the one proposed by McCaskill is not passed then military personnel will have to wait for one or the other to nab their check.

The article is correct but incomplete.
