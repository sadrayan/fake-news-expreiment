The Sporting News Earlier this week, we told you whom TSN experts Paul Attner and Vinnie Iyer are taking in Sunday's big game. Now, it's time to find out who the "real" experts like in Super Bowl 36. Rams or Pats? We threw that one out to Lance Armstrong, Sammy Sosa, Jeb Bush, Vince Carter and a few models. Here's what they had to say: HANK WILLIAMS JR.

Musician

"Rams 30-26 -- only because they're playing inside The House. After the Steelers lost, I kind of lost interest. However, I think a trip to the window in Vegas and getting down on New England plus 14 might help me get over it." CINDY MARGOLIS

Supermodel

"Buy as much Chunky Soup stock as you can. Kurt Warner leads the Rams over the Patriots 31-17." DALE EARNHARDT JR.

NASCAR driver

"It's the Rams, man, because they're from St. Louis -- home of my sponsor, Budweiser. I usually go for the underdogs, but I gotta stick with the St. Louis guys. A score? It doesn't look like the Rams are firing on all eight cylinders and the Pats may not be able to score on offense, so I'll say 27-13." VINCE CARTER

Forward, Toronto Raptors

"Rams 35-14. Four words tell why the Rams will win: Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk." ASHLEY JUDD

Actress

"I'm more concerned with UK vs. Florida on Tuesday night than the Super Bowl outcome (Kentucky beat Florida). I guess I am going more to see Mariah (Carey) and U2 than the game. And maybe eat something good as New Orleans is such a good food town." GORDIE HOWE

Mr. Hockey

"Rams 31-13. My original pick was the Saskatchewan Roughriders!" LANCE ARMSTRONG

Tour de France winner

"Rams 31-14. Marshall Faulk, Kurt Warner . . . They were there two years ago and know what it's all about. They won't settle for anything less." BROOKE BURKE

Host of Wild On and Rank on E!

"Rams, Rams, Rams 41-17. Although the Patriots had a great run in the playoffs, the Rams are too tough to beat! Kurt is a true MVP. There's a new Marshall in New Orleans, and his name is Faulk . . . Better luck next year boys!" MIKE PIAZZA

Catcher, New York Mets

"Patriots 27-24. Adam Vinatieri will win it for the Patriots with a minute left to go. This is their year. They can't be beaten." ELI MANNING

Quarterback, Ole Miss

"St. Louis 24-13. I think Marshall Faulk will have a pretty big day playing in his back yard." STEPHON MARBURY

Guard, Phoenix Suns

"St. Louis 32-10. Marshall Faulk will run and run and run and run." JEB BUSH

Governor, Florida

"New England 27, St. Louis 24. I went to high school with Bill Belichick. He was smart back then, and he's smarter now." JAROME IGINLA

NHL's leading goal scorer

"New England 27, St. Louis 24. I like to cheer for the underdog and would love to see an upset." JOHNNY DAMON

Outfielder, Boston Red Sox

"Patriots all the way. The way I see it, the sports gods are back with Boston and New England and I'm also a Boston guy now. So go Pats!" MELANIE GRIFFITH

Actress

"Rams 34-17. The only team that can beat the Rams are the Lambs." JOHN ONDRASIK

Lead singer, Five For Fighting

"Rams 28-13. Marshall Faulk will take over -- as usual." BOB HOLDEN

Governor, Missouri

"Rams 31-17. They're one of the greatest teams to play in the modern era. I'm looking forward to my lobster and clam chowder. I love lobster!" MIKE DAVIS

Basketball coach, Indiana Hoosiers

"St. Louis 42-25. You can't keep up with St. Louis on the turf." RAY ALLEN

Guard, Milwaukee Bucks

"Patriots 27, Rams 14. Since I live in Connecticut, I'm going to have to go with the Patriots. I think the defense is going to step up and hold down the Rams' offense, which will shock them a little bit since their confidence comes from their offense." JULIE FOUDY

U.S. women's soccer team captain

"St. Louis Rams. Gotta go with my former Los Angeles boys. I just wish they would have won a little more when they were in southern California. Maybe if we throw Astroturf down, they might come back." LATRELL SPREWELL

Guard, New York Knicks

"St. Louis. They are the best team in football -- hands down. They are way too talented." CHRIS SIMMS

Quarterback, Texas Longhorns

"New England. They really played the Rams the first time around and had some opportunities to win that game. With the Patriots being such big underdogs, I think that will be a big motivation for them going in. I just have a gut feeling they can win." LeROY NEIMAN

Artist

"Patriots 24, Rams 17. As a New Yorker, I favor the Pats because of their strong link to the New York Jets going back to coach Bill Parcells." DARIN ERSTAD

Outfielder, Anaheim Angels

"Pats, 31-27. Do you believe in miracles?" JASON RICHARDSON

Forward, Golden State Warriors

"Rams, 41-10. It won't even be close. The Rams are the Lakers of football." BRANFORD MARSALIS

Musician

"Rams 42-17. Everyone is talking about the fact that the last two times the Pats made the Super Bowl, it was in New Orleans. This is the second time in five years. Blah blah blah. The one point they forget to mention was that both of those games were blowouts, and the Pats were on the receiving end. This time, it will be no different. Unlike the Steelers, the Rams have a good special teams unit. And they will win. In a romp." RICK PITINO

Basketball coach, Louisville Cardinals

"New England. They remind me of the Amazin' Mets. They may not be the most talented team, but they're a team of destiny." KENYON MARTIN

Forward, New Jersey Nets

"Rams 30-17. Could be a whippin'." MARK CUBAN

Owner, Dallas Mavericks

"35-12 Rams; 14 -- The number of times they show Kurt Warner's wife during the game." DAN RATHER

Anchor, CBS Evening News

"New England, 29-26, OT. Yes, the Rams could and perhaps should turn this into one of their trademark close-the-gates-of-mercy, roll-up-the-score routs with something like a 45-16 final. But especially with Kurt Warner and Orlando Pace ailing and vulnerable, the hunch here is St. Louis may instead end up singing the "Bogged Down in the Red Zone Blues." So: New England rides inspired defense and special teams play, plus the long ball, for a chorus of "Oh Beautiful for Patriots Dream" in the first Super Bowl overtime game ever." SHERYL SWOOPES

Forward, Houston Comets

"New England 21-14. New England is the underdog and I like rooting for the underdog. I really think the Patriots are going to surprise a lot of people. But to win this game, they are going to have to keep it low-scoring." STEVE FRANCIS

Guard, Houston Rockets

"Rams 35, Pats 26. Two MVPs on the same team will be too much to handle." PRESTON SHUMPERT

Forward, Syracuse Orangemen

"St. Louis 28, New England 14. The Greatest Show On Turf has too much speed and too many weapons." JOHN FEINSTEIN

Author

"I'll pick the Patriots 24-20 for the simple reason that they're a better story. I'll get emotional about the Super Bowl when Army and Navy get there." ALLAN HOUSTON

Guard, New York Knicks

"St. Louis, 30-17. The Rams are too experienced and too potent on offense." JIM NABORS

aka Gomer Pyle

"Rams is my pick. I sang the national anthem for them for all the years George Allen was coach and I still root for them." KEN GRIFFEY JR.

Outfielder, Cincinnati Reds

"New England 31, St. Louis 17. I think the Patriots' defense will keep the Rams under 21 points." CASEY CLAUSEN

Quarterback, Tennessee Volunteers

"Rams 31-10. Rams' speed on offense will be too much for the Patriots' defense, especially on turf." JERRY STACKHOUSE

Forward, Detroit Pistons

"Rams 42-10. The Rams just have good offensive flow. Besides, doesn't New England have a quarterback controversy all of a sudden?" JOHN MCCAIN

U.S. Senator, Arizona

"Rams 28-10." BILLY GILMAN

Country singer

"Patriots 28-17. Nobody can beat the red, white & blue." ANTONIO McDYESS

Forward, Denver Nuggets

"Rams 28-7. That offense is too good. They can score too many points. DICK VITALE

Announcer, ESPN

"St. Louis 31, New England 17. While my heart says it would be great to have upset city, and my son-in-law Thomas Krug played football at Notre Dame with Patriots fullback Marc Edwards -- in fact, Marc was with our family at the Super Bowl last year -- I think Marshall Faulk and company will be too much for New England, especially on the turf." NATE DOGG

Rapper

"New England 20-18. Because New England is the underdog, and I always go with the underdog." TROY MURPHY

Forward, Golden State Warriors

"St. Louis 24-17. St. Louis has a big advantage because they play on the turf during the regular season." RUSTY WALLACE

NASCAR driver

"Naturally, I've gotta be pulling for my home team, the St. Louis Rams. Just gotta. It'll probably be really close or be an absolute blowout. Somebody either laps the field or it's just by inches at the flag. Isn't that the way that it usually goes? I'm pulling for St. Louis and I just have a feeling that the score's gonna be 23-17 with the Rams on top. Mark that down." TONI KUKOC

Forward, Atlanta Hawks

"Patriots 33-28. I like the underdog. Hopefully, Drew Bledsoe has another good game." CATHERINE BELL

Actress, JAG

"Patriots, 20-17. I always like to go with the long shot." JOHN LUCAS

Head coach, Cleveland Cavaliers

"New England wins 31-24. I pull for the underdog" CARROT TOP

Guard, New Jersey Nets

"Rams 35-24. Could be a magic carpet ride in the Dome." FABIO

"Rams, big. Kurt Warner, MVP." SCOTT TUROW

Author

"Rams 38, Pats 30. The Patriots' success against the Steelers rushing was impressive, but St. Louis has too many weapons. Watching the Rams' second half against the Eagles healed some of the wounds from my acts of seppuku as a Bears fan, inflicted the week before." JENNY THOMPSON

Olympic swimming star

Guard, Phoenix Suns
