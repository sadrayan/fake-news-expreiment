Gardner, please include the below from me. Appreciate it.

The Senator has been honored to visit the Rio Grande Valley, one specific region in the state, for 4 events since taking office, and looks forward to more. Since being sworn in, he has traveled to 38 Texas cities for 118 events.

Can you provide detail on the valley part?

6:20 p.m.

Of course, below – and I made a typo – it's 3 events– and please make the point about all of the events across the state to make it a fair comparison. Thanks!

September 3, 2013

McAllen – DPS Border tour

McAllen – Roundtable with landowners to discuss border/immigration policy

Mission – Rio Grande Partnership lunch

6:35 p.m.

I think the fair comparison to make is that the Senator has been to Iowa 4 times and travels back to Texas almost every weekend, where he's done 118 events in 38 Texas cities since being sworn in. And, yes, he's specifically done 3 events in the Rio Grande Valley and looks forward to doing more.
