I should have mentioned that the all funds tab excludes debt service and capital projects because revenues per student are a meaningless measures for these two funds given the purpose of these funds.

I made an adjustment for the recapture in the attached file. I noticed a query issue that prevented adding this adjustment in the prior spreadsheet. However, the overall percentage of districts receiving less revenue per student for all funds did not change.

Thanks,

Tom

I am plugging away on that fact check. Is there a chance TASBO or another group has already explained in plain English why some districts are getting less per student now than before? I would be happy to review/cite the appropriate publication.

I think the Texas Supreme Court pretty well summed up the Byzantine nature of the school finance funding formulas. The calculations are so convoluted that there is no simple plain English explanation to provide to laggards in achieving revenue increases since post 2011. L funding cuts. As more districts have moved off of a target revenue amount since 2006, the district's are at the mercy of the Byzantine revenue calculations.

The increases in average state aid per student have been minimum year over year since 2011. In reference to the average revenues per student, half of the enrolled students moved to a per student funding level that was less than the average and the other half to amount that exceeds the average. Therefore given the minimum increases in per student funding there are a number of districts below the average in 2015 or laggards and therefore below where they were before the 5.4 billion reduction in public ed funding.

Thanks,

TEA figures do not match the spreadsheet for total revenues per pupil. I made adjustments because total revenues per student from all funds is a not a particularly informative or useful number when it includes revenues for payment on bonded debt in the debt service fund and revenues for multi-year construction projects in the capital projects fund. Also, 20% of districts have no bonded debt and a majority of districts have no current activity being accounted for in the capital projects fund and so the remaining revenues in the dataset I forwarded to you normalizes comparisons for the 1,024 districts.

Accordingly, my calculations of total revenues per student only includes general fund and special revenue fund and excluded revenues from the these two funds to avoid inflating revenues per student that are available for daily instructional and operational activities. I also deducted robin hood payments.
