In 503 Days Between Trayvon Dying and the Zimmerman Trial Verdict, 10,865 Blacks Have Been Murdered by OTHER BLACKS

I wrote this back in April of last year:

To be exact, the shameful truth is that 93% of African-American murders are committed by other African-Americans. That is breathtakingly awful when you consider how incensed the African-American community is about the Trayvon tragedy, no matter what you believe about Zimmerman’s guilt. Let’s do the gruesome math, not out of morbidity, but because it manifests the incredible self-centered insanity of people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. 8,000-9,000 African-Americans are murdered each year. 93% of them by other African-Americans. That’s 7,905 (from average) That’s 21.65 murdered each day by other African-Americans. And these racebaiting culture-hustling microphone-pimps only get riled up when a “White Hispanic” kills an African-American? It’s absolutely shameful.

To update, in the 503 days between Trayvon dying, and today’s verdict, 10,865 African Americans have been murdered by other African-Americans.

I was so shocked, I had to double check my numbers.

[Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly reported the number of days between the altercation and the verdict as 513 days instead of the correct number of 503 days. We deeply regret this error and thank Amy Sherman from the Miami Herald/Politifact for straightening us out.]

UPDATE:

Politifact’s hit piece is here. My response is here.
