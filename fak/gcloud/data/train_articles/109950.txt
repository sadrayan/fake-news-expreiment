Canadians are filling potholes with flowers!
May 26, 2015

Potholes are as common in Canada as, well, moose? I guess. I don’t know, they’re pretty common.

Anyway, with the cold weather behind us for a few months, the rise (or fall) of the pothole is a struggle that all Canadians are all too common with, but a new trend in Canada has people making potholes into something we can all enjoy: flower pots.

I don’t know how long people have been doing it, it’s certainly something that I’ve never seen before, but now people are doing it all across the country and it just warms my little heart.

It’s happening in Moosejaw:

And Edmonton

Actually there’s a lot of things going in Edmonton’s potholes:

Have you spotted any more of these pothole flower boxes?
