It’s been going viral all over the internet tonight: George Soro’s son Robert was married to Melissa Schiff.

This is true. The couple split a few years ago.

But is Melissa Adam Schiff’s sister?

According to the New York Times, in 1992:

Melissa Robin Schiff, the daughter of Marlene S. Schiff of New York and the late Dr. Haskel Schiff, was married May 5 to Robert Daniel Soros, a son of Annaliese Soros and George Soros, both of New York.

But the California congressman was born in Mass, not NY.

His parents were not Marlene and Haskel. According to his bio, they were Edward and Sherrill Ann.

Schiff was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, the son of Edward and Sherrill Ann (Glovsky) Schiff

So Adam Schiff is NOT the brother of George Soro’s ex daughter in law.

We do not know if they’re distantly related.
