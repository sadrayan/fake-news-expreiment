Perry markets existing law as "new plan" on dropout crisis New video highlights Bill White's efforts to cut the dropout rate

HOUSTON -- Last week, after months of hammering from Bill White, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and others, Rick Perry re-released a so-called "plan" to reduce the dropout rate. He'd make having a driver's license contingent on enrollment in school or GED classes.

"Unfortunately for Rick Perry, this law has been on the books since 1989 and he's been responsible for enforcing it. Only a career politician would try to sell a law already in existence as his own slick new idea," said Katy Bacon, campaign spokesperson. "We need a governor who's actually going to work on the dropout crisis instead of dredging up election year sound bites."

About 3 in 10 Texas high school students do not graduate from high school or get a GED within 4 years. The Academy of Medicine, Engineering & Science of Texas estimated that every hour of every school day an astounding 93 students drop out of Texas schools.

The Bill White for Texas campaign released a web ad today highlighting Bill White's longstanding commitment to cutting the dropout rate. Communities across Texas have adopted a successful solution that Bill White helped pioneer, an annual "Reach Out to Dropouts" walk in which volunteers go door to door to bring students back to school.
