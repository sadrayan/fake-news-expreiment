Senator David Perdue Statement on President Obama Decision to Remove Cuba from U.S. State Sponsors of Terror List
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) released the following statement regarding President Obama’s decision to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism:

“I am deeply concerned that President Obama continues to embolden our enemies and empower dictators from Russia to Iran, and now Cuba. Cuba must prove it is willing to change its destructive and oppressive behavior before the United States removes it as a state sponsor of terrorism.

“The Castro regime, time and again, has violated international norms. In 2013, Cuba secretly shipped 240 metric tons of weapons to North Korea, violating a U.N. embargo, it provides safe harbor for American fugitives, including one on the FBI ‘Most Wanted Terrorist’ list, and it continues to support radical groups in the region, such as the FARC in Colombia.

“President Obama’s decision sends the wrong message about our democratic values as a nation. President Obama is embracing Castro and turning his back on the Cuban people who remain oppressed under this communist dictatorship.

“I look forward to using my role on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to scrutinize the President’s decision rigorously.”
