Focus on Cost
Although the United States performs well on several cancer- specific quality indicators, including cervical and breast cancer screening and relative five-year survival for breast and colorectal cancers, other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries are able to achieve similar or better outcomes at a fraction of the cost.92,93 Indeed, a 2014 population-based analysis of American women with breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ found no relationship between spending and adherence with quality measures or between spending and survival.94 Direct medical costs of cancer care (now at $86 billion annually32) are not the largest portion of U.S. healthcare spending, but they are among the fastest growing. Considering current levels of cancer incidence, survival, and cost, cancer care expenses could increase by as much as 39 percent between 2010 and 2020.95

A cancer diagnosis can result in serious financial consequences for patients and their families. A 2013 study found cancer patients to be nearly three times more likely to experience bankruptcy than people without cancer.96 Faced with high out-of-pocket costs, some patients even decide to forgo or prematurely discontinue important cancer treatments.97 And financial burdens of cancer care are often felt long after active treatment. Nearly half experience problems living on their household income, and financial hardship drives non-adherence to prescribed treatment.98 Difficulties may extend into survivorship, with young adults experiencing wage and productivity losses after an experience with cancer.9 The so-called financial toxicity of cancer treatment is a major area of concern for patients and their physicians.99-101

Drug Costs

Drugs continue to be a major focus in the discussion about cost and value in cancer care, and increasingly, this is a conversation about specialty pharmaceuticals. Specialty pharmaceuticals are those that represent significant cost, require special handling, or are part of complex treatment regimens. A large number of oncology drugs fall into this category. As treatment evolves to more targeted drugs that fight specific molecular abnormalities in a patient’s tumor—and the prospect of the need for combinations of these drugs grows—concerns about affordability, both for patients and the U.S. healthcare system overall, are growing.

In the past year, alarming statistics about drug costs have emerged:

The average monthly cost of a branded cancer treatment has more than doubled to $10,000 over the past decade. 22

Cancer drug costs are steadily increasing over time, with some approaching nearly $40,000 per patient per month in 2014 dollars. 102

Seven of the 10 most expensive drugs reimbursed by Medicare are cancer drugs (Table 4).

Seven U.S. drugs cost more than $100,000 annually, up from only four drugs in 2010 103 ; four of seven of these drugs are used in cancer treatment.

; four of seven of these drugs are used in cancer treatment. Targeted drugs are especially expensive, reaching up to $270,000 annually per patient. 104

The United States spends $37.2 billion annually on cancer drugs and supportive therapies, more than 40 percent of worldwide expenditures. 22

In 2012, spending on specialty pharmaceuticals reached $87 billion in the United States and is on track to account for 50 percent of drug spending by 2019. 105

Spending on oral oncology drugs is also growing with a 37 percent increase in average quarterly spending over five years, from $940 million in 2006 to $1.4 billion in 2011 (in 2012 dollars).106

Paradoxically, the price of a drug seems to have little relation to its demonstrated efficacy. For example, researchers point to tyrosine kinase inhibitors for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.104 The first-generation therapy, imatinib, increased the 10-year survival rate in chronic myeloid leukemia from 20 percent to 85 percent.107 When it was approved in 2001, it carried a price tag of $30,000. By 2012, the price had risen to between $80,000 and $92,000, despite falling development costs and an expanding patient pool. In 2006, a second-generation inhibitor, dasatinib, was approved for use in patients who become resistant to imatinib. Although this and other second-generation inhibitors have demonstrated improvement in early surrogate measures of prognosis, they have not shown an increase in long-term survival. These second-generation inhibitors range from $115,000 to $124,000 per year.104

Increasingly under fire, manufacturers have pointed out that drug prices in oncology reflect the high cost of research, a limited market for highly specialized drugs, and the need to finance future research.108 As the debate over drug prices continues, policymakers are seeking strategies for lowering cost, including value-based reimbursement, enhanced clinical guidelines to minimize variation and waste, and formation of non-profi organizations involved in the manufacturing and delivery of drugs.109

Cost of Care

Although drugs represent one of the fastest growing costs in the healthcare delivery system, they are not the largest contributor to overall spending on cancer care in the United States. UnitedHealthcare recently reported that hospitals and outpatient facilities account for more than half of spending on cancer care.110 The nearly five million cancer-related hospitalizations each year in the United States represent a cost of more than $20 billion,111 and as many as one fifth of those hospitalizations are potentially avoidable.112
