Sanders To Tax Churches!! – USA Newsflash
What do you think about U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders new proposal that would tax Churches and Synagogues at a 90% tax rate to provide more social programs for the poor?

“The American dream has become a nightmare”, Sanders told Fox News ,”let us wage a moral and political war against the billionaires and giant megachurches, whose policies and greed are destroying the middle class of America.

Sanders claims that about only 1% of Church tithes goes to help the poor and that many in the clergy,especially Protestant ministers in the South,use most of the money collected to buy “condos in Florida and hookers.”

“We have seen it even in the Catholic Church”,Sanders continued,”you give people a bunch of money they don’t have to pay taxes on and they just go crazy and start molesting little kids.”

Christian Ministers have denounced this plan, claiming that it is terrible. In addition, the famous evangelist Ray Comfort said “This is a plan inspired by the devil himself.We cannot allow the government to deny a Christian his right to show his love of God by giving God his money.Of course you can’t literally give God your money so they just give it to me to hold for God.”

It is estimated that if you tax the churches in America, the state would generate around $830.5 trillion in annual tax revenue if the exemption was lifted on their $600 trillion in untaxed properties.
