Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney landed another celebrity endorsement over the weekend: Jon Voight.

The actor joined Romney in Pensacola, Fla., on Saturday POLITICO’s Reid Epstein reports.

The "Midnight Cowboy" star's other claim to fame is his daughter, actress Angelina Jolie, who came up in an earlier phone conversation between Voight and Romney, the candidate said.

“I started talking about my five boys,” Romney told the crowd about his chat with the actor. “I said, you know, it’s easier to raise boys than girls. Well, after a long pause, he says, ‘Tell me about it.’”
