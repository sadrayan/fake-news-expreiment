Syrian filmmaker uses his lens to shed light on untold stories of war
Highlights: Humam Husari, a 30-year-old Syrian-born filmmaker, is hoping to harness the medium of film to attract the world’s attention to the real-life stories of the victims of the 2013 sarin gas attack. Husari’s film follows a rebel fighter who lost his wife and child in the chemical attack near Damascus, the capital of Syria. He has no time to bury his fallen family members, and is forced to take up arms to defend against an attack from government forces. “We need to know how people here were forced to join and become a part of the war,” said the young filmmaker. These pictures offer a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to bring these real-life stories to the big screen. Photos: CFP
