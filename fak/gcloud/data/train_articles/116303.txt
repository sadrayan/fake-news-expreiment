What Is ClickHole?
Welcome! We’re sure you have a lot of questions about our website, and, well, here’s everything you need to know:

What is ClickHole?

ClickHole is the latest and greatest online social experience filled with the most clickable, irresistibly shareable content anywhere on the internet.

What is the goal of ClickHole?

Let’s be honest: Today, the average website carelessly churns out hundreds of pieces of pandering, misleading content, most of which tragically fall short of going viral.

At ClickHole, we refuse to stand for this. We strive to make sure that all of our content panders to and misleads our readers just enough to make it go viral. You see, we don’t think anything on the internet should ever have to settle for mere tens of thousands of pageviews. We believe that each and every article—whether about pop culture, politics, internet trends, or social justice—should be clicked on and shared by hundreds of millions of internet users before they can even comprehend what they just read.

ClickHole has one and only one core belief: All web content deserves to go viral.

Who is ClickHole’s audience?

We don’t like to put any sort of limitation on who we can reach! Instead, ClickHole prefers to think of you and every other person on earth as nothing more than an empty vessel existing purely to share content with other empty vessels. If every vessel does its part, we can make sure our children inherit a world free from non-viral content.

Where does ClickHole get its content?

ClickHole staff members don’t write or produce any of the articles, quizzes, lists, or videos that appear on our website. Instead, through the miraculous process of spontaneous genesis, new pieces of content constantly materialize onto our website of their own will.

Where did the name ClickHole come from? Does it have any relation to the 1972 movie ClickHole starring Billy Dee Williams?

The name ClickHole actually has no relation to the 1972 movie ClickHole because that movie does not exist.
