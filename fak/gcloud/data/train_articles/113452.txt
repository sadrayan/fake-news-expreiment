Gregory T. Nojeim is the Associate Director and Chief Legislative Counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington National Office. The ACLU is a nationwide, non-partisan organization of approximately 500,000 members devoted to protecting the principles of freedom and equality set forth in the U.S. Constitution and civil rights laws. In this capacity, he coordinates the ACLU's legislative strategies, supervises its lobbyists, and helps to develop the ACLU position and message on pending legislation. He has been instrumental in developing ACLU's responses to the anti-terrorism legislation and initiatives of the Administration that have threatened civil liberties since the September 11 attacks. Mr. Nojeim started at the ACLU in 1995 and has been responsible for analyzing the civil liberties implications of federal legislation relating to terrorism, national security, immigration and informational privacy. He frequently testifies before congressional committees and the various commissions Congress establishes. For example, Mr. Nojeim testified before Congress about counter-terrorism proposals following the Oklahoma City bombing, the use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings, driver's license privacy and the threat to civil liberties posed by national ID cards. Nojeim also works to limit the threat to privacy posed by governmental wiretapping and monitoring of Internet communications. He was instrumental in bringing together the broad coalition of groups from across the political spectrum that worked to strip overly intrusive wiretapping proposals from the 1996 anti-terrorism law. Mr. Nojeim has also labored to preserve financial privacy and restore due process rights of immigrants - including the right of judicial review and the right to see the government's evidence used against the immigrant - that were taken away in 1996 immigration and terrorism legislation. Nojeim has long fought against discriminatory aviation security profiling and against proposals to require passengers to submit to invasive scanning devices that project an image of their naked body underneath their clothing. Nojeim spearheaded ACLU's efforts to ensure that arriving passengers are not strip-searched by the U.S. Customs Service on a discriminatory basis, and without adequate evidence or the approval of a magistrate. Prior to assuming his position with the ACLU, Mr. Nojeim was for four years the Director of Legal Services of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC). He conducted much of ADC's work in the immigration, civil rights, and human rights areas. Mr. Nojeim was employed for five years as an attorney with the Washington, D.C. law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart where he specialized in mergers and acquisitions, securities law, and international trade. He was graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Rochester in 1981, where he studied Political Science. He received his J.D. from the University of Virginia in 1985 and sat on the Editorial Board of the Virginia Journal of International Law.

After having studied and worked as an airplane engineer in The Netherlands for several years, Hany Abu-Assad entered the world of cinema and television as a producer. He worked on television programs about foreign immigrants and documentaries like "Dar O Dar" for Channel 4 and "Long Days in Gaza" for the BBC. In 1992, Abu-Assad wrote and directed his first short film, "Paper House." The film depicts the adventures of a thirteen year old Palestinian boy, who tries to build his own house after his family's original house has been destroyed. "Paper House" was broadcasted by NOS Dutch television and won several international awards at film festivals. One year later, Abu-Assad produced the feature film "Curfew," directed by Rashid Masharawi. An international co-production between Argus Film Productions, WDR, ARTE and AVRO, "Curfew" was highly praised, winning awards including the Gold Pyramid in Cairo, and the UNESCO Prize in Cannes, among others. After his second short "The 13th," which he wrote, produced and directed, Abu-Assad began his first full-length feature project as a director. He teamed up with writer Arnon Grunberg to develop a script that challenged and explored cinematic narrative and style in a comedy about a couple in Amsterdam. The film, "The Fourteenth Chick," was the opening film of the Dutch Film Festival in Utrecht 1998 and was distributed by United International Pictures. Recent works include the bittersweet documentary "Nazareth 2000," which Abu-Assad made for Dutch VPRO television. The turmoil in a divided and secretly occupied city and its quarrelling Palestinian inhabitants, Christian and Muslim, is viewed through the eyes of two gas station attendants. Combining both a kind and a satirical approach to a serious subject matter, Abu-Assad succeeded in creating a multifaceted and surprisingly humorous documentary. Since Augustus Film was founded by Abu-Assad and Bero Beyer in 2000, Abu-Assad has directed "Rana's Wedding" (2002), a production realized with the support of the Palestinian Film Foundation of the Ministry of Culture of the Palestinian National Authority, and describes a day in the life of a young woman in Jerusalem, during which she tries to get married before four o'clock that day. The film was selected for Critics Week 2002 in Cannes and went on to win prizes at Montpellier, Marrakech, Bastia and Cologne. Abu-Assad's latest documentary, "Ford Transit" (2002) played at the Sundance Film Festival. A portrait of a driver of a Ford Transit taxi, the film humorously observes the resilient inhabitants of Palestinian territories. The film won the FIPRESCI award during the Thessaloniki Film Festival, the In the Spirit of Freedom Award in Jerusalem and together with "Rana's Wedding," the Nestor Almendros Award for courage in filmmaking at the Human Rights Film Festival in New York. Abu-Assad and Beyer wrote "Paradise Now" (http://wip.warnerbros.com/paradisenow/) in 1999 and shot the film in Nablus in 2004. It made its World Premiere at the Berlin Film Festival 2005, where it was won the Blue Angel Award for Best European Film, the Berliner Morgenpost Readers' Prize and the Amnesty International Award for Best Film.
