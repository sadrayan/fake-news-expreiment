relating to requiring legislative consent or approval of the

settlement or compromise of a claim or action against the state that

will involve state expenditures exceeding a certain amount.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:

SECTION 1. Title 5, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is

amended by adding Chapter 111 to read as follows:

CHAPTER 111. LIMITATION ON SETTLEMENT

OF CLAIM OR ACTION AGAINST THE STATE

Sec. 111.001. PURPOSE; APPLICABILITY. (a) The purposes of

this chapter include providing a means for the legislature to

determine the extent to which this state waives its sovereign

immunity with regard to a settlement of a claim or action against

the state that requires an expenditure of state funds.

(b) This chapter applies to any settlement described by

Section 111.003(a) of a claim or action against this state seeking

any relief under any theory of recovery, including a mandamus

action against a state officer or official, that is brought or may

be brought in or before any court, administrative agency, or other

tribunal.

(c) For purposes of this chapter, a reference to this state

includes any agency, institution, or other entity of state

government.

(d) This chapter does not apply to a refund of a tax, fee, or

any related penalty or interest.

Sec. 111.002. DEFINITION. In this chapter, "settlement"

includes a consent decree, an agreed judgment, or any other

settlement or compromise of a claim or action.

Sec. 111.003. LIMITATION ON SETTLEMENT WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE

CONSENT OR APPROVAL. (a) The attorney general or other attorney

representing this state may not enter into a settlement of a claim

or action against this state without the consent or approval of the

legislature in accordance with this chapter if the settlement:

(1) requires this state to pay total monetary damages

in an amount that exceeds $25,000,000 in a state fiscal biennium; or

(2) commits this state to a course of action that in

reasonable probability will entail a continuing increased

expenditure of state funds over subsequent state fiscal bienniums.

(b) A settlement described by Subsection (a) entered into

without the prior consent or approval of the legislature is void

unless the settlement is expressly conditioned on obtaining

subsequent approval by the legislature in accordance with this

chapter.

Sec. 111.004. FORM OF CONSENT OR APPROVAL. (a) The

legislature may consent to or approve a settlement described by

Section 111.003(a) only by a resolution adopted by both houses of

the legislature.

(b) Legislative consent under this chapter may but is not

required to be expressed in the form of a resolution granting

permission to sue the state that limits the relief to which a

claimant may be entitled or provides additional conditions to which

a grant of permission to sue is subject.

Sec. 111.005. APPROPRIATIONS. (a) An appropriation of

state funds to pay or comply with a settlement does not constitute

consent to or approval of the settlement for purposes of this

chapter.

(b) A resolution consenting to or approving a settlement

under this chapter does not and may not require the legislature to

appropriate a particular amount for a particular purpose.

Sec. 111.006. REPORT BY ATTORNEY GENERAL. Not later than

September 1 of each even-numbered year, the attorney general shall

send to the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the house of

representatives, and each member of the Senate Finance Committee

and the House Appropriations Committee a report describing each

claim or action pending as of September 1 of that year that has been

or that in the opinion of the attorney general may be settled in a

manner that will require prior consent or subsequent approval by

the legislature under this chapter.

SECTION 2. Chapter 111, Civil Practice and Remedies Code,

as added by this Act, applies only to a consent decree, agreed

judgment, or other settlement or compromise of a claim or action

entered into on or after the effective date of this Act. A consent

decree, agreed judgment, or other settlement or compromise of a

claim or action entered into before the effective date of this Act

is governed by applicable law in existence on the date the consent

decree, agreed judgment, or other settlement or compromise is

entered into.

SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives

a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as

provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this

Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this

Act takes effect September 1, 2007.
