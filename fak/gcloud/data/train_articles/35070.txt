Trump rally with Ted Cruz moved to far bigger 18,000-seat arena in Houston
Updated at 3:30 p.m.: Revised with Toyota Center official saying that venue has been available all along.

WASHINGTON – The Trump campaign has moved that rally Monday night for Sen. Ted Cruz – which the president vowed to hold in the "biggest stadium in Texas" – from an 8,000-seat arena in Houston to the far-larger Toyota Center, capacity 18,000.

President Donald Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, announced the change of plans Thursday afternoon with no explanation as to why the larger venue wasn't picked from the outset.

The campaign insisted Monday that no bigger venue was available, but a Toyota Center official said Thursday that the larger arena was available all along, and Trump aides had only contacted them a few hours before Parscale tweeted that the rally was moved because response "has been HUGE and unprecedented. This will be an epic rally."

That suggested either that the Trump campaign had provided misleading information Monday, or had moved cautiously in case of modest interest.
