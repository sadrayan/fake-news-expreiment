President Donald J. Trump Calls on the Senate to Support the Grassley Bill, Oppose Bills that Fail to Deliver for the American People
President Trump issued the following statement of support today for Chairman Grassley’s immigration bill, which was just published and is based on the White House Framework. In seeking responsible immigration reform, the President urged senators to vote for the Grassley bill and to oppose any legislation that violates the Framework’s “four pillars,” and that thus fails to deliver safety, security, and prosperity to the American People:

I want to thank Chairman Grassley for introducing legislation based on the White House Immigration Reform and Border Security Framework. The Grassley bill accomplishes the four pillars of the White House Framework: a lasting solution on DACA, ending chain migration, cancelling the visa lottery, and securing the border through building the wall and closing legal loopholes. I am asking all senators, in both parties, to support the Grassley bill and to oppose any legislation that fails to fulfill these four pillars – that includes opposing any short-term “Band-Aid” approach. The overwhelming majority of American voters support a plan that fulfills the Framework’s four pillars, which move us towards the safe, modern, and lawful immigration system our people deserve.

At the same time, I remain encouraged by developments in the House toward advancing legislation from Chairmen Goodlatte and McCaul that also enshrines our four pillars.

Now that our military is fully funded, and will be rebuilt stronger than ever before, my focus is on enacting responsible and commonsense immigration reform that delivers for the American People.
