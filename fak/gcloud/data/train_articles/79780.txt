Jon Stewart Knows Who'd Win In A War Between Texas And Florida
Florida and Texas are at war ... or at least, engaged in a war of words on the floor of the House of Representatives, where Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) called Texas "a crazy state."

"You're from Florida, and you're calling Texas crazy?" guffawed Jon Stewart on Wednesday's "The Daily Show." "You may as well call out Oklahoma for also having a panhandle."

Of course, Hastings' comments didn't go without challenge. Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) demanded an apology, which Hastings declared would arrive when "hell freezes over."

"We are run by children," Stewart lamented.

But that got him wondering: What if Florida and Texas really did go to war over this? How would it unfold? And more importantly, who would win? (To find out, watch the video from the 4:30 mark.)
