About Speaker Ryan
A fifth-generation Janesville native, Paul Ryan is committed to continuing Wisconsin’s proud tradition of reform-minded leadership in Congress. Since he was elected in 1998, Paul has worked hard to represent the people of the First District.

Paul is also the 54th Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and since being named to the position in October 2015, he has worked to advance a bold, conservative reform agenda that will deliver real solutions for the American people.

Previously, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Paul worked to make health care more affordable, to simplify the tax code, and to help create jobs. During the 112th and 113th Congress, he served as chairman of the House Budget Committee, where he led the effort to balance the federal budget and pay off the national debt. In 2012, Paul was selected to serve as Governor Mitt Romney’s Vice Presidential nominee.

Before serving in Congress, Paul worked at Ryan Inc., Central—a construction firm founded by Ryan’s great-grandfather in 1884. Paul also served as an aide, economic advisor, and speechwriter for various public officials in Washington, D.C.

He currently resides near his childhood home in Janesville. He is a member of St. John Vianney’s Parish and a graduate of Joseph A. Craig High School. He holds a degree in economics and political science from Miami University in Ohio. Paul and his wife Janna are the proud parents of three children: Liza, Charlie, and Sam. The youngest of four children, Paul is the son of Paul Sr. (deceased) and Betty Ryan.
