Needham analyst Laura Martin wrote Monday that Facebook Inc. appears to be in a worse position than Big Tech peers Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. given that the Federal Trade Commission and not the Department of Justice has jurisdiction to investigate the company's practices. Martin points to several aspects of the FTC's mission statement that indicate to her that the agency has a wider scope for its investigations. The FTC's mission statement conveys a focus on "preventing anti-competitive, deceptive, and unfair business practices through law enforcement, advocacy, and education without unduly burdening legitimate business activity" and mentions that the agency is "the only federal agency with both consumer protection and competition jurisdiction in broad sectors of the economy." To Martin, this mission means that the company "can look into almost anything it wants to in any industry it wants to" and can "pivot and look at a different potential infraction" if it doesn't find anything in one area. The FTC also has public hearings, which could bring negative attention to Facebook, while peers Alphabet and Apple are now under the eye of the DOJ, which runs a closed investigative process. Martin has a hold rating on shares, which are up 38% so far this year, as the S&P 500 has risen 12%.
