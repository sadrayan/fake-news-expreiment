Elgin, IL: 17 local women discover they’re all pregnant – to the same man
A 24-year old Elgin, Illinois man has broken a world record after he successfully impregnated 17 women with all of them simultaneously pregnant with his children.

The man, a young African American – learned that the world record for simultaneous pregnancies to the same father was 16 women, and boasted to his friends that he could beat it.

“He has a habit of making big claims and never following through,” said one of the man’s friends. “In this case we didn’t think for a second he’d be able to do it, so when he came to us with proof we were blown away.”

To validate his record, the man requested all the women who he had impregnated to complete amniocentesis which proved his paternity of the children. Once he had collected all the results from the lab, he organised an event where he invited all the women to meet each other for the first time.

“How on earth he managed to keep it a secret from all of them I will never know,” said the man’s friend. “It was quite a sight to see 17 pregnant ladies in the one room all suddenly realise that he had slept with all of them.”

Despite breaking the world record, the man may now be regretting his actions, after it emerged that he would also be liable for a world-record child support bill. “To pay for 17 kids, I don’t think he’ll be able to afford it on his current salary at Burger King.”
