Tajikistan Travel Advisory
Exercise increased caution in Tajikistan due to terrorism.

On July 29, 2018, two U.S. citizens were killed in a terrorist attack in Danghara province.

Terrorists have targeted bicyclists and may target other places, such as residential areas, clubs and restaurants, places of worship, hotels, schools, outdoor recreation events, and other venues, although Government of Tajikistan facilities remain the most likely target. Facilities catering to westerners in Tajikistan present a heightened risk. Avoid large crowds and public transportation to the extent possible. Tourists should avoid activities that develop predictable patterns of movement. If documenting your travel on social media, please ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set.
