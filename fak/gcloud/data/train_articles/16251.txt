Subject: Austin reporter, seeking development fees to build an apartment building in Dallas

Hello from Austin. I just called your office and was urged to send an email.

For a PolitiFact Texas fact-check, I seek on-the-record attributable information regarding the fees that the City of Dallas imposes for the construction of an apartment building. Comparisons to Austin also would be helpful.

Here is what we’re trying to fact-check:

State Rep. Paul Workman said in his June 2017 commentary in the Austin American-Statesman: “I have received a document from an apartment builder that demonstrates the difference in total development fees for building a project in Dallas versus building the same project in Austin. Total fees in Dallas: $120,081. Total fees in Austin: $1,026,852 – nearly 10-times higher for the same project! There is no way to argue that these fees are not contributing to the affordability crisis in Austin.”

Hello again.

Per my inquiry below – which I hope you have – I am now attaching a detailed document offered as factual backup.

Can you or another city official call me to walk through the accuracy of the Dallas figures in the document?

Subject: A fresh query

In the document I shared with you, which fee would be the master permit fee?

Subject: ALSO

Also, a City of Austin official has told me Dallas does not have tree ordinances, unlike Austin. Make sense?

Dallas does have a tree protection ordinance and requires mitigation for trees that are removed either through planting of trees or a payment into a fund to plant trees.. However in the scenario given to us there was no mention of trees being removed from the site. Further there may not be an added city fee if the developer choose to plant trees.

The permit fee for the master would be the first two lines, $72,450.00 for the multifamily dwellings and $23,000 for the parking garage.
