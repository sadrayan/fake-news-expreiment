Background Report: Donald Trump: Mainstreaming a Hate Movement

“The alt-right began with a speech the conservative writer Paul Gottfried gave in 2008, after the Republican Party’s electoral wipeout…But it was Donald Trump’s presidential campaign that brought the movement into the mainstream.” [Washington Post, 8/23/16]

On June 16, 2015, Donald J. Trump officially launched his campaign for President of the United States by telling voters “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best… They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” In that moment, Trump extended his hand to an extremist right wing faction that refers to itself as the “Alt-Right.” But this was not the first time Trump had made such an overture; it was just the latest in a decades-long record of trafficking in racism, sexism, bigotry and offensive behavior outside the mainstream of American society, and more recent association with movements in the paranoid fringe of American politics.

Alt-Right is a euphemism. It is a term used by the extreme fringe of the conservative movement to conceal a set of views that can be variously described as bigoted, intolerant, racist, white nationalist, and anti-women. In his public and private life, and now as candidate for president, Trump has espoused, endorsed and encouraged the views and conspiracy theories now held at the core of movement–in his own words and tweets, in his choice of advisers (both formal and informal), and in the fueling of hate speech and conduct among supporters.

Executive Summary

As the Southern Poverty Law Center has written, Alt-Right “is a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that ‘white identity’ is under attack by multicultural forces using ‘political correctness’ and ‘social justice’ to undermine white people and ‘their’ civilization.” It has been compared to various far-right anti-immigrant parties in Europe as well as to the 1992 movement in support of Pat Buchanan’s run for President. Donald Trump, through his own words and policies, his choice of advisers and associates, and his signals to supporters and followers, has capitalized on a symbiosis with this movement.

Long before he launched his presidential bid, Trump was known for controversial comments, conspiracy theories, and hubristic style. He was the most prominent proponent and amplifier of “birtherism”—the movement that called into question the citizenship and legitimacy of the first African-American President. Today, Trump and his fringe allies are again surfacing theories about Hillary Clinton, doctoring medical reports to call her health into question, and suggesting that she co-founded ISIS. These tactics are not new.

With the hiring of Steve Bannon as his new campaign CEO - a man who proudly proclaimed just weeks ago that he and his former media company, Breitbart was the “platform for the Alt-Right” - Trump has now given an official leadership role to these hateful, fringe conservative movements, alongside other advisors and allies that traffic in hate, such as Roger Stone and Alex Jones. A Trump presidency would legitimize what most Americans rightfully deem unthinkable, grotesque, and dangerous: it would elevate this fringe movement to the Oval Office.

I. TRUMP’S OWN WORDS, POLICIES, AND THEORIES ARE DRAWN FROM EXTREME FRINGES OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT

Long before he launched his Presidential bid, Donald Trump was known for his controversial comments, conspiracy theories, and hubristic style. He was the face of one conspiracy theory in particular - “birtherism” - that the far right seized upon.

CONSPIRACY THEORY: TRUMP QUESTIONED PRESIDENT OBAMA’S BIRTHPLACE AND RELIGION

INFOWARS HEADLINE: “Bombshell: Obama ‘Born In Kenya.’” [Infowars, 5/17/12]

When he entered the crowded Republican field, Trump captured headlines by saying Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals. He championed the same issues the Alt-Right supported, and Alt-Right supporters took note.

Trump: “When Mexico Sends Its People, They’re Not Sending Their Best… They’re Bringing Drugs. They’re Bringing Crime. They’re Rapists.” TRUMP: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” [Trump Presidential Campaign Announcement, New York NY, 6/16/15; Washington Post, 7/8/15]

Mic: Trump’s Attacks on Political Correctness Contributed to Rise of Alt-Right. “Donald Trump has decried the proliferation of political correctness in his meteoric rise to the Republican nomination, saying America’s problems need a leader willing to unabashedly discuss what ails the nation before anything can be fixed. That call to defy the norms of political correctness has contributed to the rise of the ‘alt-right’ — a group that bills itself as the alternative to mainstream conservatism by embracing white supremacist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views that have historically manifested in hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.” [Mic, 8/23/16]

Politico: Donald Trump Was A Boon For White Supremacists, Who Used His Candidacy As A Tool To Expand Their Movement. “The Ku Klux Klan is using Donald Trump as a talking point in its outreach efforts. Stormfront, the most prominent American white supremacist website, is upgrading its servers in part to cope with a Trump traffic spike. And former Louisiana Rep. David Duke reports that the businessman has given more Americans cover to speak out loud about white nationalism than at any time since his own political campaigns in the 1990s.” [Politico, 12/10/15]

His plan to “build a wall” appealed directly to prominent figures in the Alt-Right community.

Trump: “We’re Going To Do A Wall… Mexico’s Going To Pay For The Wall.” [Republican Primary Debate, Boulder CO, 10/28/15; CNBC, 10/28/15]

VDARE’s Patrick Cleburne Referred To Immigration As “Immivasion” And Thought The Public Would Prefer To Support The “Great Wall Of Trump.” “Anyone who thinks that given the choice between a virtually unreported policy of No Borders and National obliteration and the Great Wall Of Trump Americans will enthusiastically choose the former is delusional. And anyone who thinks Donald Trump can be induced, like Romney, to forgo the issue does not appreciate the Donald’s instinct for the Jugular.” [Patrick Cleburne, VDARE, 3/4/16]

Prominent Alt-Right supporters also mirrored Trump’s refugee rhetoric.

Support for his candidacy continued to grow among extreme fringe conservatives - support that Trump failed to denounce, and in fact amplified at times.

New York Magazine: “[The] data shows that 62 percent of the accounts Trump has retweeted recently have white-supremacist connections.” [New York Magazine, 1/27/16]

New York Times: “Mr. Trump has amplified the messages of some white-power proponents himself: In January, he resent a Twitter message from a site called @WhiteGenocideTM. And he has done the same with statistics on black-on-white crime that were later shown to be false.” [New York Times, 2/29/16]

Just 83 days from the election, Trump elevated two advisors, Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, to senior leadership positions. Hiring Bannon (executive chairman of Breitbart News) made official the long-standing union between Trump and the Alt-Right.

U.S. News & World Report : “When Donald Trump hired Breitbart’s Steve Bannon to lead his campaign, the alt-right rejoiced.” [U.S. News, 8/23/16]

PolitiFact Gave Trump A Pants On Fire For Claiming The Election Was Rigged. “Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. election system is rigged.

CONSPIRACY THEORY: TRUMP PUSHES DEBUNKED INTERNET RUMORS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON’S HEALTH

Washington Post’s Fact Checker Gave Trump Four Pinocchios For His Claims Clinton Lacked The Mental And Physical Stamina To Be President, Calling The Claims “Half-Baked” And “Debunked Internet Rumors From The Fringes Of The Right.” “Trump has claimed twice, without proof, that Clinton lacks the physical and mental stamina to be president. In the absence of any evidence, he earns Four Pinocchios. Four Pinocchios.” [Fact Checker, Washington Post, 8/18/16]

Huffington Post: A group of conspiracy-minded conservatives have been increasingly pushing the theory that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is hiding a serious physical or mental ailment from the American people. They have an ally in Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who took a jab at Clinton’s “mental and physical stamina” during a speech on Monday. [Huffington Post, 8/15/16]

Breitbart, the Alt-Right’s most prominent media backer, has energetically promoted this conspiracy theory:

Breitbart Re-posted An Article From Website Zero Hedge That Said “Hillary Has At Multiple Times Had Convulsions That Appear To Be Seizures On Camera, Including A Series Of Seemingly Inexplicable Coughing Fits”: “Hillary’ bizarre, erratic behavior on the campaign trail (culminating with last week’s perplexing ‘short-circuit’ comment) has left many wondering whether she is seriously ill.” [Breitbart, 8/11/16]

Breitbart Editorialized That The Mainstream Media Has Been “Strangely Silent” About a Possible “Traumatic Brain Injury.” [Breitbart, 8/10/16]

Extremist supporters of the Alt-Right movement have found a candidate in Trump who shares their core beliefs. Plus, many people are saying that he is, indeed, normalizing and espousing the views of the Alt-Right - many people who happen to be experts on the subject.

Chip Berlet, veteran researcher of the far right: “Berlet does not think that American politics has been in such a dangerous place vis-a-vis the far right for almost a century. For him, the parallels between the Trump campaign and the alt-right are ‘the most important pushback against having a multicultural and pluralistic society since the 1920s Klan’.” [Guardian, 8/23/16]

Trump Called The 1993 Suicide Of Former White House Aide Vince Foster “Very Fishy” And Said Theories Of Possible Foul Play Were “Very Serious.” “In one recent interview, Trump said another topic of potential concern is the suicide of former White House aide Vincent Foster, which remains the focus of intense and far-fetched conspiracy theories on the Internet.” [Washington Post, 5/23/16]

“...Some voices on the far right have long argued that the Clintons may have been involved in a conspiracy that led to Foster’s death….‘He had intimate knowledge of what was going on,’ Trump said, speaking of Foster’s relationship with the Clintons at the time. ‘He knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide.’” [Washington Post, 5/23/16]

II. TRUMP HAS HIRED AND SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH SOME OF THE LEADING VOICES ON THE ALT-RIGHT CONSERVATIVE FRINGE

Trump has mutual relationships with and respect for Breitbart’s Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, and Alex Jones. A brief examination of the hate, conspiracy, and dangerous vitriol propagated by these three men and their megaphones should tell us something about the values of their close friend who is running for president:

BANNON’S BREITBART

The Southern Poverty Law Center has noted that “…the Outlet [Breitbart] Has Undergone A Noticeable Shift Toward Embracing Ideas On The Extremist Fringe Of The Conservative Right. Racist Ideas.” [Southern Poverty Law Center, 4/28/16]

Steve Bannon, Trump’s new campaign CEO, comes to the campaign directly from Breitbart News. Under Bannon’s leadership, Breitbart has regularly used homophobic, misogynistic, and offensive language in its headlines and coverage:

HEADLINE: “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy.” [Breitbart, 12/8/15]

HEADLINE: “Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?” [Breitbart, 2/19/2016]

HEADLINE: “Suck It Up Buttercups: Dangerous Faggot Tour Returns To Colleges In September.” [Breitbart, 7/6/16]

HEADLINE: “Trannies Whine About Hilarious Bruce Jenner Billboard.” [Breitbart, 12/4/15]

HEADLINE: “Hoist It High And Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage.” [Breitbart, 7/1/15]

Breitbart Defended White Nationalists Such As Richard Spencer And Jared Taylor, Claiming They “Have Been Accused Of Racism”: “Breitbart recently published a lengthy defense of the Alt­Right, claiming the white nationalists such as Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor who created the ideology ‘have been accused of racism,’ choosing to ignore the well ­documented openly ­racist views.” [Southern Poverty Law Center, 4/28/16]

Breitbart has also served as a Trump Propaganda Machine.

One Breitbart Editor Said He Was Told By An Executive That Trump Paid Breitbart For Positive Coverage. [BuzzFeed, 8/9/15]

A Breitbart Source Said Bannon Was Required To Sign Off On “Everything That Is Written About Trump.” [Vanity Fair, 3/14/16]

ALEX JONES AND INFOWARS

Alex Jones, whose show Trump has appeared on, and who Trump has praised publicly, is a prominent conspiracy theorist.

Jones pushed several conspiracy theories around national tragedies: “Jones’s amazing reputation arises mainly from his high-volume insistence that national tragedies such as the September 11th terror attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sandy Hook elementary-school shooting, and the Boston Marathon bombing were all inside jobs, ‘false flag’ ops secretly perpetrated by the government to increase its tyrannical power (and, in some cases, seize guns). Jones believes that no one was actually hurt at Sandy Hook—those were actors—and that the Apollo 11 moon-landing footage was faked.” [New Yorker, 6/23/16]

Jones on the Gabby Giffords shooting: “My gut tells me this was a staged mind-control operation. The government employs geometric psychological-warfare experts that know exactly how to indirectly manipulate unstable people through the media.” [Rolling Stone, 3/2/11]

Jones on the Orlando nightclub shooting: “In a YouTube video posted Sunday evening, the Infowars.com founder called Mateen’s shooting rampage ‘a false-flag terror attack.’” [Daily Beast, 6/12/16]

Apart from conspiracy theories, Jones has a history of offensive comments.

The list of disturbing and bizarre headlines on Jones’ site, Infowars, is unending. Visit http://www.infowars.com/ for a view into the mind of a man Trump has said he “greatly admires.”

STONE’S RECENT HITS

Roger Stone, another Trump associate, has a record of offensive and racist comments that resulted in recent bans from major media outlets.

Both CNN and MSNBC banned Stone over offensive comments. “As Media Matters notes, Stone’s Twitter history got him banned from both CNN and MSNBC, and yet he was still on the Trump campaign team, is still on Fox News regularly, and is still quoted as a Trump surrogate without much mention of how his Twitter feed reads like the bathroom wall at a white supremacist rally.” [Salon, 4/6/16]

Stone repeatedly targeted minorities with offensive tweets and called them “quota hires.” “Stone sent out tweets over the past few days calling Navarro, who was a Jeb Bush supporter, ‘Entitled Diva Bitch,’ ‘Borderline retarded’ and ‘’dumber than dog s—.’ He also tweeted about Navarro in December, saying she reminded him of a ‘rabid pekinese.’ He previously called Navarro and former contributor Roland Martin ‘quota hires’ for the network.” [Politico, 2/23/16]

Roger Stone Called CNN Analyst Roland Martin A “Fat Negro.” [WBUR, 6/6/16]

Roger Stone Called Roland Martin A “Stupid Negro.” “Stone called Navarro a ‘diva bitch,’ and ‘borderline retarded.’ He said Martin was a ‘stupid negro,’ and called both of them ‘quota hires.’” [Daily Caller, 2/24/16]

Roger Stone: “Herman Cain – 999 Or 69 ? #Swordsman #Hung #mandingo @magerhabepolitico.” [@RogerJStoneJr, Twitter,11/28/11]

And for good measure, Stone recently attacked the Khan family:

Roger Stone: Mr. Khan More Then An Aggrieved Father Of A Muslim Son – He’s Muslim Brotherhood Agent Helping Hillary Clinton. “Roger Stone ‏@RogerJStoneJr: Mr. Khan more than an aggrieved father of a Muslim son- he’s Muslim Brotherhood agent helping Hillary http://linkis.com/shoebat.com/2016/07/amTCP” [Twitter, Roger Stone, 7/31/2016]

Mother Jones: Roger Stone said that Khizr Khan, The Father Of A Slain Soldier Was “Working For The Muslim Brotherhood.” “Roger Stone, an informal adviser to Donald Trump, took to Twitter on Sunday to claim that Khizr Khan, the father of a slain war hero who spoke at last week’s Democratic National Convention, is working for the Muslim Brotherhood.” [Mother Jones, 8/1/16]

For years, Trump has maintained relationships with all three of these–all of whom have promoted and contributed to the dialogue among extremist groups on the far right.

A WEB OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG TRUMP, BANNON, JONES, AND STONE:

2015: Trump Allegedly Called Bannon And Asked For Breitbart To Write Positive Stories About Him. “But my sources at Breitbart said the billionaire has regularly taken advantage of his relationship with the site by placing calls to Bannon and asking for stories to be written about himself. They said his typical requests for coverage in the past tended to center on his serial flirtations with running for office, but they added that his constant presence on the homepage — and his general knack for pandering to the conservative fever swamps — had won him a true following among their readership.” [BuzzFeed, 8/9/15]

2015: Bloomberg: Breitbart News “Has Championed Trump’s Presidential Candidacy.” [Bloomberg, 10/8/15]

2016: Bannon Had Been Advising Trump For Months Prior To Being Formally Hired: “Bannon, in phone calls and meetings, has been urging Trump for months to not mount a fall campaign that makes Republican donors and officials comfortable, the aides said. Instead, Bannon has been telling Trump to run more fully as an outsider and an unabashed nationalist.” [Washington Post, 8/17/16]

2016: A Breitbart Source Said Bannon Was Required To Sign Off On “Everything That Is Written About Trump.” “At Breitbart, pro-Trump coverage is rigidly enforced from the top down, according to two people with knowledge of the site’s editorial process. ‘Everything that is written about Trump must be approved by Bannon,’ said a source who did not wish to be named for fear of retribution. [Vanity Fair, 3/14/16]

After Trump chose extremist Bannon to lead his campaign, reporters took note of its implications.

Mic: “Republicans who fear the alt-right will cannibalize the GOP, were dealt a blow last week when Trump brought on Steve Bannon to serve as the CEO of his campaign.” [Mic, 8/23/16]

“Bannon was the chairman of Breitbart, a breeding ground for the alt-right that helped push Trump's candidacy during the crowded Republican primary.” [Mic, 8/23/16]

Mother Jones: “‘We’re the platform for the alt-right,’ Bannon told me proudly when I interviewed him at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July.” [Mother Jones, 8/22/16]

Donald Trump also shares a mutual admiration with conspiracy theorist and radio show host, Alex Jones.

2015: Donald Trump to Alex Jones: “I just wanted to finish by saying that your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You’ll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we’ll be speaking a lot, but you’ll be looking at me in a year, or two years—give me a little bit of time to run things—but a year into office, you’ll be saying, ‘Wow, I remember that interview, he said he was gonna do it, and he did a great job.” [Vanity Fair, 12/2/15]

2015: “Alex Jones Is A Big Fan Of Donald Trump, And The Feeling’s Mutual.” “Republican front-runner Donald Trump appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ show on Wednesday in a lengthy display of mutual appreciation. Appearing on a blurry video connection, Trump talked to Jones about Trump’s false claims about Muslims in New Jersey cheering 9/11, Hillary Clinton, and Trump’s book, among other topics. Jones told Trump he had been ‘vindicated’ in his claims. I know it happened and I held my line and people wanted me to apologize and I can’t do that,’ Trump told Jones. ‘People like you and I, we can’t do that so easily.’“[BuzzFeed, 12/2/15]

Trump.’” [Media Matters, 2/10/16; Infowars, 2/8/16]

III. DONALD TRUMP’S RHETORIC - RHETORIC THAT IS MIRRORED BY THE ALT RIGHT - HAS ALREADY LED TO VIOLENCE, RACISM AND INTOLERANCE AROUND THE COUNTRY

Just this week brought additional developments in a racist, sexist coordinated assault on actress Leslie Jones–one begun and led by a top editor at Breitbart, which has become the Alt-Right’s platform. What has happened to Ms. Jones in recent months is evidence of the resentments fueling what is known as the Alt-Right, and its dangers. The effect is real.

Breitbart Editor Milo Yiannopoulos Was Slapped With A Rare Lifetime Ban From Twitter For Provoking The Vicious, Racist Attacks Against Leslie Jones - Bannon’s Response: “Did You Hear About Milo? It’s Great.” “Just before one of our two meetings this summer, Breitbart’s technology correspondent, Milo Yiannopoulos, was slapped with a rare lifetime ban from Twitter for an essay that provoked vicious, racist attacks by his followers against the actress Leslie Jones, a gifted performer whose major crime was finding work, in this case as part of the all-female ensemble on the new Ghostbusters movie. Across the Web, Yiannopoulos’s actions were noted as an example of race-baiting. Bannon’s first words to me that day were, ‘Did you hear about Milo? It’s great.’” [Vanity Fair, 8/17/16]

Salon: Under Bannon, Yiannopoulos Was Hired By Breitbart “Because Of His Skills At Whipping Up The Sociopathic Internet Into A Frenzy Of Resentment At Even The Hint That They Might Have To Share The World With Women And People Of Color.” “And Yiannopoulos’s boss Stephen Bannon now runs the Donald Trump campaign. Make no mistake: Yiannopoulos got his job at Breitbart not despite, but because of his skills at whipping up the sociopathic internet into a frenzy of resentment at even the hint that they might have to share the world with women and people of color. Under Bannon, Yiannopoulos was brought on to be the editor of their supposed ‘tech’ vertical, even though there’s no evidence that he knows much about tech and despite his history of bashing video game players.” [Salon, 8/24/16]

Trump’s policies and rhetoric have had a ripple effect, popping up in society in menacing ways. The “Trump Effect” is having a disturbing impact on American communities.

Washington Post: “Trump’s vitriol is making it off the campaign trail and into the lingua franca of children at an alarming rate. Just watch coverage from Trump rallies to hear the next phrases kids will be slinging at school.” [Washington Post, 3/7/16]

Huffington Post: “Even though they can’t vote… kids are paying attention to the 2016 election. Trumps bigotry is moving from the political stage to the community level.”[Huffington Post, 5/15/16]

Southern Poverty Law Center: “Our report found that the campaign is producing an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color and inflaming racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom. Many students worry about being deported.” [Southern Poverty Law Center, 4/13/16]

HEADLINE: “The Trump Effect”: Hatred, Fear And Bullying On The Rise In Schools.” [Huffington Post, 4/13/16]

● “Overall, more than two-thirds of the teachers who took the survey reported that their students — mainly Muslims, immigrants and children of immigrants — were worried about what could happen to them and their families after the November election. And more than one-third of the teachers said they’ve noticed a rise in anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment among their students as well.” [Huffington Post, 4/13/16]

“Quite frankly, it’s been quite embarrassing when I have an 11-year-old who is better behaved and more polite than some people who are the potential next leaders of our country,” said Maury Peterson, who runs Parenting Journey, a nonprofit group in Somerville, Mass., that provides support for families. “This name-calling and making fun of people is basically the opposite of what he’s been taught at home and at school.” [New York Times, 3/10/16]

“I don’t know whether Trump was the inspiration for the kids on an all-white Annapolis-area hockey team who singled out the black players on my son’s team, calling them the N-word and harassing them throughout the game. But they heard those words somewhere. They learned that cruelty somewhere. And I don’t think it’s a stretch to blame their behavior on the nation’s growing tolerance of open displays of bigotry.” [Washington Post, 5/7/16]

The Trump Effect has carried over to states:

Massachusetts Trump supporters attacked Latino man: “The first known victim of Trump-inspired violence emerged much earlier. On August 20, 2015, in Boston, Massachusetts, two Trump supporters physically attacked a homeless Latino man. One of the attackers informed police that he was motivated by Trump’s immigration message that Mexicans were criminals and rapists.” [When Islamophobia Turns Violent, Georgetown University, 4/25/15]

In Indiana: “‘Build the wall!’ That was the chant at a high school basketball game in Indiana last week, directed by kids from a majority-white school who held up Trump signs and yelled at the opposing players and fans, who were from a predominantly Latino school.” [Washington Post, 3/7/16]

“‘During the course of that game, a group of Andrean students produced signs and images of presidential candidate Donald Trump and began to chant ‘Build that wall,’ at the Bishop Noll team and fans, who are heavily Hispanic,’ the Catholic Dioceses of Gary, which oversees both schools, said in a statement. … Ashley Howard was at the game cheering for her cousin, who plays for Bishop Noll. … The signs, she said were coupled with chants like ‘Build a wall,’ ‘No comprende’ and ‘Speak English.’” [CNN, 3/1/16]

After a similar incident in Iowa, Perry High School Principal Dan Marburger responded: “They see it in a presidential campaign and now it’s OK for everyone to say this. It’s almost a sense that you feel that you don’t belong in your own country.” [CNN, 3/1/16]

In Wisconsin: “A Wisconsin high school girls soccer match turned traumatizing after fans in the rafters were shouting racial slurs at the players from the Beloit Memorial High School — and included chants like, ‘Donald Trump, build that wall,’ witnesses said.” [NY Daily News, 4/10/16]

Trump and the Alt-Right both support keeping Muslim immigrants outside of the U.S.:

African-American Muslim students fear deportation under Trump: “‘My students are terrified of Donald Trump,’ says one teacher from a middle school with a large population of African-American Muslims. ‘They think that if he’s elected, all black people will get sent back to Africa.’” [Southern Poverty Law Center, 4/13/16]

Muslim woman assaulted by a Trump supporter in Washington, DC: “Several weeks ago, in Washington, D.C., a Muslim woman was called ‘a worthless piece of Muslim trash’ and a ‘terrorist’ by a fellow Starbucks customer… After pouring something on the Muslim woman, the assaulter told her victim that she was planning on voting for Donald Trump, who would send Muslims ‘back to where you come from.’” [Slate, 5/9/16]

Trump has expressed a violent, aggressive attitude toward protesters and those who disagree with him. At times, these words have seemingly given license to supporters and rally attendees to express open hatred and to commit actions that typically invite rebuke from a candidate for president.

Just this week, an AP analysis found that Trump’s own campaign staff have employed offensive language, that has also been employed by supporters at rallies and writers and commenters across so-called “Alt-Right”, extreme corners of the internet.

Trump staffers express racially charged views: “The campaign has employed a mix of veteran political operatives and outsiders. Most come across as dedicated, enthusiastic partisans, but at least seven expressed views that were overtly racially charged, supportive of violent actions or broadly hostile to Muslims.” [Associated Press, 8/22/16]

“A graphic designer for Trump's advance team approvingly posted a video of a black man eating fried chicken and criticizing fellow blacks for ignorance, irresponsibility and having too many children.” [Associated Press, 8/22/16]

“A Trump field organizer in Virginia declared that Muslims were seeking to impose Sharia law in America and that "those who understand Islam for what it is are gearing up for the fight.” [Associated Press, 8/22/16]

That first Trump campaign speech was not the beginning of the movement, nor was it the beginning of the disturbing ties between Trump and hate groups. But it was the launch of a new kind of presidential campaign–one that normalized hate and bigotry and lifted up hate groups in a way no mainstream presidential campaign in modern history has. This kind of hatred is impacting our families, our communities and the public discourse – the so-called “Trump effect” – and we must recognize and stand up against it in order to keep the fringe extremism out of the White House.
