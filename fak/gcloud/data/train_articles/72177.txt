Donald Trump just sold off the entire Miss Universe Organization after buying it 3 days ago
Ethan Miller/Getty Images Donald Trump has just sold the Miss Universe Organization, which includes the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageant groups, to the agency WME/IMG.

The agency made the announcement on Twitter on Monday morning.

"Having worked closely with The Miss Universe Organization in the past, we understand the incredible potential of the events and the star-quality of the participants," WME/IMG chief content officer Mark Shapiro said in a press release. "The global reach of The Miss Universe Organization and the content opportunities presented by the pageants make this a strong, strategic addition to our portfolio."

Trump issued the following statement:

"I have truly enjoyed owning the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants. When I purchased the pageants many years ago, they were in serious trouble. It has been a great honor making them so successful â€¦ The pageants are now in the hands of a great company that will shepherd them to even greater levels of success."

According to Trump's financial disclosure forms with the Federal Election Commission, The Miss Universe Organization has a value between $5 million and $25 million.

The sale occurs just days after Trump announced that he bought back the half of the organization owned by NBCUniversal. In a tweet, he did tell his followers to "stay tuned" for more information.

Earlier this year, NBCUniversal's NBC and Univision networks refused to air the Miss USA pageant after Trump made controversial statements about Mexican immigrants while he announced his presidential run. In a last-minute deal, the Reelz channel aired the pageant. There it drew 4 million fewer viewers than the year before when the pageant aired on NBC.
