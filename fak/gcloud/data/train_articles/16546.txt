Thanks for the renewed help today.

Can you tell me if I read the linked web page below correctly?

My read: According to agency data, White students last comprised the majority of all seniors in high school in 2008. That year, according to TEA, there were 122,901 White seniors and 121,889 Hispanic seniors.

It newly looks to me like I initially misread the 2010 data to indicate that was the last year White high-school graduates comprised the majority of the state’s graduates. The figures posted indicate 109,887 White students graduated that year, comprising 41 percent of the 264,632 total graduates. Did I read this right?

If so, when was the last year that White students comprised a majority of high school graduates? It’s clear it wasn’t 2014, but I can’t tell yet when that was, again provided I read the 2010 data accurately.

Yes! I’m going to use my data team’s analysis verbatim, so let me know if this makes sense.

It appears that Gardner first made his calculations using the entire class and then switched to using just graduates. It also seems that he switched from wanting the most populous group to the group that accounted for greater than 50 percent of the total (“majority”).

Using graduates as the denominator, White graduates accounted for the highest percentage through class of 2010 (White students accounted for 41.5% of graduates compared to Hispanic graduates at 40.2%). Starting with the class of 2011, Hispanic students accounted for the highest percentage (42.8%) of graduates as compared to other groups, including White students (38%).

If Gardner is interested in which group accounted for greater than 50 percent of graduates (“majority”), the last time any group accounted for at least 50 percent of graduates was with White students (50.7%) in the class of 2003.

Please let me know if this makes sense and if you need anything else.
