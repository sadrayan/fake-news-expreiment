In April 2015, a Photoshop-created image of a house standing atop a very narrow rock formation recirculated online.

The image’s creator, digital artist Jan Oliehoek, has also shared the image under a few titles of his own. He called it “Dream House” when it was posted to Deviant Art, and “Bond’s Neighbor” when it was awarded second place in the Worth 1000 web site’s “Bizarrchitecture 7” Photoshop contest. (The “Bond’s Neighbor” title was a reference to a Bizarrchitecture 3 submission dubbed “Bond’s Mansion.”)

Although the photograph is obviously a digital creation, it is based on the melding of two real sites. Oliehoek combined a photo of the Lichtenstein Castle near Baden-Württemberg, Germany, with one Ko Tapu (also known as Nail Island) in Thailand:

The latter formation earned the nickname “James Bond Island” after it was featured in a scene from The Man with the Golden Gun.
