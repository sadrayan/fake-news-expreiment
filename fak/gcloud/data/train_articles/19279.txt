Hurd Demands Answers for Constituents on Proposed Trans-Pecos Pipeline
San Antonio, TX – U.S Representative Will Hurd of the 23rd Congressional District of Texas released the following statement regarding the letter he submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC)regarding the proposed Trans-Pecos Pipeline:

"I have listened to a number of questions, comments and concerns from elected officials and constituents regarding the proposed Trans-Pecos Pipeline. In response, I have compiled an extensive list of concerns and inquiries put forward by my constituents and directed them to Energy Transfer Partners, the company proposing to build the pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners remains unfortunately vague on important details and should be more cooperative in addressing these matters.

For the reasons above, I am submitting a letter to FERC, who has federal jurisdiction over this project, which calls on them to address residents’ concerns over the proposed pipeline before it issues an approval. I share their frustration over the lack of transparency displayed by Energy Transfer Partners, and I believe each of them must be thoroughly addressed before FERC moves forward."
