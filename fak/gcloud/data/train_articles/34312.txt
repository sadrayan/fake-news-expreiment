New Ad In NJ-07 Highlights D.C. Lobbyist Tom Malinowski’s Dangerous Ideas
The ad contrasts Leonard Lance who is among the most bipartisan members of Congress with Tom Malinowski who is a partisan liberal

WASHINGTON – Congressional Leadership Fund (@CLFSuperPAC), the super PAC endorsed by House Republican leadership, today released a new ad, “Safe,” in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District. The ad contrasts Leonard Lance’s independent voice and bipartisan record with Tom Malinowski who is a partisan liberal and would vote with Nancy Pelosi for higher taxes and bigger government. The ad will run on television in the New York City media market and on digital platforms throughout the district.

“Leonard Lance is among the most bipartisan members in Congress, while Tom Malinowksi is a partisan liberal who would work for Nancy Pelosi if elected to Congress,” said Michael Byerly, CLF spokesman. “Malinowski’s policies are out of touch and dangerous – he supports higher taxes, bigger government, and even lobbied for terrorists’ rights. New Jersey families deserve better than Tom Malinowksi and his dangerous ideas.”

In addition to the ad campaign, CLF previously opened a field office in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District. Each CLF field office is supported by a full-time staffer and hundreds of interns and volunteers who engage with voters on a daily basis through hyper-targeted phone banking and door-to-door canvassing.

SCRIPT

VO: Leonard Lance. Rated among the most bipartisan in Congress.

An independent voice working for New Jersey.

If Tom Malinowski’s elected… he’ll work for Pelosi.

Partisan, liberal, Malinowski’s no centrist.

Way out there on everything that counts:

Higher taxes for New Jersey.

Budget-busting big government.

Your wallet’s not safe – and neither are you.

Malinowski lobbied for terrorists’ rights.

Dangerous ideas. Pelosi liberal. That’s Tom Malinowski.
