Boehner's condo, Pelosi's vineyard: A peek at leaders' wealth

Speaker John Boehner took out a half-million dollar loan to buy a new condo in Florida in 2014, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s husband continued to lose six-figure sums on a backwater football league, according to new financial disclosure records.

The details about the wealth of members of Congress became public late last week, giving an annual peek at the financial pictures of America’s most powerful lawmakers.

Boehner is worth at least $2.3 million. For the first time, Boehner disclosed a mortgage of between $500,000 and $1 million for his condo in Florida.

While most of Boehner’s assets are in managed funds, Pelosi and her husband Paul have a wide array of properties. For example, Pelosi made between $5,000 and $15,000 from selling grapes that were grown on her Napa vineyard. The vineyard itself is worth between $5 million and $25 million. Her husband lost between $100,000 and $1 million on the United Football League’s Sacramento Mountain Lions. Pelosi has a net worth of at least $29.3 million.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has assets worth at least $147,000. The No. 2 Republican also disclosed for the first time that his wife is working for the California Republican Party.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), meanwhile, has a minimum of $15,000 in assets. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) received an extension from the House Ethics Committee, which allows him to file his financial disclosure in August.

Members of Congress report their investment holdings and liabilities in wide ranges, so only a broad view of a lawmaker’s wealth is provided.
