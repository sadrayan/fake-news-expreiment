Harry Shearer Staying With ‘The Simpsons’ After All
UPDATED with Fox’s statement: Harry Shearer has agreed to return to The Simpsons fold after less than two months ago saying he quit the show when his contract negotiations broke down. It amounted to a virtual Twitter snit between Simpsons producers and Shearer, but now all is back to normal for the actor to return to the show he’s been a key part of for 26 years as a slew of characters including Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner and many more.

The deal means all six original The Simpsons voice cast members — Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria and Shearer — will return for the series’ just-renewed 27th and 28th seasons. At 625 episodes and counting, The Simpsons is primetime TV’s longest-running scripted show.

Back in May, things didn’t look so good. The contract stalemate escalated on Twitter with Shearer tweeting late one night that he would be leaving the show: “From (Simpsons executive producer) James L. Brooks’ lawyer: ‘Show will go on, Harry will not be part of it, wish him the best,’ ” Shearer wrote, adding, “This because I wanted what we’ve always had: the freedom to do other work. Of course, I wish him the very best.”

Shearer was the most vocal Simpsons voice cast member during a 2011 contract dispute. He was insisting on getting a piece of the animated juggernaut’s lucrative backend, whose value flexed its muscles in a big way with the $1 billion off-network syndication deal at FX in 2013.

Here is Fox’s official announcement of the cast’s return:
