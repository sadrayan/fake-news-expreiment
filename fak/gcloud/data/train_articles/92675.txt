Chugging beers with Creepy Uncle Sam
Generation Opportunity, the group working to dissuade young people from signing up for Obamacare, brought its raucous brand of politics to the University of Miami on Saturday.

A tailgate party at the UM-Virginia Tech football game featured a DJ, tons of free beer, liquor and pizza.

And Creepy Uncle Sam.

"We rolled in with a fleet of Hummers, F-150’s and Suburbans, each vehicle equipped with an 8’ high balloon bouquet floating overhead. We hired a popular student DJ from UMiami (DJ Joey), set up OptOut cornhole sets, beer pong tables*, bought 75 pizzas, and hired 8 “brand ambassadors” aka models with bullhorns to help out," David Pasch, the group's communication director, wrote in an email. "*Student activists independently brought (lots of) beer and liquor for consumption by those 21 and over. Oh yeah, and we educated students about their healthcare options outside the expensive and creepy Obamacare exchanges."

He said about 250 people attended, including 100 UM College Republicans who helped promote the event over the past couple weeks and worked the crowd. Judging from the pictures, it seems some were there more for the party than the message.
