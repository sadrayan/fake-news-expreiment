White House Reviewing Stephen Moore’s Writings
WASHINGTON — The White House is reviewing past writings by Stephen Moore, the conservative commentator whom President Trump plans to nominate to the Federal Reserve Board, amid criticism that many of his opinion columns denigrated women, and enthusiasm for his candidacy appeared to be waning among Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday morning that the writings of Mr. Moore, who has not yet been nominated, were under review by the White House. “When we have an update on that front, we’ll let you know,” Ms. Sanders said.

Mr. Moore apologized on Sunday for some, but not all, of his past writings in an appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” saying that he did not remember everything he had written over his career. “Frankly, I didn’t even remember writing some of these they were so long ago,” he said, adding that he was embarrassed by some of the pieces.

Mr. Moore has written that it may be dangerous for women to earn more than men and has criticized women’s athletic abilities. On Sunday, he tried to shift the focus from his writings to his critics, saying, “I think most fair-minded people think this has been kind of a sleaze campaign against me.”
