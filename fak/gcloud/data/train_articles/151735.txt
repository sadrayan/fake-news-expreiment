Work remains the most common reason for international migration

Long-Term International Migration (LTIM) estimated that 275,000 people immigrated for work-related reasons in year ending (YE) March 2017, down from 303,000 for the previous year. This difference was not statistically significant but this is the lowest recorded estimate since YE September 2014. The majority immigrated with a definite job (188,000) but fewer people arrived looking for work (down 39,000 to 87,000 – a statistically significant decrease).

International Passenger Survey (IPS) data shows that the reason for immigration varies by nationality with EU immigrants accounting for the majority (60%) of people arriving for work (Figure 4). Differences in reason for immigration are likely to reflect the differing rights of EU and non-EU citizens to migrate to the UK, as well as the effect of government policies and other factors (such as economic conditions in origin countries).

The decrease in people looking for work was accounted for by EU citizens, down 29,000 to 47,000 in the YE March 2017 (statistically significant). EU15 citizens looking for work decreased by 12,000 (statistically significant), while EU8 and EU2 each saw a decrease of 9,000 (not statistically significant) (Figure 6).

The estimate of non-EU immigrants arriving to work (72,000) in YE March 2017 was the same as the previous year. Of these, 20,000 (28%) arrived looking for work, which is likely to be accounted for by people granted visas under the Youth Mobility Scheme.

Most non-EU citizens arriving for work will be coming to take skilled jobs. Home Office visa statistics show that the number of visas granted for longer than 12 months to skilled workers fell by 4,780 (6.6%) to 67,322 in YE June 2017. More details of nationality and sector of work are provided in the Home Office Immigration Statistics release.

The IPS shows that an estimated 33,000 British citizens arrived for work reasons. Of these around half (16,000) arrived looking for work.

For emigration (LTIM estimates), work accounted for over half (182,000) of all emigrants in YE March 2017. Similar to immigration, people emigrating for work-related reasons were more likely to emigrate to a definite job (an increase of 21,000 to 122,000 (statistically significant)) – the highest recorded estimate since YE September 2012. Fewer people emigrated looking for work, 60,000, a decrease of 9,000 (not statistically significant).

An increase in people emigrating with a definite job was seen across all main citizenship groups (none were statistically significant changes) in the year to YE March 2017. There was a 9,000 (not statistically significant) decrease in emigrants looking for work, which was accounted for by non-EU citizens who saw a statistically significant decrease of 8,000.

More detailed LTIM and IPS estimates over time can be found in Tables 2 and 3 in the accompanying datasets.

Further work-related immigration data

In addition to the Long-Term International Migration (LTIM) and International Passenger Survey (IPS) estimates, further detail on work-related immigration is available from a number of sources including:

Home Office visa statistics

Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) National Insurance number (NINo) allocations

Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates on UK and non-UK people in the labour market

Differences between these sources are described in Comparing sources of international migration statistics.

Work-related visas (non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals)

In the year ending (YE) June 2017, the number of sponsored skilled work (Tier 2) visas, including dependants, was 1% lower than the previous year at 93,000. Tier 5 youth mobility and temporary visas were 4% lower at 42,000. In the YE June 2017, in all work categories there were 164,000 work-related visas (including dependants) granted, 2% lower than YE June 2016 (Table 4).

Indian nationals accounted for 58% of total skilled work visas granted (53,366 of 92,805); and the information technology sector sponsored 42% of skilled work visa applications.

More detailed statistics by citizenship, industry sector and the underlying data can be found in the Home Office Immigration Statistics release. Due to differing definitions these visa data are not directly comparable with long-term immigration estimates from the International Passenger Survey, as explained in the comparing sources article.

How many adult overseas nationals register for a National Insurance number (NINo)?

National Insurance number (NINo) registrations and IPS estimates should not be directly compared. NINo figures include short-term migrants and registration may not have taken place in the same period as arrival (as explained in further detail the information on the differences article).

In the year ending (YE) June 2017:

there were 771,000 NINo registrations overall, a decrease of 7% on the previous year

there were 576,000 NINo registrations from EU nationals, a decrease of 9% on the previous year

NINo registrations to EU15 (217,000) and EU8 (138,000) fell by 5% and 21% respectively; registrations from the EU2 fell by 3% to 218,000

there were 194,000 NINo registrations from non-EU nationals, an increase of 1% on the previous year

Following a recent peak in 2015, the total number of NINo registrations has been falling – this is mainly because of a fall from the EU (in particular the EU8) while registrations from outside the EU have remained broadly level. A similar pattern is reported in the International Passenger Survey (IPS) work-related long-term immigration estimates although for the latest year EU15 immigration for work increased slightly (not statistically significant).

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) statistical first release on NINo registrations and the summary tables provide more detail alongside the background information.

NINo allocations to adult overseas nationals and nationality at point of NINo registration of DWP working age benefit recipients (NINo benefit claimants) are no longer badged as National Statistics. The statistics continue to be published as Official Statistics following Office for Statistics Regulation reassessment of the statistics. The full assessment can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website in a report on the reassessment of the NINo statistics.

Overseas nationals in the UK labour market

Labour market statistics are estimates of the stock of people working in the UK and are not designed to provide a measure of migration flows. As a result, changes in the labour market stock cannot be directly compared with long-term net migration.

Estimates of the UK and non-UK population involved in the labour market (employed, unemployed and economically inactive) by nationality and country of birth were recently published. These statistics are derived from the Labour Force Survey up to the latest period that is, April to June 2017. Latest estimates showed there were 3.56 million non-UK nationals in employment in the UK, 199,000 were unemployed and 1.12 million were economically inactive.

An in-depth analysis of the labour market characteristics of UK, EU and non-EU nationals in the UK in 2016 was published in April 2017.

Study was the second most common reason for migration

Long-Term International Migration (LTIM) estimates show that immigration for study (139,000) was the second most common reason for migration in year ending (YE) March 2017. Immigration to study saw a statistically significant decrease of 27,000 compared with the previous year. (See LTIM data in Table 2, Chart 2a and 2b in the accompanying datasets).

Student immigration follows a seasonal pattern, with the majority of international students arriving between July and September. As such, annual figures typically change in the YE September period. Therefore, the 27,000 statistically significant decrease from YE March 2016 to YE March 2017 is to be expected following similar figures in the last 2 quarters.

International Passenger Survey (IPS) data show that, of those whose main reason for long-term immigration was study, the majority (93,000 or 69%) were non-EU citizens (Figure 6) – a statistically significant decrease of 20,000 on the previous year. The comparable number of visas issued over the year to YE March 2017 to non-EU students for 12 months or more reported by the Home Office rose by 5% to 142,128.

As noted, there is a difference between the long-term IPS estimates for immigration to study and the numbers of long-term student visas issued by the Home Office. There are a range of potential reasons why the data sources might differ, such as: timing, stated intentions and length of stay, sampling variability in the survey and if a visa was used or not, as discussed in the student section in the Migration Statistics Quarterly Report: Feb 2017 statistical bulletin. Differences are explained further in Comparing sources of international migration statistics article.

Home Office visa data provide additional detail for non-EU migrant students. The most recent data for YE June 2017 shows the total sponsored visa applications to study (for all visa lengths) from non-EU nationals (main applicants only) rose by 3% to 203,816.

This included changes in visa applications to study as follows:

a rise for higher education (to 170,929, up 5%); within this total, applications to Russell Group universities rose by 9%

a rise for English language schools (to 2,940, up 20%)

falls for further education sector (to 14,445, down 9%), and independent schools (to 12,895, down 6%)

More than one-third of non-EU study visas were granted to Chinese students (up by 12,000 or 17% compared with a year earlier).

More detailed estimates over time can be found for LTIM in Table 2 and for IPS in Table 3 in the accompanying datasets. More detailed statistics and underlying data on visas for study reasons can be found in the Home Office Immigration Statistics release.

Other reasons for international migration

Long-Term International Migration (LTIM) estimates for year ending (YE) March 2017 for other reasons include:

to accompany or join others (80,000 immigrants; 29,000 emigrants)

other reasons (63,000 immigrants; 33,000 emigrants)

no stated reason (31,000 immigrants; 74,000 emigrants)

International Passenger Survey (IPS) estimates showed that 51,000 non-British citizens emigrated to return home to live in YE March 2017 a statistically significant increase of 34,000 compared with the previous year (Figure 6). These were mostly EU citizens (44,000, up 20,000 from YE March 2016) half of whom were from EU8 countries (all statistically significant changes).

These were the largest estimates for EU and EU8 citizens since December 2008.

More detailed estimates over time can be found for LTIM in Table 2 and for IPS in Table 3 in the accompanying datasets. More detailed statistics and underlying data on visas family reasons can be found in the Home Office Immigration Statistics release.

How many people are granted asylum in the UK?

The Home Office publishes data on asylum applications, grants and persons resettled. In the year ending (YE) June 2017, a total of 16,211 people were granted asylum, resettlement or an alternative form of protection. This is a 7% increase from 15,108 in the previous year.

Of the 16,211 total, 9,350 were grants of asylum or an alternative form of protection to main applicants and their dependants following an in-country application for asylum (a decrease of 2,319 from the previous year). An additional 6,861 people were brought to the UK under various resettlement schemes (an increase of 3,422 from the previous year).

Over 8,500 Syrian nationals have been granted humanitarian protection under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme since it began in 2014.

In 2016, the largest number of applications for asylum came from nationals of Iran (4,184), followed by Pakistan (2,870) and Iraq (2,672). Grant rates for asylum and other forms of protection vary considerably between nationalities. For example, at initial decision, the grant rate for Iranian nationals was 37% (1,456 grants), compared with 12% (285 grants) for Iraqi nationals. Overall, there were 8,465 grants at initial decision for all nationalities in 2016, which corresponds to a grant rate of 34%. A separate Home Office analysis shows that for the years 2013 to 2015, on average 37% of decisions were granted initially, but this proportion rose to 52% after appeal.

More detailed statistics and underlying data on asylum and protection can be found in the Home Office Immigration Statistics release.
