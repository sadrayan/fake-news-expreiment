October 11, 2010 More Obama Vacation Photos Posted by Van Helsing at October 11, 2010 8:45 AM Unemployment numbers are not looking good in our new Era of Big Government, with official unemployment at 9.6% and 95,000 jobs lost in September. At least Americans can take solace in that the tax money we manage to scrape together has provided weeks of fun for the happy couple in the White House, which has been lifting our spirits with cheery vacation photos. Here are some more for our vicarious enjoyment (click pics for full size):









Compliments of Air2air.







OMG! Keep them coming! They just keep getting better! Posted by: Karl at October 11, 2010 9:02 AM If the Socialist fits............ Spot on! Posted by: Oiao at October 11, 2010 9:03 AM I forgot to add. Obama hates white people. Apparently, he also hates all other U.S. Citizens of any color too. Posted by: Oiao at October 11, 2010 9:04 AM A2a - very nice shadow techniques. :-) You Rock! Posted by: Oiao at October 11, 2010 9:06 AM Great work ! May I suggest the first picture, of the hungry family, could also be "completed" with the addition of the Idler in Chief working hard at his ice cream cone (from the Maine vacation). Posted by: ObowOUT at October 11, 2010 9:09 AM A2a - Fantastic work! You've gotten in the heads of Doug Ross & IOwnTheWorld also. Keep up the great work. Posted by: AlinskyRules at October 11, 2010 9:10 AM I'm glad that you are showing that photo of me and my kids last month, but I wish I would have had time to put on makeup. Posted by: Mom at October 11, 2010 9:26 AM Awesome! Better than the first crop; the first pic has just the right touch of out-of-focus on MissHell doing the hula hoop... More please!

It really means a lot and it's all for you. If anybody knows a good original photo of Worf and Hubby doing something similar please post a link... Posted by: Air2air at October 11, 2010 10:51 AM Doesn't anyone remember the starvation and deprivation these families and their children endured? Never mind the truth of the matter that BO really is an SOB and doesn't give a tinker's damn about this country -- only his aims to rule over it. Like hell you will!!

Posted by: Hesperornis at October 11, 2010 11:45 AM The 'shadow' unemployment rate is over 17%. Posted by: TrickleUpPolitics at October 11, 2010 12:23 PM @ TrickleUpPolitics at October 11, 2010 12:23 PM It is somewhere around or above 26% for 25 and younger, the same 'base' get out the vote that Obummer is trying to drum up right now. Ouch. Talk about putting a stick in your own eye. Posted by: Oiao at October 11, 2010 12:42 PM Glad to see pictures of Mooshelle included. Posted by: Coastal Eddie at October 11, 2010 1:22 PM If we look forward, we despair.

But look back and see hope.

We survived that horror and actually improved our lives. We will survive this one.

Actually the photos saddened me very much. They are real people in them, real children, real fathers, real mothers. Someone could look at them now and say, hey, that's my uncle/aunt/gran/dad/mom.

Time to lighten up.

Old depression grace. For rabbit old, and rabbit cold

For rabbit tender, rabbit tough

Thank you Lord

We've had enough.

Posted by: Anonymous at October 11, 2010 1:55 PM I can imagine the hatred and revulsion that these photos draw out of our "Progressive" friends: "Eeeewwww, White trash!!!!" or "Look like typical Tea Partiers", etc., etc., etc.... Posted by: Toa at October 11, 2010 4:53 PM Lol...Toa you make an excellent point.
