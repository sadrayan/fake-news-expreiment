CNN’s Brooke Baldwin Responds to Critics After Saying Vets ‘Ready to Do Battle’ in Baltimore
CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin quickly became the subject of scorn for a comment she made Tuesday afternoon about veterans who happen to serve as law enforcement officers, suggesting that they might be more trigger-happy than most cops.

While interviewing Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) about the necessity of police training in Baltimore, the setting for days of destructive riots, Baldwin said:

We talk about training, we talk about having officers — I was talking to the city councilman last week. He said, Brooke, these people have to live in the community. There’s a lack of emotional investment. And a lot of young people — and I’ve been talking about there so much. A lot of young people — and I love our nation’s veterans, but some are coming back from war, they don’t know the communities, and they’re ready to do battle.

As soon as she said that, however, conservative media reacted:

This is an idiotic, unproductive, and utterly incorrect assertion about veterans. http://t.co/lKWSudUHuL Hire veterans. — Logan Dobson (@LoganDobson) April 28, 2015

Etcetera.

But the sheer amount of tweets contained within that “etcetera” were enough to elicit this response from Baldwin:

Folks. Please don't misunderstand me. Dear friends/family of mine are veterans. I was repeating a concern vocalized to me lately. That's it. — Brooke Baldwin (@BrookeBCNN) April 28, 2015

Which may have not actually helped quell the critics:

I wasn't going to say anything about @BrookeBCNN's comment but she's made it worse. Says it was anecdotal from friends/family. Reckless. — Tommy (@FirstTeamTommy) April 28, 2015
