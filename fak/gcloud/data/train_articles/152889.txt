About Roswell Park’s Cuban Collaboration
Roswell Park Cancer Institute began working collaboratively with scientists from the Center for Molecular Immunology, or Centro de Inmunologia Molecular (CIM), in Havana, Cuba, in 2011.

This research partnership with the CIM, highlighted in a Department of Commerce fact sheet, took an important step forward with our participation in the trade mission to Cuba led by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in April 2015. Since then, we’ve been working with our Cuban colleagues to plan for a U.S. clinical trial using CIMAvax-EGF, a therapeutic lung cancer vaccine developed by the CIM.

We finalized our Investigational New Drug application which seeks permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct an early-stage clinical trial with CIMAvax-EGF. With FDA approval, a clinical trial in patients with advanced lung cancer could begin in late 2016.
