Kanye West rolls up to AIDS benefit in Mercedes-McLaren SLR Stirling Moss
While we didn't exactly expect rapper Kanye West to show up to an AIDS charity gala in Cannes, France in something modest like an A-Class, we admit we didn't see a Mercedes-Benz McLaren SLR Stirling Moss coming. After all, while we're all for driving the limited-edition Mac over all of creation if you're of the means to own one, but somehow, showing up to a charity event in a million-dollar bit of rolling exhibitionism seems a wee bit cheesy. Especially when it's probably someone else's car.Still, the Mercedes-Benz looks fantastic in the wild, even at a blistering 5 mph.
