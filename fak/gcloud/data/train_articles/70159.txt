Hunger Prevention
Overview

Hunger is a concern for millions of Americans, but many people don't realize its disproportionate effect on children. Nearly 13 million children struggle with hunger in the United States. That's 1 in 6 kids. As an extension of the Hunger Prevention campaign first launched in 2008, the new Child Hunger PSAs feature real life moments that illustrate the lengths people go to help kids every day, whether it’s finding the owner of a lost toy or picking up a dropped sippy cup.

Yet there’s more we can do to help children in real need. After all, with all this enthusiasm and strength in numbers, it makes no sense that kids should go hungry. The new campaign, which includes television, radio, print, outdoor and digital PSAs, encourages viewers to visit FeedingAmerica.org to support the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks and join the fight to end hunger in America.

Additionally, a supportive PSA effort promotes the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), a service administered by many Feeding America food banks across the country. SFSP provides children who rely on subsidized meals during the school year with free and nutritious meals over the summer months. The campaign draws attention to the fact that,"summer isn't fun when you're hungry" and encourages parents to visit feedingamerica.org/summermeals to find free meals for their children through their local Feeding America food bank.
