RELEASE: Alex Sink Opposes Senate Bill 6, Stresses Need for Local Control of Decisions for our Students and Schools

Tampa, FL Florida CFO and Gubernatorial Candidate Alex Sink today announced her opposition to Senate Bill 6 and released the following statement:

"These proposals are bad for our children and our state. As a mother whose two children went to Florida public schools, I feel strongly that our local school districts should be the ones making these kinds of decisions for our students and teachers -- not politicians in Tallahassee. I also have a serious problem with placing even more unfunded mandates on our local school districts, as they are already facing significant budget concerns."
