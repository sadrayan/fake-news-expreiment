FACT CHECK: Teen Playing 'Pokemon Go' Stabbed and Mugged for His iPhone
On 6 July 2016, the web site Cartel Press published an article reporting that a teenager was stabbed when he accidentally wandered into a “bad” Chicago neighborhood while playing the new “Pokemon Go” app:

17 Year-old Marcus Jackson was stabbed and mugged for his iPhone after allegedly playing “Pokemon Go” a new app released by the franchise on July 6. Police say Jackson was just walking around playing “Pokemon Go” and didn’t realize he had stepped into what is know as a bad neighborhood. A local store owner said he saw Marcus Jackson was stabbed and his belongings stolen right after recording the incident he immediately called the Chicago police department.

There is no truth to the above-quoted story: This article is just another clickbait fabrication published by a fake news site.
