You No Longer Need To Be A Costco Member To Shop In Their Stores
For a lot of people, Costco is that one place where you can buy a month’s supply of granola bars, 72-pound wheel of Mozzarella cheese, and socks and toilet paper that’ll last you for the next century. It’s their happy place.

And in all honestly, it is a pretty magical place. People love Costco so much, that one couple actually decided to do their engagement photos there and one little girl even had a Costco-themed birthday party. Yep, Costco is no joke for some people.

But this happy place does come with a bit of a price. Not only do shoppers have to pay a minimum $60 membership fee per year, but they also have to work fairly hard at transporting all the items to their home.

If you are one of those shoppers who love Costco, but are dealing with these issues, you are going to love this.

TODAY reports that Instacart, which is a same-day grocery delivery service, will be delivering Costco goodies right to your door.

They have reportedly partnered up with the warehouse club. Best part? You don’t need to purchase that $60 membership fee.

This just made shopping at Costco a whole lot better and way more easier. So you might be wondering how exactly this works.
