Dave Brat: 'Big Money,' Soros Trying to Defeat My Independent Voice
Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) says left-wing groups funded by globalist left-wing billionaire George Soros are trying to defeat his “independent voice” in Washington, DC, by pouring millions into his opponent, Abigail Spanberger.

In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot, Brat told Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House that millions in “Big Money” is being spent to take down his populist voice in C0ngress.

“The irony is [the Democrats] are getting the Big Money,” Brat said.

Brat revealed to Breitbart News that Spanberger has received more than $2 million from the left-wing activist group ActBlue, which is partially funded by Soros.

“[Abigail Spanberger] got $2.2 million from ActBlue … that is the George Soros resistance group,” Brat said. “That’s not even Democrat. This is the group that’s doing the riots in Portland. That’s promoting violence and mobs instead of jobs.”

“They know the truth of the matter,” Brat said of the opposition against him. “I’m one of the few independent voices up there that votes on principle for the American people.”
