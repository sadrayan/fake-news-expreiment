Blunt on Obamacare Vote: “Time for Senate Democrats to Start Making Things Right”
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) today urged Senate Democrats to work with Republicans to repeal Obamacare and clear the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. A vote on legislation that provides Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare is expected in the Senate later today.



“Democrats have failed to live up to nearly every promise they made when they forced Obamacare through Congress without a single Republican vote,” Blunt said. “Despite all of their claims to the contrary, this law has forced millions of Americans off the plans and doctors they liked and could afford, drastically driven up premiums and deductibles, and slashed the number of health plan options available to families.”



This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges. Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options. In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent.



Blunt continued, “Now is the time for Senate Democrats to start making things right. They’ll have that opportunity today when the Senate considers a resolution that gives Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare and pave the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care. By taking this first step toward repealing Obamacare, Republicans are keeping the promises we made to the American people. I urge all of my Democrat colleagues to do the same.”
