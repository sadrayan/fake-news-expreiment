'Bored' migrants BEMOAN lack of cash to buy cigarettes and slow internet in camps
Refugees occupying the Ter Apel camp in the Netherlands have bemoaned the lack of comforts inside the centre, claiming they have become "bored" as a result.

An astonishing video that emerged online shows the migrants protesting against the living conditions they currently have to endure.

In the footage one unhappy migrant tells how he does not get enough food, claiming that his "breakfast is small" and he is not provided a substantial lunch either.

He goes on to complain about how he cannot buy cigarettes because the authorities have not provided him with enough money.
