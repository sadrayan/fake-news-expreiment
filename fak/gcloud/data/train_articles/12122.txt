The Gettysburg Address
Contemporary Reactions



Chicago Tribune: "The dedicatory remarks by President Lincoln will live among the annals of man."

Chicago Times: "The cheeks of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly, flat, and dishwatery utterances."

Springfield (Mass.) Republican: "Surprisingly fine as Mr. Everett’s oration was in the Gettysburg consecration, the rhetorical honors of the occasion were won by President Lincoln. His little speech is a perfect gem; deep in feeling, compact in thought and expression, and tasteful and elegant in every word and comma. Then it has the merit of unexpectedness in its verbal perfection and beauty… Turn back and read it over, it will repay study as a model speech. Strong feelings and a large brain are its parents."



New York Times. Friday, November 20, 1863.
