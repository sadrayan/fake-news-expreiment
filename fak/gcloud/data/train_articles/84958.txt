By the turn of the last century, our company's influence as International Harvester stretched around the world. While the past few decades found us focused on North America, locations around the globe once again power Navistar's business. Today, our products, parts, and services are sold throughout a network of nearly 1,000 dealer outlets in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Mexico and more than 60 dealers in 90 countries throughout the world. With facilities on six continents - including North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia - we have the power to provide the most strategic and innovative technology solutions to our customers, no matter where they are.
