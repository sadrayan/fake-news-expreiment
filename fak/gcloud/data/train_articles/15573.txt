Please see the answers to your follow up questions below:

In your reply, you said the department “has staff resources that can be flexed to handle influxes in applications.” Can you elaborate on how many staff are in place and what it means to “flex” for such purposes?

ATD has 8.5 administrative personnel which could assist with processing applications (3.5 positions are within the parking/vehicles-for-hire division) and at least 5 professional staff that could be flexed to review reports.

How much would each background check cost? A Uber spokeswoman, Jaime Moore, tells us the cost is $150. $39.95 is the cost per person.

What is the basis of that cost figure? Staff had discussion with parties involved in fingerprinting process and determined rates. This is what it costs for checks we do for other driver background checks for other vehicles for hire.

Has the City or Austin City Council decided to cover those costs? No
