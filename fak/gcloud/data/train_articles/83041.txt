Pelosi Claims to Not Know Who Gruber Is, Says ‘He Didn’t Help Write Our Bill’
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has joined in with the White House’s attempt to distance itself from a key figure in the creation of the Affordable Care Act who claimed the bill was passed with help from “lack of transparency” and “the stupidity of the American voter.”

MIT professor Jonathan Gruber — who assisted congressional staffers in writing the bill — made such claims last year during an academic conference, but the video only became widely-viewed this week. He has since appeared on MSNBC to call the comments “inappropriate,” but did not deny his underlying point.

Thursday morning the White House told TPM that Gruber’s comments were “simply not true.” And according to Washington Post reporter Sean Sullivan, Pelosi has taken it a step further by dismissing Gruber’s role in the bill altogether:

Pelosi on Gruber: "I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill." — Sean Sullivan (@WaPoSean) November 13, 2014

According to the New York Times, however:

After Mr. Gruber helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal, the White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation.

UPDATE — 11:49 a.m. ET: Back in 2009, Pelosi’s website cited Gruber on matters of health care policy, even coining the phrase “the Gruber analysis.” Though, to be fair, that’s her website; not her personally. More on Gruber’s connection to the bill here as well.

UPDATE — 12:24 p.m. ET: Watch video below of Pelosi stumbling through her dismissal of Gruber:
