Breaking: George W. Bush Breaks Silence With Incredible Statement About Trump
Ever since Donald Trump became the president of the United States, he had to deal with a lot of hostility, injustice and tricky situations. Even though his administration is among the best administrations that America has ever had, Democrats are using every opportunity to go against him. Liberals and their media have been spreading lies about the president and his administration for as long as we can remember.

Unfortunately, many Americans believed them and turned against Trump. That is exactly what the mainstream media wants, that’s why they continue to write fake news about him.

However, the majority of the people (at least those who can think for themselves) do believe in Trump and dismiss the media’s misconceptions.

But even they are surprised by this recent statement regarding this successful administration. That statement came from former president George W. Bush. He was out of the public eye for a while, but now it seems he’s back. He recently had an interview with Matt Lauer of NBC in which he spoke about President Trump, and said:

“When I was president, you (the major networks) mattered a lot more. Because there were, like, three of you. And now there are all kinds of information being bombarded out. People can say things anonymously, and it is just a different world.”

Bush openly admits that he is not alongside the media that mistreats President Trump. We additionally do not aline with how the media doesn’t show any proper treatment for our President. But, no matter what occurs in the future, the President will have our support. Trump will segue to make our country a better concept for everyone’s sake. He has shown times and times again that by his successes, we become greater as a nation, and certainly this is the strongest this country has been in years.
