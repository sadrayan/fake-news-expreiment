Hudson's Bay Company Archives

Hudson’s Bay Company Archives (HBCA), home to the archival records of Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC), is part of the Archives of Manitoba operating under The Archives and Recordkeeping Act (2003) and 1994 gift agreement between HBC and the Government of Manitoba. HBCA operations are supported in part through the ongoing financial support of the Hudson's Bay Company History Foundation.

HBCA acquires and preserves archival records of HBC and other records related to HBC history, such as private records of individuals and subsidiary companies (including the North West Company), and encourages the use and understanding of these records.
