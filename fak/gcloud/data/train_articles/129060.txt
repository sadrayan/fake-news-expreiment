KINGS MILLS, OHIO -- A little more than 24 hours after her death on I-71 in Warren County, Leelah Joshua Alcorn is being mourned and remembered as “a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old.”

“Our thoughts and prayers are with Joshua's family and friends at this tragic time,” said Dawn Gould, Community Relations Coordinator for Kings Local Schools.

Alcorn, a Kings Mill resident and former Kings Schools student, died around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after a tractor trailer hit her as she walked along the southbound lanes of the highway near the South Lebanon exit.

Ohio State Highway Patrol responded to the incident that remains under investigation.

The driver of the 2006 Freightliner semi that struck Alcorn was wearing his seatbelt when the incident occurred, OSP said. The driver has not been charged with a crime in the crash.

Alcorn most recently enrolled in the 11th grade at the Ohio Virtual Academy, Gould said.

After hearing about Alcorn’s death, the district placed counselors on call for anyone needing to speak about the loss. That number, on the Kings district website , is 513-398-8050 at either ext. 11001 or 11000.

“In addition, counselors will be available for students on their return next week from Winter Break,” Gould said.

Alcorn is survived by parents Carla and Doug Alcorn, brother Justin, and sisters Tiffany and Amanda.

The Kings High School basketball teams also plan to have a moment of silence during upcoming games.
