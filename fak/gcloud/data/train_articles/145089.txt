Gay aap 'sexually assaults' 6 guys
Six men so far have been groped and sexually assaulted by the varkerige aap during the past few weeks, reports the South Africa Morning Post.

Somizi, named after flamboyant Idols judgeSomizi Mhlongo, is said to appear out of nowhere, gryps the ouens, does his monkey business, then lets them go.

He has apparently never attacked a female.

One of the villagers, named George Chiune, said he was on his way home from a shebeen when he was grabbed and forced down on the ground by Somizi.

“I thought he wanted to kill me, but realised it was after my bum,” said George.

All six victims of Somizi's were taken to hospital after experiencing acute anal pain and fatigue. The doctors then confirmed the men have anal cancer.

It is an unusual thing for a baboon to travel alone, even more so for it to single out targets.

Somizi is thought to be an outcast because of his preference for male companionship.

One specialist, Lizzie McKenzie, said it was not unusual for male baboons to travel alone when kicked out: “It is very strange that they just attack men. It beats me. I have never seen this behaviour in my 20 years in this field.”

Fearing for the children, all the boys in the village are made to wear dresses to school and around the village so Somizi won’t target them.
