Thanks.

In this story, you’re quoted as saying global warming is on “pause.” What did you mean?

PolitiFact reporters wrote this fact check in July. Do you see errors in it? Please be specific.

We are now reviewing the claim I mentioned earlier, that the Earth is not warming. How would you analyze that?

Thanks very much.

I can’t tell from your testimony if you have concluded that the globe is not warming or not.
