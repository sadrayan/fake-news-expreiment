MURPHY, FRANKEL BRING LOCAL CONCERNS WITH ALL ABOARD FLORIDA TO U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY
Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Patrick E. Murphy (FL-18) and Congresswoman Lois Frankel (FL-22) met with U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx to discuss issues facing South Florida and the Treasure Coast in regards to the pending All Aboard Florida (AAF) project, which would link Miami and Orlando.

“There is no doubt that this project will have an effect on the lives of my constituents, from the Palm Beaches across the Treasure Coast, and it is vital that the Department of Transportation take into consideration the impact it will have on the safety, economy, and livability of our communities,” said Murphy. “I thank the Secretary for taking the time to discuss the concerns of local residents and look forward to working together to have these concerns addressed.”

“I look forward to a review of the project, and its economic and quality of life impact,” said Frankel.

The two Members of Congress will be sending a follow up letter to Secretary Foxx later this week outlining outstanding questions and concerns raised by stakeholders.
