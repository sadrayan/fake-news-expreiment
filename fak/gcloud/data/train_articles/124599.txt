Olympic shooting 2016: Kim Rhode wins bronze in women's skeet
American shooter Kim Rhode won the bronze medal in women's skeet shooting at the 2016 Olympics on Friday. She finished third behind two Italians, gold medalist Diana Bacosi and silver medalist Chiana Cainero. This is Bacosi's first Olympic medal after beating Cainero, 15-14, in the gold medal match.

Rhode, who was considered a favorite in this event, beat China's Wei Meng in the bronze medal match via a shootout. Each shooter scored 15 during the normal session, then Rhode topped Ming, 7-6, in the shootout to clinch the bronze medal.

This is the third straight Olympic medal in this event for Rhode, who won silver in 2008 and gold in 2012. She's the only American woman to win a skeet shooting medal since the event was added to the Olympic roster in 2000. Cainero beat Rhode for the gold eight years ago in Beijing.

The competition started in the morning with qualifying, which included 21 participants from 17 countries. The top six finishers in qualifying advanced to the semifinals.

Meng took the top spot in the qualifying round with score of 73 points. Rhode and Bacosi each finished with 72 points, while Cainero and Great Britain's Amber Hill rounded out the top five. The sixth and final spot in the semifinals was decided in a shootout between the United States' Morgan Craft, Russia's Albina Shakirova and Argentina's Melisa Gil, with Craft advancing.

In the semifinals, Cainero (16 points) and Bacosi (15 points) took the top two spots, while Meng, Rhode and Craft had a shootout for the bronze medal match spots after tying with 14 points apiece. Meng and Rhode came out there to prevent an all-American bronze medal match.

This is the second gold medal in women's skeet shooting for Italy after Cainero's gold in 2008.
