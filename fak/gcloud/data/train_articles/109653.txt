The octagonal shape of the early Nabisco logos were taken from a Uneeda Biscuit, the company's first flagship product. The "IN-ER SEAL" was a reference to the sealed sleeves that held the crackers, innovative for the time.The Nabisco logo moved to the top left corner of its packages in 1952. The words "NATIONAL BISCUIT COMPANY" regularly appeared beneath the logo throughout the 50s.This logo is still the current logo in Japan.

This logo is used until 2008 in many Asian countries, where is currently used the Kraft Foods logo on its product. Note the font is minus larger in tandem with its predecessor.
