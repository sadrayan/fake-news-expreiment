Scott Rothstein built the biggest Ponzi scheme in Florida
A Ponzi scheme unlike Any Other Con Scott Rothstein built the biggest Ponzi scheme in Florida history with more flair, showmanship and daring than Bernard Madoff ever dreamed of. Always putting himself in the limelight, Rothstein manipulated others by any means possible: He played on lust by providing call girls and orgies, greed with unheard-of investment returns, and sympathy by becoming South Floridaâ€™s premier philanthropist. From New York to Las Vegas, Texas to Miami, Israel to Morocco, he convinced savvy hedge fund managers and Mafia dons alike to throw hundreds of millions of dollars toward non-existent law firm settlements.
