Description

Dr. No (United Artists, 1962). Lobby Cards (4) (11" X 14").

With this film, the movie-going public was introduced to author Ian Fleming's British superspy, James Bond, Agent 007 with a license to kill, dashingly played by the tough-as-nails Sean Connery. A taut and suspenseful action picture, this film spawned one of the most successful franchises in movie history. Offered here are four cards from the initial lobby set. One card shows some water damage in the right border, another card has some smudging on the right side, the other two cards are in superb condition. If you've been wanting to add paper from this title to your collection, now is your chance! Very Fine.
