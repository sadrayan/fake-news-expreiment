LAPD Chief Charlie Beck disputes Trump's remark on release of immigrant in U.S. illegally
“Statements that ICE failed to file detainers for each of Mr. Ramirez’ arrests are incorrect,” said the spokeswoman, Sarah Rodriguez. “ICE has placed three detainers on Mr. Ramirez in the last six months, all of which were not honored, leaving Mr. Ramirez free to reoffend in an escalating fashion rather than be placed in immigration court proceedings and removed from the United States.”
