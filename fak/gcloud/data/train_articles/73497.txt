The morning after Halloween, Facebook feeds are filled with pictures of costumes from the night before. While most are creative, funny or spooky, a poorly thought out and distasteful costume can occasionally make an appearance.

Acting proactively, The University of Texas' Office of the Dean of Students recently released a voluntary 17-point checklist that advises students on how to select a costume that doesn't "intentionally or unintentionally appropriate another culture or experience."

According to the checklist, "cultural appropriation is when somebody adopts aspects of a culture that is not their own."

The guidelines ask students to consider a number of questions in order to help select a costume or theme, including "how does this theme align with our organization's values?" and "is the theme or costume referring to a living culture or people?"

In addition, the guidelines also suggest that invites to parties should share tips from the checklist and provide examples of costume ideas and expectations.

This is not the first time the University of Texas has attempted to tackle the issue of offensive costumes, in February of 2015, a border patrol frat party made national headlines after appearing near campus. Greek organizations often have themed parties throughout the year.

On Monday, a University of Texas official stressed that the guideline are entirely voluntary and not rules, despite what other news outlets have been reporting.

"UT Austin does not place limits on students' freedom of expression. We do not regulate their speech or enforce costume guidelines as rules," said J.B. Bird, Director of Media Relations at the University of Texas. "Our philosophy is to educate students and remind them that they are accountable to each other and that their actions can negatively impact other members of the university community."
