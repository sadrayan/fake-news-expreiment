Peter Moore - 15 Sneaker Designers You Should Know
Peter Moore

Brand: Nike

Significant shoe: Air Jordan 1

Peter Moore has been involved with just about anything you find cool—including video games, basketball kicks, and especially designing the sneaker that changed everything. Tinker Hatfield receives all the daps for his work with MJ, but it was Moore who created the first Jordan (and the ball and wings logo) that started a phenomenon. Michael was already skeptical about the brand and we all know the story about what Tinker did with the IIIs but you have to believe that if Moore didn't kill it from the jump the rest of it easily may have never happened. Later, after moving to adidas, he created the "Three Bars" logo most associate with adidas Equipment. Quite the résumé.
