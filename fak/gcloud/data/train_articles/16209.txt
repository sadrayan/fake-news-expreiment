We are saying that while she is running as a Democrat for office, The Executive Committee, Chairman, and state party do not believe that she is a real Democrat, since she does not hold our values.

Are you saying she is a Democrat—just one whose values are not shared by the party and its executive committee?

To rehash, we are checking the claim by Hinojosa that she is not a Democrat.

We are not backing off the claim. In our perspective of what is a Democrat, she is not one. You may have a different definition or analysis by which that determination should be made.

The SDEC and our Chair have made their analysis based on our party values and passed a resolution that affects her candidacy.

Gardner,

You probably already found it, but here it is.Chapter 162 of the Election Code regulates participation in party affairs, including affiliation. You can find it here: http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/EL/htm/EL.162.htm

Hinojosa said Rogers “has even paraded around Texas with a poster of the president with a Hitler mustache. Rogers believes that the U.S. economy is secretly controlled by London financial institutions and she has advocated for colonizing Mars.”

His basis?

"I also put the Hitler mustache on Obama, because his healthcare legislation values money over peoples' lives, which is explicitly a crime Nazi doctors were found guilty of during their trials at Nuremberg, in addition to more well known horrors." http://www.kesharogers.com/about

"As an acolyte of perennial presidential fringe candidate Lyndon LaRouche, she believes the U.S. economy is secretly controlled by a cabal of London financial institutions. She’s paraded around Houston with a giant picture of Obama sporting a Hitler mustache and compared the Affordable Care Act to 1930s-era Nazi eugenics policies. All this hasn’t endeared her to the Texas Democratic Party. She wasn’t invited to be a Texas delegate at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, for instance, and party leaders rooted against her in the primary. “If I can figure out what that silver bullet is to make sure that she is not on my slate after May, then I’ll definitely do that,” Steve Brown, chairman of the Fort Bend Democratic Party, said last year. She also advocates increased NASA funding so America can use missiles to defend against asteroids, and to colonize Mars." http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/12/anti-obama-democrat-kesha-rogers-files-for-u-s-senate.html/
