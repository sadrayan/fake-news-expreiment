In bid to look like Angelina Jolie, Iranian woman looks more like ‘Corpse Bride’
An Iranian woman looks up to her Hollywood idol so much that she has had at least 50 surgeries to look exactly like her.

Sahar Tabar, 19, says she is one of Angelina Jolie’s biggest fans and "would do anything" to look like the Hollywood actress.

But in her enthusiasm to imitate her screen idol, many say she has turned herself into Tim Burton’s ‘Dead Bride’ cartoon character.

‘Corpse Bride’ is a 2005 British-American stop-motion-animated musical fantasy film. (Supplied)

According to Sahar, she even went on a diet for months to maintain her weight at 40 kilograms.

The Iranian regularly posts her selfies on Instagram, where she has a 296,000 strong following.
