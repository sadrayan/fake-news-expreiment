Nancy Worley named chairwoman of Alabama Democratic Party
HOOVER, Alabama -- Nancy Worley has been elected chairperson of the Alabama Democratic Party.

She is the first woman to hold the position.



The Alabama Democratic Party Executive Committee today approved Worley, who has been serving as acting chairwoman, to the permanent position. She was the only person nominated.



The party has been without a permanent chairman since Mark Kennedy resigned in April.



The party has fallen on tough times in the deeply red state. Republicans currently hold all statewide offices and a majority in both chambers of the Alabama Legislature.

But Worley said she believes Democrats are poised for a comeback in the state.



“I think they are going to make a comeback because they are on the right side of issues on the economy. They are on the right side of issues on public education,” Worley said.



"The (national) Republicans are willing to shut down government, cut off hundreds of thousands of jobs, just because they have some very narrow-minded views on how not everybody deserves health care.”

Worley served as he Alabama secretary of state from 2003 to 2007.

Former Democratic Party Chairman Redding Pitt was elected as vice-chairman of the party.
