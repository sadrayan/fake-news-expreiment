Fox News host Gretchen Carlson revealed on Wednesday that she was assailed with insults from Fox News viewers after she called to reinstate the assault weapons ban.

During her Tuesday broadcast, Carlson had responded to the massacre at an Orlando night club by noting that the shooter was “able to kill so many people because he was firing an AR-15.”

“Do we need AR-15s to hunt and kill deer? Do we need them to protect our families?” she asked on Tuesday. “Can’t we hold true the sanctity of the Second Amendment while still having common sense?”

On her Wednesday broadcast, the Fox News host admitted that she had “startled many and pleased tons of others by saying I believe the assault weapons in this county, the ban should be reinstated.”

“I said I was still in favor of the Second Amendment and even concealed carry,” she explained, adding that she expected comments calling for her “whiney ass” to be fired.

“And of course, there were a lot worse ones with tons of F-bombs and worse than that even,” Carlson shrugged. “Intolerance is no doubt why politicians sometimes don’t say what they really think.”

“But could that now be changing?” she asked, pointing out that Republicans like Donald Trump, Rob Portman and Bob Dole had all expressed an openness to new gun restrictions.

“Maybe it’s time for more of us to start getting real and try to come together to actually get things done,” the Fox News host concluded.
