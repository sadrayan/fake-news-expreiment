New $1.1M attack ad ties Tillis to Koch brothers
A new television ad attacking House Speaker Thom Tillis suggests the billionaire Koch brothers treat the North Carolina Republican “like he’s one of the family.”

The 30-second ad – backed by $1.1 million from Patriot Majority USA – focuses on how David and Charles Koch are spending millions to help boost Tillis’ campaign and tries to make the connection to the 2013 tax cuts approved by state lawmakers that lowered taxes on corporations. (See the ad below.)

The kicker: “He may not be a Koch brother but he certainly treats them like family.”

It contrasts the tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations with the claims that Tillis froze teacher pay and forced higher costs for seniors’ prescription drugs – both of which lack necessary context and support.

The ad’s emphasis on how the wealthy will see a bigger tax break under the plan (citing a disputed report from a Raleigh organization that opposes the plan) also doesn’t mention that most North Carolinians will see a tax cut under the new law because the personal income tax fell to a flat 5.8 percent rate for all taxpayers.

Patriot Majority PAC is a Democratic-backed nonprofit that doesn’t disclose its donors and can receive unlimited contributions. The ad doesn’t mention his Democratic rival Kay Hagan.

The latest ad will air for two weeks across North Carolina, a Patriot Majority spokesman said. It doubles the group’s spending so far in the race. The groups spent a combined $1.1 million in February and May to air two earlier ads criticizing Tillis, according to an ad tracker.

The Koch brothers have become a frequent target for Democratic groups as they make millions in contributions to conservative political groups that are supporting Republican candidates, including Tillis.
