Sania Mirza visits Lahore!
If social media updates are to be believed, it seems that Indian tennis champion Sania Mirza has been enjoying her winter evenings in Lahore in a low-key trip.

The tennis star and wife of cricketer Shoaib Malik has been spotted hanging out with the cricket and celebrity fraternity in Lahore during her time off from tennis.

Sania attended a dinner hosted by Mohammad Hafeez before the team departed for New Zealand. Hafeez‚Äôs wife Nazia shared pictures from the occasion.

Models and actresses Urwa and Mawra Hocane also caught up with Sania over a cup of coffee.

Last but not the least, both Sania and Shoaib spent some quality time with Malik‚Äôs mother. The cricketer took to Twitter to share an adorable picture of the three which he captioned, ‚ÄúHamari Jannat #Maa.‚Äù

Sania Mirza had some free time on her hands after a knee injury ruled her out of next month‚Äôs Australian Open.Will have to admit that it would have been great to see pictures of the tennis champion posing at Lahore‚Äôs iconic spots such as Badshahi Masjid or Lahore Fort.

Shoaib has now left for New Zealand with the rest of the team for five-match ODI series starting from January 6, 2018, followed by three T20 internationals.
