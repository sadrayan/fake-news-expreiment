Nigeria’s All Progressives Congress is up for re-election in 2019. As it makes its case to voters, how has it performed on some of the main promises it made ahead of its 2015 win?

EDITOR’S NOTE: These pledges are collated from the party’s manifesto and its covenant with Nigerians. The latter document was subject to much debate after the party sought to disavow it. The APC did walk back promises for its first 100 days in office. Other publications have collated more promises. Also, the president’s first term in office ends officially on 29 May 2019 when he’d have spent four years in office.
