Signatures of names like Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler are being considered valid on recall petitions of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as long as they are properly dated, a government board indicated Tuesday.

Suspicious signatures will be noted, but reviewers on the Government Accountability Board will be looking primarily to see whether the signatures are accompanied by a Wisconsin address and signed during the appropriate time, according to WISN12.

“We will flag them, but we will not strike them without challenge,” said board elections specialist David Buerger, when asked whether Mickey Mouse’s signature could count. He added that in previous petitions, Hitler’s name was only struck because the address was in Germany, not due to the name itself.

Those seeking to recall Walker must gather 540,208 ballots by Jan. 17 to force an election on the matter. Organizers had 300,000 as of Nov. 28.

Walker’s efforts to restrict collective-bargaining rights for public union workers in Wisconsin have attracted the ire of progressive activists in the state.

Liberal activists first targeted six Republican state senators in recall elections this past summer, causing two Republicans to lose their seats. Despite their campaign to wrest control of the upper chamber from the right, Republicans still hold control over the state’s Senate.
