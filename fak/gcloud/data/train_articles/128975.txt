Abatement ab initio

? In criminal law, a long-standing principle that wipes out the conviction of a defendant who dies before sentencing or before exhausting appeals.

? From the Latin, meaning to roll back a process to its beginning.

? A rule requiring that a deceased defendant be treated "as if he had never been indicted or convicted," according to one federal court of appeals.

? The reason that the conviction of former Enron chairman Ken Lay on federal securities, conspiracy and fraud charges will probably be nullified by the trial court in Houston after his death near Aspen, Colo.

? A legal hurdle to the government and former Enron shareholders and creditors who might want to rely on the facts proved during Lay's criminal trial in seeking civil fines and damages.

? Why Mrs. Lay may get to keep some of the $43.5 million in net worth that prosecutors had sought before her husband's death.
