Kirkwood High School
The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC)-Missouri Gateway Chapter challenged public and private schools within the chapter’s territory (Missouri and Southern Illinois) to devise and implement, with the help of Green Mentors, the most creative, effective and no or low-cost sustainable practices for their schools. This year, over 3,000 students and 180 faculty and staff were directly involved in this year’s Green Schools Quest projects. The Kirkwood School District (KSD) had six schools participate: Kirkwood Early Childhood Center, Keysor Elementary School, Westchester Elementary School, Nipher Middle School, North Middle School and Kirkwood High School. The projects were judged and winners were announced at the 12th Annual Green School Event at the Missouri History Museum. KECC was announced as the winner of the elementary school category and Kirkwood High School was announced as the winner of the high school category. Nipher Middle School and North Kirkwood Middle School tied for the middle school category.
