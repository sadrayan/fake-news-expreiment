After Trump Blasts N.F.L., Players Kneel and Lock Arms in Solidarity
■ Kareem Hunt continued to make the N.F.L. look easy. The rookie running back of the Kansas City Chiefs (3-0) rushed for 172 yards and one touchdown in a 24-10 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers (0-3). Hunt now has 538 yards from scrimmage in the first three games of his career. The only player with more yards in his first three games was Billy Sims, who had 562 yards with the 1980 Detroit Lions.

■ The Denver Broncos (2-1) turned the ball over on their final four possessions in a 26-16 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Buffalo survived a subpar effort from the team’s best player, LeSean McCoy, who managed just 21 yards on 14 carries. Tyrod Taylor provided plenty of offense, completing 20 of 26 passes for 213 yards and two touchdowns. Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian was brutal a week after leading his team to an upset victory over Dallas. He threw two interceptions and had a passer rating of 58.2.

■ Jordan Howard ran in a 19-yard touchdown in overtime that gave the Chicago Bears (1-2) a shocking 23-17 upset of the Pittsburgh Steelers (2-1). Given a chance to win the game after being tied 17-17 at the end of regulation, the Bears needed just four running plays to score, with Howard and Tarik Cohen leading them to victory. Howard finished with 23 carries for 138 yards and two touchdowns.

■ Matthew Stafford of the Detroit Lions (2-1) appeared to have thrown a game-winning touchdown pass to Golden Tate with 12 seconds remaining, but after a review it was determined that Tate’s knee had hit the ground before he crossed the goal line. The ruling carried with it a mandatory 10-second running of the clock, which could have been halted with a timeout if the Lions had any remaining. With that call, the Atlanta Falcons (3-0) escaped Detroit with a 30-26 victory.

■ Case Keenum and Stefon Diggs looked like stars as the Minnesota Vikings (2-1) hardly seemed to miss the injured Sam Bradford in a 34-17 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-1). Keenum threw three touchdown passes, Diggs had eight receptions for 173 yards and two touchdowns, and Dalvin Cook ran for 97 yards in a well-balanced offensive effort.

■ Blake Bortles, a name synonymous with quarterback mediocrity, looked like Peyton Manning, throwing for four touchdowns as the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1) romped past the Baltimore Ravens (2-1) in London, 44-7.

■ Jay Cutler and Matt Haack (Miami’s punter) each threw interceptions, Jay Ajayi was completely unable to make a dent in the running game, and the Miami Dolphins lost to the Jets, 20-6. The Jets (1-2) outplayed the Dolphins (1-1) in every facet of the game.
