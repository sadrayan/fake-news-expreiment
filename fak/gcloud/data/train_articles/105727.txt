Bernie Sanders Suggests Election Is Rigged, Unendorses Hillary Clinton
In an unexpected announcement Bernie Sanders has suggested that the Presidential election may be rigged, and has unendorsed Hillary Clinton.

In a cryptic Facebook message posted on Sunday, Sanders warned American citizens of a rigged system and criticised the overly powerful elite who run it.

“That was not Abraham Lincoln’s vision of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people,” Sanders complained.

His entire message reads:

“Let’s be honest and acknowledge what we are talking about.

We are talking about a rapid movement in this country toward a political system in which a handful of very wealthy people and special interests will determine who gets elected or who does not get elected.

That is not what this country is supposed to be about.

That was not Abraham Lincoln’s vision of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people”
