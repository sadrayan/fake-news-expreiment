Westmont village manager charged with DUI: cops
The village manager for west suburban Westmont was charged with driving under the influence after he was pulled over while driving in a center turn lane in a neighboring town, police said today.

Ronald R. Searl, 54, was stopped shortly before midnight on July 3 after a Clarendon Hills police officer saw him turning into the parking lot of a business that was closed on 55th Street, Clarendon Hills Police Chief Ted Jenkins said.

By the time the officer turned around to investigate, Searl was allegedly driving westbound on 55th Street in the center turn lane.

The officer stopped Searl and noticed an odor of alcohol on his breath, Jenkins said. Searl was arrested and taken to the station after he failed a field sobriety test. While at the station, a Breathalyzer test allegedly showed his blood-alcohol content was .112, which is over the legal limit of .08, according to Jenkins.

Searl was charged with driving under the influence and driving with a blood-alcohol content over .08, both misdemeanors. He was also ticketed for driving in the wrong lane, Jenkins said.

Searl was released on an individual recognizance bond and is due in court on August 5, Jenkins said.

“He was polite, cooperative and respectful throughout, and was driven home by an officer,” Jenkins said. “That’s not an uncommon thing for us to do, especially with local residents.”

Mayor Ron Gunter said Searl, who has been a village employee for more than three decades and has served as the village manager for about a decade, informed him of the arrest within 12 hours of the incident.

Gunter said Searl has not been placed on leave, but would not discuss any potential disciplinary actions

"The issue is a personnel issue and will be handled in closed session,” he said in a written statement."
