Solving the Puzzle

Found in 2011 and painstakingly prepared for the last five years, this specimen is among the best armored dinosaur fossils ever found. Incredibly, it fossilized in 3‑D, preserving the intricate details of its armor and soft tissue. The fossil is nearly intact from the animal’s snout to its hips; researchers suspect it initially fossilized whole.
