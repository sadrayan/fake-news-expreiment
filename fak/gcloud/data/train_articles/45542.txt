Columbia Ouster Costs Nearly $10 Million
The Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to pay its former chairman and chief executive nearly $10 million when he was forced out in July in the wake of an unfolding criminal investigation of the company.

The agreement with the executive, Richard L. Scott, provided for a one-time payment of $5.13 million, as well as a five-year annual consulting fee of $950,000, for a total of $9.88 million, according to a copy of a severance agreement included in the company's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In addition, David Vandewater, the former president and chief operating officer who was forced out with Mr. Scott, received a onetime payment of $3.24 million and a five-year consulting contract worth $600,000 annually.

The company also disclosed yesterday that its lawyers had met with Federal prosecutors investigating Columbia's business practices as part of its efforts to cooperate with the inquiry. Those discussions have involved prosecutors both in Texas and in Florida. As part of its cooperation, the company also earlier agreed to allow Federal auditors to examine financial records at a sampling of Florida hospitals.

The investigation has focused on contentions that Columbia illegally increased compensation from Federal programs like Medicare by misrepresenting certain expenses in reports to the Government. The Government is also investigating allegations of improper billing practices, from misreporting the diagnosis on medical billing records to improperly charging Federal health programs for inappropriate blood tests.
