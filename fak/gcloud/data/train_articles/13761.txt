Emergency Weekend Medicaid Matters to Me Letter Writing Campaign â€“ Deadline Extended!
The Senate is set to vote soon on the latest version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act. The latest revisions to the bill do NOT change the devastating cuts to the Medicaid program that over 10 million people with disabilities rely on to live and work in their communities. The time is now to take action and tell your Senators why Medicaid Matters to You and Your Family.

Take a few moments to write a brief message about how Medicaid impacts your life. Please send those messages in the body of an email to Nicole Jorwic at The Arc of the United States: jorwic@thearc.org. PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR STATE IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL. We will hand deliver all the printed messages to the Senators from your states this week. So please act fast, e-mails must be received by midnight on Wednesday, July 19 to be printed.

We want to show strong support for Medicaid from all over the nation, but we are particularly looking for letters from the following states:

Nevada

West Virginia

Alaska

Louisiana

Ohio

Arizona

North Dakota

Kansas
