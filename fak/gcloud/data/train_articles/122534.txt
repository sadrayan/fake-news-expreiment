World War II Memorial (U.S. National Park Service)
Introduction The World War II Memorial commemorates the sacrifice and celebrates the victory of "the greatest generation." Friedrich St.Florianâ€™s winning design balances classical and modernist styles of architecture, harmonizes with its natural and cultural surroundings, and connects the legacy of the American Revolution and the American Civil War with a great crusade to rid the world of fascism.

Commander in Chief After eight challenging years as President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt embarked on his unprecedented and historic third term in 1941 mindful of the tense and uncertain international situation. A president largely concerned with domestic economic issues now turned his attention to exercising his Constitutional role as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.
