More Than 122 Million Consumers Plan to Shop Online on Cyber Monday
More than 28 million people, or 23 percent of Cyber Monday shoppers, plan to shop for Cyber Monday deals from their mobile device this year, about even with last year’s 29.6 million. More than eight in 10— 98.6 million people, will use their computers at home to shop on Monday, while 11.2 million will shop from their computers at work.

On Cyber Monday, retailers offer deals around the clock and consumers know to check-in with their favorite retailers early and often to find the deals they’re looking for. Early morning remains the busiest time for online shopping—38.9 percent of those shopping on Cyber Monday will shop first thing in the morning, while 33.9 percent will shop late in the morning, 16 percent will shop over lunch and 31 percent will shop in the early afternoon.

“Shopping online is more convenient than ever before—while travelling, emailing or relaxing at home, we’re seeing consumers of all ages researching and shopping for online deals,” said Prosper’s Principal Analyst Pam Goodfellow. “Cyber Monday deals have become something that smart shoppers rely on, and this year is no different. Consumers wake up early ready to shop at their favorite retailers for the items they’ve had their eye on all season.”
