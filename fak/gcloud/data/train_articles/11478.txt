Massachusetts Primary Election Results
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York won in a tight race that was marked by sharp generational divides, with voters ages 45 and older supporting Mrs. Clinton, and younger voters choosing Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, according to exit polls. Many voters had waited until the last minute to make a decision about whom they would support, with about one-third saying they did not decide whom to vote for until the final week of the campaign. Although Mrs. Clinton had held a lead for months, Mr. Obama appeared to get a significant bounce after receiving the backing of the state's senior senator, Edward M. Kennedy. One local poll this week showed Mr. Obama slightly edging ahead of Mrs. Clinton. The state's 93 pledged delegates are allocated proportionally between the two candidates, with 31 based on the statewide results and the remainder divided based on the vote in each of the congressional districts. Each candidate had raised considerable money in the state -- Mr. Obama $1.98 million, and Mrs. Clinton $1.88 million.
