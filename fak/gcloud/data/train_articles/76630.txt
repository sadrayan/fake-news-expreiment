Because the term "expenditure" is often associated with household decisionmaking, it is important to recognize that the ERS series also includes nonhousehold purchases. For example, the series includes the value of food purchased by the U.S. Government for domestic military personnel; the value of school meals, including the National School Lunch Program's "free" lunches for which eligible households make no expenditure; and the value of food purchased by airlines for serving during flights. The ERS series was developed in 1987, and annual data from it are available from 1929 through 2005. While the series is labeled "Food Expenditures," it also constitutes a measure of total sales through different food outlets, such as supermarkets, full-service and limited-service restaurants, mass merchandisers, hotels, schools, etc. In an accounting sense, production value, or sales, equal total expenditures. ERS provides estimates of food eaten away from home and food eaten at home, as well as the share of the two food spending categories relative to two income seriesdisposable personal income and disposable personal money income. Food-away-from-home spending is mainly for food purchased at eating and drinking places, but it is also for food purchased at such outlets as hotels and motels, recreational places, vending machines, and schools and colleges and food provided to domestic military personnel. ERS estimates of food at home and food away from home may not equal estimates with similar labels by other series. To compare the ERS Expenditure Series with the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Personal Consumption Series, the U.S. Department of Commerce, see three types of food expenditure series. Data Sources The primary data source for the ERS series is the U.S. Census, U.S. Department of Commerce. These data first became available from the 1929 Economic Census. Census Bureau reports used in the ERS series include Industry and Subject Series: Retail Trade, NAICS 44-45; Wholesale Trade, NAICS 42; Accommodations and Food Services, NAICS 72; and Other Services, NAICS 81. Information on the dollar amount of sales for food and alcoholic beverages at different types of retail establishments is available from the Census Bureau every 5 years. Each year for which the full, detailed figures are available will be called here a "census year." Between census years, both monthly and annual U.S. sales data are calculated by the Census Bureau based on a sample of the 5-year census respondents. The monthly and annual sales data are not as detailed as the census year data and require projection techniques used by ERS to obtain annual estimates of certain factors for years between census years. The most recent complete census year available is 2002. Food At Home Census Bureau reports used to directly measure food-at-home expenditures include the Retail Trade Report, Services Annual Survey, Wholesale Trade Report, Annual Survey of Manufacturers, and Statistical Abstract of the United States. As measured in census year 2002 data, over 96 percent of food-at-home expenditures is measured by one of these reports. The remaining 4 percent of food-at-home expenditures is measured by the commodity reports of USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), USDA's Census of Agriculture, ACNielsen annual grocer's survey reported in Progressive Grocer magazine, and food program data from USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). More... Food Away From Home As measured in census year 2002 data, over 90 percent of food-away-from home expenditures is directly measured by Census Bureau data from several reports, including Retail Trade Report, Services Annual Survey, Statistical Abstract of the United States, and Census of Services, and from the Monthly Labor Review, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. The remaining 10 percent of food-away-from-home expenditures is measured by data from food program data; Bureau of Transportation Statistics; National Restaurant Association; Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Commerce, Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE); and Bureau of Labor Statistics. More... Alcoholic Beverages All (100 percent) alcoholic beverage expenditures measured in the ERS series are reported in the Census Bureau 2002 data for each establishment that sells alcoholic beverages and alcoholic drinks. Because the Census Bureau reports alcoholic beverage sales in only each census year, projection techniques, described below, are needed for this series between census years. Alcoholic beverage sales are listed in the Census reports as "Packaged liquor, wine, and beer" or "Alcoholic drinks (served at this establishment)." Level of Measurement by Outlet Total expenditures for food are derived as the sum of four broad categories: (1) Food-at-home expenditures include expenditures on food for preparing at home and anywhere elseexcept on the premises where soldthat is taken home for consumption, including food purchased at department stores, drug stores, or gas stations.

(2) Food-away-from-home expenditures include expenditures on food consumed on the premises where it is sold, such as in restaurants and fast food establishments, including recreation places (movie theaters, amusement parks, concessions in sports parks, etc.).

(3) Packaged alcoholic beverages include beer, wine, and liquor for consumption at home and off the premises where they are sold.

(4) Alcoholic drinks include alcoholic beverages consumed in bars, clubs, and other premises where they are sold. Industry-level production of all goods and services in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico is measured using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). For selected individual NAICS industries, food sales are reported separately by the Census Bureau for food-at-home and food-away-from-home. These figures are developed from the Census Bureau's Survey of Establishments and summarized in its Retail Trade and Merchandise Line Sales reports. The categories labeled by ERS as "food at home" and "food away from home" actually have different labels in the Census reports. For example, Grocery Stores, NAICS 4451, and Full-Service Restaurants, NAICS 7221, each contain food sales from both categories and industry-specific labels are used by the Census Bureau: NAICS 4451, Grocery Stores: FOOD AT HOME: Product line code 20100, "Groceries and other food items for human consumption off the premises, including bottled, canned, or packaged soft drinks; candy; gum; packaged snacks; etc." FOOD AWAY FROM HOME: Product line code 20120, "Meals, unpackaged snacks, sandwiches, ice cream and yogurt; bakery items; and nonalcoholic beverages generally served for immediate consumption." AICS 7221, Full-Service Restaurants: FOOD AT HOME: Product line code 0121, "Meals, unpackaged snacks, sandwiches, and nonalcoholic beverages (including soup and salad bars, party platters, and hand-dipped ice cream). Food/nonalcoholic beverages prepared for carry-out and consumption off the premises." FOOD AWAY FROM HOME: Product line code 0122, "Meals, unpackaged snacks, sandwiches, and nonalcoholic beverages (including soup and salad bars, party platters, and hand-dipped ice cream). Food/nonalcoholic beverages prepared for consumption on the premises." In addition to annual sales data for individual NAICS establishments that sell food, the individual retailers that respond to the census questionnaire record their sales for their establishment by various merchandise lines listed on the questionnaire. Census data reported by the retail establishment and information on the distribution of sales between food, alcoholic beverages, meals, and snacks by type of store are used to determine the percentage of food sales purchased for food-at-home and food-away-from-home consumption. These percentages between food-at-home and food-away-from-home purchases for a given NAICS code remain constant between census years. In other instances, ERS classifies the full level of expenditure at a given outlet as food at home or food away from home. For example, food purchased at schools and colleges are classified entirely as food away from home. Measurement of Expenditures Between Census Years Total food expenditures for industry or outlet i in year t, Y i,t , are given by: (1) Y i,t = Y H i,t + Y A i,t where Y H i,t and Y A i,t are food-at-home and food-away-from-home expenditures. In a census year, the Census Bureau reports data for a NAICS industry in detail sufficient for ERS to identify food-at-home product lines and food-away-from-home product lines, as noted above; nonfood sales for the industry, N i,t , are also reported separately in the census year. For years between a census year, the Census Bureau reports only the total annual sales figure, S i,t , for the industry, where S i,t is the sum of Y H i,t , Y A i,t , and N i,t . ERS estimates or projects the figures Ŷ H i,t and Ŷ A i,t for inter-census years using a common formula shared by many Food Expenditure data series. This common formula is given by: (2.1) Ŷ H i,t = wH i,0 S i,0 (2.2) Ŷ A i,t = wA i,0 S i,0 where wH i,0 is an industry-specific share of food-at-home expenditures relative to the industry's total sales (inclusive of nonfood sales) in census year 0, given by (Y H i,0 )/( S i,0 ); and wA i,0 is a census year share of the industry's food-away-from-home expenditures relative to total sales, given by (Y A i,0 )/( S i,0 ). For example, the 2002 weights for food-at-home expenditures for certain industries are 72.50 for Grocery Stores (NAICS 4451), 6.62 for Mass Merchandisers (NAICS 4529), 17.45 for Warehouse Clubs and Superstores (NAICS 45291), 0.15 for Full-Service Restaurants (NAICS 7221), and 0.64 for Limited-Service Restaurants (NAICS 7222). The 2002 weights for food-away-from home expenditures for certain industries are 97.60 for Limited-Service Restaurants (NAICS 7222), 81.80 for Full-Service Restaurants (NAICS 7221), 1.81 for Grocery Stores (NAICS 4451), and 14.61 for Variety Stores (NAICS 45299).

Methodology for Food Expenditures by Source of Funds A hallmark of the ERS Food Expenditure series is that the national figures for both food-at-home and food-away-from-home expenditures add to total food purchases for all final U.S. usersconsumers, businesses, and governments (including nonprofit organizations). Expenditures by these groups or sectors are reported separately in table 5. The food expenditures financed by governments are the sum of such items as expenditures paid for by the Food Stamp Program and WIC, the value of USDA commodity supplemental donations to school meals and elderly nutrition programs, and the value of food paid for by government and served in military messes, correctional institutions, and hospitals and nursing homes. The food expenditures financed by businesses are the sum of such items as the value of food served by airlines and by hospitals and nursing homes and the value of food furnished to employees by firms. The total of food expenditures by all final users in table 5 equals the total of food-at-home and food-away-from-home expenditures in table 1. The equality between the two tables' total food expenditure figures is assured because of the methodology used to construct table 5. Specifically, food expenditures by families and individuals in table 5 are calculated as a residual, deducting the food expenditure figures for government, business, and the value of food produced and consumed on farms (value at farm prices) from the total food expenditures figure from table 1. Data Sources and Methodology for Food Expenditure Shares Food expenditures by families and individuals as a share of disposable personal income are reported annually in table 7 and in the ERS periodical Amber Waves. Food expenditures by families and individuals as a share of disposable personal money income are reported in table 8. The annual disposable personal income data are reported by U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis in their National Income and Product Account Tables, table 2.1 Personal Income and Its Disposition. The annual data for disposable personal money income are reported by U.S. Department of Commerce, Survey of Current Business, table 2.1 and table 1.14, which include government expenses for military medical insurance, food stamps, and other Federal, State, and local medical care expenses. Both table 7 and table 8 report food expenditures by families and individuals, but the tables differ as to whether or not certain specific types of household expenditures are counted. The figures used in table 8 are the same as the figures reported in table 5, food expenditures by families and individuals. In contrast, table 7 begins with those figures but adds three major itemsthe values of food stamps, WIC vouchers, and food produced and consumed on farms (listed in a column of table 5 itself)and certain minor items. These items are components of disposable personal income, the denominator of the share figures in table 7, and consistency suggests counting the same types of food expenditures in the numerator and denominator. In contrast, the disposable personal money income figures used in table 8 exclude those items. The full set of differences between the treatment of food expenditures in table 7 and table 8 is reported in table 9. Relative Prices of Food at Three Stages of the System The prices of food in restaurants and food provided to the food system by manufacturers and shippers are each expressed relative to store prices in table 13. The restaurant prices ratio is calculated as the current-year value of the CPI for food away from home relative to the current-year value for the CPI for food at home. Both indexes are reported in table 14. The manufacturers' and shippers' prices ratio is calculated as the current-year value of the Producer Price Index (PPI) for consumer foods to manufacturers selling price relative to the CPI for food at home. The PPI for consumer foods to manufacturers selling price uses 1988 as a base year and is calculated by ERS using data and methods described in "Developing an Integrated Information System for the Food Sector." Food Expenditures at Constant Prices The food-at-home and food-away-from-home expenditures reported in table 1 are nominal figures i.e., current-year values not adjusted for inflation. These two expenditure categories are reported in constant 1988 dollars in table 14 by deflating a category by its respective price index, each of which is reported in the table. The price index for food at home is based on prices for specific items, including meats, dairy, and related products, fruits and vegetables, nonalcoholic beverages, and other food at home. Specific items of the CPI for food away from home include full-service restaurant meals and snacks, limited-service meals and snacks, food at employee sites and schools, and food from vending machines and mobile vendors. These indexes use 1988 as a base year and are calculated by ERS using data and methods described in Developing an Integrated Information System for the Food Sector. Periodic Data Revisions The ERS Food Expenditure data series uses data from several different U.S. Government sources that periodically revise their individual data series. For example, the Census Bureau updates and revises their benchmark Economic Census Reports in their Industry Series and Subject Series every 4-5 years (e.g., in 1997 and 2002). Other major data series for which revisions can affect certain ERS Food Expenditure series include the population estimates of the Census Bureau (used by ERS for food expenditure per capita) and the national economic accounts of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. ERS integrates these updates by revising the ERS Food Expenditure series as updates are released, which can result in changes to figures for several years at a time.
