Murphy one of only seven House Democrats to vote for special Benghazi committee
Five days after the terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice repeats talking points blaming spontaneous reaction to a “hateful video.”

Freshman U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, was one of only seven Democrats in the House to vote tonight in favor of creating a select committee to investigate the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans.

The final vote was 232-to-186, with Republicans voting 225-0 for the committee and Democrats voting 186-7 against.

Murphy spokeswoman Erin Moffet Hale released this statement:

“While the congressman respects the work his colleagues have done already investigating this matter, when it comes to American lives lost overseas in service to our nation, we must make sure that all questions have been answered. He sincerely hopes that this committee is not used as a way to politicize this tragedy and the deaths of four Americans.”
