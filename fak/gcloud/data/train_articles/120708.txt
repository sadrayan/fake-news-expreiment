American Airlines agrees to pay $45 million to settle antitrust lawsuit filed by passengers
“We continue to deny, without qualification, that American participated in any such agreement, and the settlement does not include any admission of wrongdoing,” according to the statement. “The facts show that American dramatically increased domestic capacity during the period covered by the complaint while taking delivery of hundreds of new aircraft, giving it the youngest fleet of the U.S. network carriers.”
