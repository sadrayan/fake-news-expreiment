CANDIDATE CONTINUES. ADAM: THANK YOU FOR CLICKING ON OUR EXTENDED DIGITAL CONVERSATION WITH TIM RYAN OF OHIO. THE NEXT DAY MINUTES IS COMMERCIAL FREE SO WE CAN GET TO AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE GOING TO START WITH CAROLYN MORRILL. CAROLYN: HILLARY CLINTON, NOW MANY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AFTER HER LOSS, HIT THE HEAD BY SAYING, "I DID NOT REALIZE THIS COUNTRY WAS SO DIVIDED." HOW DO YOU PLAN ON GETTING US UNITED AGAIN? REP. RYAN: I THINK IT STARTS WITH RESPECT. I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO START RESPECTING EACH OTHER, EVEN IF WE DISAGREE. WE HAVE GOT TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER. NOT TO GET SENTIMENTAL, BUT WE HAVE TO CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER. WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT, ALL BLESSED TO BE AMERICANS. WE HAVE TO START FROM THAT POINT. WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND WE HAVE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER. WE DON’T ALWAYS HAVE TO LIKE EACH OTHER, LIKE WHAT WE TELL OUR TEENAGE KIDS. YOU HAVE TO -- THAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY I WILL BRING. I THINK WE HAVE TO LISTEN AND I THINK REPUBLICANS HAVE GOOD IDEAS. WE NEED THE FREE MARKET TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND SCALE THINGS UP. LET’S SIT DOWN AND WORK IT OUT. I AM HERE TO GET THE JOB DONE FOR OUR KIDS AND WHEN YOU APPROACH WITH AN OPEN HEART AND OPEN MIND AND A GOOD DEAL OF RESPECT, I THINK IT CAN UNLOCK SOME OF THE TOXICITY WE ARE DEALING WITH TODAY. ADAM: NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM DAN BERGERON. DAN: WELCOME BACK. ANOTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION, WHAT DOES EDUCATION FUNDING LOOK LIKE IN A RYAN WHITE HOUSE AND LOCALLY HERE IN MANCHESTER AND THE REST OF NEW HAMPSHIRE? REP. RYAN: AS YOU KNOW, MOST OF IT IS STATE-FUNDED, BUT I BELIEVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MORE AND MORE OF AN IMPORTANT ROLE MOVING FORWARD. WE HAVE GOT TO GET THE NUMBERS UP WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THERE IS A 40% COMMITMENT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANYWHERE CLOSE TO FUNDING. I BELIEVE UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING. OUR KIDS ARE COMING TO SCHOOL WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRAUMA. KIDS IN THE UNITED STATES, OVER 50% THAT SHOW UP IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS -- ATTEND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS LIVE IN POVERTY THAT ARE LOW INCOME KIDS AND THEY COME WITH ALL THE ISSUES THAT COME WITH LIVING IN A LOW INCOME FASHION. SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING HAS BEEN BY CONNECTING KIDS. CONNECT KIDS TO THEIR TEACHER, TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY. TEACH THEM HOW TO HANDLE THEIR EMOTIONS AND DEAL WITH SOCIAL SITUATIONS LIKE BULLYING AND THE PRESSURE YOU GET AROUND TEENAGE DRUG USE AND TEEN SEX. TEACH THEM REAL TECHNIQUES ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS AND DE-ESCALATE THEMSELVES AND HANDLE THE EMOTIONAL PRESSURES THAT COME WITH BEING A KID. NOW, WHY? AND DOES THIS WORK? THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN OVER 300,000 KIDS WHO HAVE A ROBUST SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROGRAM, 11 PERCENTILE POINT INCREASE IN TEST SCORES, 10% INCREASE IN GOOD BEHAVIOR, 10% DECREASE IN ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR. IT CLOSES THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. IN MY ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL TAKE SCIENCE AND EXPERIENCE AND TRANSLATE IT INTO POLICIES THAT MATTER. WE WILL BEGIN TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WITH SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND A THIRD PIECE WILL BE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. ONE OF THE WORST THINGS WE EVER DID WAS GET RID OF SHOP CLASS AND NOW WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO MOVE INTO THE ECONOMY AND LEARN THESE SKILLS AND THAT IS GOING UNFILLED. ADAM: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION. FOLLOWING UP ON THAT, WHEN WE TALK WITH EDUCATORS AND CANDIDATES, THE EDUCATORS WILL SAY TESTING IS TAKING THE JOY OUT OF TEACHING. WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN FIGURING OUT WHAT KIDS ARE LEARNING THROUGH TESTING AND NOT MAKING SURE YOU ARE SQUEEZING OUT THE REST OF IT? REP. RYAN: PART OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS REALIZE WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING SO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS SHARING INFORMATION TO WHERE YOU CAN GO FROM YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PLUG IN WHAT THE METRICS ARE, WHAT IS THE POVERTY RATE? HOW MANY KIDS? WHAT IS THE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH RATE? AND FIGURE OUT WHAT OTHER COMMUNITIES, WHAT OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DOING SO THAT YOU CAN BEGIN TO SAY WHAT IS THAT BALANCE BETWEEN ASSESSING A KID ABILITY -- KID’S ABILITY AND OVER TESTING, WHICH IS HAPPENING TODAY. LEARNING HAS TO BE FUN. YOU HAVE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS, BUT LEARNING HAS TO BE FUN BECAUSE WE WANT OUR KIDS TO BE LIFELONG LEARNERS. I THINK THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT MOVING FORWARD AND THAT MEANS PAYING TEACHERS. I THINK THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING PIECE IS KEY BECAUSE THERE IS FEAR AND EMOTION FOR KIDS DEALING WITH A LOT OF TRAUMA. WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM TESTING AND I WANT PEOPLE TO START SEEING SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING AS A WAY TO INCREASE TEST SCORES WITHOUT HAVING THE HUGE PRESSURE AROUND TESTING. ADAM: NEXT UP IS A SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTION COMING FROM ADRIAN DASSING. HE ASKS, "IS AN INDIVIDUAL BOUND BY LAW TO PAY FEDERAL INCOME TAX?" REP. RYAN: YES, AS MUCH AS WE ALL DISLIKE IT. ADAM: THIS HAS BEEN A CONSERVATIVE TALKING POINT THAT HAS BEEN BIG IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, TAXATION IS THEFT. WHAT DO? YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? REP. RYAN: TAXATION IS THE --WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? REP. RYAN: TAXATION IS THE PRICE WE PAY FOR LIVING IN A SOCIALIZED SOCIETY. WE HAVE WATER AND SEWER AND AIRPORTS AND EDUCATION AND INVESTMENTS INTO EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. WHILE WE ALL HAVE ISSUES WITH THIS, AND I THINK WE NEED A HUGE GOVERNMENT REFORM PROPOSAL, I DON’T THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS RUNNING AS EFFICIENT AS WE NEED IT TO. I THINK DEMOCRATS NEED TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THAT, WE ALL WANT TO LIVE IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY AND THAT ENTAILS US MAKING THAT CONTRIBUTION. ADAM: THE NEXT QUESTION IS COMING FROM TERRANCE GEENARAIN. TERRANCE: AS AN IMMIGRANT THAT IS NOW A PROUD AMERICAN CITIZEN, I KNOW WHAT IT IS PART -- WHAT IT IS TO BE PART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. WHAT ARE YOU PLANS FOR IMMIGRATION, SPECIFICALLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED? REP. RYAN: THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE IMMIGRATION. AS WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TO MAKING SURE THE BORDER IS SECURE, MAKING SURE DRUGS DO NOT GET IN, AND HAVING A COMPASSIONATE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY CARING FOR REFUGEES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TROUBLE AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO FIND A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE, WHO ARE WORKING HARD, PLAYING EITHER RULES AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WITH PAYING BACK TAXES OR PAYING A FINE OR WHATEVER. I THINK THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE BETTER OFF IF WE FIND A PATHWAY. MY GREAT-GRANDPARENTS WERE ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS AND I REMEMBER GOING TO CHRISTMAS EVE AND THE FAMILY PARTIES AND MY GREAT AUNTS TALKING IN BROKEN ENGLISH. I WAS BORN INTO AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY AND WE APPRECIATED THAT. WE HAVE GOT TO GET AWAY FROM THAT. WE HAVE GOT TO START SEEING AMERICA’S DIVERSITY AS OUR GREATEST STRENGTH AND THAT MEANS A COMPASSIONATE WAY TO GET UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO OUR SOCIETY WHERE THEY CAN THRIVE AND CONTRIBUTE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS ALWAYS SEEN AND HIGHLIGHTED AND SUPPORTED. ADAM: TO FOLLOW-UP ON THAT, WHAT DOES A COMPROMISED IMMIGRATION BILL COME OUT OF THE RYAN WHITE HOUSE LOOKING LIKE? REP. RYAN: I THINK IT WILL A LOOK -- LOOK A LOT LIKE THE GANG OF SEVEN BILL THAT MARCO RUBIO AND JOHN MCCAIN PUT TOGETHER THAT I THINK OUT OF 70 VOTES IN THE SENATE, THEY ALL KIND OF ABANDONED WHEN TRUMP CAME IN AND STARTED THROWING GASOLINE ON EVERYTHING REGARDING ISSUES OF IMMIGRATION. THAT KIND OF BILL WHERE -- BORDER SECURITY, MAKE SURE WE ARE ALL FIRM, BUT THEN A COMPASSIONATE PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP IN SEVEN YEARS, PAYING A FINE, PAYING BACK TAXES DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT MAKING SURE THERE IS A PATHWAY, INCLUDING THE DACA KIDS, MAKING SURE THERE IS A FIX FOR THE KIDS WHO HAD DEFERRED ACTION, THAT WE BRING THEM INTO FULL CITIZENSHIP AS WELL. THE PROJECTIONS ARE 1.2% OR 1.3% GROWTH TO GDP. EVERYONE WHO COMES IN IS PAYING TAXES AND CAN TRIPPING TO THE ECONOMY AND PAYING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE AND THAT WILL BOLSTER OUR ECONOMY. ADAM: NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM OLIVIA ZINK. OLIVIA: THANKS FOR BEING WITH US AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND SPONSORSHIP OF HR1, THE BIGGEST DEMOCRACY REFORM THESE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, THE FOR THE PEOPLE ACT. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE WAY -- THE WAY OUR ELECTIONS ARE FUNDED. IF ELECTED, WOULD YOU FIX OUR DEMOCRACY FIRST? REP. RYAN: IT IS ESSENTIAL. I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC WAY IS GETTING DISTORTED BECAUSE OF THE MONEY IN POLITICS. THE TOP 1% OWNED 90% OF THE WEALTH AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO GOT THE TAX CUT IN THE LAST ROUND OF TRUMP’S TAX CUT, A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE HUGE DONORS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY GET HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK IN TAXES AND A DUMP THEM INTO THESE SUPER PACS THAT END UP SPENDING MONEY TO GET PEOPLE ELECTED WHO WILL CONTINUE DOWN THE ROAD OF KEEPING THOSE TAX CUTS. FIXING DEMOCRACY HAS TO BE ESSENTIAL. IT IS THE DEMOCRACY AND THE ECONOMY, THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE TO MOVE ON. IT WILL BE A PRIORITY FOR ME. I BELIEVE IN PUBLICLY FINANCING ELECTIONS. I HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THAT MY ENTIRE REAR ENTIRE CAREER. I THINK IT IS THE MOST CORROSIVE THING HAPPENING IN OUR DEMOCRACY TODAY. ADAM: TO FOLLOW ON THAT QUESTION, ALL SORTS OF CANDIDATES ARE MAKING PLEDGES ABOUT THE KINDS OF DONATIONS AND MONEY THEY WILL NOT TAKE. CAN YOU LAY OUT WHAT KIND OF MONEY YOU WILL NOT BE TAKING? REP. RYAN: I HAVE NOT MADE ANY PLEDGES YET. I HAVE NEVER FELT LIKE IF I TAKE A CONTRIBUTION FROM SOMEBODY, THAT SOMEHOW I AM OBLIGATED TO VOTE FOR THEM. I HAVE ACCEPTED DONATIONS FROM A VARIETY OF PEOPLE AND VOTED AGAINST THEIR INTEREST. THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS HAPPY, BUT MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION IS IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING MONEY AND FEEL OBLIGATED TO HAVE TO VOTE THAT WAY, YOU ARE IN THE WRONG BUSINESS, YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE. I HAVE NOT MADE ANY PLEDGES OR ANYTHING WITH REGARD TO CAMPAIGN-FINANCE OTHER THAN TO SAY I THINK I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE TALKING ABOUT PUBLICLY FINANCING ELECTIONS. THAT IS THE MAIN COMMITMENT, THE MAIN PUSH WE NEED. ADAM: DO YOU HAVE A POSITION ON TERM LIMITS? REP. RYAN: FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS? ADAM: CONGRESS AND THE SENATE. REP. RYAN: I AM NOT A TERM LIMIT FAN. IN MY EXPERIENCE, WHAT YOU IS YOU WILL HAVE BUREAUCRATS WEATHER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, ARMY CORPS ENGINEER, WHATEVER, THAT HAVE 40 YEARS EXPERIENCE AND THEN YOU HAVE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE OR A SENATOR TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE AS THE BUREAUCRAT YOU ARE TRYING TO MOVE WITH POLICY AND THEY OUTFOX YOU. I KNEW THIS. WHEN I FIRST GOT IN, THESE PEOPLE, THEY KNEW MORE THAN I DID. NOW I HAVE BEEN IN 17 YEARS AND I KNOW AS MUCH AS THEY DO AND I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MOVE THEM ALONG. I THINK YOU STAFF AND BUREAUCRATS RUNNING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I THINK THAT IS A BAD DEAL FOR US. I HAVE SEEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAVE BEEN IN 30 OR 40 YEARS CALL BUREAUCRATS OUT AND SAY THAT IS BALONEY BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN YOU AND YOU ARE GOING TO DO WHAT WE GOT ELECTED TO DO BY THE PEOPLE. I THINK IT IS GIVING AWAY THE STORE, GIVING AWAY THE POWER THAT SHOULD BELONG TO THE PEOPLE. ADAM: NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MARGARET ANDERSEN. MARGARET: THANK YOU FOR COMING. ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF RANK CHOICE VOTING? REP. RYAN: SAY THAT AGAIN. MARGARET ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF : RANK CHOICE VOTING? REP. RYAN: I DON’T KNOW. I DON’T KNOW. SOMEONE ASKED ME THIS LAST NIGHT AND I HAVE NOT LOOKED INTO IT. IT SOUNDS INTERESTING TO ME. I KNOW THEY DO IT IN MAINE AND I WAS WATCHING THE RACE UP THERE AND SOMEONE WAS SAYING IT IS RANK CHOICE AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT? GIVE ME SOME TIME TO STUDY UP ON THAT. ADAM: SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTION NEXT FROM NILS CHRISTENSEN. HE ASKS WHAT WILL YOU DO TO STOP WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY? REP. RYAN: THIS HAS GOT TO BE A MAJOR INITIATIVE FOR DEMOCRATS. WE DON’T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT WASTE IN THE GOVERNMENT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS $50 BILLION A YEAR WASTED IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THAT IS $1 BILLION A WEEK. WE WANT TO CARE. -- MEDICARE. WE NEED TO PUT STRUCTURES IN PLACE IN HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, IN OUR MILITARY PROGRAMS AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, AGRICULTURE, ALL OF THESE TO SQUEEZE AND GET THESE PROGRAMS RUNNING EFFICIENTLY. WE NEED A STRONG REINVENTING OF GOVERNMENT USING DATA ANALYTICS, METRICS, THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE WASTING THIS MONEY. I AM NOT SAYING WE SAVE THAT MONEY AND GIVE IT TO WARREN BUFFETT IN A TAX CUT. I AM SAYING WE REINVEST BACK INTO THE PROGRAM AND EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM. IT IS RIDICULOUS FOR US TO CEDE THAT TERRITORY TO CONSERVATIVES BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT WORKING AS EFFICIENTLY AND CUT THE PROGRAMS AND THE FUNDING. WE NEED TO BE, AS DEFENDERS OF HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYBODY, AS DEFENDERS OF EDUCATION, MAKING SURE THESE PROGRAMS ARE RUNNING EFFICIENTLY. WE WILL HAVE A BIG REINVENTING GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE THAT WE WILL BE PROPOSING AND I AM EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK -- IT IS 2019, TRUMP WANTS TO BUILD A WALL, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. LET’S USE THAT TECHNOLOGY TO GET THE GOVERNMENT WORKING EFFICIENTLY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ADAM: ARE YOU IN SUPPORT OF MEDICARE FOR ALL? REP. RYAN: REP. RYAN: I HAVE BEEN ON THE MEDICARE FOR ALL BILL SINCE 2007. I TELL THE NEW PEOPLE I WAS ON MEDICARE FOR ALL BEFORE IT WAS EVEN COOL. I THINK THE NATURAL NEXT STEP IS BRING MEDICARE DOWN TO 50 OR 55. IF YOU WANT TO STAY ON PRIVATE INSURANCE, YOU CAN. HELP PEOPLE PAY FOR IT, LIKE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DID, WHERE YOU GIVE PEOPLE CREDITS IF THEY CANNOT QUITE AFFORD THE MEDICARE PIECE. I WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES WITH UNDER 50 EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE TO BUY INTO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THIS WILL HELP WITH INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING KILLED WITH HEALTH CARE COSTS. I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT CONVERSATION. WE CANNOT JUST BE TALKING ABOUT A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT COVERS US WHEN WE ARE SICK. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT KEEPS US HEALTHY AND HOW DO WE BUILD INCENTIVES INTO THE PROCESS FOR EMPLOYERS, FOR PATIENTS, AND FOR DOCTORS THAT GET REWARDED FOR KEEPING US HEALTHY? 75% OF HEALTH-CARE COSTS TODAY ARE FOR CHRONIC DISEASES THAT COULD BE PREVENTED, WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR FOOD SYSTEM, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE STRESS IN OUR COUNTRY. ECONOMIC AND OTHERWISE. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR AGRICULTURE SYSTEM AS WELL. HOW DO WE HAVE A SYSTEM TODAY THAT IS NOT DISEASE MANAGEMENT? THEN YOU HAVE HEALTH CARE COMPANIES AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES SAYING HOW CAN I MAKE -- OFF OF THIS THING? IF WE WANT TO KNOCK THE SOCKS OFF OF OR KNEECAP THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, LET’S FIGURE OUT HOW TO STAY HEALTHY. WE SPENT 2.5% AS MUCH -- 2.5 TIMES AS MUCH -- THAT IS A BROKEN SYSTEM. PART OF IT IS US BEING HEALTHY AND READY TO ROCK ’N’ ROLL AGAINST CHINA. THAT MEANS A SYSTEM THAT MOVES AGAINST PREVENTION, FACTORS IN FOOD AS A COMPONENT TO DISEASES, AND WE NEED TO SET METRICS OVER THE NEXT DECADE OF HOW DO WE CUT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND HALF? HOW DO WE CUT DIABETES AND HALF -- IN HALF? HALF THE COUNTRY TODAY HAS DIABETES OR PREDIABETES. A DIABETIC COSTS TWICE AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER PATIENT. MEDICARE FOR ALL, PRIVATE INSURANCE, FEE FOR SERVICE, OUT-OF-POCKET POCKET, THAT SYSTEM IS GOING TO SINK IF HALF THE COUNTRY HAS DIABETES. MY PITCH IS GOING TO BE FRONTLOADING, TALKING ABOUT FOOD, TALKING ABOUT PREVENTION, WHAT WE ARE GIVING KIDS IN SCHOOLS, GETTING HEALTHY AGAIN, AND BEING LESS RELIANT ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THAT IS WHAT WE CAN DO AS AN ACTIVE REBELLION AGAINST THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. ADAM: YOU MENTIONED AGRICULTURAL POLICY. HOW DO YOU GET MORE LOCAL FOOD TO PEOPLE? YOU HAVE A POLICY IN THE AG DEPARTMENT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE WASTE YOUR IT HOW DO YOU REFORM THAT DEPARTMENT AND MAKING PEOPLE HEALTHY THROUGH FOOD POLICY, EXPLAIN. REP. RYAN: I WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE "REAL FOOD REVOLUTION: THE RETURN TO FAMILY FARM." WE NEED TO HAVE POLICIES THAT MOVE TO SUSTAINABLE FARMING. IT IS BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, PRODUCES REAL FOOD, NOT CROPS THAT GO INTO HIGHLY REALLY PROCESSED FOODS AND I THINK WE NEED TO REWARD AND PAY FARMERS FOR GROWING REAL FOOD. GROWING MORE PRODUCE. PAY THEM FOR THE TRANSITION OUT OF WHERE THEY ARE AND WE ARE GOING TO SAVE THEM MONEY AND HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE LONG RUN. WE NEED TO BRING A STRONG URBAN CULTURAL AGENDA WHERE WE ARE CLOSING THE GAP WHERE THEY CALL FOOD DESERTS WHERE THERE IS NOT A GROCERY STORE WITHIN A MILE OR TWO OF WHERE PEOPLE LIVE. SAME ISSUE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. BUILD THIS AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM TO PROMOTE AND PAY FARMERS MORE TRADITIONAL CROPS. IT IS BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT USE ALL THE PESTICIDES. WE HAVE ALGAE BLOOMS IN THE GREAT LAKES, THERE IS A DEAD ZONE AT THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BECAUSE OF ALL THE CHEMICALS GOING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. WE ARE DESTROYING OUR ENVIRONMENT. I MENTIONED THIS IN IOWA, WE NEED TO PAY FARMERS TO SEQUESTER CARBON. FARMERS CAN BE A BIG PART OF THE SOLUTION OF REVERSING CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE THEY CAN HELP WITH SOME REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURAL TECHNIQUES, NO TILL FARMING, COVER CROPS, ALL THESE METHODS CAN HELP US PUT MORE CARBON IN THE SOIL AND WE SHOULD PAY FARMERS TO DO THAT AS WELL. IF WE COME TOGETHER, SIT DOWN WITH FARMERS, SIT DOWN WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE, PEOPLE IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY AND SAY, HOW DO WE DO THIS? IT CAN BE GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. KIDS WILL BE HEALTHIER AND HAVE BETTER COGNITIVE FUNCTION, SO OUR KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL AND FOCUSED AND CONCENTRATING, WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED THEM TO DO. WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN. IF MONSANTO LOSES IN THE PROCESS, SO BE IT. MOST OF US ARE GOING TO WIN BY BREAKING DOWN THIS SYSTEM. ADAM: THE NEXT QUESTION CALLS FROM -- COMES FROM GALE TAYLOR. REP. RYAN: SORRY YOU GOT STUCK LISTENING TO ME. HE GOT ME FIRED UP, IT WAS HS FAULT. GALE: DO YOU SUPPORT OVERTURNING CITIZENS UNITED? REP. RYAN: OH MY GOODNESS, CAN WE DO IT RIGHT NOW? THE DARK MONEY HAS BEEN CORROSIVE TO OUR POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. THE ADS SHOW UP AND YOU DO NOT KNOW EVEN -- WHO IS EVEN PAYING THESE SUPER PACS. IT IS OBNOXIOUS. IT NEEDS TO END. ADAM: THANK YOU. YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU TALK ABOUT COMING FROM THIS RUST BELT DISTRICT AND THAT IS A TOUGH ISSUE. WHEN THE CONVERSATION TURNS TO CLIMATE CHANGE, HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU ARE HOME? REP. RYAN: JOBS. I BELIEVE AN AGGRESSIVE AGENDA AROUND CLIMATE MEANS JOBS. WE HAVE GOT TO STOP SEEING IT AS A NEGATIVE. I WILL GIVE YOU TWO OR THREE OR 10 EXAMPLES DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE. ELECTRIC VEHICLES. RIGHT NOW, THERE IS ONE MILLION TO 2 MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BY 2030, THERE IS GOING TO BE 30 MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES. I WANT THOSE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES. I WANT THE BATTERIES MADE IN THE UNITED STATES, I WANT THE PLATFORMS MADE IN THE UNITED STATES, I WANT THE STEEL MADE IN THE UNITED STATES. SAME WITH BATTERIES, SAME WITH CHARGING STATIONS. SOME ESTIMATES HAVE IT AS A MULTITRILLION DOLLAR OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESS JUST REBUILDING CHARGING STATIONS TO CHARGE THESE CARS. IT WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO SOMEONE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET? IT MEANS A GOOD JOB AND WE SHOULD SIT DOWN WITH VENTURE CAPITALISTS, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, THE BIG THREE, SUPPLY CHAIN, AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO CONVENE AND USE THE WEIGHT OF THE OFFICE NOT TO BASH FORMER FIRST LADIES, BUT CONVENE AND GET THE MARKET GOING. DO THE SAME THING AROUND SOLAR. THESE ARE THINGS WE WANT TO DO FOR CLIMATE, BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF SAYING TO THE AVERAGE PERSON STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET, HAS A HEALTH CARE ISSUE, OPIATE CRISIS, CLIMATE IS WAY OVER HERE NOT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CARE, BUT BECAUSE THE PRESSURES OF DAILY LIFE DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO ENTERTAIN THOSE BIGGER PROBLEMS. SOLAR, TRYING TO CONTROL 60% OF THE SOLAR MARKET, THOSE ARE JOBS AND IF WE HAVE TAX POLICIES AND INVESTMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS AND INCENTIVES THROUGH THE TAX CODE, NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS AND ALL THESE THINGS DRIVE THAT INVESTMENT INTO THE DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES FROM THE OLD ECONOMY . IF YOU HAVE LOST JOBS, IF YOUR WAGES ARE DOWN, HOW DO WE GET ALL THESE INVESTMENTS SPRINKLED AROUND THE COUNTRY? INVEST INTO SMALLER COMMUNITIES AND GET THIS PRIVATE SECTOR, WHICH IS WHY I SAY WE CANNOT BE HOSTILE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING TO REVERSE CLIMATE CHANGE, JUST LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT GO TO THE MOON. IT WAS THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THE TECHNOLOGIES, THE ENGINEERS WHO WORK FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THEY GOT US TO THE MOON. WE SET THE POLICY, PUT SOME INVESTMENT, PUT SOME SKIN IN THE GAME, CATALYZE, AND LET’S GO. I THINK IT IS A HUGE JOB OPPORTUNITY AND THAT’S HOW I TALK ABOUT IT AT HOME. ADAM: SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTION FROM PATRICK O’HAIR ON AN ISSUE THAT HAS REALLY BUBBLED UP. DOES HE SUPPORT REPARATIONS? REP. RYAN: I SUPPORT -- THERE IS A BILL TO FORM A COMMISSION, WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT, WHICH WILL STUDY THE IMPACT OF SLAVERY. CLEARLY, WE CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE DAMAGE, SOCIAL, CULTURAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC THAT HAS BEEN DONE BECAUSE OF SLAVERY AND ITS AFTERMATH. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE, TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS PART OF A CONVERSATION. THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WILL WE MAKE INVESTMENTS INTO CLOSING THE OPPORTUNITY GAPS THAT EXIST IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR? ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT IS IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY, IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM, YES, WE HAVE TO. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE VERY INFORMATIVE AS WE AGGRESSIVELY TRY TO CLOSE GAPS DOWN. ADAM: BIG PICTURE QUESTION, WHAT ADVERSITY HAVE YOU FACED IN YOUR LIFE THAT HAS MADE YOU A BETTER LEADER? REP. RYAN: GROWING UP IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAD ECONOMIC ISSUES, MY PARENTS WERE DIVORCED, MY PARENTS -- THAT IS ALWAYS SEMI-TRAUMATIC ANNA YOUNG KID, MYSELF AND MY BROTHER, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS YOUR ADVERSITY IS A ROADBLOCK IN SOME INSTANCES. IF THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT HELP YOU AS A KID, ESPECIALLY, YOU CAN OVERCOME THOSE ADVERSITIES, THOSE HEARTBREAKS YOU HAVE. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND THIS IS WHY IT IS A MAIN THEME IN THE CAMPAIGN, HOW DO WE COME TOGETHER? I KNOW, WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT COME FROM THAT PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE, THE COMMUNITY WAS AROUND ME. IT WAS MY COACHES, IT WAS MY TEACHERS, IT WAS THE NEIGHBOR WHO WOULD KICK YOU IN THE REAR END IF YOU NEEDED IT AND SOMETIMES KICK YOU IN THE REAR END IF YOU DID NOT NEED IT. BUT WAS THERE FOR YOU AND CARED ABOUT YOU AND THE IDEA THAT WE ANOTHER ONE WAS WHEN I GOT HURT, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE THE CORNERBACK OF THE CLEVELAND BROWNS GROWING UP. THAT WAS LIKE ALL MY EGGS WERE IN ONE BASKET HURRIED I GOT A FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIP TO BE CORNERBACK AT YOUNGSTOWN STATE UNIVERSITY. I WAS SO EXCITED. IT WAS A DIVISION I COLLEGE. FIRST SCRIMMAGE, I BLEW MY KNEE OUT AND SHATTERED THE DREAMS AND NOW THEY HAD TO GET BAKER MAYFIELD AND NOW HE IS THE QUARTERBACK. I AM SORRY, BUT I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE OK. THAT WAS REALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE THAT BROKE MY IDENTITY REALLY AS THIS QUARTERBACK. I HAD TO OVERCOME THAT AND REASSEMBLE WHO I WAS MOVING FORWARD, BUT DREW A LOT FROM THAT. THAT GOT ME INTO POLITICS AND HERE I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. ADAM: YOU ARE UNIQUE IN ANY CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN THAT YOU LIVED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE THING ABOUT LIVING HERE WHEN YOU WENT TO UNH AND FRANKLIN PIERCE LAW SCHOOL? REP. RYAN: THE FALL. YOU CANNOT EVEN EXPLAIN IT TO PEOPLE. ON OUR TV SET AT HOME, WHEN IT GOES QUIET AND THEY FLASH PICTURES, ONE OF THE QUESTION -- PICTURES HAS GOT TO BE FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE LEAVES ARE SO VIVID. I WOULD TELL MY WIFE, THAT HAS GOT TO BE NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE FALL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, NOTHING LIKE IT. I WILL BE HERE A LOT IN THE FALL, OK? ADAM: CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE CANDIDATE. WE THANK YOU, OUR AUDIENCE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS, AND THE FOLKS WALKING AT HOME. HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.
