Here are the answers you are looking for in regard to AISD recapture payments:

The estimated recapture payments are calculated using a state formula funding template that is utilized by Texas school districts. The template estimates the amount of recapture due based on estimated student data and estimated tax collections. The template is provided by Education Service Center Region 13.

Austin ISD is estimated to pay $533,874,730 in recapture payments for the 2017-2018 school year.
