Del Monte Pet Products Voluntarily Withdraws Specific Product Codes of Pet Treats and Wet Dog Food Products in the United States

April 6, 2007As a precautionary measure, Del Monte Pet Products is voluntarily recalling select product codes of its pet treat products sold under the Jerky Treats®, Gravy Train® Beef Sticks and Pounce Meaty Morsels® brands as well as select dog snack and wet dog food products sold under private label brands. A complete list of affected brands and products is below.

No other Del Monte Pet Products treats, biscuits or wet dog food products are impacted by this recall, and no Del Monte dry cat food, dry dog food, wet cat food or pouched pet foods are subject to this voluntary recall.

The Company took this voluntary recall action immediately after learning from the FDA that wheat gluten supplied to Del Monte Pet Products from a specific manufacturing facility in China contained melamine. Melamine is a substance not approved for use in food. The FDA made this finding as part of its ongoing investigation into the recent pet food recall. Del Monte Pet Products has proactively engaged and fully cooperated with the FDA since the start of its investigation.

Del Monte Pet Products has not used wheat gluten from this manufacturing facility in China in any other pet products except those described below. The adulterated ingredients were used in a limited production quantity over the last three months for those items identified by specific product codes below. This recall removes all Del Monte Pet Products with wheat gluten procured from this manufacturing facility from retail shelves. Del Monte did not use product from this supplier prior to the recall period in question and has since discontinued sourcing product from this manufacturing facility.

Consumers should discontinue feeding the products with the Product Codes detailed below to their pets.

Del Monte Pet Products are 100% guaranteed and all voluntarily recalled products will be refunded.

Del Monte Pet Products customers can contact our Consumer Hotline at (800) 949-3799 for further information about the recall and for instructions on obtaining a product refund.
