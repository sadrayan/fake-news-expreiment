Phosphorus and Nitrogen Dynamics in Streams during a Wildfire
Various studies report changes in phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in surface waters after wildfires; however, we have found no reports which include nutrient data collected during actual wildfire activity. We had an opportunity to collect water chemistry data from several streams as a large (15,500 ha) intense firestorm passed through their watersheds. Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations increased from 5 to 60 fold over background levels within the first two days of the fire with maximum recorded concentrations for dissolved nutrients reaching as high as 135 μg/L soluble reactive phosphorus, 261 μg/L ammonium, and 61 μg/L nitrate + nitrite. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen levels increased up to 206 μg/L and 349 μg/L respectively. Nutrient concentrations declined to background levels typically <5-10 μg/L within several days to several weeks. Experimental evidence suggests that the primary source of phosphorus was from leaching of ash deposited directly into the streams during the firestorm while the primary source of nitrogen appeared to be from diffusion of smoke gases into the stream waters.
