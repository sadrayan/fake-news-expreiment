Marilyn Manson Dies from Injuries Sustained during Show |BREAKING NEW…
NEW YORK — It has been confirmed American singer, songwriter, musician, composer, actor, painter, author and former music journalist Marilyn Manson has died at age 48.

Marilyn Manson was rushed to the hospital Friday night after a large stage prop fell on top of him during his show at the Manhattan Center Hammerstein Ballroom. He was in the middle of a performance of his Eurythmics cover “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” when it appears he touched the struts of a scaffolding setup attached to two large guns, causing it to tip over onto him.

Stage crew immediately rushed to get the prop off of him, and TMZ reports it took several minutes to get Manson onto a stretcher as crew and bandmates stood near him onstage.

One of the show attendees, Yousif Al Zaid, 23, told The Guardian, “It happened in the middle of his song ‘Sweet Dreams.’ He performed it and all of a sudden he climbed on to the two guns. . . At end of the song he bent over holding one of the poles [on the prop] and tipped over. Then it all went silent and you could hear a pin drop. Everyone rushed to him and there were rumors he was dead. Then they brought out a stretcher and he was taken away.

He was earlier reported only to have fractured his ankle, but official news just broke out the singer died from injuries he sustained from the accident.

Manson was three dates into his Heaven Upside Down Tour, due to end in December with a series of U.K. performances. He reportedly broke his ankle recently during a show in Pittsburgh, but kept performing despite the injury.
