Meme of the week: Sad Keanu
A paparazzo photographed Keanu Reeves sitting alone on a park bench, eating a sandwich and looking sad. Why might Keanu have been sad? Perhaps because his father abandoned him as a child. Or maybe he was thinking about his good friend River Phoenix, who died in a drug overdose, or the daughter-to-be who was stillborn. But Keanu Reeves is inherently hilarious, and so it was more fun for people on the Internet to have fun with the Sad Keanu photo than to think about any of this, and so the Internet people created many additional Sad Keanu photos using Photoshop, such as one featuring Sad Keanu surrounded by cats. But then other Internet people invented a mostly-earnest secondary meme to accompany the ironic first one: Cheer Up Keanu Day, a Facebook-driven effort to “hopefully bring a smile to Keanu Reeves’ face” by sending him “letters, emails, gifts, and any other niceties.” The group has attracted more than 15,000 supporters.
