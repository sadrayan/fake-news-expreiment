How many TB cases and deaths are there?
Trends

The TB mortality rate (i.e. TB deaths among HIV-negative people per 100 000 population per year) is falling at about 3% per year, and the overall reduction in the period 2000–2017 was 42%.

Worldwide, the TB incidence rate is falling at about 2% per year. The fastest regional declines from 2013 to 2017 were in the WHO European Region and the WHO African Region. In the same 5 years, particularly impressive reductions (4–8% per year) occurred in southern Africa (e.g. Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe), following a peak in the HIV epidemic and the expansion of TB and HIV prevention and care; and in the Russian Federation (5% per year), following intensified efforts to reduce the burden of TB and scrutiny of progress from the highest political levels.
