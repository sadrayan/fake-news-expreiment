Ma Sedaye is originally from Zimbabwe! Now she lives in Columbus, Ohio. She has three children, Shamizo, Robert, and Bathabile, who are all grown up, but she is still known as Ma Sedaye. In Zimbabwe, Ma was a nurse, and after working as a cleaner here in America, she eventually pursued her dream in community college to become a nurse once more! This blog is her special side project when she is not working at the hospital.
