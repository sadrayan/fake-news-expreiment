Bachelor Police Studies
The Bachelor’s Degree in Police Studies is a three-year course run by the Norwegian Police University College. The training is professionally orientated and is intended to provide a broad theoretical and practical foundation for police work.

The training is based on the principle that all newly qualified policemen/women must be generalists. A generalist is a policeman/woman who possesses basic knowledge and skills pertaining to the police’s preventative, crime prevention and civil order work. In solving assignments, generalists shall be able to perform basic police duties, make overall assessments of situations, view their work in a broader social context and engage relevant specialist expertise and partners as required. Generalists shall acquire a basis for continued learning and development through the execution of their profession.
