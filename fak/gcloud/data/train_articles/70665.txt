API: New oil tax proposal would harm consumers

WASHINGTON, February 4, 2016 – President Obama’s proposal to add a new $10 per barrel tax on crude oil would harm consumers, said API President and CEO Jack Gerard:



“The White House thinks Americans are not paying enough for gasoline, so they have proposed a new tax that could raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon, harm consumers that are enjoying low energy prices, destroy American jobs and reverse America’s emergence as a global energy leader.



“On his way out of office, President Obama has now proposed making the United States less competitive.”
