In October, Customs and Border Protection unveiled eight prototypes on for President Donald Trump's long-promised wall along the 1,900-mile US-Mexico border.

On Tuesday, Trump is visiting the prototypes to inspect them for himself. "I'll see you at the wall!" he said as he boarded Marine One on the way to California.

Workers from six companies spent a month constructing prototypes designed to deter illegal entry of immigrants and drugs. Then the tactical teams took over to test each stretch of wall.

They evaluated if the prototypes could prevent breaching, climbing, and digging, as well as ensure the safety of CBP officers, according to Ron Vitiello, CBP's acting deputy commissioner.

Shortly after taking office, Trump issued an executive order demanding that the Homeland Security Secretary "take steps to immediately plan, design and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border."

Although Trump's plans for a border wall have been beset by a number of obstacles — including the Senate's refusal to greenlight a $1.6 billion down payment, Mexico's refusal to pay for it, wavering estimates on the total cost, and a lawsuit from California — his administration has moved ahead with the prototypes.
