Here is the info responsive to the follow up questions:

1) Are city salaries generally already approved to bump up in any way that would change the chart you sent me yesterday (either lifting more workers into this category or knocking some out)? Yes, see chart below and attachment “Salariesover100k__Sep14v3.xls”

2) Are there unfilled positions paying $100,000 or more? If so, can the HR folks send a supplemental chart showing those positions and individual salaries? Yes, they are included in the detailed report at the end of the report.

3) How many total jobs does the city have budgeted, both occupied and not? For FY15 there are 12,780 budgeted positions.

Based upon the follow up question we have run an analysis of what the new pay rates will be in the first pay period after the beginning of the fiscal year (October 1). Based on those increases, the numbers are higher. We have a table that summarizes the information below and a file that contains the detail. These are not current pay rates but the future pay rates (based on your follow up questions for those).

Projection of salaries as of October 5, 2014 FY15(includes vacancies)

# Ees Earning at least $100K % of Total Austin Energy 238 20% Public Safety 551 46% EMS 23 2% Fire 111 9% Police 417 35% Remainder 409 34% Total >$100K 1198 100%

Total budgeted positions for FY15 = 12,780

And, for your additional follow up question there were 11 in the previous file I sent you that were double counted – I’m sorry for that error.(890-11=879)

Clarification: The initial spreadsheet that we provided you (879 – included no vacancies or increases) was actually as of 9/1/14 instead of 9/14/14 as I had reported.

The most recent spreadsheet I sent you did include FY15 numbers, and it included the 3.5 pay raises effective September 21, 2014 with a paycheck date of October 10, 2014.
