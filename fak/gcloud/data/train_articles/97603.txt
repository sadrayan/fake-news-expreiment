Financial help â€“ Refugees
The Canadian government has several programs to help refugees settle in their new home.

Resettlement Assistance Program

The Government of Canada gives resettlement help to Convention Refugees Abroad.

In some cases, they offer this help to members of the Country of Asylum Class who have been:

identified as refugees with special needs and

admitted to Canada as government-assisted refugees.

If you claimed refugee protection from inside Canada, you are not eligible for this program.

These funds are used to help pay for:

meeting you at the airport or port of entry

a temporary place to live

help finding a permanent place to live

basic household items and

general help with life in Canada.

You can also use this money for income support for up to one year, or until you can support yourself, whichever comes first.

Immigration Loans Program

The Immigration Loans Program helps refugees resettled from overseas pay for:

travel documents and

transportation to Canada.

Loans are approved according to your needs and ability to repay.

Loans may also be available to other newcomers to Canada to cover expenses such as:

rental housing

telephone deposits, and

work tools.

Interest is charged on Immigration Loans Program loans. The Department of Finance sets the interest rate each January.
