Top Russian broadcaster: Trump could get assassinated over Russia outreach
ADVERTISEMENT "Trump’s leading in the race. His ability to state things as they are, and his intention to end the recent extreme Russian-American tensions — all this puts him in a very risky situation,” Dmitry Kiselyov said Wednesday on Russia 1.

“Now they may just kill him,” he said.

Kiselyov was appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013 to head the country's official government-owned international news agency, Rossiya Segodnya.

Kiselyov, 62, appeared to implicate the FBI and establishment politicians, railing against "special services" and "American oligarchs."

“The U.S. special services do not need such a president. Those services promote hatred toward Russia in order to justify their existence,” he declared.

“The American oligarchs also do not need such a president. For these oligarchs, the existing world order ensures solid and stable business. For them, a Trump who is ready to settle issues with Russia means that the finances will flow in a different direction.”

Kiselyov is a former host on Soviet Central Television.

Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, spoke highly of Putin last week during the "Commander-in-Chief Forum," lauding his 82 percent approval rating in Russia.
