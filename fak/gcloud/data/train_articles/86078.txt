Mission Statement

Founded in 1984, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund is dedicated to telling the story of American Law Enforcement and making it safer for those who serve.

A nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization headquartered in Washington, DC, the Memorial Fund built and continues to maintain the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial—the nation’s monument to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The Memorial Fund is a principal organizer of the National Police Week observance each May and hosts a Candlelight Vigil each May 13th to honor all fallen officers. In addition, the Fund maintains the largest, most comprehensive database of line-of-duty officer deaths, conducts research into officer fatality trends and issues, and serves as an information clearinghouse.

More recently, the Memorial Fund is building the National Law Enforcement Museum, currently under construction adjacent to the Memorial in Washington, DC. The Museum will tell the story of American law enforcement through exhibits, collections, research and education.

The Memorial Fund is governed by a Board of Directors representing 16 of the most prestigious law enforcement organizations in the country. In addition, three major corporate partners serve on the Board of Directors including DuPont, Motorola and Verizon. Led by Chief Executive Officer Craig W. Floyd, Memorial Fund staff members bring diverse backgrounds and skills to the organization’s mission. The Memorial Fund does not receive taxpayer dollars for its day-to-day operations, but relies on the generous contributions of the public.
