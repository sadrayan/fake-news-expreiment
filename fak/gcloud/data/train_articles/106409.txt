Attention women!! Husbands, fathers,and brothers...
Attention women!! Husbands, fathers,and brothers too!! Tell this story to everyone you know!!! Today (08/07/16) while leaving walmart in Darboy,WI at about 4:45pm a woman in her 20s approached me and in an embarrassed hushed tone said i started my period and i should come to her car and get her sweatshirt to tie around my waist and i could just keep it. To most this sounds like an innocent, kind hearted gesture from one woman to another but what she didn't know is that i had a hysterectomy about 8 months ago...i can't have periods. A guy the next row over heard me telling her i was fine and that I'm going straight home and she started to argue with me about coming to her car and he came over and said hey how's it going long time no see and i played along for a moment thinking i possibly knew him from work and when i turned back to tell the woman that I'm not interested she was gone. The guy introduced himself as John Meldais(sp?) and said he's up from Milwaukee visiting his mom and he's a police officer. He explained to me that this trick is just one of many used to abduct unsuspecting women and he offered to stay with me while i contacted local police and gave my report. I'm grateful he was there today or who knows what might have happened! Ladies don't believe anyone you don't know! We see this on the news and feel awful for those involved but think it'll never happen to us. Don't be a victim!
