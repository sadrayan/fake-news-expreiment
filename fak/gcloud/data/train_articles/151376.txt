How Donald Trump Finally Settled on Mike Pence
The newly forged ticket will face a grueling test in the coming days, as two very different political performers get accustomed to each other as teammates. The Trump campaign said both men would appear together at the Hilton Midtown in Manhattan on Saturday, and the campaign previously committed to a joint interview on “60 Minutes” on CBS.

Their chemistry could determine just how extensively the two will campaign together during the summer and fall. According to Republicans briefed on the Trump campaign’s deliberations, Mr. Pence could conceivably travel the country on his own, shoring up support for Mr. Trump in conservative areas and Republican-leaning states, like North Carolina and Arizona, where Mr. Trump appears vulnerable.

Within Mr. Trump’s inner circle, Mr. Pence is seen as a reliable sidekick, unlikely to cause trouble or upstage Mr. Trump in any way.

But the relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence remains a work in progress, and they could well form a closer bond over the course of the campaign.

Even as Mr. Pence endured as the clear favorite of Mr. Trump’s advisers, both Mr. Christie and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, lingered as alternative possibilities. Allies of Mr. Christie were convinced, as late as Friday morning, that he was still in contention.

When the choice was finally made, it caught at least one contender by surprise: Mr. Gingrich said in an email a few minutes before 11 a.m. that he had yet to hear directly from the Trump campaign about its decision.
