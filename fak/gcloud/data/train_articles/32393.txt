Recognizing Our Generous Supporters
The Clinton Foundation's impact would not be possible without the generous philanthropic support of thousands of individuals, corporations, foundations, and other funders. Their contributions continue to make a difference in the lives of tens of millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. We are grateful for their support and pleased to recognize them in the listing below, which is updated quarterly, consistent with the Foundation’s commitment to transparency. The list recognizes cumulative lifetime giving from those who have made contributions to advance any aspect of the Foundation’s mission, including through gifts, grants, memberships, sponsorships, and conference fees. This includes support for the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Presidential Center. Current listings include giving through Date. We thank them all for their generosity.
