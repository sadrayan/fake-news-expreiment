Restaurant apologizes for employees who sang anti-cop song | Daily Ma…
'F--- tha Police' is one of the most well known hit songs performed by the Compton, California-based hip hop group N.W.A (above)

Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect

Judge Dre presiding

In the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department

Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube

And Eazy-motherf***ing-E

Order, order, order

Ice Cube, take the motherf***ing stand

Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth

And nothing but the truth so help your black ***?

You goddamn right!

Well won't you tell everybody what the f*** you gotta say?

F*** the police coming straight from the underground

A young n***a got it bad cause I'm brown

And not the other color so police think

They have the authority to kill a minority

F*** that s***, cause I ain't the one

For a punk motherf***er with a badge and a gun

To be beating on, and thrown in jail

We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell

F***ing with me cause I'm a teenager

With a little bit of gold and a pager

Searching my car, looking for the product

Thinking every n***a is selling narcotics

You'd rather see, me in the pen

Than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o

Beat a police out of shape

And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape

To tape off the scene of the slaughter

Still getting swoll off bread and water

I don't know if they f*** or what

Search a n***a down, and grabbing his n***

And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none

But don't let it be a black and a white one

Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top

Black police showing out for the white cop

Ice Cube will swarm

On any motherf***er in a blue uniform

Just cause I'm from the CPT

Punk police are afraid of me, huh

A young n***a on the warpath

And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath

Of cops, dying in L.A

Yo Dre, I got something to say

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

Pull your god damn *** over right now

Aww s***, now what the f*** you pullin me over for?

Cause I feel like it!

Just sit your *** on the curb and shut the f*** up

Man, f*** this s***

Aight, smart***, I'm taking your black *** to jail!

MC Ren, will you please give your testimony

To the jury about this f***ed up incident?

F*** the police and Ren said it with authority

Because the n***as on the street is a majority

A gang is with whoever I'm stepping

And the motherf***ing weapon is kept in

A stash box, for the so-called law

Wishing Ren was a n***a that they never saw

Lights start flashing behind me

But they're scared of a n***a so they mace me to blind me

But that s*** don't work, I just laugh

Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path

For police, I'm saying, "F*** you punk!"

Reading my rights and s***, it's all junk

Pulling out a silly club, so you stand

With a fake-*** badge and a gun in your hand

But take off the gun so you can see what's up

And we'll go at it punk, and I'ma f*** you up!

Make you think I'mma kick your ***

But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast

I'm sneaky as f*** when it comes to crime

But I'ma smoke them now and not next time

Smoke any motherf***er that sweats me

Or any ***hole that threatens me

I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope

Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me

The motherf***ing villain that's mad

With potential, to get bad as f***

So I'ma turn it around

Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound

{​*BOOM, BOOM*}​

Yeah, something like that

But it all depends on the size of the gat

Taking out a police would make my day

But a n***a like Ren don't give a f*** to say

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

Yo man, what you need?

Police, open out!

Aww s***

We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest

Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em

(Move motherf***er, move now!)

What the f*** did I do, man what did I do?

Just shut the f*** up

And get your motherf***ing *** on the floor

(You heard the man, shut the f*** up!)

But I didn't do s***

Man just shut the f*** up!

Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand

And tell the jury how you feel about this bulls***?

I'm tired of the motherf***ing jacking

Sweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and

Shining the light in my face, and for what?

Maybe it's because I kick so much butt

I kick *** -- or maybe cause I blast

On a stupid-*** n***a when I'm playing with the trigger

Of an Uzi or an AK

Cause the police always got something stupid to say

They put out my picture with silence

Cause my identity by itself causes violence

The E with the criminal behavior

Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor

Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?

A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot

By me, or another n***a

And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger

(MC Ren: Size don't mean s***, he's from the old school fool)

And as you all know, E's here to rule

Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror

And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a

Dumb motherf***er with a gun

And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one

That I take out, and then get away

While I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

The verdict

The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck

White bread, chickens*** motherf***er

But wait, that's a lie! That's a god damn lie!

Get him out of here!

Get him the f*** out my face!

I want justice!

Out, right now!

F*** you, you black motherf***ers!

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police

F*** Tha Police
