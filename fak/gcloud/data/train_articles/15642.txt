I can tell you what we have in our latest election-year study. The ANES 2012 Time Series Study was conducted over two modes, via in-person interviewing and also via internet (Web-based) interviewing. Among respondents who said they were born-again Christians, 83% said they voted in the 2012 elections for the in-person sample and 78% said they voted in the 2012 elections for the Internet sample. It should be noted of course that this is self-report.
