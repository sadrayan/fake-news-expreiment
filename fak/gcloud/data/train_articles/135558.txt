Bill Cosby Hollywood star removed!
Bill Cosby has yet to be convicted and already his Hollywood Star is being removed. What gives them the right to remove a star when there have been multiple Hollywood stars who’ve been charged with horrible crimes and they didn’t removed theirs.

This is a disgrace and a shame to not only Bill Cosby but to the entertainment industry as a whole. This is saying if your black in Hollywood and commit a crime no matter what it is your star is removed. This is unbelievable.

How do you feel about this?
