Brimming with caffeine and nicotine?

Broadcast Date: Feb. 17, 2004

Countless Canadians are addicted to Tim Hortons coffee, and CBC-TV's Disclosure wants to know why. "What's in this brew that has us all spellbound?" asks Disclosure's Peter Walsh, a self-confessed Tim's addict. Rumour has it that Tim's has the maximum amount of caffeine legally allowed. Or is it filled with nicotine? In this light-hearted 2004 TV clip, Walsh gets to the bottom of these rumours by taking the coffee to a science lab for analysis.
