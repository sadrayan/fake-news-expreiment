"While we'd obviously wish the Debate Commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Mr Trump," a spokesman for the organization said.

Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, Friday tweeted opposition to the debate schedule that has been finalized since September of last year by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Two of the planned debates coincide with Sunday and Monday night NFL games.

"As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/Bernie. Unacceptable!" Trump tweeted.

In an excerpt of an ABC interview to air Sunday, Trump said he received the letter from the NFL.

"I'll tell you what I don't like. It's against two NFL games. I got a letter from the NFL saying, 'This is ridiculous,' " he said.
