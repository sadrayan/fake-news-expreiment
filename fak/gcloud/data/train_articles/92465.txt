State senators advance controversial 'anti-Sharia' bill
A controversial measure dubbed an “anti-Sharia bill” advanced out of the Florida Senate on a 24-14 vote Monday.

The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatilla, touted SB 286 as “an American bill.”

It would restrict judges from considering foreign law in matters of divorce, alimony, child support and custody.

Under the language of the bill, an order of a foreign court would not be enforceable if it “offends the public policy of the state.”

It goes on to say: “Any attempt to apply the law of a foreign country is void if it contravenes the strong public policy of this state or if the law is unjust or unreasonable.”

Several senators said they were baffled by perceived need for the bill, feared it would inhibit foreign trade and adversely affect the state’s large Jewish population and their Israel-granted divorces.

“There is no record of Sharia law being implemented in the courts of Florida or any other state,” Sen. Eleanor Sobel, a Hollywood Democrat said, in opposition.

Sharia is the moral code and religious laws that governs Muslim life.

“Although the bill seems neutral on its face, the perception is that it targets certain citizens in the state of Florida,” Sen. Geraldine Thompson, D-Orlando, said.

“There is nothing in this bill that sends a message to anyone of another nation that is not positive,” Hays said. “Those people who want to come to America, we welcome them, but when you come to America, you are going to be governed under American laws, when you come to Florida you are going to be governed b y Florida laws, and we ought not to apologize for that.”

A comparable House bill (HB 903), sponsored by Rep. Neil Combee, R-Polk City, is poised to go to that chamber’s floor for a vote.
