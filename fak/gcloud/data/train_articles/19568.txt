Josh Mandel for U.S. Senate – Official Campaign Website
Columbus, OH – State Treasurer Josh Mandel was joined by homeowners today at press conferences across Ohio and highlighted that Senator Sherrod Brown voted to raise taxes, but didn’t pay his own taxes three times.

“Senator Brown is a serial delinquent when it comes to not paying his property taxes. He voted to raise our taxes more than thirty times, but failed to pay his own taxes three separate times,” Treasurer Mandel said. “Sherrod Brown only managed to pay his property taxes after a reporter asked him about it, and at one point in time he had fallen so far behind that his condo was listed for public auction."

Treasurer Mandel was joined by concerned homeowners in Hamilton, Franklin, and Cuyahoga counties.

“To make matters worse, Senator Brown sits on the Banking Committee and the Subcommittee on Housing. When the guy who’s supposed to be writing our banking and housing laws can’t be bothered to pay taxes on his condo, it’s time to send him packing,” Mandel added.

Treasurer Mandel also released a new TV ad to highlight the issue.
