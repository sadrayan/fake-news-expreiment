Fact check: Trump says 10,000 at El Paso County Coliseum rally; Fire Department says not true
The El Paso County Coliseum holds about 6,500 people, but President Donald Trump told the crowd that his campaign got special permission from the El Paso Fire Department to let 10,000 inside.

An El Paso Fire Department spokesman on Monday said the president's claim was incorrect.

Enrique D Aguilar, fire public information officer, said no special permission was given by the Fire Department, and the Coliseum had about 6,500 people in it during the president's rally — at capacity, but well within its standard allowance.

Aguilar said "it might be 10,000 with the people outside" total, but the Fire Department did not track the number of people outside. The Coliseum was full at about 4 p.m., and thousands watched the president's speech on big screens outside.
