Fox News Poll: 60% Believe Trump Is Hiding Something in Tax Returns
Is Donald Trump hiding something in his tax returns?

According to a Fox News poll taken a week ago, a majority of voters believe that the GOP candidate is "hiding something" by failing to release the documents.

The poll found that 60 percent of registered voters, including 36 percent of Republicans, believe Trump is hiding something, compared to 35 percent who believe the opposite.

Trump reiterated on The O'Reilly Factor last night that the returns will be released when a routine IRS audit is complete.

"Nobody cares about it except some of the folks in the media. Nobody cares about it," Trump said, adding that he'll release his returns "immediately" if Hillary Clinton releases her 33,000 deleted emails.

Meantime, former President Bill Clinton said at a campaign event that he was "tickled" when he heard that Trump called the Clinton Foundation a "criminal enterprise."

Clinton then brought up a reported pay-to-play situation involving Trump and Florida AG Pam Bondi, who endorsed the billionaire earlier this year.

"He made a political contribution to the attorney general of Florida who at the time had an office investigating Trump University and mysteriously the investigation vanished," Clinton said.
