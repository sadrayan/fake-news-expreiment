Bob Woodward Admits He Lied In Anti-Trump Book
When Eric Trump said that fake news media “journalist” Bob Woodward’s only goal was to “make three extra shekels” by trashing President Trump, he was exactly right.

Woodward recently appeared on CNN to push his new book, which is filled with lies and slanderous libel targeting President Trump.

“Don’t you think people look through the fact that you can write a sensational, nonsense book, CNN will definitely have you on there because they love to trash the president,” Eric Trump said, adding that Woodward’s goal was to make some “shekels.”

Woodward has pushed back against President Trump for pointing out that numerous “sources” didn’t even speak to Woodward and have come out to say he was lying in his trash book. But now, he admits he lied.

“There was a lot of guesswork when I was putting this book together and I had to embellish a little,” Woodward admitted in an MSNBC appearance. “I used hundreds of sources, but not all of the information was available.”

Woodward says that “constructing a story” to hurt the President is like “assembling a puzzle with missing pieces” and that when it’s all said and done, “you can always find where the missing pieces go.”

This latest admission by a Trump critic that he was lying comes as no surprise to most of us, but liberals are (of course) ignoring it. It’s time for us to expand libel laws so that President Trump can sue all these naysayers.
