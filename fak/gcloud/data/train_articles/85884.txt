Menendez calls on feds to award funds to Newark police after 10-day homicide surge
NEWARK — U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez asked the Department of Justice to award funds to Newark police that will allow the cash-strapped city to hire more police in the wake of a bloody 10-day span that left 10 dead, his office said today.

In a letter written to Attorney General Eric Holder, Menendez (D-N.J) said the federal government should give Newark the money to hire 15 additional police officers through the Community-Oriented Police Services grant, better known as COPS. Newark police applied for the grant this year, and have received funds from it in the past.

"The Newark Police Department is doing its utmost to combat the spike in crime, including additional police presence and patrols, as well as resources focused on preventing gun violence," he wrote in the letter. "However, in recent years, budget constraints at both the federal and state level have hampered Newark’s ability to fully respond to upticks in violent crime."

The city is also supposed to add 50 police officers to its ranks later this year, officials have said. Menendez said he led a delegation of legislators that helped New Jersey police departments hire 50 new officers through the COPS program last year.

In 2010, a massive public works purge led to the layoff of roughly 1,000 Newark employees, including 163 police officers. Retirements in the years that followed have shrunk the department's roster to around 1,000 officers, its lowest staffing in years.

Menendez's announcement comes on the heels of a brutal crime surge that saw 10 people killed in the city's streets between Aug. 26 and Sept. 4. A 61-year-old man who was shot in August also died of his wounds in that time frame, and a killing occurred at the county jail.

Newark was on pace for its first annual decrease in homicides before the crime wave, but the city's death toll now stands at 61.
