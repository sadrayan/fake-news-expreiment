Donald Trump says Vladimir Putin more of a leader than President Obama
Donald Trump praised Vladimir Putin on Wednesday for his high approval ratings and his "very strong control" over Russia, comparing him favourably to Barack Obama, the US president.

Mr Trump made the comments during a foreign policy forum in which Hillary Clinton appeared first and had difficulty answering questions about her handling of classified materials as secretary of state.

The Republican nominee then took the stage, and presented several unorthodox prescriptions for America's approach to foreign affairs.

"The man has very strong control over a country," Mr Trump said of Mr Putin at one point. "It's a very different system and I don't happen to like the system, but certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader."

Mr Trump repeated his claim that he opposed the invasion of Iraq – despite the fact that he expressed support for it in a 2002 interview – and said that after the US combat mission ended troops should have remained to "take the oil".
