BREAKING: Trump Instructs Acting Secretary of State To Nullify Oaths Taken On Qurans
President Trump is taking his oath of office very seriously by ensuring that all oaths of office in America are administered legally. According to the White House Director of Information and Propaganda, Art Tubolls , says the problem is widespread:

“There are people from illegitimate religions popping up all over Congress and at the state level. They want to take their oaths on the Moon God book like Obama did in 2008. The problem is, the Constantinople Clause says that Christianity must be observed for oaths ‘lest they have no meaning.’ This isn’t about church and state. This is about assigning Christian morals and ideals where appropriate in our Christian society. If you can’t take an oath on a bible, you can’t serve this country. Period.”

The rules aren’t Trump’s. Obama broke the law in 2009 when he took the oath on a tiny brown book people assumed was a bible. As it turns out, there is no bible that size in existence. Nobody has ever made one. It is, however, the standard size for the American Muslamic version of the Koran (Q’Oaurane’). Active Secretary of State, Sandy Batt, has sent a Secretarial Order to all state secretaries to refuse certification to any elected official not willing to take an oath as described in the Bill of Rights

If they try to mess with the constitution, they’re going to learn a very hard lesson
