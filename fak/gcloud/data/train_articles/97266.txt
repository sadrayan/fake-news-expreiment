Justin Trudeau, "The Economy" on March 10th, 2015
Thomas Mulcair NDPLeader of the Opposition

Mr. Speaker, let us look, word for word, at what the Prime Minister actually told Canadians and, word for word, what this Parliament voted on.

On September 30, he stated, “It is quite precise. It is to advise and to assist. It is not to accompany.” I am quoting word for word what the Prime Minister said on September 30.

This House adopted a motion that states, word for word, “that the Government of Canada will not deploy troops in ground combat operations”.

Why is it that our soldiers are not just accompanying, but are dying in combat on the front line?
