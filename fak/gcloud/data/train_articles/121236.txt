Breitbart's Michelle Fields Files Police Report Against Trump Campaign Manager
In the newest update in the Breitbart-Trump saga, reporter Michelle Fields has filed a police reporter against Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.

IJ Review’s Benny Johnson reports that Fields filed assault charges in the Jupiter, Florida jurisdiction, the site of the late-night Trump speech Tuesday. Fields alleges, and The Washington Post‘s Ben Terris corroborates, that Lewandowski grabbed her from behind and tried to threw her to the ground while she was asking Trump a question. Lewandowski and his boss both deny the entire encounter even happened.

On Thursday, Fields posted a picture of her bruises on Twitter.

Fields’ complaint come after Breitbart editor-at-large Ben Shapiro publicly encouraged her to press charges.

Michelle should certainly file a police report. https://t.co/5JD7xGjYBO — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) March 10, 2016
