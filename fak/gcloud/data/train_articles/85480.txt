Sign in to read: CO2: Don't count on the trees
FORTY-FIVE minutes' drive from Panama City, followed by a 20-minute boat ride and a 30-minute trek into the rainforest, will bring you to some of the best-studied trees in the world. On a half-square-kilometre plot of land on Barro Colorado Island, the lives and deaths of precisely 208,387 trees have been tracked for 20 years, like patients in a clinical trial. In that time the trees have been monitored for signs of how tropical forests are responding to climate change. Now the news is in, and it isn't good.

It has long been assumed that forests will be the "get out of jail free card" we need to help soak up spiralling carbon dioxide emissions. Much of that hope has been pinned on tropical forests, the so-called "lungs of the planet", with some studies suggesting that elevated CO 2 levels are allowing rainforests to grow more quickly, locking away the extra ...
