2018 Legislator Compensation Information
Annually, NCSL collects legislative salary and per diem information from all 50 states. This information is presented in the table below.

Every other year, NCSL conducts a broader survey on legislative compensation, including information on mileage reimbursement, office supplies and benefits. In 2018, NCSL decided to wait to collect this information until the majority of states were out of session. The results of this survey will be available by the fall of 2018. For the most up to date look at the type of information available from these surveys, please see NCSL's 2016 Legislator Compensation page.
