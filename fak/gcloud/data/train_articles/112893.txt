Cosby Hollywood Walk of Fame Star Vandalized with Word ‘Rapist’
Bill Cosby’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized following the numerous allegations of sexual assault leveled against the comedian.

A photo of the vandalized star — which had the word “rapist” scrawled across it several times — surfaced via a Fox 26 viewer on Thursday.

In response to the vandalism, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce released the following statement: “The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees. When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways then to vandalize a California State landmark. The star is being cleaned up at this time.”
