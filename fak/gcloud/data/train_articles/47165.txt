Winners and Losers in the Trump Tax Plan
The tax plan the Trump administration released Wednesday consists (so far) of a single page of bullet points.

If this were a more rounded plan, we could wait for the tax wonks at various think tanks to run it through their models and tell with some precision how it would affect people at different income levels and who would benefit from different deductions.
