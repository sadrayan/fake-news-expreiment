Evening Journal, Wilmington, Del. Thursday, Nov. 9, wz Executive at Elkton's Thiokol Is One of 14 New Men on Moon Iff &ZM James Irwin during the Apollo 16 shot last year. Wilson said he had no idea why the National Aeronautics and Space Administration delayed releasing the information until now, except that "the paper is slow in government work, but usually not that slow." Those whose names were placed on the moon were a sampling honoring the more than 200,000 employes of NASA and its contractors who By MIM CROWL Newark Bureau ELKTON, Md.-When Thomas B. Wilson Jr. was notified recently that his name had been placed on the moon last July, his wife and children were more excited than he was. "I really didn't feel much 'different," he said, "but the family was impressed and excited." Wilson modestly said he told them he did no "The next thing will be the Skylab program, and then the space shuttle. Someday it would be really nice to actually go up there," Wilson said. Until then, he and his wife an two teen-age daughters will be content with the letter notifying them that his name is on : the moon, along with a color print of the name list. Someday Wilson may get ' his wish to go to the moon. Until then the family will continue living in Graylyn Crest, . north of Wilmington. have made the Apollo space program possible. Preparations to launch Apollo 17, the last in the Apol!o moon landing program, are now under way. AFTER the Apollo program is completed, Wilson said, he expects to continue managing the production of Recruit rocket motors at Thiokol, because they are used extensively in other space programs to propel scientific probes to high altitudes. thing special to be selected for the honor. Wilson, 50, is a program manager at the Elkton division of Thiokol Chemical Corp. He has worked there 13 years, coordinating the design and production of the Recruit retro rocket motors that separatte , second and third stages of the Saturn V Apollo launch vehicle. HIS name was one of 14 placed in a canister and left on the moon by Astronaut Elder Foes Challenged At Conrad Majority Supports Him 'at Meeting A resolution for Conrad School District Superintendent Leon B. Elder's reassignment was challenged by Elder supporters at last night's four-hour meeting of the Conrad Area Concerned Citizens Coun- , cil-'T Previous meetings of the council have included up to 300 . persons expressing dissatis-faction with the superintendent, but a majority of about 40 persons, including six school board members, supported Eider at last night's meeting. The pro-Elder group challenged the council on its resolution at Jant month's meeting, which called for Elder's transfer. The challenge was recorded although Ronald Eck, council president, reject-e d a proposed resolution supporting the superintendent Data Center Except in Legislature Computer Poppiti 's 'Magic Worked l ens All Staff Photo by Jodl Cobb Peace Pilgrim 1,500 miles per pair of shoes this year's victory has given the party. POPPITI was lured back into active politics and the state chairmanship by the challenge of building a political party on the shambles of the state Democratic organization. He had left active politics in the mid '60s when he quit as city Democratic chairman to , build a successful law prac-. tice. He recalled that in 1948 it. was a successful state party built from scratch in time for - that election. Now, he had overseen the start of another rebuilding. And while all the shouting and celebration was still going on at the hotel, Mike Poppiti went home to bed. the election's result would have been impossible without them. And there is a tendency to believe him. After the polls closed and the wait for the first returns began, Poppiti described a pool of more than 1,000 campaign workers by all the state's Democratic candidates to man a coordinated effort to get out Democratic votes. Since taking over the party's helm, Poppiti said, his job has been patching together the various segments into an organization that could work together. It apparently did work. POPPITI held no realistic hope that McGovern could beat Nixon in Delaware, but he was counting on a "penance vote" with many voters who felt they couldn't vote for McGovern voting straight Democrat for the rest of the ticket. He was also counting on an anti-Peterson vote among disaffected Republicans and declines to turn the tide for Tribbitt. He said David P. Buckson, Gov. Russell W. Peterson's opponent in the Republican primary, turned out to be one of the Demo-' crats' best candidates because Peterson was forced to spend a great deal of time mending fences within his own party. And as he stood in the back of the room as well-wishers and newsmen swarmed around Tribbitt, he was already talking about finding candidates for the 1974 elections and solidifying the base Peace Pilgrim Treks Message Through Delaware Election Results Sped to Media From the Dover Bureau DOVER - The IBM computer at the central data center in the Highway Admin-i s t r a t i o n Building here reported winners in the eight top election races in a test run last Friday. And it followed through on Tuesday. Burton D. Willis, election commissioner; and Horace E. Bunting, computer operations manager, worked out a system that provided the news media with revised totals in all 106 contests every 20 minutes on election day. ' Votes were completely tallied for Delaware at 12:25 a.m., just 15 minutes after the last election district reported. It was the first time the state Division of Central Data Processing provided election results. ; Figures reached Dover by phone and by courier, after auditing from each of the 321 election districts, and were double-checked and punched on cards fed to the computer. The operation - required about 450 persons, indiuding runners in the 321 -districts, area captains', telephone and By BILL HAYDEN Mike Poppiti stood like a conquering hero early yesterday morning at the head of the sweeping stairway leading up to the Hotel du Pont's Du Barry Room. Outside the locked doors leading to the 'Du Barry and Gold Ballroom, a crowd of well wishers and bandwagon climbers on pounded to get inside to parties for Sherman W. Tribbitt and Joseph R. Biden Jr. INSIDE, the rooms were filled with capacity crowds of partiers and politicans. And Michael A. Poppiti, the man who had taken over a disorganized Democratic Party in February as state chairman, ruled as cock of the walk. The election returns were pretty much the way Poppiti a week before said they would have to go for him to be satisfied. A Democrat was elected governor. A Democrat U.S. senator. A Democrat New Castle County executive. A Democrat mayor of Wilmington. A Democratic Wilmington city council. The only hope that didn't come to pass was Democratic control of a house of the General Assembly. And that was a narrow miss. POPPITI had been prag-m a t i c in his predictions. Yesterday, he was jubilant, accepting with a broad smile congratulations from passing party workers. He assured each one that for 'his excellent record." Eck said the Elder supporters were not members of the council. THE council, organized dur-i n g recent negotiations between the school board and the Conrad Area Federation of Teachers, has tried to get Elder reassigned to non-personnel work. Eck said last night that the council was not formed primarily to dump Elder but to obtain answers and open communication between the community, and school. "We want to know why the teachers' morale is so low that they went on strike," Dick said. MRS. Kenneth H. Meidling wife of a board member, scored condemnation "without the facts . . ." and said the News-Journal papers helped polarize the community by presenting views favoring the teachers. A retired teacher cited El-! der as a capable superintendent. "Teachers who have been fired or- left . . . just weren't gocd teachers," she said. "All Mr. Elder asked for was a day's work for a day's pay.".

She's been doing it since 1953 and her routes carry her through Wilmington every two or three years. "I'M a penniless pilgrim," she says, "and I walk until I find shelter and fast until I'm offered food. I never ask for anything." Peace Pilgrim stopped counting her mileage back in 1964 when her accumulated walks amounted to more than 25,000 miles. A.M. EST Nov. 9 I Data From NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE.

Woman Shot Accidentally A woman was wounded last night when a tenant above her accidentally discharged a rifle and the bullet went through the floor. Viola Washington, 30, of 501 E. 8th St., was released after treatment at Delaware Division for nose and chest wounds. Wilmington police said Irvin t SNash, 59, discharged a .22- ' caliber rifle about 9 last night. Peace Pilgrim estimates her mileage by the wear on her navy - canvas, rubber-soled shoes. "These shoes last me 1,500 miles," she said, pointing to a new pair, "and I use a couple of pairs a year." Interviewed at the Brandy-wine Hundred home where she was staying, Peace Pilgrim said people today don't understand the purposes of pilgrims. .

Robert A. Coleman, director of administrative services, said information may be submitted to the state police or the school district office and wOl be treated confidentially. There have been three or more bomb threats each day at the high school for the last three school days, Coleman said. Each call resulted in an evacuation of the school's 1,-600 students. ...
