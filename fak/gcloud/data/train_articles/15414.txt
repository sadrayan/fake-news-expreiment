Subject: Texas reporter, inquiry for a PolitiFact Texas fact-check about Vince Foster's death

Dr. Berman:

I write seeking your on-the-record comments for our fact-check of US Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, who recently said in a radio interview that former President Clinton told then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch last year: “We’ve killed people. We killed Vince Foster. We destroyed Webb Hubbell. We will destroy you,” in advance of Hillary Clinton not getting indicted for her handling of email.

I am aware of your expertise and role in the Foster investigation overseen by Kenneth W. Starr and am writing to ask if there was any indication in your review at that time (or later) that actions by President Clinton and/or Hillary Clinton contributed to, or caused, Foster to commit suicide.

Anything else you recommend we consider?

If you’d prefer, I’d be happy to talk about this for our story by phone. I am at the phone number below now.

Thank you for taking this time.

There is not a scintilla of fact in this statement –it is a blatant falsehood, unsupported and unsupportable. There were four investigations into Foster’s death, all arriving at the same conclusion.
