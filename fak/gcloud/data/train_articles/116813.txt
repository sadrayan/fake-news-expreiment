John Michael Montgomery
The Little Girl lyrics - John Michael Montgomery



Her parents never took the young girl to church

Never spoke of His name

Never read her His word

Two non-believers walking lost in this world

Took their baby with them

What a sad little girl



Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs

Never wanted to play

Or give kisses and hugs

She'd watch the TV and sit there on the couch

While her mom fell asleep

And her daddy went out



And the drinking and the fighting

just got worse every night

Behind their couch she'd be hiding

Oh what a sad little life

And like it always does, the bad just got worse

With every slap and every curse

Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night

Used a gun on her mom and then took his life



And some people from the city took the girl far away

To a new mom and a new dad

kisses and hugs everyday

Her first day of Sunday school the teacher walked in

And a small little girl

Stared at a picture of Him



She said I know that man up there on that cross

I don't know His name

But I know He got off

Cause He was there in my old house

and held me close to His side

As I hid there behind our couch

The night that my parents died
