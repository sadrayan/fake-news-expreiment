Mahlon Mitchell – In the Arena

The Wisconsin Assembly has passed a Republican bill that would strip most state workers of the bulk of their collective-bargaining rights. Among other things, the measure would require workers - with the exception of police and firefighters - to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions. Collective bargaining would be limited to wages, though any pay increases beyond the inflation rate would be subject to voter approval.

The fight over the Wisconsin bill appears far from over. It still must clear the Wisconsin Senate, a step that is likely to prove far more contentious. Since the beginning firefighters have been showing their support of other state workers.

Are the state workers and Governor Scott Walker–along with Republican state lawmakers–any closer to resolving the situation?

Currently, no. Right now, Governor Walker is being somewhat unreasonable—we haven’t been able to sit down with the governor and come to a conclusion. We’d like to do that. I mean, the labor leaders have reached out to the governor’s office to reach a compromsie—with no avail. We haven’t had any luck with that.

Fourteen Democratic state senators fled to neighboring Illinois to prevent a quorum from voting on the issue. Do you have any idea how long they will stay away?

I think they will stay until the job is done and the people’s voices are heard. FULL POST
