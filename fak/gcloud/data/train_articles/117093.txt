Attendee FAQ
• Simulated or costume weapons are allowed as a part of your costume, subject to prior approval by security, the local police and if in compliance with the following. Please note that police have final say on all cosplay weapons.

• All costume weapons must be inspected by uniformed police at the Costume Weapons Check Desk in the main lobby.

• All costume weapons must conform to all state and federal laws.

• Projectile costume weapons must be rendered inoperable.

• Costume swords must be tied to your costume in such a way that they can’t be drawn and must also pass police approval.



After each person’s costume weapon has been checked, it will be tagged by security, and you will be given a wristband to wear to designate that your weapons have been checked. Security will escort you to the security station for inspection if your costume weapon is not tagged. Please do not bring your costume weapons, if you are unwilling to comply with these policies. Event organizers and the Police department reserve all rights to change or modify any costume weapons policy or rule at any time and without notice to best safely serve event attendees. Your understanding and cooperation is appreciated.
