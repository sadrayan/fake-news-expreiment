T1International launched our Insulin & Diabetes Supply Survey in March 2016 to look at prices people pay out-of-pocket for their diabetes costs. We asked respondents to let us know

the type of insulin they take

how they take their insulin

the out-of-pocket cost for their insulin

what type of test strips they use

the out-of-pocket cost of their test strips

their out-of-pocket costs for other diabetes management (appointments, syringes, etc.)

We compared monthly out-of-pocket costs for diabetes with average monthly wages in each country and explored whether people use ketone strips and the glucagon injection, which are life-saving when blood sugars are too high or too low.

Hundreds of people completed the survey from more than 40 countries. The information gives us a wider picture of the global situation for people with diabetes, even if it is just a snapshot. It confirmed what we already know â€“ that living with diabetes is a struggle for many and an exorbitant financial burden for others.
