Dear Mr. Selby,

My claim that Jan Schakowsky was an active member of the Democratic Socialists of America is based on the research behind my book "Radical-in-Chief."

If you get the book, or look it up on Google Books, go to page 167. There I describe evidence drawn from 1983 and 1986 newsletters of Chicago's chapter of the DSA that Jan Schakowsky was an active member of this group.

Footnotes to the newsletters in question are found on page 424 of my book. The original material is available at the archives of the Democratic Socialists of America housed in the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University (see p. 393 of my book for a list of the library archives I consulted).

I do not know how long Jan Schakowsky remained a member of the DSA. I simply note in the book clear evidence that she was an active member of the Chicago Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America in the mid-1980s.

Subject: Texas reporter inquiring about Rep. Schakowsky

Good afternoon.

I write in connection with a PolitiFact Texas fact check of a Texan’s claim that Rep. Jan Schakowsky is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

You wrote in an NRO blog post in 2010 that you came across evidence Schakowsky was a member in the past, if I read correctly.

Can you elaborate?

Do you have information that would apply to this claim about her current standing?

I’d be happy to visit further by email or phone. I’m trying to complete this look today.

Thanks.

g.
