What this US Embassy is Doing on July 4th "Out of Respect for Islam" is INSANE
A U.S. embassy is an extension of U.S. soil, no? Whatever country has one of our official government consulates within their own, they should be respectful of our customs.

Likewise, our own embassy should be respectful of our customs and traditions. That should be a no-brainer.

Apparently the U.S. embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia has decided to kowtow to Islam and say goodbye to one of the most cherished days on the calendar.

Instead of celebrating America’s independence (July 4) on July 4th, all delegates celebrated on June 4th in order to not interfere with Ramadan.

Get right the heck out of here!

From Federalist Papers via American Thinker:

In a mind-boggling gesture of official US Government dhimmitude, the US Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia celebrated our sacred Independence Day holiday on June 4, so as to avoid any conflict with the month-long Ramadan celebration. If you think any Islamic countries – there are 57 of them (not counting ISIS) that count themselves officially Islamic – will move their DC embassy’s celebration of Ramadan to accommodate our Independence holiday, I have some bridges to sell you. … Officially, embassies are the national territory of the country being represented, not of the host country. So there is no need to accommodate local sensibilities in celebrating our most sacred national holiday. … This is a moment of national dhimmitude and deep shame.

Doesn’t this make you feel embarrassed?
