Tax policies

The Australian Labor Party has an ambitious tax and superannuation reform agenda which it has published in stages over recent years.

ALP modelling suggests that most of the revenue raising measures impacting individuals will affect mainly high income earners, a claim which the Coalition contests in policy areas such as negative gearing and franking credit refunds.

Business tax reforms are largely designed to increase tax transparency and reduce gearing deductions claimed by multinationals against the Australian tax base. Labor's proposed Australian Investment Guarantee has been well-received by the business community because it caters for large capex outlays (as distinct from the current $20,000 threshold for the instant asset write-off for businesses turnover less than $10 million).
