Via The Nation:

In a comment posted in response, the Clinton campaign’s Internet Director Peter Daou, posted a statement from the campaign confirming that the email had indeed been forwarded by a “volunteer county coordinator,” but said it was “wholly unauthorized” and that the campaign was “unaware of it.”

“We are asking this volunteer county coordinator to step down,” the statement continued “and are making it clear to every person involved in our campaign that this will not be tolerated.”
