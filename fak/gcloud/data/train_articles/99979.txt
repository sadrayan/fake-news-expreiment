Hindu guru Sai Baba buried in India

Updated

Hundreds of thousands of devotees have gathered for the funeral of Sathya Sai Baba, one of India's most influential spiritual leaders who enjoyed a global following.

While cremation is the most common practice at Hindu funerals, Sai Baba was buried in the custom accorded to Hindu holy men.

The charismatic guru, who died of multiple organ failure on Sunday aged 85, was interred under the podium where he gave many teachings in the main hall of his ashram in the southern town of Puttaparthi.

The spiritual leader, credited with supernatural powers by his millions of followers in India and abroad, used donations to build an empire of free hospitals, schools, clinics, prayer centres and other properties and assets.

Instantly recognisable by his wild curly hair, he had ashrams in 126 countries and his trust, which has often been criticised for a lack of transparency, is estimated to be worth up to $9 billion.

Television screens erected around the town showed live footage of the event for the vast crowds of followers who had converged on Puttaparthi in recent days.

Since his death, Sai Baba's body was inside a transparent casket on view to grieving devotees including poor villagers, foreign pilgrims and cricket stars such as Sachin Tendulkar.

On Tuesday, prime minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, leader of the ruling congress party, visited the ashram to pay their respects.

The Federal Government had warned Australian travellers in India to avoid the funeral.

The Department of Foreign Affairs says says Indian police have deployed significant security forces in the area and Australians should avoid large crowds.

The overall advice for India is that a high degree of caution is required.
