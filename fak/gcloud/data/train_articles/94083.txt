How Strong Are Your City's Finances? 116 US Cities Ranked
To compile this Fiscal Health Index, we looked at 116 U.S. cities with populations greater than 200,000, using data from 2015 financial reports issued by the cities themselves. Our scoring system is described in a new working paper. It uses five factors:

1. the ratio of a cityâ€™s general fund balance to its expenditures (40 percent weighting)

2. the ratio of its long term obligations (including OPEB but excluding pensions) to total government-wide revenues (30 percent weighting)

3. the ratio of actuarially determined pension contributions to total government-wide revenues (10 percent weighting)

4. change in local unemployment rate (10 percent weighting)

5. change in property values (10 percent weighting).
