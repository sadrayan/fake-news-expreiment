McCain Watch: Out of Touch While Americans Are Out of Work
Seven Months of Job Losses for Americans, Seven Houses for McCain WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The following was released by the Democratic National Committee: (Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20080519/DNCLOGO ) As John McCain continues his "Job-Killing John" tour in Pennsylvania today, it's clearer than ever how out of touch he is with working Americans. McCain is insulated from the economic struggles of most Americans. As Americans face the consequences of seven months of job losses and spiraling energy costs, John McCain, who owns seven houses, has said that there has "been great progress economically." Perhaps it's not surprising then that John McCain is so out of touch with the struggles facing Americans today that he actually has said that the nation's economic problems are merely "psychological" and he is calling for more of the same failed Bush policies and politics that have already cost thousands of Americans their jobs. Bush-McCain economic policies have already put almost 70,000 Pennsylvanians out of work, while trade deals Bush and McCain support have cost Pennsylvania more than 44,000 jobs. Under Bush, median income in Pennsylvania has been nearly stagnant. Meanwhile, 1.2 million Pennsylvanians are without health insurance -- that's 10 percent of the state -- including more than 200,000 children. In the first quarter of 2008 alone in Pennsylvania, almost 6,000 homes received a foreclosure filing. While Americans are facing the effects of failed Bush-McCain economic policies, McCain puts corporate profits before American jobs, from his support for failed Bush's economic policies to unfair trade agreements to business deals that hurt working Americans -- like his support of European-owned EADS over American company Boeing and entanglement with German company DHL in Ohio, which may cost Ohioans 8,000 jobs. BUSH-MCCAIN ECONOMY A DISASTER FOR PENNSYLVANIA NAFTA Net Displacement Was One Million Workers and a Net Job Loss of Over 44,100 in Pennsylvania. A 2006 Economic Policy Institute study found that NAFTA had displaced just over 1 million jobs in this country, and net job loss of 44,173 in Pennsylvania. [Scott, Salas & Campbell, Revisiting NAFTA, 9/28/2006; http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp173] Income Stagnant. Median household income in Pennsylvania has only increased from $47,524 in 2000 to $48,148 in 2006, a 1.3% increase.

The number of unemployed workers in Pennsylvania has increased by 26% under President Bush.

The unemployment rate has similarly increased from 4.3% to 5.2%. [Local Area Unemployed Statistics, (Seasonally Adjusted), Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed 7/25/08, data.bls.gov] Pennsylvania Has Over 1.2 Million People Uninsured. 1,216,260 people have no health insurance. That's 10 percent of Pennsylvanians living without any insurance.

[statehealthfacts.org, accessed 7/20/08, available here: http://www.statehealthfacts.org/profileind.jsp?ind=127&cat;=3&rgn;=40] In the First Quarter of 2008, Over 5,900 Homes in Pennsylvania Received a Foreclosure Filing. 5,901 homes received a foreclosure filing in the first quarter. [Realty Trac Press Release, 4/29/08] BUSH ECONOMY AND TRADE POLICIES COST AMERICAN JOBS Seven Straight Months of Job Losses in 2008. As reported by the New York Times, "The unemployment rate spiked again in July, to 5.7 percent, its highest level in more than four years and a strong signal that come Election Day millions of Americans will still be hunting for work...The nation's employers cut their payrolls for the seventh consecutive month, this time by 51,000 jobs, the government reported Friday. For millions still at work, hours were reduced, a hidden form of unemployment, and the average raise was less than enough to keep up with inflation." [New York Times, 8/2/08] Manufacturing Jobs Have Decreased by Nearly a Quarter Under Bush. As reported by the New York Times, "When President Bush took office, nearly 13 percent of American jobs were in manufacturing. In November, that figure fell below 10 percent for the first time ever, and at last measure was 9.95 percent." [New York Times, 2/9/08] MCCAIN IS OUT OF TOUCH ON THE ECONOMY, SUPPORTS BUSH POLICIES McCain's "Economic Plans Really Are An Extension of the Bush Administration Policies." "McCain doesn't like to hear it, but his economic plans really are an extension of Bush administration policies...When all the economic mumbo-jumbo is removed, that fact remains." [Boston Globe, Editorial, 7/9/08, boston.com ] McCain Says Economy Has Improved. During an interview in April, McCain declared that, "you could make an argument that there's been great progress economically." [Bloomberg Money & Politics, 4/17/08] McCain has voted with President Bush 95 percent of the time in 2007. According to Congressional Quarterly, he also has a record of heartily supporting Bush on some of his most controversial priorities, including the Iraq war and comprehensive immigration reform. In 2007, as he ramped up for his second White House run, McCain voted with Bush 95 percent of the time, according to Congressional Quarterly, which tallied votes McCain was present for on issues in which the administration took a position. [Arizona Republic, 4/6/08] MCCAIN PUTS LOBBYISTS BEFORE AMERICAN JOBS, SUPPORTS DEALS THAT HURT WORKING AMERICANS McCain Had Role in DHL Deal That May Cost 8,000 Jobs in Ohio. "John McCain (http://search.politico.com/results.cfm?subject=John+McCain ) went on the offensive Thursday in a key battleground state, hoping to blunt criticism that he was indirectly responsible for the possible loss of more than 8,000 jobs in Wilmington, Ohio ( http://search.politico.com/results.cfm?subject=Ohio )." [Politico, 8/7/08] McCain Objected to Efforts in the Senate to Hold Up DHL Deal. "McCain, of Arizona, and fellow Republican Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi objected, saying it would be unfair to keep the Pentagon from using an air carrier it might someday need. McCain, then the chairman of the Commerce Committee, also objected to using a spending bill to set military policy." [Cleveland Plain Dealer, 8/6/08] Campaign Manager Rick Davis Lobbied for DHL Deal. "In 2003, Davis lobbied the Senate to accept the proposal by DHL to buy Airborne Express for $1.05 billion. Airborne Express at the time ran the airport and package-sorting facility in Wilmington. Filings in the Senate show Davis' lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, was hired to help both companies deal with Congress, where objections over DHL's foreign ownership arose. Davis and a partner earned their firm $185,000 for the DHL-Airborne Express work that year, records show. They earned $405,000 more from Deutsche Post for work on other issues in 2004 and 2005, Senate records show." [Cleveland Plain Dealer, 8/6/08] 4,000 American Jobs Are At Stake Because of John McCain and His Lobbyist Advisors. According to a June report by the Economic Policy Institute, awarding European-based EADS the $35 billion aerial refueling tanker contract will cost at least 14,000 jobs. "At least 14,000 jobs that could have been generated in the United States if the contract had gone to Boeing," found the EPI, "will not be created" if EADS receives the contract. [Economic Policy Institute, "Bailing out on America: Air Force Tanker Decision Will Ground at Least 14,000 U.S. Jobs," [EPI Briefing Paper #218, 6/5/08 (http://www.epi.org/briefingpapers/218/bp218.pdf)] Current McCain Advisors Lobbied for EADS to Get $35 Billion Tanker Contract Over Boeing. "Top current advisers to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign last year lobbied for a European plane maker that beat Boeing to a $35 billion Air Force tanker contract, taking sides in a bidding fight that McCain has tried to referee for more than five years." [Associated Press, 3/11/08] EADS Lobbying Involves at Least 4 High-Level McCain Advisors. "A $35 billion contract has been awarded to Europe's Airbus consortium to build the latest generation of tanker planes. The decision has sparked anger from Boeing's congressional supporters and critics of outsourcing. It has also focused attention on McCain's reliance on lobbyists in his campaign for president because his finance chairman and several other top advisers lobbied for Airbus last year when it was in fierce competition with Boeing for the Air Force contract...McCain finance chairman Thomas G. Loeffler and Susan E. Nelson, who left Loeffler's lobbying firm to be McCain's finance director, both began lobbying for Airbus's parent company in 2007, Senate records show. William L. Ball III, a former secretary of the Navy and frequent McCain surrogate on the trail, also lobbied for Airbus, as did John Green, who recently took a leave from Ogilvy Public Relations to serve as McCain's legislative liaison."
