Mike Toomey Resigns as Chief of Staff

AUSTIN – Mike Toomey, chief of staff to Gov. Rick Perry, today announced that he is stepping down from his position effective Monday.

Toomey, a former three-term state representative from Houston and former chief of staff for Gov. Bill Clements, has served as Perry’s top aide since November 2002.

“Mike Toomey brought incredible talent, expertise and focus to my staff and was a major factor in the successes of the 2003 legislative session,” Perry said. “When I asked Mike to leave the private sector to come back to work for the state, I knew we would need an individual who could help guide major legislation through the process at the same time we wrestled with a $10 billion shortfall. He has once again served the state tirelessly, and I am grateful for his dedication to serving the people of Texas.”

Toomey’s replacement has not been named.

“It has been my honor to serve as Chief of Staff for Governor Rick Perry,” Toomey said. “Governor Rick Perry is a remarkable man, and to serve under his leadership has been the high point of my career.”
