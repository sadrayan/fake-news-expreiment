4. What is a base period? Alternate base period?

The base period is the period of time used to determine if you have sufficient wages to be eligible. The base period is the first 4 of the last 5 completed calendar quarters before the starting date of your new claim. The calendar quarters are: Jan 1-March 31; April 1-June 30; July 1-Sept 30; and Oct 1-Dec 31. Once a quarter's wages are used to establish a claim, they cannot be used again on a later claim.



If you are not eligible using your base period earnings, we will recompute your claim using an alternate base period. The alternate base period is the last four completed calendar quarters before the starting date of your claim. While you must still meet the same earnings requirements, this allows some of your more recent wages to be used.
