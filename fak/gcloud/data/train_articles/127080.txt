Suisham made good from 23 and 36 yards out and was 1-for-1 on extra points for a total of seven points on the game.

(Updated 12/14/2008). Injury Report No information available at this time (Updated 12/17/08). Fantasy Analysis Suisham has just six field goals over his last four weeks for the Redskins with four missed attempts. He hasn't scored in double figures in five straight and that should likely continue in Week 16 against Philadelphia, though he did score 11 points against them in Week 5. That was a different Washington team, however, and Suisham is not a recommended Fantasy option.
