BREAKING: Federal Government Cancels $80 Million Nike Contract
The Trump administration has quietly dealt a blow to Nike that has sent the company stocks tumbling. According to Housing, Clothing, and Utility Bill Director, Art Tubolls:

“HCUB has canceled it’s contract with Nike to provide footwear, outerwear and other sports apparel to any US athlete. Whether they compete at the Junior Olympic, National Championship, Olympic, or Special Olympic event, athletes wearing the American Flag are no longer to be associated with this hateful company.”

If you haven’t been watching, Nike has decided it hates America by backing the people who feel it necessary to disrespect dead veterans. They gave Colin Kaepernick a contract and he doesn’t even play football. That right there should be illegal. When the middle class of this country decides a person isn’t good enough, that’s final.

The US Olympic team, as well as all the others, will switch to Adidas, which is a brand well-known to love America. In the end, Nike was a good brand for those people, but not really for us anyway. By “those people,” of course, we’re referring to unpatriotic people who kneel and may have other characteristics in common that definitely don’t come into play because then we’d all be horrible racists.

President Trump has yet to tweet on the matter. We’ll keep you update just as soon as we come up with one.
