Ensuring your programs and physical spaces are accessible and welcoming to people with ID:



 Incorporate disability etiquette, including for intellectual disability, into internal staff training.

 Speak directly to the individual, not his or her companion, and let the person finish before responding.

 If you offer assistance, wait for the offer to be accepted and for specific instructions. If you aren’t sure what to do, ask.

 If you are having difficulty understanding a person, it is ok to ask them to repeat themselves.

 Operate under the assumption that people with ID are capable of making their own decisions.

 Explore how using Universal Design may be applied to your services or organization.

 Ensure your space or programs are in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
