Presidents of Belarus and India plant blue spruce at Alley of Honored Guests

After the official part of the meeting Presidents of Belarus and India went to the Alley of Honorary Guests. By tradition, the heads of state planted a blue spruce here. This evergreen tree will be a symbol of longevity and loyalty to the Belarusian-Indian friendship.

The Avenue of the guests of honor was founded at the Palace of Independence in October 2013. Today one can find here trees planted by presidents of Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Ecuador.
