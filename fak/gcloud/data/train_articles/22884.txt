Congressman Taylor Supports Health Insurance Reforms
WASHINGTON D.C. — March 22, 2017— Congressman Scott Taylor voted in support of two bills that pave the way for health insurance reform. H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Paul Gosar (AZ-04), amends the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 to restore the application of federal anti-trust laws to the business of health insurance. The second bill, H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017, which was introduced by Representative Sam Johnson (TX-03), amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to allow small businesses to join together in Association Health Plans (AHP) across state lines through trade associations to become larger purchasers of health insurance.

Congressman Taylor had this to say about the reforms: “I have and will continue to work to lower the cost of healthcare and to offer more access to the care people need. These two pieces of legislation do exactly that. I am proud to support these bills.”
