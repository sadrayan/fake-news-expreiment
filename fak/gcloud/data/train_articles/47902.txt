Could this California State Assembly Bill BAN the Bible?
8 SHARES Tweet

It’s hard to imagine what the Control Freaks in the California Assembly actually want to do. Is this a move to Ban the Bible? Whatever happened to Free Speech and Religious Freedom? Of course, this is the People’s Republic of California, so such things are to be expected. They are so far down the totalitarian, Globalist path that they are oblivious to any sane, sensible ideas. God Help the people of California. Then again, they insist on voting these nut cases into office.
