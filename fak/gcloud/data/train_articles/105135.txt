Seattle Police Begin Gun Confiscations: No Laws Broken, No Warrant, No Charges
Here comes a downvote Shoah:

While I'm a very pro-gun person, I absolutely hate the fact that some gunowners interpret their 2A Rights as an open license to act like assholes.

Case in point:

I was out at a bar with some friends one night (guy's night out), and 1 of the guys I was with started a fight with another group. When he got called-out by the other group, he said "You really want to do it, we can, but I got an M-16 in the trunk of my car out there". (He in fact, did have a full-auto M-16 in the car, but without the gun, he wouldn't have had any balls at all).

I calmed the situation down, a la "Sorry about my friend, he's had a lot to drink", and was cool with the other group...and then tore this idiot I was with a new asshole for starting a fight in the first place, again, ONLY because he outmatched the other group.

The problem is, every time gun owners act like dipshits, it just adds supportive evidence to the cause of the Antigun Commie Libtard Cocksuckers who don't know a damn thing about guns, but think nobody except "The Benevolent Government" should have them, because their only sources of information are leftist propaganda, and other forms of brainwashing...made-for-TV "evil domestic-abuser man" movies, Oprah, The View, etc.

In the case of this creep in Seattle, the guy has a gun on display, and is out in public acting strangely.

What are the cops supposed to do?

Take a chance that maybe the guy's okay, and there's an innocent reason for how he's acting? What if they're wrong? (They'd be publicly crucified, if the guy turns out to be a nutter, and they failed to prevent a needless shooting, when they had a chance to, especially in a place like Seattle).

I'm on the side of the cops with this one. They made a judgment call based on the circumstances and available information, with the intention of protecting the public.

Not everything is a grand conspiracy.
