Did A Fiat Crash Into A Painted On Tunnel A La Wile E Coyote?
The pictures seemed to good to be true. It looks like a Fiat plowed into a tunnel painted onto a flat brick wall just like Wil E. Coyote would’ve done to the Road Runner, but did it really happen?

In an ode to a favorite cartoon of childhood lore it looks like a couple of Brazlian street artists took their artistic skills to work and painted a classic scene from Looney Tunes, a painted on tunnel from that familiar duo, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Earlier Wednesday a photo gallery popped up on Reddit simply entitled, “This just happened” which showcased a series of three photos with what looks like an accident caused by these graffiti artists and their painted on tunnel. Check out the photo gallery below and decide for yourself if the Fiat that got hit really did smash into a painted on tunnel a la Looney Tunes style.

The first picture shows a red Fiat parked next to the offending painted on tunnel with a Road Runner off to the side. The next picture shows what looks like that same Fiat having suffered a bit of front end damage from what at first like a collision from stuffing his front end into the wall. The final image shows that lovely bit of mural being painted over in what we think is a bid to prevent accidents from not happening in the future.

In the thread where this photo gallery was first posted, it looks like an accident stemming from the mural didn’t happen at all. Keen eyed viewers will notice that the first picture shows a Fiat Uno and the Second a Fiat Strada, two totally different vehicles. In addition, an accident resulting from this mural would’ve had damage across the whole bumper and not just to the side.

So unfortunately while it would’ve been a juicy story, it looks like no one was harmed in the making and display of this Wile E. Coyote style mural.
