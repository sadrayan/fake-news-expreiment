Pelosi Names Drew Hammill Deputy Chief of Staff

Washington, D.C. – Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced today that she has named her longtime spokesman and senior advisor, Drew Hammill, as Deputy Chief of Staff with a portfolio focused on communications and messaging strategy. Hammill will continue to lead Pelosi’s communications and messaging operations on a daily basis, retaining the duties of Communications Director and chief spokesman.

“Drew Hammill has played an integral role in honing and executing House Democrats’ message for nearly a decade,” said Leader Pelosi. “Drew’s judgement, insight and commitment to disciplined and effective messaging have been a great asset in advancing the priorities of hard-working Americans in Congress. In his new position as Deputy Chief of Staff, Drew will continue to play a leading role in our Caucus’s communications and message strategy as we go forward.”

Hammill began working for Pelosi in 2006 and served as Press Secretary during her historic Speakership. He previously served as spokesman for Congressman Kendrick B. Meek (D-Miami), and got his start on Capitol Hill in the press office of Congressman Rahm Emanuel (D-Chicago).

Hammill is an alumnus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and completed his graduate work at the London School of Economics. He and his husband, Jason Mida, reside on Capitol Hill.
