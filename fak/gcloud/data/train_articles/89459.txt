Virtually every scientific study has found cannabis (or marijuana, or pot) to be far less harmful than alcohol or tobacco. There is an obvious inconsistency in punishing adults who choose to use cannabis instead of these more dangerous substances.

Polls show that the public now favors the idea of allowing adults to use cannabis, and four states have approved ballot measures to treat cannabis like alcohol. We are moving away from an absolute ban on cannabis use and toward a tightly regulated system that lets adults purchase small amounts of cannabis from licensed businesses.

The Rhode Island General Assembly is currently studying a proposal called the Marijuana Regulation, Control and Taxation Act, which would do just that. As a physician, I believe it is in our best interest to end the policy of cannabis prohibition because regulating cannabis would probably improve public health in three important ways.

First, in the illegal cannabis market, consumers have no idea what they are buying. There are no labels with information about potency or purity. There are no regulatory oversights that ensure the product is free of toxic chemicals and not laced with hard drugs.

During alcohol prohibition, bootleggers produced moonshine that caused blindness and paralysis. Cannabis prohibition has created a similar illegal industry, and there are reports of consumers buying illicit cannabis laced with PCP, cocaine and even embalming fluid.

By bringing cannabis producers and distributors under the control of regulators, we can ensure that cannabis is manufactured under sanitary and safe conditions.

A second public health advantage of regulating cannabis is that it will allow for more accurate and nuanced discussion about cannabis use. At the federal level, cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD, a category more restrictive than that for cocaine. This classification has been a significant impediment to scientific research on cannabis. Regulating cannabis would let universities and other research organizations more easily study cannabis, and as a result, produce more accurate health information about it.

Moreover, prohibition has been an obstacle to thoughtful discussion about the difference between responsible and irresponsible cannabis use. In Colorado, where adults are now allowed to purchase small amounts of cannabis from licensed businesses, public health campaigns advise consumers to lock up their cannabis to keep it away from minors and to not drive under the influence of cannabis.

Finally, under prohibition, cannabis is the most commonly sold drug in schools, and more than 80 percent of 12{+t}{+h} graders say that cannabis is �fairly easy� or �very easy� to find. Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol.

By letting an illicit market thrive, cannabis prohibition has introduced many teens to a violent underground culture of progressively more dangerous substances.

Establishing a system to tightly regulate cannabis for adult consumption also lets the state impose age restrictions and require businesses to check IDs. In Colorado, things seem to be going well. A recent undercover sting operation by police in Denver and Pueblo found that 100 percent of retail cannabis businesses were turning away minors under the age of 21.

Rhode Island�s current policy of cannabis prohibition has not been a success from a public health perspective. Regulation would probably be a far better policy. While cannabis prohibition lets growers and dealers operate outside the law with no oversight, regulation would greatly increase accountability. Regulation would allow the state to have more control over where, how and to whom cannabis is sold.

The Rhode Island General Assembly now has a bill before it that would regulate rather than prohibit cannabis. By enacting the Marijuana Regulation, Control and Taxation Act, Rhode Island could take a more sensible public health approach than prohibition by regulating cannabis.
