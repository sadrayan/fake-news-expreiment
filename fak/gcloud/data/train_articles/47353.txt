New Country Rankings Aim to Help Travelers Choose Safe Destinations
Planning to travel abroad this year?

The State Department has new advisories at Travel.state.gov that rank every country on a scale of one to four to help travelers make informed decisions about their personal safety. The agency introduced the rankings this month to replace its longstanding system of warnings and alerts, which many travelers found difficult to grasp.

“Frankly, I personally was tired of explaining the difference between a travel warning and a travel alert even to some of my colleagues,” Michelle Bernier-Toth, the Bureau of Consular Affairs acting deputy assistant secretary for overseas citizens services, said during a conference call about the rankings.

Many people weren’t sure what di fferentiated travel warnings from alerts, and what they were supposed to do when either was issued. Under the new ranking system, the lower the number, the lower the risk, with Level 1 being “exercise normal precautions,” Level 2 being “exercise increased caution,” Level 3 being “ reconsider travel” because of serious risks to safety and security, and Level 4 being “do not travel” because of the greater likelihood of life-threatening risks and the United States government’s limited ability to provide help.

Upon first blush, the rankings may seem like laws. For instance, if you search for a country and it’s a Level 4, as Afghanistan is, it has a bright red heading and the words “Do not travel.” But the State Department does not bar private citizens from traveling to a particular country — even one that it advises they not visit. (In the case of North Korea, however, there is a general travel restriction on the use of a United States passport.) The rankings, even those that are Level 4, are recommendations, not rules.
