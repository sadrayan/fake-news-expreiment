Rosie O'Donnell and Donald Trump's Fight Gets Personal
Gothamist was hoping we could end the week without another peep out of Donald Trump, but Rosie O'Donnell just ruined it for us! Yesterday, she slammed him over the Miss USA Tara Conner scandal (Gawker has a clip), and then he fired (heh?) back hard. From The Insider:

"(He) left the first wife -- had an affair, left the second wife, had an affair, but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America," she said from her perch on "The View." She added that personally she has "never enjoyed" watching The Donald and in a final challenge, said to the cameras, "Donald, sit and spin, my friend!" In response, Donald sat down with "The Insider" and told us exactly how he feels about "The View" co-host. "Rosie O'Donnell's disgusting both inside and out," he said. "You take a look at her, she's a slob. She talks like a truck driver, she doesn't have her facts, she'll say anything that comes to her mind. Her show failed when it was a talk show, the ratings went very, very, very low and very bad, and she got essentially thrown off television. I mean she's basically a disaster."

Yikes! And here's the edited-together highlights of his chat with The Insider:

Naturally, Trump wants to sue Rosie for defamation -can she sue him for being so rude and calling her "my nice fat little Rosie"? Sure, Rosie has certainly not been the swiftest while on air, but this is so ugly. 'Tis the season? And is it weird that we sorta agree with both of them?

And the latest: Rosie brought her girlfriend Kelly Carpenter on the air today and, on her blog, cited Wikipedia's Donald Trump entry about his finances as the basis for her claims. Maybe Trump can sue Wikipedia!

Finally, the funniest thing is that The View tapes right next to Trump Place - which has Trump's name and is where Tara Conner lives. The world is wonderfully small!
