Jeb Bush is Back: On Board With Immigration Reform That Includes Path To Citizenship (Again)
The past seven days have been quite a ride for Jeb Bush. He began the week by recanting his earlier support for immigration reform with a path to citizenship. That’s because Jeb wrote a book last year when it didn’t seem like a path to citizenship would be the mainstream Republican position. But, the 2012 elections completely changed the politics of immigration reform. While Jeb’s support for legal status, not citizenship, might have been a sorta far-reaching position back in 2012, it wasn’t in Spring of 2013. And, it marked a retreat from his earlier support for citizenship. So, Jeb, who is contemplating a 2016 campaign for President looked out-of-step — and, frankly, just rusty.

When AV’s Frank Sharry appeared on The Ed Show on March 5th to talk about Jeb and his immigration position, he said, “my prediction is by the end of the week he is going to reassert his traditional position in favor of [citizenship.]”



Frank was right. Today, Bush appeared on all five major Sunday talk shows. And, it’s true: he’s back. There was actually an upside to Jeb’s major misstep. The ensuing discussion confirmed that immigration reform must include a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who aspire to be Americans. In fact, this episode produced the strongest defense of citizenship that we’ve heard from Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) so far

I thought about that issue a lot and [went] back and forth on it before I signed on to my principles and I just concluded that it’s not good for the country in the long term to have milions and millions of people who are forever prohibited from becoming citizens. That hasn’t worked out well for Europe.

Rubio also predicted Jeb would come (back) around.
