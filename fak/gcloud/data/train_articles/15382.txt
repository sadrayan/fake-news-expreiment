Emails, Brian Rodgers, investor and civic activist, Austin, June 20 and July 5, 2017

Three things jump out:

1. A project this size is well over $50 million in cost. The total fees for Austin represent only 2% of that total cost. The developer is more concerned about the other $48 million with land and construction costs sky high and interest rates rising. As one developer told me, he's more concerned about the fluctuation on the price of concrete and materials.

2. I seriously doubt that Dallas can approve a project in two weeks!

3. If the developer doesn't pay for their share of the water and sewer infrastructure, then the ratepayer has to pay. I'm sure Workman wanted water treatment plant #4 but doesn't want his development buddies to pay the costs. The whole purpose of those impact fees is for the municipality to recoup those costs rather than stack them up for the utility customer to pay. It's been state law since the '80s. Same for plan review. Am I supposed to pay property taxes to my city in order to help some developer get his plans reviewed for free? Hell no!

Hi Shonda,

I served on the City of Austin’s Impact Fee Advisory Commission for five years up until 2012. I wanted to serve on that committee because Austin Water was selling water and wastewater connections for an average house to developers at $2,000 when the cost to the utility was more like $7,000. In other words, we were selling w/ww taps at a $5,000 loss which amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars over recent years and that difference had to be made up by higher rates for everyone. Our committee pushed for Austin Water (and council) to charge the full fee allowed by state law which is equal to the actual cost and no more. That fee level is now $7,600 for a 5/8 inch meter. 60% of the water portion of that fee is for Water Treatment Plant #4. That plant was not needed by existing residents, it was built for future development and that is who will pay for it which is how the impact fee law is supposed to work.

State law allows municipalities to recoup infrastructure costs in only four categories: water, wastewater, drainage and roads. Austin doesn’t charge for roads or drainage. I pushed for impact fees for roads for years but the political pushback was too great. We’ve let hundreds of millions of dollars go uncollected that could have helped solve traffic congestion. I think road impact fees are finally getting some attention but I am not longer on the committee.

Other states collect impact fees to recoups infrastructure cost for schools, roads, fire, police, etc. but Texas won’t likely expand that mechanism. The Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, RECA and the City of Austin have been inducing population growth for years and dumping the costs of the needed new public infrastructure onto existing residents. RECA and the Chamber members are primarily from all aspects of the real estate industry who benefit from a population explosion.

I want you to be more precise about the sentence you wrote “And from a larger perspective, are you basically saying developers should pay their fair share of the overall costs of development…” I am saying that “developers should pay for the cost of the new public infrastructure that is attributed to and necessitated by their new development.”

Call me on my cell if you have questions. You can continue to call me civic activist and real estate investor.

Thanks!

Let me make my quote more match state law:

Developers should pay for the cost of the new public infrastructure that is necessitated by and attributable to their new development.”

Hi Shonda,

I'm copying Ed Wendler on this since his company actually develops this product so his answers aren't theoretical. I'm hoping he can elaborate.

The developer is more concerned about the other $48 million with land and construction costs sky high and interest rates rising.
