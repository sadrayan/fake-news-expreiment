- 1. - 2 INTRODUCTION This document describes the requirements that the Host Organisation of the World Scout Jamboree must fulfil in preparing and running this event. It has been developed taking into account the Constitution of World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), resolutions and policies adopted by the World Scout Conference, decisions taken by the World Scout Committee, and the experience and knowledge accumulated at previous World Scout Jamborees. The Host Organisation is obliged to comply with the WOSM Guidelines for the hosting of the World Scout Jamboree, and is advised to take into consideration the information from previous World Scout Jamborees (available from past host organisations and the World Scout Bureau). 1.1 Definition The World Scout Jamboree is an official educational event of the WOSM. It is specifically designed for young people aged between 14 and 17 years inclusive, from National Scout Organizations (NSOs) that are members of WOSM. It is organised by an NSO or alliance of NSOs, appointed by the World Scout Conference, under supervision of the World Scout Committee and with the support of the World Scout Committee and World Scout Bureau (WSB). 1.2 Purpose Participants at the World Scout Jamboree should develop as individuals, become better citizens of their local, national and international communities, make new friends with Scouts from around the world and assume new responsibility for promoting peace and goodwill. The World Scout Jamboree is an opportunity to develop Scouting, promote good practices and improve the quality of Scouting in all countries, spread the image of Scouting in the wider world and keep the Scout Method relevant to modern society. The World Scout Jamboree allows its Participants to experience an exemplary Scouting programme, faithful to the definition, Purpose, Principles and Scout Method and adapted to the needs and aspirations of young people in today's world. Young people, supported by adults, undertake individual, small group and large group activities in the setting of a large camp, that enable them to develop physically, intellectually, emotionally, socially and spiritually, adhering to the Scout Promise and Law. Whilst each World Scout Jamboree reflects the culture and practices of its host NSO(s), each event aims to create an environment that celebrates the unity of the Scout Movement, develops among Scouts the awareness of their belonging to a world family and organisation, and provides them with the opportunity to make friends with other Scouts. The World Scout Jamboree provides a unique opportunity to promote among the public worldwide the image of a universal educational movement which is open to all young people, both boys and girls, men and women, and contributes to the development of individuals as better citizens of their local, national and international communities. 1.3 Basic Principles The World Scout Jamboree shall be run in accordance with the basic principles of the Scout Movement, including the Scout Promise and Law and the different policies adopted by the World Scout Conferences on Youth Programme, Youth Participation and Adults in Scouting. The organisation of a World Scout Jamboree responds to historical and educational criteria that are specific to the Scout Movement and do not necessarily correspond to the usual characteristics of international youth or sports gatherings. The organisation of a World Scout Jamboree is subject to a number of technical and functional requirements, established by the WOSM in accordance with the Scout framework and the educational objectives of the event and in coherence with the different policies adopted by the World Scout Conference on Youth Programme, Youth Participation and the management of Adult Volunteers. These requirements are revised regularly in the light of experience. WOSM GUIDELINES FOR THE HOSTING OF THE WORLD SCOUT JAMBOREE â€“ March 2016

- 2. PARTICIPATION 2.1 Participants - 3 The World Scout Jamboree is an event held for young people. Participants at the World Scout Jamboree should be aged between 14 to 17 years (inclusive). The World Scout Jamboree is open to boys and girls, young men and women. The World Scout Jamboree is for members from all NSOs. Every Scout should have the opportunity to attend one World Scout Jamboree. The Host Organisation should take into consideration the dates for the preceding and succeeding World Scout Jamborees, and if necessary, accept Scouts who are 13 years of age (who will be 18 at the time of the succeeding Jamboree). 2.2 Adults at the Jamboree Unit Leaders, members of the International Service Team (IST) and members of Contingent Teams must be members of an NSO and be 18 years of age or older at the time of the event. In accordance with WOSM policy on Youth Participation, Contingents should encourage the participation of adults in the 18â€“30 age range. 2.3 Contingents Participation at a World Scout Jamboree is organised through national Contingents. Each Contingent will be led by a Head of Contingent and such Contingent Staff as necessary and appropriate to the size of the Contingent. The maximum number of Contingent staff per Contingent, based on size, will be published in good time by the Host Organisation. It is up to each NSO to organise their Contingent and their attendance. Only NSOs can register Contingents and there can only be one Contingent per NSO. Every individual attending the World Scout Jamboree must be a member of a Contingent. Each NSO is responsible for all members of its Contingent. No Contingent may constitute more than 10% of the maximum number of Participants approved by the World Scout Committee, with the exception of that of the country in which the Jamboree is being held, which may send a Contingent constituting up to but not more than 20% of that number. Where alliances of NSOs form the Host Organisation special arrangements may be agreed with the World Scout Committee. No Contingent may have more Adults than Participants, with the exception of the country in which the Jamboree is being held. Where alliances of NSOs form the Host Organisation special arrangements may be agreed with the World Scout Committee. 2.4 Scout Units (sometimes referred to as Troops) Participants should be registered in Scout Units of 4 Patrols with 9 Scouts in each. Each Scout Unit should be accompanied by 4 Leaders. In special circumstances (e.g. when a Participant has a disability that requires a carer) additional adult leaders may form part of the Unit. In such cases these adults are in addition to the 36 young people and four adults of a standard Unit. The Host Organisation may form international Patrols and Units for those who are not part of a full Unit. Unit Leaders are directly responsible for the behaviour of their Participants, in accordance with the activities and Participants' code of conduct established for the event. They accept full responsibility for the supervision of all individuals in their Unit and they are responsible for explaining the rules and regulations of the event to them. 2.5 International Service Team (IST) The International Service Team (IST) is made up of volunteers who assist with the delivery of the World Scout Jamboree. It is composed of host country/countries and international Scouts. Members of the IST must attend the Jamboree as part of a Contingent. WOSM GUIDELINES FOR THE HOSTING OF THE WORLD SCOUT JAMBOREE â€“ March 2016

- - 4 The presence of volunteers drawn from NSOs around the world is necessary to guarantee the worldwide character and the cross-cultural dimension of the event. The Host Organisation shall undertake to build an IST with the greatest possible international diversity. No more than 10% of the total planned IST should be drawn from any one country (with the exception of the country in which the Jamboree is being held). Where alliances of NSOs form the Host Organisation special arrangements may be agreed with the World Scout Committee. Members of the IST are required to be on site before the first Participants arrive in order to take part in training required for their role at the Jamboree. They are also required to stay after the participants depart in order to assist the Host Organisation with the Jamboree take down process. When nominating members of the IST, NSOs should take into consideration the individualâ€™s ability to manage the physically and psychologically demanding conditions at the event. 2.6 Visitors and Special Guests The Host Organisation should encourage visitors to attend the World Scout Jamboree, however, effort should be made to ensure that their presence impacts as little as possible upon the Participants. The Host Organisation on behalf of the World Scout Committee and NSOs present may invite special guests, including representatives of sponsors and partners, to the World Scout Jamboree. The WSB shall work in close co-operation with the Host Organisation in relation to the invitation and co-ordination of special guests and partners. 2.7 Non-WOSM Scout Organizations/Associations The World Scout Committee may decide if any non-WOSM Scout organisations or associations shall be invited to attend and participate at the World Scout Jamboree, with the agreement of the WOSM Member NSO in that country, if applicable. 2.8 WAGGGS members Members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) can participate in accordance with the policy agreed upon by WOSM and WAGGGS, which is as follows: - For National Scout and Guide Associations (those which are members of both WOSM and WAGGGS), invitations to World Scout Jamborees are addressed not only to WOSM registered members, but also to those members registered with WAGGGS. - Members of national Girl Guide/Girl Scout associations (which are members of WAGGGS only) may attend such events with the agreement of the NSO in their country. Apart from initial information provided by WOSM and WAGGGS, all information about the event, registration procedures, etc. are handled through their WOSM Member Organization. - In all cases, Girl Guides/Girl Scouts attending a World Scout Jamboree are part of their respective National Contingent. There will therefore be no WAGGGS contingents. 3. RESPONSIBILITIES The planning, organisation and execution of the World Scout Jamboree includes many parties. All the parties shall work together towards a successful event. 3.1 World Scout Conference The World Scout Conference elects an NSO or an alliance of NSOs to host the World Scout Jamboree.
