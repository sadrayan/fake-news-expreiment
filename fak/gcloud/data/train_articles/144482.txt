Louisiana Supreme Court Please FREE Corey Miller!!!!

The justice system should be to protect the innocent and to imprison the guilty. The justice system has done Corey Miller wrong. The Louisiana supreme court have denied Corey Miller's appeals and a retrial. The Louisiana supreme court did the same thing to: Glenn Ford, he was wrongfully convicted in a Louisiana murder case. Glenn Ford left the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, La., in 2014. His conviction in a murder case was vacated after he spent more than 29 years on death row. He died less than two months after he was released. From untreated lung cancer while in prison in Angola!!! Corey Miller should not have to endure the same torture Glenn Ford went through. There are visible flaws in the Louisiana justice system. The death penalty need to be abolished. Errors, negligence and deliberate misconduct by prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers are the most pervasive cause of wrongful convictions in Louisiana. Court appointed lawyers caused, at least in part, 77% of the convictions in Louisiana . Please free a man that has been wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit. How can you convict a person of murder if there wasno evidence to convict Corey Miller. There was

-NO GUN

-NO D.N.A

-NO EVIDENCE TO CONVICT

But, this man is sitting in prison serving a life sentence while the real man who did this crime is out there running the streets free to commit other crimes. Please take a moment of your time and sign this petition and help Corey Miller be free. Corey need to come home to his family. So that he can enjoy his life with his family and be a father to his 3 daughters. Please overturn Corey Miller conviction he should not be locked up for a crime that he did not commit!!! What would you do if it was your family member was wrongfully convicted of a crime? Corey Miller need to be exonerated and released from prison and compensated for the wrongful conviction. He should not have to rot in prison like so many other men in Angola and like Glenn Ford. Corey Miller deserve to be heard and he should be released from prison!!!
