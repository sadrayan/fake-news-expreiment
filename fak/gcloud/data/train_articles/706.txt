Airwars
Context

After the swift capture of much of Iraq by Islamic State, the US began military actions at the invitation of the Iraqi government on August 8th 2014, focused mainly on airstrikes. It was later joined in its Iraq campaign by France (from September 19th); the UK (September 30th); Belgium (October 5th); the Netherlands (October 7th); Australia (October 8th); Denmark (October 16th); Canada (November 2nd) and Jordan (unspecified date.)

The US began Syrian operations against ISIL on September 23rd 2014, initially aided by Saudi Arabia; Jordan; the United Arab Emirates; Bahrain and Qatar. These actions did not have the consent of the Assad government - and most other Western nations have not engaged militarily. US targets in Syria have also included a faction of the Al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, labelled the ‘Khorasan Group.’ On April 8th 2015, Canada also began airstrikes against ISIL in Syria, followed on August 26th by Turkey, by Australia on September 15th and by France on September 27th.

The coalition's war against ISIL has inevitably caused civilian casualties, certainly far more than the six deaths Centcom presently admits to. Yet it’s also clear that in this same period, many more civilians have been killed by Syrian and Iraqi government forces, by so-called Islamic State and by various rebel and militia groups operating on both sides of the border.

While our own focus is international airstrikes only [see our Methodology] we will always aim to place our work in its broader context - and highlight wherever possible the crucial work of other monitoring groups such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights; the Violations Documentation centre; SOHR and Iraq Body Count.
