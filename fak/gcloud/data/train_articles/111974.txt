Kremlin blows off US Congressional crusade to ‘audit’ Putin’s finances as Russophobic fuss
"It can hardly be taken seriously. Most likely it’s just some more Russophobic fuss. We’ve long learned to take that with irony," Peskov said.

MOSCOW, February 28. /TASS/. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned against taking seriously the US bill containing demands for information about the Russian president’s personal wealth.

He speculated that Vladimir Putin had not yet read the media publications about this bill.

"It is very unlikely the president is aware of this initiative. Naturally, if he comes across the corresponding mass media reports in the digests (compiled especially for the head of state - TASS), he will study this information," Peskov said.

He remarked that US legislators for some reason preferred to spend much time on Russian affairs, including those of the head of state and other senior officials.

"Either their own duties are too few, or this is the way they see their main job," Peskov said.
