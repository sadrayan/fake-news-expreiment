18 Safest Places to Live in America

Current Resident : Castleton is a quaint, quiet and reserved Vermont lake side town with a lot of character. I have lived here now for nearly 4 years and they have been wonderful ones. During the summer months the lake and the surrounding town is alive with tourists, home owners, locals and there is much to do. As the summer season winds down and the tourists and others leave for the cold months, Castleton quiets down and becomes quite serene. The foliage change during the fall is hands down the most dramatic and mesmerizing seasonal shift I have ever had the delight in witnessing. By winter, the lake is frozen over, reflecting bright sunlight and illuminating the surrounding homes. Ice fishers huddle out inside of their shanties with whiskey and small fires to keep them warm. Every season is a sight to see and varies very much from the last. All in all, Castleton is an ideal place to relax, vacation and to revel in the beauty that is Vermont.
