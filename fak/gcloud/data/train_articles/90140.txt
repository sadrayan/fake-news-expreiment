Liberal Trial Lawyer’s Math Doesn’t Add Up: When Wages Aren’t Income And Graduates Are Dropouts
On Day 30 of liberal trial lawyer Bill White refusing to release his income tax returns, he is attacking Texas educators by using incorrect statistics related to the graduation rate of Texas students.

“Liberal trial lawyer Bill White ignores facts when they don’t suit his agenda,” said Texans for Rick Perry spokesman Mark Miner. “Over the last month, he has denied he was a trial lawyer, defended not disclosing to Texas Ethics Commission wages that he reported to the IRS, and is now intentionally using misleading education statistics. It is unfortunate that Bill White continues to distance himself from reality.”

As Gov. Rick Perry has said before, one dropout is one too many, but Texas does not have a 30 percent dropout rate as White has suggested. The percent of students who enter high school and eventually earn a diploma or equivalent, or who remain in pursuit of a diploma or equivalent, is 90 percent.
