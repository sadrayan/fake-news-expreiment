RCP4.5: a pathway for stabilization of radiative forcing by 2100
Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 is a scenario of long-term, global emissions of greenhouse gases, short-lived species, and land-use-land-cover which stabilizes radiative forcing at 4.5 W m−2 (approximately 650 ppm CO 2 -equivalent) in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value. The defining characteristics of this scenario are enumerated in Moss et al. (2008, 2010). RCP4.5 is based on the MiniCAM Level 2 stabilization scenario reported in Clarke et al. (2007) with additional detail on the non-CO 2 and pollution control assumptions documented by Smith and Wigley (2006), and incorporating updated land use modeling and terrestrial carbon emissions pricing assumptions as reported in Wise et al. (2009a, b).

Unlike the scenarios developed by the IPCC and reported in Nakicenovic et al. (2000), which examined possible global futures and associated greenhouse-related emissions in the absence of measures designed to limit anthropogenic climate change, RCP4.5 is a stabilization scenario and assumes that climate policies, in this instance the introduction of a set of global greenhouse gas emissions prices, are invoked to achieve the goal of limiting emissions and radiative forcing.

While RCP4.5 is based on the MiniCAM Level 2 scenario reported in Clarke et al. (2007), it differs in several important regards. First, the Clarke et al. (2007) scenario considered a slightly different definition of radiative forcing than RCP4.5. In Clarke et al. (2007), radiative forcing is defined in terms of a suite of six greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ). RCP4.5 considered the influences of a broader set of anthropogenic emissions including CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF 6 , but also chemically active gases such as carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Importantly, RCP4.5 considers the influence of sulfur aerosols, as well as black and organic carbon. The Clarke et al. (2007) scenario stabilized radiative forcing at approximately 4.7 W m−2, slightly higher than RCP4.5. For CO 2 , the most important anthropogenically released greenhouse gas, year 2100 concentrations are somewhat higher in the Clarke et al. (2007) scenario, approximately 550 ppm CO 2 , than in RCP4.5, approximately 525 ppm CO 2 . RCP4.5 also employed updated historical data series by calibrating to the year 2000 consensus emissions inventories from Lamarque et al. (2010), and the HYDE crop and pasture land use history (Klein Goldewijk et al. 2010) as well as implementing a new representation of residue biomass supply (Gregg and Smith 2010). RCP4.5 also employed a more sophisticated land-use and land-cover model (Wise et al. 2009a, b) than was available for use in Clarke et al. (2007). Perhaps the most important difference is the downscaling of emissions and land-use-land-cover from the 14 geopolitical GCAM regions to a 0.5° grid for the RCPs in order to enable use of the scenario in atmospheric chemistry models and global climate models. Finally, RCP4.5 takes advantage of one technology that was not modeled in Clarke et al., namely combining bioenergy production with CO 2 capture and geologic storage (CCS). This technology combination is capable of producing final energy such as electricity with net-negative carbon emissions (Luckow et al. 2010).

Because the RCPs are based on previously existing scenarios documented in the open literature, each reflects a different set of underlying socioeconomic assumptions. RCP4.5 is a stabilization scenario and thus assumes the imposition of emissions mitigation policies. RCP4.5 is derived from its own “reference”, or “no-climate-policy”, scenario. This reference scenario is unique to RCP4.5 and differs from RCP8.5 as well as from the reference scenarios associated with RCP6 and RCP2.6 (also referred to as RCP3PD)(van Vuuren et al. 2011a).

In the remainder of this paper we will discuss the modeling environment employed to develop RCP4.5 (the Global Change Assessment Model; GCAM), from the original MiniCAM Level 2 scenario (Clarke et al. 2007). We will then proceed to describe the underlying socioeconomic assumptions that shape RCP4.5 and its associated reference scenario and discuss the characteristics of RCP4.5, highlighting the global energy, economic, land use, and land cover systems, as well as the mechanisms employed to limit radiative forcing to 4.5 W m−2 and contrast RCP4.5 to its reference scenario. Next, we compare the RCP4.5 to other 4.5 Wm−2 stabilization scenarios in the literature. Finally, we will describe alternate GCAM scenarios that follow the radiative forcing pathways of the other three RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP6, and RCP8.5).
