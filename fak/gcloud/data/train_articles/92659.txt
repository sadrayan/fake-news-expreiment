4 Planned Parenthood locations cited after Gov. Rick Scott orders inspections
After inspecting all 16 Planned Parenthood clinics in Florida, the state Agency for Health Care Administration announced Wednesday that three have performed procedures outside the scope of their licenses and one has not kept proper records on disposing fetal remains.

The inspections were ordered by Gov. Rick Scott in response to videos that went viral online that allegedly showed Planned Parenthood employees discussing the sale of fetal tissue and organs. AHCA did not find any evidence that organs are being sold illegal in Florida, confirming statements by Planned Parenthood.

"We will take immediate actions against these three facilities for performing second trimester abortions without a proper license," AHCA spokesperson Shelisha Coleman said in a written statement Wednesday. "These facilities have been notified to immediately cease performing second trimester abortions."

Clinics in St. Petersburg, Fort Myers and Naples were cited for performing abortions in the second trimester that they are not licensed to do.

A Pembroke Pines clinic was cited for improper recordkeeping.
