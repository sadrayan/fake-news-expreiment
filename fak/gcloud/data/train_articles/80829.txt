Anheuser-Busch gets buyout bid
When Miller Brewing Co. and Coors Brewing Co. executives announced plans to merge, Anheuser-Busch Cos. President and CEO August Busch IV saw an opening.

Busch, while conceding the joint venture’s ability to cut costs, told his employees that combining the nation’s No.2 and No. 3 brewers would sow confusion, and Anheuser-Busch should “capitalize on this disruption now.�?

Eight months later, with MillerCoors to begin operations July 1, Anheuser-Busch is facing its own potential disruption: an unsolicited bid of $46.3 billion from global brewer InBev NV. The end result, however, could be the creation of an international competitor that towers above all — including Miller’s corporate parent, SABMiller Plc.

The $65-per-share bid, reported to be in the works since just before Memorial Day weekend, was acknowledged Wednesday by St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, the nation’s largest brewer. The company statement was issued after the day’s trading, which saw Anheuser-Busch stock close at $58.35 a share, up $1.20, or 2.1%.

The company said its board of directors “will evaluate the proposal carefully and in the context of all relevant factors, including Anheuser-Busch’s long-term strategic plan.�?

“The board will review the merits of the proposal consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its financial and legal advisers. The board will pursue the course of action that is in the best interests of Anheuser-Busch’s stockholders.�?

Translation: We’ll consider it, but we might say no.

If rejected, Belgium-based InBev could bypass the board and take the bid directly to Anheuser-Busch shareholders as a hostile tender offer.

‘Not on my watch’

August Busch IV, whose family roots at the company date to 1864, told the company’s wholesale distributors at their annual conference in April that a sale of Anheuser-Busch would not happen on “my watch,�? according to the Wall Street Journal.

Busch, however, may be powerless to fight the offer, said analyst Ann Gilpin, of Chicago-based Morningstar Corp. The company’s stock price has lagged because of flat sales volume; concerns over higher costs eating into its profit margins; and a concentration of its sales in the United States, where an economic slowdown is leading beer drinkers to shift to lower-priced, less profitable brands.

“I think it’s going to be pretty hard for the board to convince shareholders that they can create value beyond what InBev can offer them today,�? Gilpin said.

The offer is 24% more than Anheuser-Busch’s share price on May 22, the day before published reports said InBev was preparing a takeover bid.

Anheuser-Busch could make the case that it would deliver more value to shareholders by remaining independent, said analyst Mariann Montagne, of Minneapolis-based Thrivent Asset Management.

Among other things, the company could increase its 50% stake in Grupo Modelo, the Mexican brewer of Corona and other brands. That would give Anheuser-Busch a bigger presence outside the United States.

The company also could sell its Busch Gardens amusement parks division to raise cash, Montagne said.

“You know they have to make a strong appeal to the shareholders who are not in St. Louis and who are not in the (Busch) family,�? she said. Busch family members own only about 4% of Anheuser-Busch shares.

Experts at cutting costs

If InBev acquired Anheuser-Busch, it would likely follow its pattern of slashing costs in order to boost profit margins, Montagne said.

For Anheuser-Busch, that could include a drastic cut in marketing for Budweiser. Despite being the second-largest U.S. brand and the longtime company mainstay, Budweiser and other full-calorie, mainstream beers have seen declining sales for several years — including a 4.7% volume drop in 2007, according to trade publication Beer Marketer’s Insights.

InBev would likely divert marketing dollars now spent on Budweiser and other U.S. brands to overseas markets with higher growth potential, Montagne said. She said that could make it easier for the new MillerCoors joint venture, which will have a 29% market share, to compete with Anheuser-Busch, which has a 48% U.S. market share.

Gilpin, of Morningstar, believes a combined InBev/Anheuser-Busch would create a tougher global competitor for London-based SABMiller, which has large operations in Africa, central Europe and Asia.

“InBev is a global powerhouse and they’re experts with their cost-cutting,�? Gilpin said.
