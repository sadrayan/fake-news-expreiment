FAKE NEWS STORY - CHINESE FOOD RESTAURANT: We have received several private messages and tweets about this story circling the internet. This is a FAKE news story. As a reminder, always read and check the source before sharing, commenting or liking these stories. A few tell tale signs in this story: Coral Springs, roadways, and the restaurant name is lowercase (no good journalist would lowercase streets, cities or businesses or misspell several words); also what is gummypost.com ; not a credible news source. As a matter of fact their headlines read: 15 scariest people that exist (with a half woman/half animal photo) and celebrities that turned ugly in just a few years (with Photoshop images of celebrities).
