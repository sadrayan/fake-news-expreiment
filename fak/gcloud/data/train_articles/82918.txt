RI Minority Business Enterprise
Overview MBECO promotes the development of certified Minority Business Enterprises (MBE), Women Business Enterprises (WBE), and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE). It does this by facilitating their participation in Rhode Island's business and economic development opportunities. Specifically, MBECO services in certification, enforcement, business assistance and advocacy. Certification is a marketing tool, used specifically to enhance your ability to do business in public markets. Where an agency has affirmative purchasing goals, certification increases your chances of receiving a contract. Certification does not guarantee that you will be successful each and every time you bid; but it may add a competitive edge to your bid. MBECO works extensively with state and local agencies to help them fulfill their business purchasing goals. MBECO actively promotes the participation of certified businesses in public and private purchasing and contracting programs. For more information on Rhode Island's procurement system, contact www.purchasing.ri.gov. MBECO offers the following services designed to meet the needs of the Minority (MBE) and Woman-Owned (WBE) business communities. MBECO also assists with new legislative and policy proposals that facilitate the involvement of minorities and women in the mainstream of the economy.

State Procurement Opportunities As of April 1, 1997 State law requires that State Bids must be solicited from vendors by computer, rather than by mail and/or print advertisements. The address on the Internet is www.purchasing.ri.gov. It is therefore essential that you take a few minutes to register your company on line in order to access purchasing opportunities with the State of Rhode Island and its quasi-state agencies. It is important to note that your firm does not need to be certified as a Minority Business Enterprise, Women Business Enterprise, or Disadvantaged Business Enterprise to access the Rhode Island Vendor Information program.
