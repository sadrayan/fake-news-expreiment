McCain fields questions at Nashua forum

Please upgrade your Flash Player

NASHUA Â– Political observers from friendly and enemy camps peppered Republican presidential candidate John McCain with 13 questions ranging from health care and Iraq to gas prices and violent video games during a town hall-style forum here Thursday.



The longtime Arizona senator behaved as if he enjoyed every minute of it.



McCain even listened calmly while it took four prompts to get David Wheeler, a self-described "Christian voter" from Nashua, to ask why he and other fundamentalists should elect him.



From the back of the gym, McCain supporters began chanting louder and louder for Wheeler to "ask the question."



"I hope that we all know that this nation was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. I intend to abide by those principles as president of the US as I have my entire life," McCain responded.



"That means a country open to all faiths, all religions and all beliefs."



McCain, 72, returned to the first primary state, site of 102 forums like this one that keyed McCain's come-from-behind victory five months ago.



In a relatively short time, the New Hampshire win helped vault him to the nomination over several better-financed and younger opponents.



While early polls have him leading Democratic nominee to-be Barack Obama in the state, McCain had assured regional reporters earlier in the day that this race would "be down to the wire in New Hampshire."



After thanking a dozen, prominent supporters by name at the Daniel Webster College Vagge Gynasium event, McCain called this supportive crowd to his aid.



"I need you this November. I know that you know New Hampshire is going to be a key state, my friends. I can win it and I'll be back and back and back," McCain implored.



"I want to tell you that I need you to get active now because this is going to be a tough fight."



McCain trails Obama in national polls.



The revisited underdog McCain keeps tinkering with his election theme.



Last week the campaign unveiled, "Leadership you can believe in" to mock Obama's "Change you can believe in."



McCain insisted Obama represents the "wrong change."



McCain has charged that Obama's America is what the country would have been like had President Jimmy Carter won a second term in 1980 rather than lose to the late Ronald Reagan.



During his interview with reporters, he tossed out another theme.



"If there's a slogan for this campaign it would be 'country first,' " McCain said.



This reinforces McCain's life story as the Vietnam War prisoner of war who has since spent 26 years in Congress, often as a maverick who did battle with the leadership of his own party.



"I will always, no matter what the political cost, I will always put my country first," McCain said closing the forum.



Amherst Democratic activist John Mendolusky engaged McCain in a sharp but respectful exchange over Social Security reform.



"You stated you are in favor of private accounts which really is privatization of Social Security," Mendolusky began.



"Why would you have workers risk their nest eggs on the roulette wheels of Wall Street?"



"I am not for quote 'privatization of Social Security.' I never have been, never will be. That is a great buzzword for an attack," McCain shot back.



"Workers should have the right to put their own taxes, their own money into an account. If they don't want to, don't do it."



McCain pondered one question about a potential uphill battle against Obama considering the media buzz for the first black presidential nominee from either major party.



McCain answered, "All I can say is the first thing I will do is not complain because nobody made me do this. It has been one of the greatest experiences of my life."
