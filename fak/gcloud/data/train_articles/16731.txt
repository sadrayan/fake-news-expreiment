First and foremost, abortion is a constitutionally protected medical procedure.

As far as higher rates of abortion among black women, it reflects higher rates of unintended pregnancy. This article lays it out well: https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2008/higher-abortion-rates-among-women-color-reflect-higher-rates-unintended-pregnancy

And, you should really be reaching out to women of color groups like Sister Song and In Our Own Voice, to get their perspective on this.

Best,

Rebecca
