Subject: Inquiry for a PolitiFact Texas story

Christine:

Good afternoon. I am fact-checking a candidate’s claim that after Texas cut its two-year family planning budget by $73 million, “one in four clinics closed their doors.”

Does HHSC have information bearing on this claim’s accuracy?

We’re interested in the degree to which the family planning budget was cut and whether one in four clinics closed.

As ever, we count on attributable on-the-record information for our stories. We are trying to complete this review by Friday.

Thanks,

g.

Hi Gardner,

We cannot confirm the number of clinics that may have closed.

The Family Planning program funding can be found in the state budget under DSHS’ B.1.3. Strategy: FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES.

In 2009, $111 million was appropriated for the 2010-2011 biennium. http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Documents/GAA/General_Appropriations_Act_2010-11.pdf (page167 of the pdf)

In 2011, $37.9 million was appropriated for the 2012-2013 biennium. http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Documents/GAA/General_Appropriations_Act_2012-13.pdf (page 171 of the pdf)

I hope that helps. Thanks.

How has spending changed since the latter biennium?

Have women served through clinics gone up or down and by how much?

Just for the Family Planning Program? There were changes made to the women’s health programs throughout the years. Please see the attached for a historical look at numbers of clients served by the Family Planning Program, Expanded Primary Health Care, Women’s Health Program, Texas Women’s Health Program, and Healthy Texas Women. Generally with the programs, numbers for 2010 through 2012 can be compared year over year since those are the years the programs were most similar. But between 2013-2016 the programs allowed for clients to access one or more programs, so it really wouldn’t be accurate to make comparisons for those years. With the changes in July 2016, we aligned the programs so they serve distinct populations.

This April 2018 paper says HHSC was coming out with updated information May 1. Did that happen? If so, where might it be?

Thanks,
