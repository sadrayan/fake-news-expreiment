Dreams Do Come True: Pizza Vending Machines On Their Way To The U.S.
How often do you stand in front of a vending machine, examining the selection of chips, crackers, and candy bars, and think, “I wish this thing would make me a fresh pizza”? Every day? Me too. Turns out the pizza gods have heard our prayers, because an innovative pizza vending machine called “Let’s Pizza” is finally making its way to the States. The Let’s Pizza has been popular in Europe for years (for obvious reasons), but here’s what Americans can expect: once you choose your toppings and pay $5.95, the machine mixes the dough from scratch, kneads it, flattens it into a 10.5-inch round, and adds the toppings. An infra-red oven heats your creation to 380 degrees, and about a minute later, out pops a steaming hot, fresh(ish) pizza to enjoy at any of the malls, supermarkets, and gas stations where a Let’s Pizza machine will soon be found. Bon appetit, America! [Huffington Post]
