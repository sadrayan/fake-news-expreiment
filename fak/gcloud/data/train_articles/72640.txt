SNAP Plays a Critical Role in Helping Children — Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) is the nation’s largest child nutrition program, providing benefits to help one in three children in the nation to be able to eat a nutritionally sound diet. As such, SNAP is crucially important to children’s health and well-being.

[10] “Child food insecurity” is the most severe form of food insecurity. Children are often protected from food insecurity as adults in food insecure households reduce their own food intake in order to provide adequate nutrition for children; in households with food insecurity among children, however, the children are subject to reductions and changes in food intake.
