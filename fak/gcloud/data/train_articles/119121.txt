Charlie Sheen in Bad Death Hoax
Truth rating: 0

By Michael Lewittes

Charlie Sheen is the latest victim of a sick, FAKE death hoax.

According to another gross prank from Global Associated News, “Actor Charlie Sheen is reported to have died shortly after a snowboard accident earlier today -December 26, 2010.”

Sheen is NOT dead.

The FAKE report claimed that while at a ski resort in Zermatt, Switzerland, “Sheen lost control of his snowboard and struck a tree at a high rate of speed… Sheen was air lifted by ski patrol teams to a local hospital, however, it is believed that the actor died instantly from the impact of the crash.”

Again, this is NOT TRUE.

Sheen is ALIVE and WELL in L.A.

His ex-wife, Denise Richards even tweeted, “The rumor about Charlie Sheen is not true. He is alive and on his way over to see his daughters.”

Just recently there was an equally vile death prank about Morgan Freeman.

These hoaxes have happened many times before.

They’re not funny. They’re not cool. They’re not entertaining.

We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, Gossip Cop is at a total loss as to why anyone would concoct phony fatalities, and sincerely hopes the only thing that dies out are these horrible hoaxes.
