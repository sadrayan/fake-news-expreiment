What did it cost?

Connecticut raised the age after already committing to the removal of low-need kids from the juvenile justice system and investment in cost-effective community-based programming. Because of this shift from expensive out-of-home placement or incarceration to community and evidence-based programming, overall spending on juvenile justice in Connecticut decreased, even after the age was raised. Expenditures went from in $139 million 2001-2002 to $137 million in 2011-2012.*

Because the research is clear that keeping older youth in the juvenile justice system promotes rehabilitation, raising the age creates long-term savings by avoiding serial incarceration. An Urban Institute study concluded that Connecticut would save $3 for every $1 it spent raising the age.
