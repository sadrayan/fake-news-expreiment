Travel Wisconsin: Boating
It’s National Travel and Tourism week and we think that’s a perfect opportunity to kick off the summer boating season on one of Wisconsin’s 15,000 lakes. Wisconsin is home to fantastic water skiing, tubing, boating and swimming. So get out there and get wet!

Up North

Making a pilgrimage “Up North” to the Northwoods of Wisconsin is a summertime staple.

With 28 connecting lakes, the Eagle River Chain of Lakes is the largest freshwater chain in the world, perfect for boating, water skiing and tubing. The depth of the lakes varies widely from one to the next, providing more than enough space for whatever activity floats your boat.

One of the oldest water ski show clubs still in existence today, the Min-Aqua Bats put on a great show for Northwoods visitors all summer long. Check out one of their shows performed on Sunday, Wednesday and Friday nights in Minocqua.

Head a few hours further north to Bayfield , located on the shores of Lake Superior. Explore the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, which includes 22 islands via sea kayak.

Wisconsin Dells

The “Waterpark Capital of the World” offers more than just waterparks.

Visit Lake Delton and rent a speedboat, jet ski or, for a more leisurely cruise on the lake, a pontoon boat.

While you’re in the area, be sure the see “The Greatest Show on H2O,” the Tommy Bartlett Ski Show in Wisconsin Dells.

Take a Wisconsin Dells Boat Tour on the Wisconsin River to see stunning rock formations formed thousands of years ago. The Upper Dells glides you by incredible rock ledges that tower above the river, and pauses for shore landings at Witches Gulch, a spooky and spectacular canyon carved into the stone.

Door County

Door County is a boat lovers’ paradise. With 300 miles of shoreline, you can watch a sunrise and a sunset over the water without leaving the county.
