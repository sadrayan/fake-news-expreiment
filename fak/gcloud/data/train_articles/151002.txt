What kinds of fake/false/dodgy news are there?

There are generally two kinds of fake/false/dodgy news. The first is “news” as click bait to drive traffic to a fake/dodgy news site and where the content is still misleading and or doesn't subscribe to common standards of journalism. The second is fake/false/dodgy news done as part of a deliberate strategy to misinform and shift public discourse, or what we think and talk about. Both kinds undermine media freedom and our democracy as they seek to mislead and disempower us from being able to be informed and to participate meaningfully in society.

The other problem with the term fake news is that there is often a good deal of truth to the stories. In many instances fake/false/dodgy news stories can spread fast because they have to have elements that make them believable.

One of the earliest examples in South Africa was a “breaking” story around five years ago on a dodgy website that announced that Nelson Mandela had died. The story spread rapidly and was taken up by many – largely because at the time Mandela had been in hospital, so the authors used the accurate knowledge that Mandela had been ill to help make it seem more believable that he had passed when in fact he only passed away some years later.

It gets worse, not only is our own news in South Africa simply unbelievable, but if you play around with our Churnalism tool on this site you will also find that in many instances stories from sites that are known for dodgy content, have copied a lot of content from more credible media sites. Sometimes they will copy the whole story, or sometimes use just a portion of it. In any event it means that instead of being able to say the site is fake or the stories are fake we prefer to call them dodgy. The benefit is that the term indicates that the news, for a variety of reasons should not be trusted.
