Truth Test: Kelly ad claims Bost voted to raise his own pay - WSIL-TV 3 Southern Illinois
WSIL -- In a new ad in the race for Illinois 12th congressional district, Democrat Brendan Kelly attacks incumbent Republican Mike Bost, claiming he’s a career politician who works for himself, not southern Illinois.

"My opponent, Mike Bost, has been an Illinois politician for almost 35 years, he even voted to raise his own pay," Kelly claims in the ad.

That claim goes all the way back to 2007 when Bost was a member of the Illinois General Assembly.

He did vote for a supplemental budget that included a raise for lawmakers, but that one vote doesn’t tell the full story. The supplemental budget wasn’t just a raise for lawmakers, it also included funding for schools and infrastructure improvements.

In addition, Bost voted for a resolution in 2006 rejecting the proposed raises. In fact, Bost has a long history of voting against lawmaker raises during his time in Springfield and Washington.

While in the Illinois Legislature, Bost voted against pay increases for lawmakers more than a dozen times, and even voted to require furlough days for legislators, actually reducing compensation.

Since being elected to Congress, Bost has voted against pay increases 12 times, including a vote earlier this month. While in Washington he has never voted for a pay increase.

Did Bost vote for a pay increase in 2007, yes, so the claim is true, but because it doesn’t provide context and leaves out important parts of Bost’s record, the claim is also misleading to voters.
