Current News News Archive Add your comments ICE not a hoax Email hoaxers are threatening a campaign to encourage people to store contact details in their mobile phones.



The ICE (In Case of Emergency) scheme gained widespread coverage in the wake of Thursday’s London bombings as word spread by email throughout the world.



People can add into the mobile’s address book ICE and the name and number of the person they would like contacted in an emergency.



But a subsequent email circulated by malicious hoaxers suggests that ICE is a type of mobile phone virus which accesses your address book and drains pay-as-you-go phones of its credits.



Matt Ware, spokesman for the East Anglian Ambulance Service, asked people to ignore the hoax email.



“I have been inundated with emails and phone calls from people worried that, having put ICE into their mobiles, they are now going to be charged for the privilege,” he added.



“We would like to assure people that that’s not the case. Whoever began this second email chain is obviously a malicious person with way too much time on their hands.”
