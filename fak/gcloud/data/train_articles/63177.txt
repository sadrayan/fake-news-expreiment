WEBVTT MIKE: A DEAL TO HELP CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAKER KIMBERLY-CLARK STAY IN THE FOX VALLEY APPEARS TO BE IN JEOPARDY IN THE STATE SENATE AND GOVERNOR WALKER STATED WHAT IS AT STAKE LAST WEEK. GO WALKER: IF THE STATE FAILS TO ACT, I BELIEVE BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH, THOSE JOBS ARE GONE. THIS IS NOT AN ID THREAT FROM KIMBERLY-CLARK. MIKE THE GOVERNOR CALLED ON THE SENATE TO LEAD AND APPROVE THE INCENTIVE LEGISLATION, WHICH IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH ABOUT $70 MILLION. THE BILL LACKS ENOUGH REPUBLICAN VOTES TO PASS, AND NO DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID PUBLICLY THAT THEY’LL SUPPORT IT. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? WE’RE ASKING REPUBLICAN STATE SENATOR ALBERTA DARLING, THE CO-CHAIR OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. SEN. DARLING: THANKS, MIKE, GLAD TO BE BACK. MIKE: WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN? SEN. DARLING: WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY COUNTED THE VOTES. EVERY TIME WE HAVE HAD INCENTIVE PACKAGES, WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. I AM VERY SURPRISED THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT IT. IS THIS GOOD FOR DAVE HANSEN AND HIS AREA? IS IT GOOD TO SAVE THE UNION IS REALLY WORKING TO KEEP THE JOBS IN THE AREA? AND WE REALLY CONCEDED A LOT, AND WE WANT OUR FAMILIES TO STAY HERE. WE LOVEC. IF THEY LEAVE, WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO FIND 72,000 JOBS ? WE HAVE A MAJOR WORK SHORTAGE, AND I UNDERSTAND OTHERS ARE SAYING WE HAV A WORK SHORTAGE, BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF THOSE JOB AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT THE FAMILIES CAN HAVE BECAUSE OF THESE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND SALARIES. MIKE: LET ME POST BACK -- PUSH BACK ON THE CASE FOR DOING THIS. WE HAD A SENATOR ON THE PROGRAM, AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS. HE BELIEVES IT IS NOT TRANSFORMATIONAL. HE IS ALSO CONCERNED THAT DOWN THE ROAD, YOU MAY HAVE OTHER COMPANIES COMING TO YOU WITH HANDS OUTSTRETCHED SEEING WELL, YOU DID IT WIT KIMBERLY-CLARK, WHY AREN’T YOU DOING IT WITH US? SEN. DARLING: THEY ARE SAYING CKC IS A PAPER PRODUCTS COMPANY. THEY ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE LIFESTYLE AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE, AND THEY WANT TO PUT MONEY INTO INNOVATION AND R&D, AND THAT IS WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO STAY COMPETITIVE. I THINK WE ARE AT THE POINT NATIONALLY THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT -- HOW DO WE KEEP INNOVATION, BECAUSE THAT IS OUR FUTURE. MIKE: THE YOU THINK WE ARE SETTING A PRECEDENT, THAT OTHER COMPANIES WILL LOOK AT KIMBERLY-CLARK IF THEY GET THIS? SEN. DARLING: THIS WILL NOT BE AN ABSOLUTELY NEW PRECEDENTS. WE HAVE H FOXCONN, BUT WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO GROW AND MAINTAIN THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE, AND WE WILL DO IT AGAIN. THIS IS THE NORM, THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF JOBS AND GOOD THE JOBS VERY -- GOOD PAYING JOBS IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE GROWN TO THE TOP 10, AND WE DO NOT WANT TO GET OUT OF THAT COMPETITIVE CATEGORY. FAMILIES IN WISCONSIN COULD USE HIGHER PAYING SALARIES TO KEEP THESE IN WISCONSIN, TO HAVE A GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LAME-DUCK SESSIO, THERE SEEMS TO BE A CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS IS AN ATTEMPT LIMIT THE POWER OF INCOMING GOVERNOR, TOBY EVERS. -- TONY EVERS. THE 20 20TH ELECTION CHANGE, THAT WE MIGHT CHANGE THE DATE OF OUR PRESIDENTIA PRIMARY IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE REPUBLICANS. ARE YOU AGREEING WITH THAT? SEN. DARLING: YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT IS AT STAKE. WE DO NOT THINK IT IS IMPORTANT -- TO PUT A BURD ON A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. MIKE 2016, REBECCA BRADLEY WAS RUNNING, HOT CONTESTED PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. YOU COULD ARGUE SHE COULD BENEFIT FROM THAT. DO YOU WORRY THAT REPUBLICANS ARE DOING THIS TO, I DON’T KNOW, RIG A ELECTION, THAT THE AVERAGE VOTER MIGHT SEE IT THAT WAY? SEN. DARLING: THE AVERAGE VOTER MAY HAVE A QUESTION FOR IT, AND THE FACT IS WE SHOULD NOT PUT A NATIONAL ELECTION ON TOP OF LOCAL ELECTIONS. A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH THAT. MIKE: DO YOU AGREE WITH WHAT SPEAKER CO VOSS SAID, WE’RE TRYI TO DO THINGS WE APPROVE OF. DO YOU AGREE WITH HIM ON THAT? I WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF DOING THOSE CHANGES, BECAUSE A LOT OF US THOUGHT -- WHAT IF THERE IS A DIFFERENT GOVERNOR, AND THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENT GOVERNOR AT SOME POINT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE RULES HAVE A BALANCE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH WITH THE EXECUTIVE. WE GAVE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TOO MUCH POWER. I THINK IT IS A GOOD TIME TO LOOK AT BALANCING THE POWER, MAKING SURE THE LEGISLATIVE VOICE IS HEARD, BECAUSE WE ARE EQUAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, AND WE HAVE TO BE EQUAL WHEN IT COMES TO RULES. MIKE: SPEAKER VOS ALSO SAID HE WOULD LIKE T SEE ACTION THAT WOULD COVER PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. SEN. DARLING ABSOLUTELY. I WANTED TO DO THAT A LONGTIME AGO, BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISS THAT WISCONSIN HAS ALWAYS STOOD F FINDING PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, AND WE NEED TO TAKE THE BOAT, AS THE ASSEMBLY. OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR CONGRESS DISAGREE WITH THAT. MIKE: SENATOR ALBERTA DARLING, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE PROGRAM. SEN. DARLING: L
