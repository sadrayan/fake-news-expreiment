Helping hard-working middle-class families provide the best start in life for their children is a top priority for the Government of Canada. That is why two years ago the Government launched the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) to help families with the high cost of raising kids. The CCB—which is targeted to middle-class families and those working hard to join the middle class—is simpler, tax‑free and more generous than previous child benefit programs.

Today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, announced that the CCB has been increased to keep up with the cost of living two years ahead of schedule. Indexed cheques are already out, giving parents even more money each month to help them provide for their children.

Increasing the CCB sooner will ensure that it will continue to play a vital role in supporting families. This means that for the 2018–19 benefit year, the CCB will now have a maximum annual benefit of $6,496 per child under age 6 and $5,481 per child age 6 through 17 years. On average, families benefitting from the CCB received $4,600 more over the last two years compared with 2015–16.

Thanks to the CCB, 9 out of 10 Canadian families have more money to help pay for things like healthy food, sports programs and music lessons. Even more importantly, the CCB has helped lift more than half a million people—including nearly 300,000 children—out of poverty in Canada.
