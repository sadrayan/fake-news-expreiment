The 115th Congress by Party, Race, Gender and Religion
The 115th Congress, sworn in on Jan. 3, 2017 , is the most racially diverse in history and boasts more women serving in the Senate than ever before.

But increased diversity in the new Congress is largely around the edges, with women and minorities each making up less than 20 percent of lawmakers. When it comes to religion, more than 90 percent of members are identified as Christian.
