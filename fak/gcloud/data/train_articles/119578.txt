Jennifer Hudson 'Very Safe' At Hotel: Trump
Jennifer Hudson and some of her family members have been staying as Donald Trump's guests at his new Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago since last month's murder of her mother, brother and nephew, and are "very safe" there, the real estate mogul told People.

"She's a great girl. And we're protecting them well," Trump told PEOPLE at a benefit honoring Australia director Baz Luhrman at the Museum of Modern Art Monday night. "They are very safe."

The lone identified suspect in the killings was denied parole Monday in a hearing unrelated to the Hudson investigation. William Balfour, the estranged husband of Hudson's sister, Julia, will remain in prison as the case proceeds.
