'Everybody's Just a Sitting Duck': Trump Blasts Gun-Free Zones
Donald Trump called in to "Fox and Friends Weekend" today and weighed in on a variety of topics, including the tragic Oregon shooting.

Trump pointed out that Umpqua Community College was a gun-free zone, so the only person who had a gun was the bad guy.

"Everybody was sitting there and there was nothing they could do, not a thing they could do," Trump said. "The police did a fantastic job getting in that quickly, but there was nobody with any protection."

"Wouldn't they have been better off if somebody in the room, anybody, anybody, had a gun to at least help them out?" Trump said. "It was a terrible thing. And these gun-free zones are a disaster. Everybody's just a sitting duck."

He added that he believes shootings like this are more mental health issues than gun issues.

"We have to do something about mental health. It is becoming a bigger and bigger problem. Certainly, every one of these instances with the school shootings and the movie theater shooters, every one of them turns out to be the same kind of a character."
