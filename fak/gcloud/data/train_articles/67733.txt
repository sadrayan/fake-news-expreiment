Harry Reid Spends $736,882 In NC To Attack Thom Tillis, Double-Down On Obamacare



The Senate Majority PAC, led by liberal Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, has purchased $736,000 worth of television advertising in North Carolina to defend Obamacare and attack House Speaker Thom Tillis, the conservative candidate for US Senate.

“Harry Reid has come to North Carolina to defend Obamacare and attack me for opposing it,” Tillis said. “North Carolina is ground zero in the effort to get rid of the liberal Reid majority that is keeping Obamacare in place and keeping our country on a path to fiscal disaster.”

As the leader of the conservative reform movement to overthrow Democrats in Raleigh in the 2010 elections, Tillis made the rejection of Obamacare his first order of business as Speaker of the House. Under Tillis’ leadership, North Carolina has refused Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and refused to build a state exchange to implement Obamacare in North Carolina.

“My campaign to beat Kay Hagan is the key to a new conservative majority that will repeal Obamacare and balance the budget,” Tillis said. “It is a badge of honor to be attacked by Harry Reid and I will work night and day to beat Kay Hagan and overthrow his majority in the U.S. Senate.”

Reid’s political action committee, the Senate Majority PAC, has purchased advertising in the Piedmont Triad, the Triangle, Charlotte, and in the Greenville-New Bern market. The $736,882 media buy represents Reid’s largest single political expenditure this year in a 2014 Senate contest.
