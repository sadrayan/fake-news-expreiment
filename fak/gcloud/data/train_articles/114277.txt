Alka-Seltzer FAQs
What is the advantage of using the Alka-Seltzer effervescent products for heartburn relief over taking a medicine in a swallowable tablet form?

There are multiple advantages to using effervescent Alka-Seltzer products. Simply put, the medicine dissolves fast and goes to work instantly, neutralizing acid on contact. Because the medicines in Alka-Seltzer effervescents are in solution prior to ingestion, they do not require time to dissolve in the stomach like similar active ingredients taken in swallowable tablet form.

What should I do if the tablets don't fizz?

This is a sign that the tablets may have started to break down. It is very likely that the foil packet has a slight imperfection or pin hole which has allowed moisture to come in contact with the tablets. This may also cause the tablets to discolor and crumble.

Radio Actor, Dick Beals was the voice of Speedy Alka-Seltzer on our Alka-Seltzer commercials. Speedy Alka-Seltzer was originally known as Sparky, but the name was changed by a sales manager, Perry L.
