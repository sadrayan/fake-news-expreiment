Hi Robert,

To answer the reporter's question, the governor's quote is correct: 1 in 5 children live in a family that receives food stamps.

As far as comparing the rates to previous years, that same press release has a time comparison to 2007 (just prior to the recession). The proportion of children that received food stamps then was roughly 1 in 8.

We do have figures for Texas from the ACS, but the universe is households, rather than children.
