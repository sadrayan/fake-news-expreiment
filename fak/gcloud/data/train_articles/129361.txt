Kasich: 'Women left their kitchens' remark not artful
FAIRFAX, Va. -- Republican Presidential Candidate John Kasich is now saying a controversial comment he made about women leaving their kitchens to support his first run for office was not worded "as artfully" as it could have been.

It became one of Monday's campaign trail stories after his town hall meeting at George Mason University.

Kasich talked about his first campaign for the state legislature in 1978.

"How did I get elected? I didn't have anybody for me. We just got an army of people who and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door-to-door," he said.

He later added, "Things were different. Now you call homes and everyone is working."

A woman in the crowd said Kasich still had her vote but added, "I won't be coming out of the kitchen."

Kasich responded, "I got ya. I got ya."

Hillary Clinton tweeted in response, "It's 2016..A woman's place is...wherever she wants it to be."

Some women and advocacy groups were already upset by Kasich's signing of legislation that strips government funding from Planned Parenthood in Ohio.

"When I heard John Kasich's latest offensive views on women and our rights, I almost dropped the casserole I was taking out of the oven," said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL, a reproductive rights advocacy organization.

Kasich later acknowledged his remarks are not spoken "as artfully" as they might have been.

He explained that's because he speaks of the cuff.

"I'm a real guy, and I think people want authenticity," he said.

He got some heat on this, but to harken back to the old Harry Truman adage, he's not getting out of the kitchen.
