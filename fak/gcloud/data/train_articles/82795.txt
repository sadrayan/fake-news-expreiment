Maltese beauty queen denies ‘fake’ report of Heathrow airport arrest
Malta’s 2016 Miss Universe contestant, Martha Fenech, has denies reports that she was arrested at Heathrow airport in the UK for drug smuggling.

UK news portal Metro reported that Fenech had been arrested at the airport on Thursday after customs and border protection police officers found more than £80,000 (€91,692) worth of cocaine in her luggage.

Taking to Facebook, Fenech said that the article is fictitious and that she is currently in Malta, not the UK, as the newspaper reported.
