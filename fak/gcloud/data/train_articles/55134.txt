Snipes starts re-election campaign for 2016
Broward elections supervisor Dr. Brenda Snipes can start working on her own political campaign now. She filed paperwork to open a campaign account and run for re-election.

Snipes, a Lauderdale Lakes resident and former educator, had announced in April her intent to run.

Snipes has sparred with the Broward County Commission (as has the property appraiser, and many elected officials in City Halls across Broward), and there were rumblings that the now-seated charter review board would recommend changing the county charter so her job would be an appointed one. Snipes said she feels strongly the job should be an elected one.

Snipes, a Democrat, was appointed by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2003, after he removed her predecessor Miriam Oliphant. Snipes went on to win three elections.

Already in the race for her seat on the 2016 ballot are political consultant David Brown, Willie Floyd Roberson Jr., and Rubin Young.
