A case of sustained massive gabapentin overdose without serious side effects.
Gabapentin is an antiepileptic agent that is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures. It has a relatively benign side effect profile, but little data exists on massive overdoses with this agent. The authors present a case of a patient who received a massive overdose of this agent but suffered no clinically significant toxicity.
