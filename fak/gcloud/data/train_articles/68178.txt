New ad: Rick Perry a "Coward" for refusing to debate
Allies of Democrat Bill White are stepping up the rhetoric against Rick Perry for refusing to debate in full-page ads that will appear in Tuesday's newspapers. Back to Basics PAC has bought an ad in newspapers across Texas challenging Perry's manhood. The ad is pure cowboy machismo. It shows a big picture of Perry stamped with the word "Coward." And in a combination political attack and schoolyard taunt it declares: "Tell Rick Perry to stop cowering and face Texans like a man."

Like a man? Quienes mas macho, el Blanco o el Cabello? Perry campaign spokesman Mark Miner says the governor won't debate until White releases his income taxes from his years as deputy energy secretary in Washington in the early 1990s. The ad also chides Perry for not sitting down with newspaper editorial boards to discuss his record. Miner says the governor is too busy meeting with Texans to meet with editorial boards. The ad will appear Tuesday in nearly two dozen Texas newspapers. Harvey Kronberg's Quorum Report was first to report an ad was coming. Back to Basics is an independent political committee funded largely by a Houston trial lawyer, Steve Mostyn. It's already run three anti-Perry TV spots. The swaggering tone of the newspaper ad marks an escalation of the political rhetoric in the gubernatorial contest. And short of any newspaper getting cold feet and refusing to publish the word "Coward," it should give Texas voters their strongest sense yet of the direction of the rock 'em, sock 'em campaign.
