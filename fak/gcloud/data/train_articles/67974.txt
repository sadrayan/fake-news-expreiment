Highlights of Results fromTIMSS (Middle School Years)

The following are the main results in HTML format:

Key Findings

Singapore was the top-performing country in mathematics and science at both the eighth and seven th grades. Korea, Japan, and the Czech Republic also performed very well in both subjects. Hong Kong and the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium also were among the top countries in mathematics. (See pages 2 and 3 for a full listing of the results.)





For most countries, even though gender differences were minimal in mathematics, they were pervasive in science. Boys outperformed girls, particularly in physics, chemistry, and earth science.





Home factors were strongly related to mathematics and science achievement in every TIMSS country (i.e., educational resources, books in the home, and parents' education).





In almost every country, the majority of students agreed that they did well in mathematics and science. Interestingly, some of the countries with the highest achievement also were those whose students had the most negative perceptions of success -- Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong.

TIMSS Results About Teaching and Learning

Most countries reported that four years of post-secondary education, practice in teaching, and so me form of examination were required for teacher certification.





In many countries, students generally were in mathematics and science classes of fewer than 30 students. Korea was a notable exception, with most students in classes of 40 or more.





Mathematics teachers in many countries reported a high frequency of calculator use in their classes, often for checking answers, routine computation, and solving complex problems. Again, Korea was the exception, where it was reported that calculators were seldom used.





Teacher demonstrations of experiments were common in science classes regardless of whether eighth graders were taught science as a single subject or as separate science subjects, as is done in much of Europe.





Notwithstanding a considerable range in student reports, eighth graders in about half the countries reported doing an average of 2 or 3 hours of homework each day. Most typically, students reported studying mathematics for roughly an hour each day, and science for somewhat less than that.





Eighth graders in most countries reported spending as much out-of-school time each day in non-academic activities as they did in academic activities. Most frequently, students reported watching 1 or 2 hours of television each day as well as spending several hours playing or talking with friends, and nearly 2 hours playing sports. (Of course, for teenagers, these activities often occur simultaneously, such as watching television and talking with friends on the phone.)
