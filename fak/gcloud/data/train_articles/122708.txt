The Guns of Kennesaw
Darvin Purdy is Mayor of Kennesaw, Ga., and Robert Ruble is Chief of Police. The two are feeling expansive over an ordinance their City Council passed requiring all heads of households to own a gun and ammunition. It's a symbolic gesture, for the most part, a message to the criminals, Mayor Purdy suggests. And to soft-headed supporters of gun control, adds Chief Ruble.

The jovial officials turn more reticent when talk turns to crime statistics in their community of 7,000. Chief Ruble says overall crime in 1981 was up 16 percent from 1980. But you have to ask to find out the details. Armed robberies did soar - from one in 1980 to four in 1981. Homicides declined, from two in 1980 to none in 1981.

In fact it sounds like Kennesaw is a fairly safe place to live already. Are more guns going to make it safer? Mayor Purdy and Chief Ruble think so, but a lot of Yankee criminologists think otherwise.

They say that in Boston, the guns that most armed robbers equip themselves with are stolen. ... That in the two years after the 1967 Detroit riot, when thousands bought guns, deaths in handgun accidents increased by a number that exceeded those killed in the riot. ... That when off-duty police officers in New York City fire their guns, one time in four it's an accident, a suicide or an act of frustration. (''After a dispute with my wife, I went outside and fired 12 shots into a tree. ...'')

Kids are also a problem. Guns fascinate them. Like the 3-year-old in Mount Airy, Md., last year who came across his dad's .357 magnum in the bedroom. ''Is this what I pull, Mommy?'' he asked. Before she could say or do anything, he shot her through the chest.

Mayor Purdy, Chief Ruble and the Kennesaw City Council think it's fine for everyone to have a gun in the house to shoot criminals. The people who know something about it are sure that most of the time it won't be criminals who get shot.
