Voters still mad about lack of gun legislation
PPP's newest national poll finds on the 6th month anniversary of Newtown that voters are still angry with Congress over the lack of action on expanded background checks. They continue to have overwhelming bipartisan support with 71% of voters favoring them to only 22% who are opposed. That includes an 85/10 spread among Democrats, a 66/23 one with independents, and a 57/35 one with Republicans.

This still has the potential to be a major issue in next year's midterm elections. 51% of voters say they're less likely to support someone who voted against background checks next year to only 14% who say they would consider that a positive. Even among Republicans 30% say they'd be less inclined to vote for someone who opposed expanded background checks to 25% more likely, so this isn't even something that would be a particular salient issue for potential primary challengers.

Fear of the NRA seems to drive much of the opposition to gun legislation, but our polling continues to find its brand just isn't that strong with average voters. It has a narrowly positive favorability rating at 43/41. But 40% of voters say they're less likely to vote for an NRA supported candidate to only 28% who would be more likely to, suggesting there's a greater intensity of feeling among voters with a negative view of the organization.
