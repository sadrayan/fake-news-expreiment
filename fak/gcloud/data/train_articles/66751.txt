McLauchlan challenges Brandes to ‘debate,’ but they disagree on what that means
The opposing campaigns for Senate District 22 (Tampa, St. Petersburg) seem to have different ideas on what constitutes a “debate.”

Democrat Judithanne McLauchlan on Wednesday released a letter she sent to GOP incumbent Jeff Brandes, challenging him to a series of three debates.

“Voters deserve to hear where Sen. Brandes and I stand on a number of issues affecting Pinellas and Hillsborough counties,” said McLauchlan, a political science professor at University of South Florida St. Petersburg.

Chris Spencer, Brandes’ campaign manager, sounded confused when reached Wednesday afternoon.

“We already agreed to three debates,” he said, mentioning one at Tiger Bay Club of Tampa this Friday, a second at St. Petersburg College on Oct. 2, and a third the next day on Bay News 9’s Political Connections program.

Bay News 9 had to cancel, however, and will reschedule the candidates’ appearances, Spencer added.

Andy Bilyk, McLauchlan’s campaign manager, said those aren’t “debates.”

His idea is both candidates squaring off with a moderator asking questions.

“We want a debate, not a 30-second sound bite forum,” he told Fresh Squeezed. “We also want to focus on this senate race, not (be) in a forum with other races.”

Spencer declined further comment, referring back to his previous statement.

Brandes, a businessman and investor with a $14.1 million net worth, was elected to the Senate in 2012 after a term in the House.

He’s raised $568,000 toward his re-election, with in-kind donations of $261,000, campaign finance records show. He’s spent $386,000.

McLauchlan has raised $195,000, $58,000 in-kind and spent $76,000.

UPDATE: Bilyk adds that he spoke with Bay News 9, and was informed “the canceled Political Connections segment with Judithanne and Senator Brandes will not be rescheduled.”
