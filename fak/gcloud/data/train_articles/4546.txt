DENVER (CBS4) – RTD will open its first FasTracks line April 26 of next year, eight months ahead of schedule.

RTD General Manager Phil Washington stopped by the CBS4 Morning News to make the announcement.

We also talked about what you can expect to see over the next few months as construction continues on the project.

Watch the full interview below:

The West Rail Line will travel 12.1 miles from Union Station in Denver west to the Jefferson County Government Center in Golden. They expect the line to serve nearly 20,000 riders each weekday.

Parking structures at Wadsworth and Sheridan as well as 10 other locations will bring 5,600 new parking spaces.

RTD will hold the ground breaking for the Sheridan park-n-Ride June 29th.

Construction on the Wadsworth parking structure is already under way.

RTD officials say that not only is this project helping commuters, it’s helping the economy as well. They state that twelve ongoing FasTracks projects have created thousands of jobs.
