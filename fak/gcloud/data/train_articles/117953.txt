A Harry Potter Version of Pokémon Go Might Be Happening: Here Are More Mashups We're Dying to Play
The description of the game sounds like a really good time. "The possibilities are endless. In a Harry Potter augmented reality game, you could cast spells in real life. Accio Firebolt! And have a wizard duel with your friends, expelliarmus could disable their app for a few seconds! Who is your second?" That's not all. "With Harry Potter Go, you could search for the seven Horcruxes, and then for swords, and basilisk fangs to destroy them." Say no more.

That got us thinking. What if Pokémon Go was the start of a gaming trend? Just like everyone and their dog has their own emoji these days, will there soon be different versions (like Harry Potter Go, for example) of Pokémon Go? If so, we've rounded up a list of mashups that need to be a thing (just in case).
