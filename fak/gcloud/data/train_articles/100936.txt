Indian Air Force fighter jets struck the "biggest training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammad" in Balakot, the Centre said today. The strikes by the Indian Air Force (IAF) were carried out around 3:30 am by a dozen Mirage 2000 fighter jets.

The aircraft dropped 1,000 kg laser-guided bombs on terror training camps, completely destroying them, reports said.

"A large number of terrorists were eliminated... It was a non-military, pre-emptive strike," said Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale.

The IAF strikes come two week after the terror attack in Pulwama in which over 40 soldiers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed by a suicide bomber of the Jaish-e-Mohammed.

The Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for the February 14 attack and had also posted videos of the bomber, who had joined the terror group a year ago. India had earlier in September 2016 carried out surgical strikes on terror launch pads across the Line of Control in retaliation to an attack on an army base in Kashmir's Uri that month.
