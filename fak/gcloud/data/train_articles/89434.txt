PROVIDENCE, R.I. ��One day before Mayor Angel Taveras gives his final budget address and proposal for the city, a news release from the campaign staff of one of his gubernatorial opponents, General Treasurer Gina M. Raimondo, criticized the mayor for raising property taxes dramatically.

The email was entitled, �Just the Facts: As Providence families pay their property taxes, residential property taxes up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras.�

Using only the effective tax rates for city residents living in their houses, they contend the tax rate increased 26.7 percent � from $15.19 per $1,000 of assessed property in fiscal year 2011 to $19.25 per $1,000 of assessed property this current fiscal year.

�Providence property taxes are skyrocketing and placing a huge strain on the budgets of too many families,� Raimondo�s campaign manager, Eric Hyers, contended in the Monday news release.

He continued, �With Providence�s finances being compared to Detroit, which is bankrupt, this is not the kind of leadership that the state can afford right now.�

Taveras� campaign staff declared that Raimondo�s numbers are wrong.

�Treasurer Raimondo�s charge against the mayor is flat out false,� said Dawn Bergantino, communications director for Taveras� campaign. �That may be fine on Wall Street, but it doesn�t work here in Rhode Island. This is just another example of how she will say anything, including mislead voters, in order to get elected.�

The Taveras campaign contends the average property bill increased by about 6 percent in this fiscal year, and not Raimondo�s 20.7 percent claim because her campaign staff failed to factor in the recent revaluation. The revaluation caused property values to collectively drop by 13.2 percent.

Providence Journal stories show in his inaugural year in office, 2011, the City Council approved a budget that raised the residential tax rate by nearly five percent. It was a decrease from Taveras� proposed tax-rate hike of 13.5 percent.

Taveras recommended, and the council approved, keeping the rates the same the following year.

Last year, he and the council froze the commercial, tangible and motor vehicle rates as one of several planned measures to help businesses and boost the city economy. As a result, the property-tax burden shifted more toward the homeowners.

The new residential rates are also higher than last year�s effective tax rates, and all the changes were complicated by the revaluation. The end result was many received higher tax bills, but some homeowners received significantly higher tax bills and others saw a reduction.

That�s because while the value of the city�s taxable property dropped 13.2 percent overall, the reduction differed greatly when broken down by neighborhood and types of homes � such as single-family, multifamily and condominiums.

Taveras� budget address will be given at 6 p.m. Tuesday in City Hall.
