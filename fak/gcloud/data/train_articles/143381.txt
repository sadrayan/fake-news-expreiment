4.0 out of 5 stars Well-written volume even if subject matter is often shocking, December 31, 2007

This is one of the most intense volumes in the WWII series. Be prepared for violent and unpleasant stories.Included are the usual Time-Life collection of hundreds of photographs, illustrations, artwork, and maps that supplement clear and interesting narratives.
