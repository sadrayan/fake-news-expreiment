The Baby Train and Other Lusty Urban Legends: Jan Harold Brunvand: 9780393312089: Amazon.com: Books
TheBaby Train and Other Lusty Urban Legends, when picking upthis book I had no idea what it was. All I knew is that title took hold of myattention and I was lost in the book. This book is one many urban legend quickreads. What's best about this one is that there are so many that can be closeto home or some that we already may have heard of. This is one out five urbanlegend books written by the Jan Harold Brunvard. A lot of the others includingthis one are said to be repetitive. Although this may be true and hard tofollow it helped me understand that some of the written legends can be debatablytrue.



I wouldn't recommendthis book to anyone who doesn't have interest in how cultures can connect oranyone who is looking for an easy quick read. Although it is very easy tocomprehend. As I read I decided to readsome of them to my mother. In doing sosparked her curiosity and how she could connect to some of these stories. Idon't want to go into deep detail on the author because the way the authorwrites speaks for itself. The stories areentertaining and the author's observations are illuminating. Professor Brunvandprovides an informative and entertaining account of urban legends (or urbanmyths). I recommend that readers also read his other books about urban legends. Whether you believe in urban legends or notthis a read that I highly recommend along with all the other books by ProfessorBrunvard.
