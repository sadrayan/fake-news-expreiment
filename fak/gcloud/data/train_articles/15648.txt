This is the best I could do: Attached is EIA’s most recent capital cost worksheet on different types of generation. It’s from 2013, but I don’t think much has changed with wind and fossil fuel cap costs. It shows wind having pretty low capital costs, but it doesn’t take into account the capacity factor – coal generally can run 88% of the time if economic conditions allow it; wind is more like 30% or less, depending on conditions.

Hope this is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
