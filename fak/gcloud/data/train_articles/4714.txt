Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau

Engrossment information:

The text of Engrossed 2013 Assembly Bill 85 consists of the bill, as passed by

the assembly on May 8, 2013, as affected by the following Assembly Amendments

adopted in the assembly on April 17, 2013: Assembly Amendments 1, 2, and 3.

Content of Engrossed 2013 Assembly Bill 85:

Under current law, in a county with a population of at least 500,000 (presently

only Milwaukee County), county board supervisors are paid an annual salary that

is set by the board. In general, county board supervisors may receive other benefits

such as life and health insurance, and supervisors in counties other than Milwaukee

County are paid a per diem by the county for each day that the supervisor attends

a county board meeting. Current law provides a maximum number of days for which

a supervisor may receive such per diem payments, ranging from 20 to 30 days, based

on the population of the county.

Subject to approval by the electors in a referendum to be held in Milwaukee

County in April 2014, under this bill, county board supervisors in a county with a

population of at least 500,000 may be paid an annual salary that may not exceed the

annual per capita income of Milwaukee County, as determined by the U.S. Bureau

of the Census, beginning with the term that commences in April 2016. Currently, the

county's per capita annual income is approximately $24,000. Under the bill, a

Milwaukee County supervisor may not receive any additional compensation or

benefits, including health insurance and pension benefits, that are not authorized

or required by law, although the bill authorizes the board to provide the board

chairperson additional compensation, such that his or her salary may be up to 150

percent of the salary paid to a supervisor. The board may also provide the

chairperson of the finance committee additional compensation such that his or her

salary may be up to 125 percent of the salary paid to a supervisor. The board may

increase a supervisor's salary by the rate of inflation or, subject to approval by the

electors in a referendum, at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. In no case,

however, may the salary of a supervisor, other than the board chairperson and

finance committee chairperson, exceed the annual per capita income of Milwaukee

County, as determined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

Currently, Milwaukee County employees are covered under the Milwaukee

County Employee's Retirement System (MCERS), a retirement system established

for a county having a population of 500,000 or more. MCERS is not part of the

Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS), but is a separate retirement system.

The bill provides that no individual who is receiving an annuity under an

employee retirement system of a county having a population of 500,000 or more and

who is reemployed by the county may continue to receive the annuity if a similarly

situated individual who is receiving an annuity under WRS and who was reemployed

by a participating employer under that system would be required to terminate the

annuity. This provision first applies to individuals who terminate employment on

or after the bill's effective date.

Under current law, the term of a Milwaukee County supervisor is four years.

Under the bill, beginning with the spring election in 2016, the term of such a

supervisor is two years.

Subject to a number of exceptions, the bill also limits the Milwaukee County

board's expenditures for expenses related to the county board, such as salaries and

fringe benefits of county board members, costs for staff, and certain items related to

the functioning of the board, to no more than 0.4 percent of the county portion of the

property tax levy. Items not subject to this 0.4 percent limit are costs related to

pension and health care payments for retired county employees, officers, and their

families; salaries, health benefits, and pension benefits for supervisors and the

county board chairperson for a term that begins before April 2016; and certain costs

related to duties performed by the Milwaukee County clerk.

Generally under current law, a county executive has the authority to direct all

administrative and management functions of county government that are not vested

by law in other elected officers. The Milwaukee County executive is further

authorized to appoint and supervise the heads of all departments, unless otherwise

provided by law, and the department heads are generally authorized to supervise the

administration of their departments. Current law also generally authorizes a county

board to exercise any organizational or administrative power that is not given to a

county executive or administrator, or such a person's subordinate. The bill makes

a number of changes which clarify or increase the authority of the Milwaukee County

executive and limits and clarifies certain authority of the Milwaukee County board.

With regard to the powers of the Milwaukee County executive and board, the

bill does the following:

1. Except for a specific statutory provision which states otherwise, authorizes

the county executive to administer, supervise, and direct all county departments,

including any person who lobbies for, or negotiates on behalf of, the county.

2. Authorizes the county executive to establish departments and subunits of

the departments, subject to the approval of the board, that the executive believes are

necessary for the efficient administration of the county. This authority is subject to

board approval of the county executive department budget.

3. For a contract with the county to be valid, requires the county executive to

sign all contracts on behalf of the county to the extent that no other county officer or

employee is required to sign them, and the county executive must countersign all

other contracts. Under current law, and under the bill, contracts with the county

must also be countersigned by the comptroller and corporation counsel.

4. The county executive may introduce proposed ordinances and resolutions for

consideration by the board, call a special meeting of the board with the approval of

the county board chairperson, and hire and supervise the number of employees that

he or she believes are necessary to carry out his or her duties, subject to compliance

with hiring policies set by the board.

5. The county board is prohibited from creating a county department or subunit

of a department, and may not exercise day-to-day control of any county department

or subunit of a department. Such control may be exercised only by the county

executive.

6. Except for making an inquiry, referring a specific constituent concern, or

using legal services of the corporation counsel, the supervisors may deal with county

departments solely through the county executive, and no supervisor may give

instructions or orders to any subordinate of the county executive, although the board

may require any county employee or officer to attend a board meeting to provide

information and answer questions.

7. Although the board may generally set the salary and compensation level of

county employees, the bill prohibits the board from lowering the salary, terminating,

or eliminating the position of any county employee who works in the office of the

county executive, unless such changes affect all county employees in all county

departments. This prohibition does not apply after the supervisors who are elected

in the spring 2016 election take office.

8. Permits only the county executive to bargain collectively with county

employees.

The bill creates a new approval process for contracts to which a populous county

(a county with a population of at least 750,000) is a party. Under the bill, a contract

with a value of between $100,000 and $300,000 is subject to passive review, meaning

that the contract may take effect unless the board's finance committee votes to reject

the contract within 14 days of the county executive signing or countersigning the

contract. If the finance committee rejects the contract, it may still take effect if the

entire board approves the contract within 30 days of the committee's rejection. A

contract with a value of more than $300,000 may take effect only if it is approved by

the entire board.

Under current law, a county board may schedule an advisory referendum or a

referendum on the question of ratification of an ordinance or resolution of the county

board. This bill prohibits the Milwaukee County Board from scheduling a

referendum on any matter that is subject to the approval of the electors of a county

under this bill to be held concurrently with the election at which the question of

approval is presented to the electors.

Under current law, the state, regional planning commissions, federally

recognized Indian tribes and bands, and local units of government, including

municipalities, counties, school districts, and other special purpose districts, may

enter into intergovernmental cooperation agreements for the receipt or furnishing

of services or joint exercise of powers. Under another provision of current law, a

county and a city, village, or town (municipality), may enter into a contract to

consolidate municipal services under which the county renders such services to the

contracting municipality, either exclusively by the county or jointly with the

municipality.

Under this bill, before such a contract, or before an intergovernmental

cooperation agreement with a value of more than $300,000, between a county with

a population of 750,000 or more (presently only Milwaukee County) and another

local unit of government may take effect and become binding on such a county, the

contract or agreement must be approved by an executive council. The bill defines

executive council as a body that consists of the mayor of a first class city (presently

only Milwaukee) and the mayor or village president of every city and village that is

wholly located within that county and is based on a current law provision that is used

to select four members of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage Commission.

This bill repeals an obsolete provision of civil procedure governing judgments

entered before the first Monday in January 1962 in the civil court of Milwaukee or

in any court which ceased to function on that date, or in any court functioning under

ch. 254 of the 1959 Wisconsin Statutes.

This bill also removes certain authority currently possessed by the Milwaukee

County board. Under the bill, the board may no longer do any of the following:

appropriate money for planning or participating in a world festival celebration or any

similar program designed to promote international commerce and culture; own and

operate a professional baseball team, and maintain a nonprofit corporation for such

ownership or operation; require licenses for cats; and let a contract for the

design-build construction of a sheriff's department training academy.

Under current law, a county board has general authority to acquire, lease, or

rent real and personal property. Under this bill, in Milwaukee County, such

authority is exercised by the county executive, consistent with established county

board policy, although the sale or lease of property is subject to a simple approval or

rejection by the county board.

The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do

enact as follows:
