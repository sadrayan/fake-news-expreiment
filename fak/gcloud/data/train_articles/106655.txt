Olivia Newton-John is clinging to life in the hopes she can see her only child, Chloe Lattanzi, marry in the new year! Ravaged by a spreading and incurable cancer, songbirdis clinging to life in the hopes she can see her only child,, marry in the new year!

“Olivia’s bodily functions appear to be shutting down , but she refuses to let go until she makes it through Chloe’s wedding day!�? a source exclusively spilled to RadarOnline.com.

Insiders revealed the 70-year-old “Grease�? icon, who was hit with a devastating stage 4 cancer diagnosis in 2017 , has continued to stun doctors by staving off what is almost a definite death sentence!

John Easterling and Chloe as they prepare for her secret wedding to longtime fiancé James Driskill. Chloe has been with the martial arts expert since 2009 and they announced their engagement a year later. The gutsy “Let’s Get Physical�? singer has committed to spending her final days at her Santa Barbara, Calif. , ranch with hubbyand Chloe as they prepare for her secret wedding to longtime fiancé. Chloe has been with the martial arts expert since 2009 and they announced their engagement a year later.

“I refuse to die in a hospital room . I’ll go on my own terms, in our home and in my own bed — but not until Chloe says, ‘I do,’�? the “Xanadu�? star told a close pal.

Newton-John’s illness brought her closer than ever to the 32-year-old daughter who followed in her beloved mother’s footsteps as a singer and actress.

“Seeing me with James has brought her a lot of joy. She is thrilled I’ve found my soul mate,�? said Chloe, who has stayed by Olivia’s side as she continues her courageous fight for life.

The British-born star’s cancer nightmare began in 1992 when she found a lump in her right breast. At the time, she had a modified radical mastectomy, followed by reconstructive surgery.

Sadly, the dreaded disease returned and spread to her shoulder in 2013 and then again in 2017, this time to the bones in her back — forcing her to cancel a U.S. and Canadian tour!

Desperate for a cure, Newton-John tried homegrown marijuana, relying on cannabis oil to ease her increasing pain. She also turned to kitten therapy — watching frolicking felines as a feel-good cure-all to supplement more traditional photon radiation treatments.

But the heartbreaking news that the disease had spread has led to a grim prognosis from top doctors, who are amazed the plucky pop star has continued to endure!

“Bone metastasis is an ominous sign,�? said Dr. Stuart Fischer, who had not treated Newton-John. “This can’t be helped by chemotherapy.

“It is unlikely that any treatment could be beneficial.�?

“Stage 4 cancer itself is not curable, and the long-term survival rate is less than 10 percent,�? noted renowned longevity expert Dr. Gabe Mirkin, who has also not treated Newton-John.

“If the breast cancer spread to the bones in her back, it can spread to the other organs in her body. That includes the brain, lungs and liver.

“She almost certainly is going to die!�?

Given her family history, the odds are stacked against the sickly singer. Her father, Brinley Newton-John, died of liver cancer in 1992 and her sister, Rona, succumbed to brain cancer in 2013.

Still, Newton-John bravely battles on, according to Chloe, who has made it her mission to see her mom make it to her wedding!

After Olivia’s initial diagnosis, Chloe admitted, “I became extremely protective of her. I was scared I might lose her at any moment!�?

Now, a source close to the loving mother and daughter duo said, “Chloe can’t wait for the wedding herself because she fears her mom may not be around much longer.

“They’re planning to have it at the ranch, not long after New Year’s. Everyone’s praying that Olivia will be there to enjoy the celebration.�?
