Starbucks' (Nasdaq: SBUX) roastery is seen by some on Capitol Hill as a sign of the continued gentrification of the city and of the neighborhood in particular.

In recent years, May Day protests in Seattle have turned violent and closed down commerce in the downtown core.

On Friday, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said the “city is open for business.” His office issued a statement Friday afternoon saying officials are working to ensure peaceful protests.

“At this time, based on what we know about today’s protests, the city has not advised any business to change its hours of operation,” the statement said. "All Seattle businesses make their own independent decisions about hours of operation.”

Starbucks opened the roastery in December. The store nearly always is packed with customers. The company plans to build more around the world.
