McPizza
was a pizza product that McDonald's attempted starting in the 1980's.The pizza originally began as a family-sized pizza that was brought out to the table by an employee and placed on a raised rack in the centre of the table. Later it was scaled down to a personal-sized pizza. By 1991, the McDonald's test markets for pizza had grown to over 500 McDonald's locations before the pizza test was placed on hold. Pizza was discontinued in most restaurants by 2000. The reason for eliminating the pizza from the menu was that the time to cook a pizza took 11 minutes, and McDonalds wanted to keep its reputation for fast service. As of April 2018, McDonald's pizza is only available at McDonald's located in Orlando.
