About Us
The North American Mission Board is an entity supported by the generous contributions of Southern Baptists with the goal of seeing the gospel change lives and communities. NAMB assists churches with evangelistic church planting strategy, the identification and training of missionaries, chaplains and church planters through the Send Network, and helps churches impact their communities through Send Relief. NAMB accomplishes this by serving in cooperation with churches, associations, state conventions, other national SBC entitles and the Canadian National Baptist Convention.
