Luther Strange Lays Out Alabama's Clear Choice



“Voters have a clear choice in this election: President Trump’s conservative fighter, Luther Strange, who has a record of taking on the swamp, or another hypocritical politician, Roy Moore, who has spent 40 years putting himself and his ambition ahead of Alabamians.”

Birmingham, Ala. - Voters have a clear choice in the September 26 Republican primary runoff election. Luther Strange has a record of draining the Montgomery swamp and putting corrupt politicians behind bars. Roy Moore, on the other hand, has spent the last forty years running for political office and putting his own ambitions ahead of Alabamians’ well-being.

FACT: As Attorney General, Big Luther created the Special Prosecution Division and successfully convicted corrupt officials – included the Republican State Speaker of the House – who were removed from office and/or jailed.[i]

FACT: Because of his success draining the Montgomery swamp, corrupt politicians tried to shut Big Luther down, gutting the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) budget and passing a law that would have given legislators the ability to block specific AGO operations and investigations.[ii]

FACT: Big Luther opposes career politicians and supports term limits.

FACT: Roy Moore has been running for office since he first ran for an Etowah County circuit judge seat in 1982 as a Democrat.

FACT: Roy Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts had to shut down because of lack of funding.[iii]

FACT: Roy Moore has made a career out of profiting off of public service and sticking tax payers with the bill. [iv]

Luther Strange is the only candidate in this race that has a record of delivering conservative reform and protecting rule of law. That is why President Donald Trump has endorsed him. He has said Big Luther is “tough on crime and borders,” and he knows will be a vital ally for him in his goal to drain the swamp and make America and Alabama great. Roy Moore has a record of putting his own ambitions ahead of what was best for Alabama. Our great state cannot afford another career politician.
