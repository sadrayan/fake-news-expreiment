Folks:

A reader recently brought to our attention this statement attributed to Sen. Cruz in July 2014: Every year we spend roughly 500 billion dollars on tax compliance. That is roughly the budget of our entire military, entirely wasted on tax compliance.???

Did Cruz say this, as quoted? If so, what was his basis?

Thanks.

I’ve missed you so. I was wondering when you might reemerge and here you have not disappointed me. Yes, I will once again play your tediously rigged game even though I am privately convinced that your “truth” meter does not actually move from its seemingly singular position - might want to have that checked. Nevertheless, I am freely offering evidence, even though I am confident that you are perfectly capable of looking it up for yourself, to support the Senator’s statement which I suspect, despite my aversion to pessimism, you will either ignore or torture. But I remain in good cheer and hope your are well.

The Mercatus Research 2013 Report: "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF TAX COMPLIANCE" (attached) concluded, "We estimate that hidden costs of tax compliance range from $215 billion to $987 billion annually”.

The Laffer Center 2011 Report: "The Economic Burden Caused by Tax Code Complexity (attached) concludes, "In our analysis we estimate that U.S. taxpayers pay $431.1 billion annually”.

According to the CBO, "The Department of Defense's (DoD's) base budget grew from $384 billion to $502 billion between fiscal years 2000 and 2014 in inflation-adjusted (real) terms”.

$500 billion is comfortably in the range of the negative economic impact of tax compliance and the military’s historical budget.

I, stipulating that you are the truth arbiter, look forward to your judgement call.

Those studies seemnigly top out at $431 billion in compliance costs. If you know of others that informed the senator, fire at me.

Thanks.

Rick:

I didn’t hear back. Meantime, it looks to us like the senator understated military costs (which all told totaled $866 billion in 2014, counting war costs) while shooting high on compliance costs; the declared equivalence isn’t supported. I hope to post our fact check soon.
