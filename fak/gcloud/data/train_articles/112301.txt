Feminist suggests we use Euthanasia Vans to weed out OLD people!
Katie Hopkins, a British television personality and former The Apprentice contestant, is a classic example of the insane liberal thinking.

According to her, old people should be euthanized because they are too much of a burden to society.

She has even developed a whole scenario for her sick idea…

Hopkins suggests that we create “euthanasia vans” that would drive door-to-door and ‘takes care’ of the elderly.

“We just have far too many old people,” the feminist says. “It’s ridiculous to be living in a country where we can put dogs to sleep but not people.” “Euthanasia vans — just like ice-cream vans — that would come to your home,” Hopkins says. “It would all be perfectly charming. They might even have a nice little tune they’d play. I mean this genuinely. I’m super-keen on euthanasia vans. We need to accept that just because medical advances mean we can live longer, it’s not necessarily the right thing to do.”
