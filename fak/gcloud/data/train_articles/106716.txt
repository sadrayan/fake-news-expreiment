Car Repossessed, He Kills 7 : Gunman a Suicide After Rampage in Jacksonville
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. â€” A man whose car had been repossessed methodically gunned down customers and employees at a GM financing agency today, killing seven people and critically wounding six others before committing suicide, police said.

"He just started walking through the building and shooting," Jacksonville Sheriff James McMillan said.

The gunman used a .30-caliber semiautomatic rifle and a .38-caliber revolver in the shootings, and may be connected with two other weekend shootings using the same kind of rifle, authorities said. Police identified him as James Edward Pough, 42, of Jacksonville.

"It's just a terrible, terrible, senseless thing," McMillan said.

The shootings occurred inside the General Motors Acceptance Corp. building at the Baymeadows Office Park just before 11 a.m., said Jacksonville police Sgt. Steve Weintraub. GMAC is the car-financing arm of the General Motors Corp. McMillan said the man's car had been repossessed.

The sheriff said the man went up to the counter, shot a customer and then began walking through the office shooting his weapons. Most of the shots apparently came from the rifle, McMillan said.
