Confirmed: McCain Leaked the Golden Showers Dossier

RUSH: And here’s a story… We knew this, but it’s great to have it confirmed. John McCain was the source of the dossier that NewsFeed, NewsBuzz got and published. If you remember the history of the dossier, the Trump dossier, the golden showers story where Trump found out he was in the same hotel room that Michelle (My Belle) and Barack Obama had used, and so the story goes that Trump called and hired some prostitutes to come over and urinate on the bed. It was called “the golden showers” story.

It’s totally bogus. (sigh) It’s ridiculous. That story’s in the Trump dossier. It’s one of the highlights. Well, that story, the dossier was running around Washington all during the summer of 2015, the fall of 2015 into 2016. All the Drive-Bys had it, but nobody ran it because it had not been verified. And then all of a sudden one day, BuzzFeed did. BuzzFeed ran it in toto. They published the dossier in toto, and they admitted none of it had been corroborated. None of it could be! None of it have been verified. None of it could be!

But, NewsFeed, NewsBuzz… What is it? BuzzFeed thought that it was so important that you had to know that it was out there. So they ran it in its entirety. Well, what’s been confirmed is that John McCain sent somebody… We knew he’d sent somebody to the U.K. when he heard about the dossier, because he hated Trump. He sent somebody to get it and McCain is who furnished the dossier to BuzzFeed for it to be published. Well, it was one of his aides, but McCain saw to it that this happened.

“A longtime associate of late Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain provided a copy of the … Steele dossier to BuzzFeed News, according to an explosive court filing released Wednesday. David Kramer, a former State Department official who was an executive at the McCain Institute, met on December 29, 2016 with BuzzFeed reporter Ken Bensinger, according to a filing submitted Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Ursula Ungaro. BuzzFeed published the dossier, which was authored by former British spy Christopher Steele, on January 10, 2017.” Blah, blah, blah, blah.
