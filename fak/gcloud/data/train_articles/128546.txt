New Fraudulent Email Circulating
Service Update

Fraudulent emails adopt many different forms and are the unauthorized actions of third parties not associated with UPS. These email messages referred to as "phishing" or "spoofing" are becoming more common and may appear legitimate by incorporating company brands, colors, or other legal disclaimers.



There have been a number of fraudulent emails reported (see a current list of examples below), and new spoofs continue to be introduced. These types of emails point to invalid hyperlinks that are revealed when you hold your cursor over them. The invalid links may contain malware, which could potentially corrupt your computer.



These are not legitimate UPS communications, and should you receive any of these emails, do not follow any links provided or click on any attachments. Instead, simply delete the email. If you've accidentally selected a link, you should run a virus scan immediately.
