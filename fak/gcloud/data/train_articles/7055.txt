HRAGI.ORG – The Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation
The Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (“HRAGI”), is a non-governmental organization established in Washington, DC to help restart American adoption of Russian children.

Three years ago, the fate of 250 children was thrown into uncertainty after Russia passed a law prohibiting Americans from adopting children in Russia. The children would have added to the impressive number – more than 60,000 – of Russian children adopted by American families following the collapse of Communism. Some of the blocked adoptions were taken up by Russian families – while other children were adopted overseas. But some got sick and others reportedly died.
