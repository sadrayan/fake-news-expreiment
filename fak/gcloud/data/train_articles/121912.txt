Seven news battleground polls, seven states where Hillary Clinton holds a lead against Donald Trump.

Those are the results from the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls, which found Hillary Clinton ahead in Iowa (by four points), Ohio (by five), Florida (by five), North Carolina (by nine), Pennsylvania (by 11), Virginia (by 13) and Colorado (by 14).

If those poll numbers hold with another three months to go until Election Day 2016, Trump won’t have a realistic path to 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.

But there are four other takeaways from the new battleground polling. Call them the four different gaps:

1. The Education Gap

With one exception (Florida), Clinton is leading in every battleground among college-educated white voters, while she’s losing among whites without a college degree. Why is this significant? As the Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein has noted, no Democratic presidential candidate going back to 1952 has won among college-educated whites. (All poll numbers below are among registered voters)

Colorado

Whites with a college degree: Clinton 55%, Trump 23% (D+32)

Whites without: Trump 43%, Clinton 32% (R+11)

Florida

Whites with a college degree: Trump 42%, Clinton 40% (R+2)

Whites without: Trump 50%, Clinton 32% (R+18)

Iowa

Whites with a college degree: Clinton 56%, Trump 25% (D+31)

Whites without: Trump 42%, Clinton 35% (R+7)

North Carolina

Whites with a college degree: Clinton 47%, Trump 40% (D+7)

Whites without: Trump 60%, Clinton 23% (R+37)

Ohio

Whites without: Trump 49%, Clinton 31% (R+18)

Pennsylvania

Whites with a college degree: Clinton 53%, Trump 32% (D+21)

Whites without: Trump 50%, Clinton 34% (R+16)

Virginia

2. The Urban-vs.-Rural Gap

Relatedly, Clinton is drubbing Trump in urban areas and suburbs, while Trump is ahead in rural areas. The problem for Trump: For the most part, there are many more voters in these urban areas than rural ones.
