40% of Louisiana state senators voted against making bestiality a crime—because they're homophobic
Top row left to right: homophobic, homophobic, homophobic, homophobic, homophobic. Bottom row ...

On Tuesday, the state senate of Louisiana voted to make bestiality against the law. The vote was 25-10. Why would ten people vote against making bestiality a crime? Maybe they’re super free spirits that believe the government shouldn’t make those kinds of decisions? No. Not even close. It’s because they’re homophobic.

A law on the books prohibits "crimes against nature," but it also outlaws so-called sodomy and was ruled unconstitutional in 2003. [...] The measure does also specify that previously illegal forms of "sodomy" are no longer against the law. "Anal sexual intercourse between two human beings shall not be deemed as a crime," part of the bill states.

The Louisiana state senate is comprised of 25 Republicans and 14 Democrats. That means 40 percent of the state’s senate republicans voted against making bestiality a crime. The list of “Nays” can be seen here. All 10 are Republicans, and all 10 consider bestiality less problematic morally than homosexuality or oral sex. Their names are:
