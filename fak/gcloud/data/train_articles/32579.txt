Here are the new tax brackets in the GOP plan
As part of the tax overhaul, House Republicans are cutting the current income tax brackets to four.

Currently, there are seven tax brackets: 10 percent, 15, percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.

Under the House bill, The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there will be four: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent, according to The Wall Street Journal. The bill roughly doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married couples.
