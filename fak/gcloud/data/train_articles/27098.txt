Christine Blasey Ford Has Record of Questionable Integrity – Kavanaugh and Gorsuch Went to Same School

Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are working overtime to delay Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.

On Thursday, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) referred a mysterious letter about Kavanaugh to the FBI.

Feinstein had been holding on to the letter since July. The woman who wrote the letter, Christine Blasey Ford, accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault — 36 years ago!

Feinstein only decided to drop the letter as a last resort.

Both of President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, Kavanaugh and confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch, are both graduates of Georgetown Prep. Brett Kavanaugh graduated two years before Gorsuch.

It turns out the woman who sent the letter to Democrat lawmakers – Christine Blasey Ford – is a far-left activist.

She also has questionable integrity.

Senator Feinstein admitted on Tuesday that she “can’t say that everything is truthful” about the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh brought forth by far-left activist Christine Ford.

Christine Blasey Ford went to Holton-Arms High School.

The letter of support to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the Holton-Arms Alumnae page was recently taken down.

There are rumblings that Ford also accused Gorsuch of abuse. But there is no evidence to support this.
