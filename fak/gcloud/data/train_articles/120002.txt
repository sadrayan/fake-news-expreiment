Las Vegas man 'excited' to sell testicle for $35,000 as part of medical trial
A Las Vegas man has said he is "excited" and "anxious" at the prospect of selling one of his testicles for $35,000 (£22,000) and having it replaced as part of a medical trial.

Mark Parisi told TLC network's programme 'Extreme Cheapskates' that he hoped to be accepted onto a medical trial where his testicle would be removed and replaced by an artificial one.

He has already taken part in paid medical studies, including one that involved the Ebola virus, where Mr Parisi was paid $5,000 and monitored for a week in an experiment never tested on humans or animals before.

His willingness to participate in medical trials is party motivated by the access to free medical check ups they provide him, which can cost upwards of $700.

He also told the broadcaster that he had been hoping to participate in a "flatline" medical trial, which would involve stopping his heart from beating momentarily, but the US Food and Drug Administration prevented the study from proceeding.

“What they do is they stop your heart for one minute, but you still breathe. Stay there 14 days, pays $25,000. But the FDA kind of stepped in and stopped that,” he explained.

The episode is due to air on the TLC network on Wednesday.
