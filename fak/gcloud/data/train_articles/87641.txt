Aaron Sandusky, who federal prosecutors said used the Ã¢Â€Âœperceived ambiguityÃ¢Â€Â? of CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s medical marijuana laws to create an illegal, for-profit operation that included a cultivation warehouse in Ontario and dispensaries in Moreno Valley, Upland and Colton, was sentenced to 10 years in prison Monday, Jan. 7.

Sandusky, 42, of Rancho Cucamonga, was the co-founder and owner of G3 Holistics. He was convicted in October of conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute hundreds of pounds of marijuana, prosecutors said. The amount was derived from the juryÃ¢Â€Â™s finding that each count involved at least 1,000 marijuana plants.

Investigators alleged G3 used California's medical marijuana laws as a cover for an illegal grow-and-sell operation instead of a nonprofit cultivation collective for those with a doctorÃ¢Â€Â™s recommendation to use marijuana, as allowed by CaliforniaÃ¢Â€Â™s Prop. 215 and subsequent state laws regulating medical marijuana.

Federal prosecutors in California said in late 2011 they would begin investigating dispensary operations they believed were skirting the stateÃ¢Â€Â™s regulations.

Under federal law, marijuana is an illegal drug in all circumstances.

Federal agents and other investigators claimed those who became G3 customers were not involved in cultivation. Instead, the supply of marijuana came from the growing operation in the Ontario warehouse.

In a civil forfeiture complaint, the government claimed that a forensic investigation by the IRS identified 19 bank accounts linked to G3 Holistics Inc. or individuals connected with it. The accounts had received $3.3 million in deposits during an eight-month period in 2011, with withdrawals nearly equaling that amount. The IRS concluded it was to make G3 appear to be a nonprofit organization.

Government attorneys said in a sentencing memorandum that Sandusky had no altruistic goals in establishing G3 Holistics, but instead used it to replace the income he lost in the collapse of his real estate business.

Sandusky sought probation in the sentencing before U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson in a downtown Los Angeles federal court.

SanduskyÃ¢Â€Â™s attorney claimed in court papers that his client believed he was operating within the law. He also said it was federal authorities who had been ambiguous about how they would apply drug statutes in states such as California where medical marijuana had been authorized.

But the U.S. attorneyÃ¢Â€Â™s office said Sandusky Ã¢Â€Âœbuilt a veneer of legitimacy around his criminal enterprise, using his customersÃ¢Â€Â™ good-faith search for pain relief,Ã¢Â€Â? according to a memo filed for MondayÃ¢Â€Â™s sentencing. It called Sandusky an Ã¢Â€Âœunrepentant manipulator.Ã¢Â€Â?

SanduskyÃ¢Â€Â™s attorney said the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s sentencing memorandum disregarded statements from authorities, including President Barack Obama and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, that led Sandusky to believe federal agents would not pursue prosecution of medical marijuana dispensaries.

Sandusky also had cooperated with the FBI in an unrelated corruption investigation in Upland, and Sandusky had been open with authorities regarding his G3 operation, attorney Roger Jon Diamond wrote.

Ã¢Â€ÂœSandusky has always accepted responsibility for what he did with respect to medical marijuana. He never denied involvement. He readily admitted involvement. Therefore he accepted responsibility and should have been given a credit for that,Ã¢Â€Â? DiamondÃ¢Â€Â™s filing said.

Federal authorities said the U.S. attorneyÃ¢Â€Â™s office sent Sandusky a warning in October 2011 that the G3 stores were operating illegally.
