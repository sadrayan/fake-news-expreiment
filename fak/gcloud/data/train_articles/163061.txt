President Kenyatta has ordered all striking nurses to resume work by Friday 8am.



In a stern address from State House Nairobi after a meeting with Council of Governors, Mr Kenyatta on Wednesday directed the Health ministry and county governments to fire caregivers who will defy directive.



The courts, he said, have suspended the strike "and court orders must be obeyed by all Kenyans".
