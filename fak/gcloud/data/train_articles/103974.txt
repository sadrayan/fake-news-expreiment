Hey, I’m not sure what it is either but residents in Santa Fe, Argentina claim the creature was 7-feet-tall and resembled some sort of horse/chupacabra hybrid. Neighbors reported the creature walked on four long, spindly legs with a face that appeared rabbit-like. The curiosity turned to nightmare when the beast killed two neighborhood dogs – a large German Shepherd and a Pitbull. One witness said “it blew my mind because it looked at us, then turned and walked away” – then proceeded to jump off its back two legs, easily clearing a 15-20 foot wall.

Argentinians say the animal is called ASWANG and believe it to be a demon that can transform and take on various animal shapes.
