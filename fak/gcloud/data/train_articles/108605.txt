How To Select The Best Bell Pepper Depending On Its Use
Describing peppers as a “gender” is not accurate, because bell peppers are hermaphroditic. The gender reference is used only as a memory aid to help select the best bell pepper for each purpose – either eating raw, seed collection, or for cooking. There is a simple method for identifying which bell pepper has the traits you desire. Peppers with four lobes are “female” and those with three lobes are “male”. The “female” peppers with more lobes, contain more seeds are best for seed collecting and growing new plants (hence “female”). They are also sweeter when eaten raw. The “male” peppers with three or fewer lobes are better for grilling, cooking. They also contain fewer seeds.
