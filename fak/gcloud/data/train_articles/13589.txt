WASHINGTON – Arianna Jones, a spokeswoman for Bernie Sanders, issued the following statement on Tuesday in response to Chelsea Clinton’s attack on Sanders’ health care plan:

“It is time for the United States to join the rest of the industrialized world and provide health care as a right to every man, woman and child. A Medicare-for-all plan will save the average middle-class family $5,000 a year. Further, the Clinton campaign is wrong. Our plan will be implemented in every state in the Union regardless of who is governor.”
