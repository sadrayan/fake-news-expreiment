Background to “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections”: The Analytic Process and Cyber

Incident Attribution

“Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections” is a declassif

ied version of a highly classified assessment that has been provided to the President and to recipients approved by the President.



The Intelligence Community rarely can publicly reveal the full extent of its knowledge or the precise bases for its assessments, as the release of such information would reveal sensitive sources or methods and imperil the ability to collect critical foreign intelligence in the future.



Thus, while the conclusions in the report are all reflected in the classified assessment, the declassified report does not and cannot include the full supporting information, including specific intelligence and sources and methods.

The Analytic Process

The mission of the Intelligence Community is to seek to reduce the uncertainty surrounding foreign

activities, capabilities, or leaders’ in tentions. This objective is difficult to achieve when seekin g to

understand complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to hide or obfuscate their activities.



On these issues of great importance to US national security, the goal of intelligence analysis is to provide assessments to decisionmakers that are intellectually rigorous, objec tive, timely, and useful, and that adhere to tradecraft standards.



The tradecraft stand ards for analytic products have been re fined over the past ten years. These standards include describing sources (including their reliability and access to the information they

provide), clearly expressing uncertainty, distinguishing between u nderlying information and analysts’

judgments and assum ptions, exploring alternatives, dem onstrating relevance to the custome r, using strong and transparent logic, and explaining change or consistency in judgments over time.



Applying these standards helps ensure that the Intelligence Community provides US policymakers, warfighters, and operators with the best and most accurate insight, warning, and context, as well as potential opportunities to advance US national security. Intelligence Community analysts integrate information from a wide range of sources, including human sources, technical collection, and open sour ce information, and apply specialized skills and structured analytic tools to draw inferences informed by the data available, relevant past activity, and logic and reasoning to provide insight into what is happening and the prospects for the future.



A critical part of the analyst’s task is to explain uncertainties as

sociated with major judgments based on the quantity and quality of the source material, information gaps, and the co mplexity of the issue.



When Intelligence Community analysts use words such as “w e assess” or “we judge,” they are

conveying an analytic assessment or judgment.
