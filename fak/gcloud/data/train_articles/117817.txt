Accelerated School Infrastructure Delivery Initiative
The objective of ASIDI is to eradicate the Basic Safety Norms backlog in schools without water, sanitation and electricity and to replace those schools constructed from inappropriate material (mud, plankie, asbestos) to contribute towards levels of optimum learning and teaching. The Schools Infrastructure Backlog Grant (SIBG) funds the ASIDI portfolio.

The impact of ASIDI is far reaching. Firstly, it is providing infrastructure that exceeds the minimum norms and standards for educational facilities in South Africa. This, in rural and other economically depressed areas, is a significant development for communities who constantly refer to ASIDI schools as ‘universities’. Secondly, much more than brick and mortar, ASIDI schools are helping to restore dignity and pride for people who had gone far too long deprived of facilities that are taken for granted elsewhere.





The scope of the ASIDI Programme comprises the following sub-programmes:

Sub-programme 1: Inappropriate Structures: 483 Schools that were built from inappropriate material in their entirety are replaced with new schools that meet the department’s standards of basic functionality.

Sub-programme 2: Providing Sanitation: Facilities 939 Schools that previously did not have access to sanitation are supplied with at least a basic level of sanitation.

Sub-programme 3: Providing Electricity: 932 Identified schools that are not serviced have access to electrical energy supply.

Sub-programme 4: Providing Water: 1145 Schools that do not have access to water are provided with basic water supply.

The programme is driven by Department of Basic Education (DBE) who has established a Project Support Unit to support the Programme Manager. Implementing Agents have appointed professional service providers and contractors to execute the work.
