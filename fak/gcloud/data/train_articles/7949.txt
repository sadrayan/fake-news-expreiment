The average annual premium for family coverage for covered workers in small firms (3-199 workers) ($15,849) is lower than the average premium for covered workers in large firms (200 or more workers) ($17,265) (Exhibit 1.2). The average annual single premium for covered workers in small firms (3-199 workers) also is significantly lower than for workers in larger firms ($5,788 vs. $6,130).

Average single and family premiums for covered workers are higher in the Northeast ($6,369 and $17,772) and lower in the South ($5,720 and $16,170) than the average premiums for covered workers in all other regions (Exhibit 1.3).

Average single and family premiums for covered workers in the Wholesale ($5,189 and $15,599) and Retail ($5,355 and $14,979) industries are lower than the average premiums for covered workers in all other industries (Exhibit 1.4).

Covered workers in firms where 35% or more of the workers are age 26 or younger have lower average single and family premiums ($5,292 and $15,182) than covered workers in firms where a lower percentage of workers are age 26 or younger ($6,079 and $16,955). Covered workers in firms where 35% or more of the workers are age 50 or older have higher average single and family premiums ($6,313 and $17,425) than covered workers in firms where a lower percentage of workers are age 50 or older ($5,759 and $16,286) (Exhibit 1.5) and (Exhibit 1.6).

Covered workers in firms with a large percentage of lower-wage workers (at least 35% of workers earn $23,000 per year or less) have lower average single and family premiums ($5,175 and $14,177) than covered workers in firms with a smaller percentage of lower-wage workers ($6,093 and $17,044). Covered worker in firms with a large percentage of higher-wage workers (at least 35% of workers earn $57,000 per year or more) have higher average single and family premiums ($6,244 and $17,582) than covered workers in firms with a smaller percentage of higher-wage workers ($5,819 and $16,124) (Exhibit 1.5) and (Exhibit 1.6).

There is considerable variation in premiums for both single and family coverage. Twenty percent of covered workers are employed by firms that have a single premium at least 20% higher than the average single premium, while 21% of covered workers are in firms that have a single premium less than 80% of the average single premium (Exhibit 1.7) and (Exhibit 1.8). For family coverage, 20% of covered workers are employed in a firm that has a family premium at least 20% higher than the average family premium, and another 20% of covered workers are in firms that have a family premium less than 80% of the average family premium (Exhibit 1.7) and (Exhibit 1.8).



Premium Changes Over Time

The average premiums for covered workers in2014 are $6,025 annually, or $502 per month, for single coverage and $16,834 annually, or $1,403 per month, for family coverage. The 2014 average single premium is similar to the 2013 average premium (the 2 percent increase is not significant). However, the 2014 average family premium is 3 percent higher than the 2013 average premium (Exhibit 1.11). The $16,834 average annual family premium in 2014 is 26% higher than the average family premium in 2009 and 69% higher than the average family premium in 2004 (Exhibit 1.11). The 26% premium growth seen in the last five years (2009 to 2014) is significantly lower than the 34% premium growth seen in the previous five year period, from 2004 to 2009 (Exhibit 1.16). Premiums for both small and large firms have seen a similar increase since 2009 (25% for small and 26% for large). For small firms (3 to 199 workers), the average family premium rose from $12,696 in 2009 to $15,849 in 2014. For large firms (200 or more workers), the average family premium rose from $13,704 in 2009 to $17,265 in 2014 (Exhibit 1.13). Since 2004, premiums for small firms (3 to 199 workers) have increased 63% ($15,849 in 2014 vs. $9,737 in 2004). The premiums for large firms have increased 72% ($17,265 in 2014 vs. $10,046 in 2004) (Exhibit 1.13). Average family premiums for firms with fewer low-wage workers (less than 35% of workers earn $23,000 per year or less) grew in the last year ($17,044 vs. $16,450), while premiums for family coverage for firms with many low-wage workers were similar to 2013 ($14,177 vs. $15,225) (Exhibit 1.15). Overall, premiums for family coverage have grown faster for firms with fewer low-wage workers than firms with many low-wage workers over the last year (4% vs. -7%), as well as the last five years (27% vs. 9%). A similar pattern is observed for single coverage, where average premiums have grown faster for firms with fewer lower-wage workers than firms with many lower wage workers over the last five years (26% vs. 12%).

For large firms (200 or more workers), the average family premium for covered workers in firms that are fully insured has grown at a similar rate to premiums for workers in fully or partially self-funded firms from 2009 to 2014 (26% in both fully insured and self-funded firms) and from 2004 to 2014 (71% in fully insured firms vs. 73% in self-funded firms) (Exhibit 1.17).
