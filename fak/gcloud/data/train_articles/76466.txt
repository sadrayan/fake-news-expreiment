Education In The 1920s
I have read some interesting research on education in the twenties and thirties. Basically, more schools were built during the prosperity of the twenties. Educational movements were progressive and experimental. There was Dewey to conend with. He felt that children should experience their educational. During the thirties, times were tough. Those beautiful grand schools were mostly empty, and people were so desperate for jobs that there were higher quality teachers. Or so I have read.
