Ted Strickland on guns
"Strickland switches on gun rights" By Jack Torry – December 21, 2015

"The Senate doesn't want new gun laws. Here's how Ohio candidates would change that -- or not." By Stephen Koff – December 7, 2015

It is one of the most-dramatic reversals in Ohio politics since 1990, when Democratic gubernatorial candidate Anthony J. Celebrezze jettisoned his lifelong opposition to abortion rights... And even as Strickland’s aides insist that he became an advocate of new gun restrictions in the wake of the shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in 2012 at a Connecticut elementary school... Strickland’s staff members declined requests to make the former governor available for an interview. But David Bergstein, a Strickland spokesman, said, “Ted’s views about gun violence and gun safety have been deeply influenced as a result of the multiple horrific incidents of gun violence that our country has suffered, and particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy (in Connecticut)."Strickland says he supports the same thing as Democrats already in the Senate… That means he has changed his mind… When did he change his position, and why? …Over the last several days, he's been too busy with meetings or traveling for fundraising to have that conversation with a reporter, his representatives say. But here is the semi-official response from his representatives: He was thinking about the issue and finally changed his mind after December 2012 carnage that killed 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
