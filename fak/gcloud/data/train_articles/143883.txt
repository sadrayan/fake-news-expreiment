Westport's design and engineering teams have collaborated with world-renowned designer Donald Starkey and prominent naval architect William Garden to develop a refined hull form for exceptional ocean-going performance, an innovative accommodation plan which balances interior and on-deck spaces for maximum enjoyment and versatility, and a contemporary styling that ensures lasting appeal.



The six-stateroom layout with on-deck full-beam master suite affords everyone a luxurious private retreat incorporating the finest fabrics, cabinetry, stone and leathers. An innovative arrangement includes a top-deck VIP suite with its own sun deck, a large formal dining room adjacent to the commercial-grade galley, and a garage aft for tenders and water toys. Designed for entertaining and relaxed socializing, the saloon opens to a large covered aft deck with lounge, conversation areas and wet bar.
