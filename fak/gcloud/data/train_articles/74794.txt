Comparing the Latest House and Senate Tax Bills by Provision
In broad fiscal terms, the House and Senate tax bills are very similar. Both plans would cost more than $1.4 trillion over ten years on paper while hiding potentially hundreds of billions in gimmicks. However, the two plans differ in where the costs come from. On net, the House plan includes $1.1 trillion of business tax cuts, $200 billion of individual tax cuts, and $151 billion from estate tax repeal. The Senate version, meanwhile, has $900 billion of individual tax cuts, $700 billion of business tax cuts, $83 billion from estate tax cuts, and $318 billion of savings from repealing the individual mandate. The plans also differ on details, in particular the Senate's sunsetting of almost all individual tax provisions after 2025.

To see how the tax plans stack up, we've updated our comparison of how much each of the provisions in each plan costs or saves. Differences are especially noticeable in the gross individual tax increases and the Senate's decision to repeal the individual mandate. But the bottom lines, both with and without gimmicks, are very similar.
