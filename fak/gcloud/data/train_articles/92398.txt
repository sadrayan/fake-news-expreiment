No more Zika clusters in Singapore: NEA
SINGAPORE - As at Thursday, there are no more Zika clusters in Singapore, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA) website.

The last one that closed was in Bedok North Street 3 (Blk 542, 544, 555), which had seven cases.

Data on NEA's website also showed that no new Zika cases were reported since Dec 11, though one was reported on Dec 10.

Singapore's first locally transmitted Zika case came to light on Aug 27, and led to an all-out effort to curb the disease's spread.

The first and largest Zika cluster, which was in the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive area and had nearly 300 cases, has been declared "closed" by the authorities on Oct 9 after it went two weeks without any new reported case.
