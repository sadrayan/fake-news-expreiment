PolitiFact criticized Bernie Sanders' understanding of poverty on Monday, after the Vermont senator said during Sunday's Democratic presidential debate that white people don't know what it's like to be poor.

"Sanders was certainly wrong to suggest that whites haven’t experienced poverty," the Florida-based organization wrote in giving his statement a false rating. "In 2014, there were actually more white Americans in poverty — 19.7 million— than members of any other group."

"Part of the reason, of course, is that there are more white Americans than there are members of minority groups overall. (Whites account for 62 percent of the population.) Still, even though whites have a lower poverty rate than other groups -- roughly 10 percent —even that percentage is hardly trivial."

Sanders' statement during the debate in Flint, Michigan, followed a question from CNN anchor Don Lemon, who asked him and Hillary Clinton what racial blind spots they have.

Sanders said; "When you’re white, you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto. You don’t know what it’s like to be poor. You don’t know what it’s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car."
