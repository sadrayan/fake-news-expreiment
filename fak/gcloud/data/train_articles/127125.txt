Girl, 9, 'permanently scarred after acid leaked from her iPhone case'
A nine-year-old girl was left with a phone-shaped burn mark after a unicorn iPhone case allegedly leaked acid onto her skin.

Olivia Retter could be scarred for life after the pink glittery case – which was covered in unicorns and rainbows – allegedly leaked toxic chemicals onto her right thigh as she slept on it.

The case was bought for about £5 at a New Look shop in Cambridge. The fashion chain has now removed the covers from sale while it investigates.

Olivia’s mother, 35-year-old cleaner Karly, told the Daily Mail: “Doctors said it is a severe chemical burn caused by acid and she will be scarred for life.

“Imagine if it had leaked when Olivia was on the phone or holding it to her face.”

Ms Retter, from Ware in Hertfordshire, warned others of the potential risks on Facebook and her post has now been shared more than 40,000 times.

Please share this as much as possible this case is full of acid and if it cracks it will cause 3rd-2nd degree burns this... Posted by Karly Retter on Friday, January 8, 2016

In one message, she wrote: “I’ve been watching the Segways waiting for them to blow up and the bloody £5 phone case can do this, bloody shocking.”

A spokeswoman for New Look said: “New Look has spoken with the customer involved and takes complaints of this nature extremely seriously.

“In line with our health and safety procedure, we have now instructed all stores to remove the product in question from the shop floor with immediate effect.

“Our quality team have also begun an investigation with the supplier to understand and prevent this from happening in the future.”
