Table 3.Public high school Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate (AFGR), by year and state or jurisdiction: School years 2002–03 through 2009–10
— Not available. State or jurisdiction did not report diploma count.

1 AFGR is an estimate of the percentage of an entering freshman class graduating in 4 years. For 2009–10, it equals the total number of diploma recipients in 2009–10 divided by the average membership of the 8th-grade class in 2005–06, the 9th-grade class in 2006–07, and the 10th-grade class in 2007–08.

2 Reporting states totals include any of the 50 states and the District of Columbia that reported all data elements.

3 Maine reported 1,169 diplomas that were awarded to students attending private high schools that received a majority of their funding from public sources. These 1,169 diplomas were included in the Maine and the Total counts but were not included in the AFGR calculations for Maine and for the Total AFGR. The diploma counts used to calculate the AFGR for Maine and for the reporting states were 12,924 and 3,036,757, respectively.

4 Due to item non-response: data for Connecticut was imputed for 2009–10 and data for California and Nevada were imputed for 2008–09. Imputations are based on prior year rates. No state data were imputed prior to 2008–09.

5 Maine's estimated first-time 9th graders were edited to include 1,419 9th grade, publicly-funded private school students that were reported as 9th graders on the 2006–07 Common Core of Data (CCD) but were reported as 10th graders in 2007–08 and as diploma recipients in 2009–10.

6 DoDDS and DDESS are the Department of Defense Overseas Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools and the Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools, respectively.

NOTE: Ungraded students were allocated to individual grades proportional to each state's enrollment in those grades.
