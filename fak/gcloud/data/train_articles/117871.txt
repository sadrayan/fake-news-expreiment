2008 Inductees



Hassen Abdellah Hassen Abdellah has accomplished many great accomplishments. He is a product of the Elizabeth School system and as a result Hassen has become a prominent attorney. Hassen attended Bucknell University. During his time at Bucknell he amassed 1,543 career- rushing yards, which allowed him to graduate in the top ten of all time. Mr. Abdellah also graduated as the University’s record holder with 3,484 all purpose yards. He was the recipient of the team’s Big Blue Award twice during his career, and as if all of these achievements were not good enough, in 2004 he was inducted into the Bucknell Hall of Fame. Hassen may have perfected his skills while at Bucknell but he crafted them during the years that he played for the Elizabeth Minutemen. An Elizabethan to the core of his heart, some of Hassen’s, most memorable moments were played out on the field. During his time as a Minuteman he received several honors, particularly in the year 1975 in which he was All- Metro, All State Group 4, All Union County 1st Team, and Watchung Conference American Division 1st Team. After graduating from Bucknell University, Hassen went on to Seton Hall Law. He has been a lawyer since 1983, and has served on several boards and committees. Just to name a few, he is the President of Dar UI Islam (a mosque located in Elizabeth), president of Muslim Brothers Movement Inc. and was the president of Fox Hunters Inc. He also served on the Union County Fee Arbitration for State Ethics Committee, and was a committee member for the State Bar Committee for the Supreme Court State of New Jersey for the recordation of the video taped statements. Still sticking to his roots Hassen keeps his office located in Elizabeth, where he continues to give back to his community. Hassen has two children, Amani Sahar Abdellah and Siraj Syeed Abdellah. <<Back
