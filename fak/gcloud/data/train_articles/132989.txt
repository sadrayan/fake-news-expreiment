Iconic Song "The Electric Slide" Is Rumored To Be About A Vibrator [UPDATE]
The songwriter of "Electric Slide" reached out to EDM.com to dispel any rumors.

Unfortunately, we received word from Bunny Wailer and his team that this was a false internet rumor. In a statement made directly to EDM.com, Neville Livingston stated:

At no time have I ever lent credence to a rumor that the song was inspired by anything other than Eddie Grantâ€™s Electric Avenue. To state otherwise is a falsehood and offends my legacy, the legacy of the singer Marcia Griffiths, and tarnishes the reputation of a song beloved by millions of fans the world over.

Despite the rumors being false,

We are shook. The legendary song we all know and love, "The Electric Slide", also known as "The Electric Boogie", has revealed its true meaning from the songwriter himself Neville Livingston. The 71-year-old has been rumored to have confirmed the song is about a vibrator.

Wait, what?!

Yes, a ladies favorite toy. We had no idea! Sources say Livingston aka Bunny Wailer, was inspired to write the song after a girlfriend told him she didn't need him she had her vibrator called the "Electric Slide". Damn. Although this is unconfirmed yet, take a look at the lyrics for yourself and decide. We will never be the same.

We have reached out for an official statement, but this is still life-changing.

It's electric!

You can't see it (it's electric!)

You gotta feel it (it's electric!)

Ooh, it's shakin' (it's electric!)

Jiggle-a-mesa-cara

She's a pumpin' like a matic

She's a movin' like electric

She sure got the boogie

You gotta know it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie!)

Now you can't hold it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie!)

But you know it there,

Here, there and everywhere

I've got to move,

I'm going on a party ride

I've got to groove, groove, groove,

And from this music

I just can't hide

Are you comin' with me?

Come let me take you on a party ride

And I'll teach you, teach you, teach you

I'll teach you the electric slide

Some say it's mystic

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

You can't resist it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

You can't do without it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin' like a matic

She's movin' like electric

She sure got the boogie

Don't want to lose it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

But you can't choose it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

But you know it's there,

Here, there and everywhere

I've got to move,

Come let me take you on a party ride

And I'll teach you, teach you, teach you

I'll teach you the electric slide

You can't see it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

You gotta feel it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

Ooh, it's shakin'

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin' like a matic

She's movin' like electric

She sure got the boogie

You gotta know it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie!)

Now you can't hold it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie!)

But you know it's there,

Here, there and everywhere

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!
