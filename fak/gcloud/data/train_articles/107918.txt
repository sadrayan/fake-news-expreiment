Electoral monitoring mission in Russia. March 2018
Following an invitation from the Russian Peace Foundation, we will deploy an Election Observation Mission (EOM) during the presidential elections in Russia, that will be held March 18, 2018.

The general timing of mission operation is from March 16th till March 19th, 2018.

Election observation is a vital ECDHR activity aiming to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It contributes to strengthening democratic institutions, building public confidence in electoral processes, helping to deter fraud, intimidation and violence. It also reinforces our other objectives, in particular peace-building.

An observation mission assesses all aspects of the electoral process, its constitutional and legal framework, the delimitation of constituencies, the registration of voters and candidates, the training of election staff, voter education, media coverage, the campaign and the preparations for election day, as well as the appeals process. On election day, observers visit pooling stations in order to observe the opening, voting, counting and aggregation of results.

Its fundamental principles are full coverage, impartiality, transparency and professionalism. Its ultimate objective is to become superfluous by entrenching democracy deep within each nation through the development of national capacities.

Its main goals are the legitimization of an electoral process, where appropriate, and the enhancement of public confidence in the electoral process to deter fraud, to strengthen respect for human rights, and to contribute to conflict resolution.
