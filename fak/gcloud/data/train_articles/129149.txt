Judge lets ban on ballot selfies remain in New York
NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge says he is not overturning a New York state ban against ballot selfies or the showing of a marked election ballot to others.

Manhattan Judge P. Kevin Castel said in a written ruling Thursday that people who want to publicize their ballot choices can do so through "other powerful means."

The ruling came in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of voters. The lawsuit contended that voters had a First Amendment right to share a photograph of their ballot with others, even through social media.

Lawyers for the state and New York City argued against it. The state argued that a law more than a century old banned people from showing their marked ballot to others.
