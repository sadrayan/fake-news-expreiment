Here is our response regarding using federal AYP ratings as indicative of low performing schools:

Federal AYP requirements are generally not considered to be the hallmark of whether a school is doing well or poorly. (see November 2013 article from Americans for Prosperity http://americansforprosperity.org/article/no-child-left-behind-a-classic-case-of-the-failure-of-central-planning-in-education). This is because the requirement that 100% of all states' students must be proficient on state reading assessments by the year 2014 is widely regarded as being unrealistic and unattainable. Even Sandy Kress, one of the architects of No Child Left Behind for the Bush administration, admitted that no one ever expected all schools to actually achieve 100% proficiency. (see Jan. 2015 Politico article http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0115/morningeducation16707.html). Few, if any, schools in the country could have met that standard which is why so many states sought waivers from the requirement. Even as early as 2005, experts calculated that "Based on current improvement levels and without major changes in the definition of adequate yearly progress (AYP), almost all schools will fail to meet NCLB requirements within the next few years." (see 2005 Policy Brief of the National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED492874.pdfhttp://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED492874.pdf). And in March, 2011, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan predicted that "82 percent of the nation’s schools may not make adequate yearly progress, or AYP, (that) year, according to U.S. Department of Education estimates." (see Education Week article http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2011/03/16/24ayp.h30.html). Accordingly, the projection that 95% of Texas schools would have failed to meet AYP in 2014 shows that Texas was in the same predicament as every other state in the country due to a poorly conceived and widely discredited federal standard that both the U.S. Department of Education and Congress agree must be eliminated.

Background re federal NCLB/ESEA requirements regarding Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP):

Amended on January 8, 2002, Title I of ESEA requires states to develop and submit the initial AYP criteria in the Consolidated State Application Accountability Workbook (AYP Workbook) for 2003 AYP evaluations. The initial submission of the Texas AYP Workbook included TAKS assessment results for performance, while participation was measured by TAKS and other statewide assessments. ESEA outlined state criteria for development of performance standards or targets, specifically requiring states to use test data for the 2001–2002 school year to establish starting points for development of performance standards. Each state was required to establish a timeline to ensure that not later than 12 years after the end of the 2001–2002 school year (2013–2014 school year), all students in each group will meet or exceed the state's performance standards. In order to meet federal requirements, the Texas AYP performance targets developed in 2002–2003 were based on the 2001–2002 Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) student test results which were converted to equivalent Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) proficiency levels. TAKS results from the newly implemented administration for grades 3–8 and 10 were used to evaluate 2003 AYP.

...one additional elaboration - regarding my first statement that "Federal AYP requirements are generally not considered to be the hallmark of whether a school is doing well or poorly", I referenced a Nov. 2013 article from American for Prosperity. I want to add this particular quote from that article to support our position as follows:

"As if it were not burdensome enough for schools to meet AYP’s ambitious proficiency requirements on the macro level, they must do so on the micro level as well. NCLB classifies public school students into subgroups<http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/adequate-yearly-progress/>, including the economically disadvantaged, Asian Americans, the disabled, Native Americans, African Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics, and those who are learning English as a second language. Each subgroup within a public school must also fulfill or exceed the AYP standards determined by the state government. If even one group does not live up to these standards, NCLB designates that entire school<http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/30/feds-grant-texas-no-child-left-behind-waiver/2898159/> as failing to make AYP – an unreasonably ambitious benchmark.

Under this rigid definition, schools that would otherwise be considered respectable or high-quality have been classified as “failing” just because one group of students did not score high enough on some standardized tests. For example, Rachel Carson Middle School in Virginia is considered a “failing” school, even though more than 60 graduates<http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-08-11/local/35269673_1_virginia-schools-patricia-i-wright-state-math-tests> of that school were admitted to the prestigious Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in 2010. Carson also had an overall passing rate of 98% in English<http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-08-11/local/35269673_1_virginia-schools-patricia-i-wright-state-math-tests> and 95% in math in 2011. In addition, Mission High School in California is considered a “failing” school, even though 88% of the graduating class<http://www.care2.com/causes/no-child-left-behind-turns-successful-schools-into-failing-schools.html> was accepted to college in 2012."

Thanks,

...we do not agree with the statement that a majority of Texas students are in underperforming schools. According to a summary of the most recent state accountability ratings for school districts and campuses, only 8.5% of Texas schools received a rating of “Improvement Required” (i.e. low performing).

Additionally, we do not believe that citing Texas’ federal AYP standing as evidence to support the statement that a majority of Texas students are in underperforming schools is valid. Federal AYP requirements are generally not considered to be the hallmark of whether a school is doing well or poorly. This is clearly illustrated in an excerpt from a November 2013 article from Americans for Prosperity http://americansforprosperity.org/article/no-child-left-behind-a-classic-case-of-the-failure-of-central-planning-in-education) in which the author wrote: "As if it were not burdensome enough for schools to meet AYP’s ambitious proficiency requirements on the macro level, they must do so on the micro level as well. NCLB classifies public school students into subgroups, including the economically disadvantaged, Asian Americans, the disabled, Native Americans, African Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics, and those who are learning English as a second language.
