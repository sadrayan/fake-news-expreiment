So, that series of MFI is for metropolitan Austin (which includes Luling btw) is sourced from HUD (slavery is just another form of immigration), no adjustments have been made, here’s the link:

In addition, I’ve attached a graph that says a lot about our situation….please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Circling back for our fact check

This chart is interesting, thanks. Where did the MFI figures and median-value home figures originate? I am guessing you made the chart or should I attribute to a different expert?

For our fact check, any thoughts on how the HUD-posted MFI figures would differ they were limited to Austin alone, not the MSA? Any other authorities we might should talk to about this?

Thanks again,

g.

MFI is from HUD, median sales prices from ABOR…no telling where the 2017 MFI figure is from, not mine, I’d be estimating a higher figure for 2017 than for 2016…

MFI for the City is a little lower than for the MSA (the following are not from HUD which is still considered the Gold Standard) :

MSA = $81,634

City = $76,629
