Shea-Porter Spokesperson Statement on Misleading Radio Ads
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Contact: Ben Wakana, 202-295-7608

MANCHESTER, NH – Ben Wakana, spokesperson for Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter, issued the following statement regarding a misleading radio advertisement about the Affordable Care Act:

“This ad is false. Washington Republicans should take down their misleading attack ads and stop frightening Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem, because they can indeed renew their policies and keep their current doctors and hospitals.

“Congresswoman Shea-Porter worked this out with Anthem weeks ago: New Hampshire residents who hold individual policies from Anthem have until December 16 to renew their current policies and keep their hospitals and doctors in 2014.

“In fact, under the Affordable Care Act, families in a situation like the one depicted in this ad no longer face lifetime limits on coverage, they won’t suffer from bankruptcy due to overwhelming medical bills, and they can’t be kicked off their insurance or kept from getting insurance because of illness. Washington Republicans should stop trying to take people’s insurance away and start working to improve the Affordable Care Act.”
