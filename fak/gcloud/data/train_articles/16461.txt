There were over 190 detainers refused, but most of the persons detainers were refused on are still in our custody.

37 inmates were released on Feb. 1 once they made bond or had their charges disposed by a judge.

Subject: RE: {EXTERNAL} Urgently seeking factual elaboration about immigrants released recently

When would you expect the other 147-plus individuals to be released? Is there a breakdown, perhaps?

Given this count, is the senator’s claim largely accurate or not? Why or why not?

I can’t predict when the others will be released. It depends on when their charges are disposed or if they make bond. 34 of them will be released to ICE because we received Federal Warrants on them last Friday. (Phil Jankowski reported it.)

If you want a breakdown, you’ll need to make an open records request so a paralegal can do the research.

The senator’s claim that “Hundreds of illegal immigrants subject to detainers were released in the last week since the new sanctuary policy was adopted by the Travis County Sheriff's Office”

Is not accurate.

Again, this is information I have already released to the Statesman. See below.
