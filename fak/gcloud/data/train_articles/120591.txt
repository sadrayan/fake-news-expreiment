UPDATE Confronting False Allegations about the George Zimmerman Case

Statement from July 17, 2013

Contrary to rumors that are circulating, Koch companies, Koch affiliates, and the Koch family have no connection to or involvement whatsoever, either direct or indirect, with George Zimmerman. We did not and are not paying his legal fees. This is another completely false and baseless rumor. In addition to this statement, we published the statement below on April 19, 2012. Snopes.com has also stated that the rumor alleging we paid his legal fees is false.

Statement from April 19, 2012

Contrary to an irresponsible rumor that began circulating online on April 18, Koch has no involvement whatsoever with the defense of George Zimmerman, the defendant in the Trayvon Martin case.

The exact origin of that rumor remains to be seen but similar falsehoods made by partisan activists in recent days have intentionally sown confusion about Koch. On March 23, Democratic party operative Karen Finney wrongly accused Koch of a connection with the tragic circumstances surrounding the Trayvon Martin matter. We provided MSNBC with a formal statement and demonstrable proof that Ms. Finney was deceiving viewers — and yet the network refuses to air those remarks or post them online.

Just days later, former White House aide Van Jones appeared on MSNBC and remarked, “You’ve got all of the passion around Trayvon and what a horrible injustice that was and you can draw a direct line to the Koch brothers.” We confronted the network about that lie as well and again they refused to air our statement.

Despite MSNBC’s appalling disregard for basic journalism standards, we will continue to set the record straight on this issue as often as necessary.
