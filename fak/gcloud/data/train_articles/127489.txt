Ukip leadership candidate backs death penalty for paedophiles
A Ukip leadership candidate has called for the death penalty for paedophiles, but only those who abuse children under the age of 12.

John Rees Evans said the policy would "depend on what you define as a paedophile" but added that adults who have sex with a child who "looked 18 but was 15 and a half", for example, should be exempt.

Another candidate, Paul Nuttall, said the death penalty should be returned for those who kill children, while Suzanne Evans and Peter Whittle were against the punishment.

The remarks were made during the first Ukip leadership hustings as the party seeks a new leader to replace Diane James, who quit after just 18 days in post.
