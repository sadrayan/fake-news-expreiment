WAKE UP AMERICANS
June 14th is not just the birthday of the US President.

Not just a Flag Day.



On this day we officially starts our project "USA Really": the honest media about what is really happening around.

Our slogan is "USA as it is".



We invite all Americans - all who cares about the country - to celebrate this.

Come up to the White House on June 14th at 2:00 p.m. to congratulate America.



We're calling for every patriot!

Wake Up Americans!
