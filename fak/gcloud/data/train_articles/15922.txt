Here is a story about the bill that uses the word "expanded" to describe Sb 1528.

https://www.texastribune.org/2011/10/25/undocumented-students-texas-receive-financial-aid/

This is the UT-Austin website that describes SB 1528 as an "expansion" of HB 1403.

https://world.utexas.edu/isss/students/dreamers/who-is-undocumented

In the white paper you will read that Sb 1528 expanded HB 1403 by no longer requiring a students residence to be determined by the location of the student's parents.

So, in summary, the higher ed community and reporters have characterized this as an expansion and I have told you explicitly how it expanded HB 1403.

Subject: RE: Following up in a check of Sen. Patrick's claim

I have more information on both measures now. I’d be happy to visit by phone, too.

Summing up, the tuition measure doesn’t appear to have expanded any benefits for illegal immigrants. A UT admissions official said as much by phone.

-At least one reporter has used the word "expanded" to describe SB 1528. The UT website uses the word "expanded" despite what the official said. The bill did expand benefits because under HB 1403, if a student's parents moved out of Texas, the student was no longer a resident. SB 1528 changed this so that a student's residence was determined by the student. Therefore, the bill expanded the existing program by allowing students to gain in-state tuition despite being an illegal immigrant AND not having parents that live in Texas. As a result, a group of students will continue to get in state tuition if they are here illegally if they are here living with their parents and a new group of students will get in state tuition if they are here illegally but are not here with their parents.

The other measure gave permission to hospital districts to provide non-emergency services to residents regardless of immigration status, services the Harris County Hospital District had been providing until then-AG Cornyn issued an advisory opinion saying whoa in July 2001. It doesn’t look to me like any services were expanded.

- All of this information is in the white paper I sent you. The AG said providing free nonemergency healthcare to illegal immigrants was illegal in 2001 so the services stopped. Gallegos passed SB 309 out of the Senate (with Texas Eagle Forum, and YCT opposing) with two Nay votes (Shapiro and Nelson) in order to expand free emergency services to include free nonemergency services in 2003. SB 309 passed the Senate and would have expanded free emergency healthcare services (required under ERISA) to include free tax-payer funded nonemergency health care.

I hope I have cleared these up because it seems very clear to me.

Need to also clarify…I meant EMTALA not ERISA.
