Rep. Kirkpatrick to Start “Working For You” Tour With “Chats With Ann,” Funding Announcements
PRESCOTT, AZ – Starting Monday, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick will be travelling across Greater Arizona on her month-long “Working For You” Tour. The first leg of the trip will take her through three counties and will include the launch of her new “Chat with Ann” events, along with several major announcements about funding for important district projects.



Rep. Kirkpatrick will continue her work to make sure that what’s important to people in the district has a voice in Congress. She will hold her first “Chat with Ann” events at the Safeway grocery stores in Payson and Holbrook, visiting with folks so they can share their thoughts on what is happening in Arizona and Washington. The Congresswoman has made it a priority to be available to people throughout Greater Arizona, and with these locations she is trying to make it as convenient as possible for folks to discuss their concerns and issues.



As a major part of her tour, Rep. Kirkpatrick will be giving updates on critical infrastructure improvements for our communities. She will hold a press conference at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott to announce progress on securing federal funding for the NASA Educator Resource Center. She will later tour the Little Colorado Levee in Winslow with local leaders to report on her success in helping allocate funds for continuing feasibility studies.



The Congresswoman will also meet with firefighters from throughout Greater Arizona to discuss her work to make it easier for them to participate in critical grant programs, and will join Winslow police officers to hear more about how they will use the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant that she recently helped them secure through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
