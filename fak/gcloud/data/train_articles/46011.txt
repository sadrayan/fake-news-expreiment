Blumenthal Apologizes for Vietnam Service Claims
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, whose acknowledgment last week that he had misrepresented his Vietnam record overshadowed his nomination as Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, has apologized.

“I have made mistakes and I am sorry,” he said in a statement e-mailed to The Hartford Courant by a campaign aide on Sunday night. “I truly regret offending anyone. I will always champion the cause of Connecticut’s and our nation’s veterans.”

Mr. Blumenthal, who repeated his apology in person in New Haven on Monday, came under attack on May 17 when The New York Times reported that he had sometimes claimed to have served in Vietnam, though he actually served stateside in the Marine Reserve after receiving five draft deferments.

“At times when I have sought to honor veterans, I have not been as clear or precise as I should have been about my service in the Marine Corps Reserves,” Mr. Blumenthal said in the statement on Sunday, The Courant reported. “I have firmly and clearly expressed regret and taken responsibility for my words.”

Mr. Blumenthal initially expressed regret for what he called his “misplaced words,” in a nationally televised news conference on May 18.

But his omission of an apology left veterans’ groups and some Connecticut politicians demanding one and exposed him to criticism even from some Democrats at the party’s state convention on Friday, where he wrapped up the nomination for Senate.
