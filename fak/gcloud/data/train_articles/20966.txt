Joe Crowley: GOP Tax Bill Needs to Be Repealed and Replaced
Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY), chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said that the GOP tax bill needs to be repealed and replaced while speaking at the Tax March D.C. on Tuesday.

“The Republican caucus needs to announce that it will repeal and replace this bill. This is the bill that needs to be repealed and replaced. They are focused on health care. Repeal this bill, my Republican colleagues,” Crowley said.

Earlier this month House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) suggest that if Democrats retake the House, they will repeal the GOP tax bill.

It has been reported that Crowley is eyeing Pelosi’s job as top Democrat in the House, if Pelosi retires from Congress after this term.
