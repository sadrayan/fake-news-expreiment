Libya's lawlessness and migrant crisis
A new European Union policy on migration is now in place, but the turmoil in Libya makes it difficult to enforce.

European leaders met in Brussels to discuss ways to deal with the gowing numbers of migrants to Europe. They went as far as threatening to take military action against human traffickers in Libya.

Many have questioned the feasibility of the new measures by the EU as long as the chaos in Libya prevails. Thousands of illegal migrants make use the security vacuum there to try to make to Europe.

So, is the new policy enoug to stem the influx of those immigrants? And should the EU get involved in efforts to restore peace in Libya?
