Brandon Bouchard
As Director of Media Relations, Brandon Bouchard oversees Polaris’s national and international media efforts and directs the organization’s celebrity Ambassador Program.

Working with members of the media at all levels, Brandon has helped drive and inform stories about modern slavery throughout nearly every major national media outlet, working to ensure the voices of survivors and survivor advocates are included in the conversation. Creating and directing Polaris’s Ambassador Program, Brandon also works with celebrity influencers to amplify the fight against human trafficking across new audiences, and has consulted and advised on projects throughout the entertainment industry—from documentaries to Oscar-winning films and Emmy-winning television shows.

Prior to joining Polaris, Brandon worked more than four years for former U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (Maine) on Capitol Hill. Serving as her press secretary and special assistant, he highlighted her efforts to forge bipartisan solutions for some of the nation’s most pressing issues. Following Senator Snowe’s retirement from the U.S. Senate in January 2013, he served as her senior advisor and helped her write her memoir, Fighting for Common Ground.
