Before entering the web site, please read the following information:

The Rhode Island Sex Offender Community Notification Unit updates information on this sex offender website regularly to try to assure that it is complete and accurate. However, the information can change quickly and information on registered sex offenders is often provided by the registered sex offender themselves as required by law. This information may not have been verified by local law enforcement officials at the time it is posted on the website. You are cautioned that the information provided on this site is information of record and may not reflect the current residence, status, or other information regarding a registered sex offender.

The Level II and Level III offenders listed on this website have been convicted of Criminal Sexual Conduct or other statutes which requires the individual to register with law enforcement and allow for community notification. The primary purpose of community notification is to enhance public safety and protection. The offender(s) are not wanted by the police at this time unless otherwise indicated. This notification is not to increase fear in the community. It is the belief of law enforcement that an informed public is a safer public.

The main purpose of providing this data on the Internet is to make the information more easily available and accessible. Specific, local community notification for Level II or Level III offenders is done by local police or Rhode Island State Police for the particular city/town an offender resides.

If you believe any of the offender information listed on this website is incorrect, please report it to the Sex Offender Community Notification Unit (401) 462-0905.
