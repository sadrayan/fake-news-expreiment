President Trump is making Oct 4th bring your...
Dawn Zirkelbach I believe whole heartedly that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior...I had to say that first, and I pray you feel his peace,love and mercy one day..I am not saying this in a snarky way..I say it because you are my sister and I love you

and Jesus loves you sooo much more... I am not trying to push anything on you.. I just felt lead to tell you that ..I also want to say thank you for debating and saying you’re peace without name calling and being ugly...I greatly respect you for that..there is sooo much hate being spewed all around..coming from every direction..I also feel that I need to say that much of this is our fault..We were not meant to judge and act all crazy towards ppl...Jesus called us to love one another and show his light thru our walk..sadly folks wanna do the opposite..And all the church folks that are reading this..Be careful of what you say...think before you speak...am I saying this to glorify God and show his love to someone or am I acting in anger and in flesh and misrepresenting the Lord??..I have done this myself also ,but the Holy Ghost set some real conviction on me for it..We are none perfect but he loves us anyway and we are

Meant to strive to be Christ like..Tell ppl about him and show them love even if they are saying mean things..make ppl go wow...I want what they have.. Be fishers of men..real em in ..do your job..Don’t get to big for your britches and try to do his..I assure you..we are not qualified..Only God can Judge and make you feel conviction...come on Church,, do better..Just imagine if we all followed just one of his commandments ..Do unto others as you would have them do unto you...just the one...imagine how much better things would be...much love y’all
