Mark Pryor's new ad is interesting.Here is a KATV Arkansas Report describing the ad: "Sen. Mark Pryor is out with a new ad offering a Biblical solution to the already heated 2014 Senate race in Arkansas. Pryor's campaign said the ad will begin airing on Wednesday. In the 30 second ad, Pryor speaks directly to the camera about his faith in the Bible. The ad is a substantial purchase for the campaign and will run statewide. "I'm not ashamed to say that I believe in God, and I believe in His word. The Bible teaches us no one has all the answers. Only God does. And neither political party is always right," Pryor says in the ad. "This is my compass. My North Star. It gives me comfort and guidance to do what's best for Arkansas."Interesting ad, considering the same Mark Pryor was quoted below just last year cautioning that the Bible is "not a rule book for political issues."So is the Bible Mark Pryor's compass, providing the "comfort and guidance to do what's best for Arkansas? " Or is it really not a good rule book for political issues and decisions made in the Senate? Guess it depends on which Mark Pryor that you ask.
