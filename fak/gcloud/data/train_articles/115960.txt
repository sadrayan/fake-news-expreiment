Working memory of numerals in chimpanzees
Summary

Chimpanzee memory has been extensively studied [1,2] . The general assumption is that, as with many other cognitive functions, it is inferior to that of humans [3] ; some data, however, suggest that, in some circumstances, chimpanzee memory may indeed be superior to human memory [4] . Here we report that young chimpanzees have an extraordinary working memory capability for numerical recollection â€” better even than that of human adults tested in the same apparatus following the same procedure.
