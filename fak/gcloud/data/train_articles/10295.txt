Scott To University Presidents: 'We Will Fight To Hold The Line On Tuition'
Governor Rick Scott is doubling down on his opposition to tuition increases. Lynn Hatter reports, the Governor has written letters to each state university president as well as members of the board that governs them.

Even though Governor Rick Scott vetoed a three-percent tuition increase approved by the legislature, universities could still request tuition hikes from the Florida Board of Governors.

There are also questions about a state rule that could allow an automatic 1.7 percent tuition increase because of inflation.

In his letter Scott says, quote: "We absolutely will fight to hold the line on tuition in Florida," end quote.

The Governor goes on to call any increase a tax hike. State laws on tuition increases do not spell out what happens if an increase allocated by the legislature is vetoed.
