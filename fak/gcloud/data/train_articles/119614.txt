The Powerpuff Girls Are Officially Coming Back In 2016
It's a good day for justice.

The hit cartoon "The Powerpuff Girls" is now coming back in a brand new reboot, according to Cartoon Network. The Emmy-winning series originally debuted in 1998 and followed the crime-fighting adventures of super-heroines Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup. This new series is set to air in 2016 and will bring on "Adventure Time" animator Nick Jennings as executive producer.

The girls, who always make sure to save the world before bedtime, briefly got back together in 2014 for the special "Dance Pantsed. The special reunited the original voice actors and also brought on Ringo Starr as a guest.

Cartoon Network did not immediately respond to HuffPost Entertainment's request for further comment on the reboot; this post will be updated if and when one is received.
