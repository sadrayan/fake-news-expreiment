Terry McAuliffe's Spending
Executive Summary

:

Throughout his campaign, Terry McAuliffe has refused to reveal the true cost of his plans for health care, education, public safety, transportation or energy. When questioned, he has admitted that without Medicaid expansion, there won‟t be any money for his plans. However, even the most generous assumptions about new revenues come nowhere close to balancing his budget. McAuliffe has said that Medicaid expansion would free up $500 million a year, but this ignores the fact that the legislature is determined to stow away the general fund‟s savings from expansion in the short-term to pay for the long-term costs. Accordingly, McAuliffe will only be able to spend new tax revenue generated from the expansion. According to Chmura and the liberal Commonwealth Institute, new tax revenue will be between just $50 and $60 million a year. Several of McAuliffe‟s spending proposals are too vague to even be scored, but an analysis of those proposals that can be scored suggests he will need at least $14 billion more tax dollars to pay for his plans. McAuliffe wants to spend 60 times more money than is available to him. Without significant cuts to other programs, McAuliffe will be forced to raise taxes on the typical family of four by more than $1,700 per year.

McAULIFFE EXPENSES

PK-12 EDUCATION

According to the Commonwealth Institute, per pupil general fund expenditures are down approximately $1,000 since FY07 and McAuliffe says this budget balancing has undermined the Standards of Quality. To restore those standards would require this difference be made up by increasing expenditures by $1,000 for each of Virginia’s 1.26 million students. NOTE: This analysis assumes static enrollment and no increases in per-pupil expenditures after the initial increased investment. McAuliffe Says That Budget Balance Has Undermined The Standards Of Quality & It’s Time To Restore Those Standards. “Restoring the Standards of Quality and fully funding them. In recent years, economic hardship forced our leaders in Richmond to look for budget balancing strategies that led them to undermine the standards of quality, our curriculum, and standards for school services. It‟s time to restore those standards and make sure our schools have the tools they need to get the job done. (“Terry‟s Platform: Keeping Virginia Competitive In A Global

Economy,” Terry McAuliffe For Governor, Accessed 8/27/13)

McAuliffe Wants to Spend An Additional $5 Billion Over Four Years On Virginia’s Per Pupil PK-12 Education It Would Cost Approximately $1,264,880,000 To Make Up The Difference In Virginia’s General Fund Spending Per Pupil From FY2007’s Level To FY2014’s Level.

COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY

The cost of keeping students out of debt outlined in McAuliffe’s platform for the 2011 school year would have cost more than $667 million. Using historical trends in the rise of student indebtedness and the increasing number of graduates, the total cost from the 2013-14 school year to the 2016-17 school year is more than $3.8 billion. NOTE: This analysis does not include community college students, students who incur debt but do not graduate or the likely increase in enrollment if students knew the state would pay off their debt. These numbers could be much higher. Terry McAuliffe Wants To Keep Students Out Of Debt McAuliffe Says He Will Control Costs & Fees “To Keep Students Out Of Debt.” “Controlling costs and fees to keep our kids out of debt. Every student in Virginia deserves the opportunity to get a quality education and start their working lives without the burden of heavy debt… Emphasize financial aid. We must ensure that, in this era of rising costs, all students have a fair shot at getting a college education.” (“Terry‟s Platform: Keeping Virginia

Competitive In A Global Economy,” Terry McAuliffe For Governor, Accessed 8/27/13)

The Cost Of Keeping The Class Of 2011 “Out Of Debt” Would Have Been $667,563,408 According To The Institute For College Access & Success, The Average Debt For The Class Of 2011 Attending Four Year Universities In Virginia Was $14,628.

TEACHER PAY

McAuliffe’s Plan To Increase Average Teacher Pay To The National Average, Would Cost Virginia $700 Million Per Year. (Tim Miller, “Terry McAuliffe Can‟t Explain How He Will Fund His „Shoot For The Moon‟ Plans,” America Rising, 9/13/13)

RENEWABLE PORFOLIO ENERGY STANDARD

If Virginia had a mandatory renewable portfolio energy standard and electricity rates increased by 40 Percent, Virginia state government would have paid an average of $295,129,252 in FY10-12. The difference between what Virginia spent and what it would have spent if McAuliffe instituted a mandatory renewable portfolio standard amounts to $84,322,643 a year. In FY10-12, Virginia State Government Paid An Average Of $210,806,609 For Electrical Services Charges Each Year    In FY12, Virginia State Government Paid $224,267,572 For Electrical Service Charges. (Commonwealth

Data Point, Datapoint.apa.virginia.gov, Accessed 10/5/13)

In FY11, Virginia State Government Paid $208,579,521 For Electrical Service Charges. (Commonwealth

McAuliffe Supports A Mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standard In Virginia & States With Mandatory Renewable Mandates Had Electricity Prices Nearly 40 Percent Higher Than In States That Don’t In 2013, McAuliffe Said A Mandatory Renewable Energy Standard Would “Lure Investors And Others Who Will Come Here To Virginia Which Will Help Us Build New Jobs Of The 21st Century.” McAuliffe: “We are the only state in the mid-Atlantic without a mandatory renewable energy standard. If we had one, it would be able – someone who has been in the renewable energy field – it will lure investors and others who will come here to Virginia which will help us build new jobs of the 21st century.” (PBS‟ “Politics Matters,” 4/28/13)

In 2011, Electricity Prices Were “Nearly 40 Percent Higher In States With Renewable Electricity Mandates.” “Electricity prices are already nearly 40 percent higher in states with renewable electricity mandates. While the renewable mandates may not be the only reason electricity prices are higher in those states, these mandates likely contribute to higher prices and certainly are not helping to decrease the price. After all, renewable electricity mandates require the generation of electricity from more expensive sources.”

(“The Status Of Renewable Electricity Mandates In The States,” Institute For Energy Research, 2/9/11)

ROUTE 58

We approximate there are about 100 miles of Route 58 that are currently two-lane highway and not currently planned for expansion. In 2002, construction of a four-lane divided highway would have cost $3,570,000 per mile. We subtracted the cost of a two-lane highway at $1,050,000 per mile to reach a cost of $2,520,000 per mile. Adjusting for inflation and multiplying by 100 miles equals a cost of $327,609,800. Additionally, the unfunded project to expand Lover’s Leap will cost $480 million. McAuliffe’s Plan To Expand 100 Miles Of Route 58 From Two To Four Lanes Will Cost More Than $325 Million The Widening Of 19 Miles Between Stuart & Hillsville, Which Includes Lover’s Leap, Is Projected To Cost $480 Million. “According to Jason Bond, communications representative for VDOT‟s Salem district, the project has 19 more miles to go before the widening is completed, none of which have funding yet. This includes Lover‟s Leap, which many argue is one of the most dangerous sections of U.S. 58. The widening of these 19 miles is projected to cost about $480 million.” (Brittany Hughes, “McAuliffe Takes Heat For U.S. 58 Statement,” Danville Register

& Bee, 7/30/13)

McAuliffe’s Plan To Expand An Additional 100 Miles Of Route 58 From A Two-Lane Highway To A Four-Lane Highway Will Cost $327,609,800. (“2025 State Highway Plan: Technical Report,” Virginia Department Of Transportation,

December 2005; Bureau Of Labor Statistics, “CPI Inflation Calculator,” Accessed 10/6/13)

McAuliffe Said He Wants To Make Route 58 Four Lanes “All The Way Out From The Port [Of Virginia.]” “The discussion turned to the economy, and McAuliffe said areas such as Martinsville „need to open up their communities.‟ Referring to Route 58, he said, „How you do that is, I say, four-lane 58 all the way out from the Port [of Virginia] so we can get the goods from the Port all the way to the commerce of America.‟”

(Paul Schwartzman, “McAuliffe, Cuccinelli Race Drips With Venom,” The Washington Post, 8/6/13)



McAuliffe’s Spokesman Specified That McAuliffe’s Comments On The Expansion Of Route 58 Have “Always Been In The Context Of All The Way To The End Of The State.” “Nowhere in his statement did Terry talk about a four-lane road just to Martinsville,‟ said McAuliffe spokesperson Josh Schwerin. „If you look back at Terry‟s statements, it‟s always been in the context of all the way to the end of the state. There are a lot of places between there and the state line that are just two lanes. So progress has been made, but the work‟s not done.” (Brittany Hughes, “McAuliffe Takes Heat For U.S. 58 Statement,” Danville

Register & Bee, 7/30/13)

McAuliffe’s Campaign “Didn’t Specify” Where They Would Get The Money To Pay For Route 58’s Expansion. “When asked where McAuliffe plans to find the additional funds needed to complete U.S. 58‟s expansion, Schwerin didn‟t specify, only saying that the project is a „critical project‟ to McAuliffe. „He believes that these funds need to be allocated, and it‟s a top priority,‟ Schwerin said.” (Brittany Hughes, “McAuliffe Takes

Heat For U.S. 58 Statement,” Danville Register & Bee, 7/30/13)

LIGHT RAIL CONSTRUCTION

McAuliffe’s Planned Light Rail Expansion In Norfolk Would Cost Virginia $250 Million McAuliffe Pledged To Push For The Expansion Of Light Rail To Norfolk Naval Station & The Virginia Beach Oceanfront. “Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic candidate for governor, pledged Monday to push for expansion of light rail to Norfolk Naval Station and the Virginia Beach Oceanfront.” (Bill Sizemore, “McAuliffe: Extend

Light Rail To Naval Base, Oceanfront,” The Virginian-Pilot, 9/23/13)

The Expansion Would Cost Approximately $1 Billion With The State Obligated For A 25 Percent Share. “An estimate from Hampton Roads Transit last week pegged the total cost of an eastward expansion to the Oceanfront at more than $1 billion. The standard funding model for light-rail projects includes a 25 percent state share in addition to 50 percent from the federal government and 25 percent from the locality.” (Bill Sizemore,

McAULIFFE’S BLANK CHECK SPENDING PLANS

EDUCATION McAuliffe Plans To Increase Funding For Pre-K & Early Childhood Education By An Unspecified Amount. “Increasing support for Pre-K and early childhood education: Every young Virginian deserves access to the benefits of an early childhood education.” (Terry McAuliffe For Governor, “Investing In Virginia‟s Urban Centers,”

www.terrymcauliffe.com, Accessed 9/23/13)

McAuliffe Promised Unspecified Research Funds For Virginia Universities. “Afterward, McAuliffe said Tech‟s research and business ventures are second to none in the state, and that Tech‟s dedication to research and innovation is a model for the commonwealth‟s public colleges and universities. „As governor, I‟d like to see this throughout Virginia,‟ McAuliffe said.” (Tonia Moxley, “Gubernatorial Hopeful McAuliffe's Campaign Tours Virginia Tech,” The Roanoke

Times, 7/2/13)

TRANSPORTATION McAuliffe Promised An Increase In Unspecified Funding For Inter-City Passenger Rail. “Increasing support for inter-city passenger rail. Virginia‟s cities and citizens need to be connected to other markets. We should continue to invest in those lines that make economic sense to ensure that our passenger rail service is fast, frequent, reliable, and affordable: Supporting passenger rail to Roanoke; Continued support for the Lynchburg and Charlottesville line; Studying and implementing improvements on Richmond to DC rail line; Marketing and supporting Norfolk passenger rail.” (“Terry‟s Platform: Keeping Virginia Competitive In A Global Economy,” Terry

McAuliffe For Governor, Accessed 8/27/13)

McAuliffe Promised An Increase In Unspecified Funding For Rail Systems To Fully Connect Distribution & Delivery Centers Across Virginia, Along With Rail To “Our Airports.” “Improving connectivity across our network. We should make sure that our rails fully connect distribution and delivery centers along with providing passenger access to our airports.” (“Terry‟s Platform: Keeping Virginia Competitive In A Global

Economy,” Terry McAuliffe For Governor, Accessed 8/27/13)

HEALTH CARE McAuliffe Promised An Increase In Unspecified Funding To Expand Rural Health Care Delivery. “Continue to support efforts to expand rural health delivery. By encouraging the federal government to expand residency slots and by supporting state programs that aid in loan repayments for rural health professionals, we can ensure that all Virginians get access to quality care.” (“Terry‟s Platform: Keeping Virginia Competitive In A Global Economy,” Terry

McAuliffe For Governor, Accessed 8/27/13)

McAuliffe Promised An Increase In Unspecified Funding For Mental Health Services. “Mental health services are a critical part of Virginia‟s healthcare and public safety services, and recent events in Newtown, Aurora, Oak Creek and Virginia Tech have all shown us that we need to take serious steps to continue to improve our mental health services… Increase resources for Crisis Intervention Training for public safety officers… Incentivize the creation of more and higher-capacity crisis stabilization units… Increase resources for and personnel performing intensive case management – particularly for children… Improve the quantity and quality of long-term supportive housing for severely mentally ill and homeless citizens.” (“Terry‟s Platform: Keeping

Virginia Competitive In A Global Economy,” Terry McAuliffe For Governor, Accessed 8/27/13)

McAuliffe Would Like To Move To A State Exchange For ObamaCare, But Does Not Identify How He Would Pay For It. “A Virginia exchange. Terry believes that we should have implemented a state run exchange when we had the chance. Now that a plan for a modified version of a federally-administered exchange is being developed, Virginia should continue to move incrementally toward Virginia control while learning from our peer states‟ implementation efforts.” (“Terry‟s Platform: Keeping Virginia Competitive In A Global Economy,” Terry

McAuliffe For Governor, Accessed 8/27/13)

TOURISM McAuliffe Promised Increased Unspecified Funding For Virginia’s Tourism Industry. “Virginia is for Lovers – and tourists. Tourism is already a $20.4 billion industry in Virginia. We need to commit greater resources toward expanding this asset.” (“Terry‟s Platform: Keeping Virginia Competitive In A Global Economy,” Terry McAuliffe For Governor,

McAULIFFE SAVINGS

Terry McAuliffe Expects Medicaid Expansion To “Free Up $500 Million A Year” McAuliffe Said Medicaid Expansion Would “Free Up $500 Million A Year.” “McAuliffe said his plan to increase teacher pay could be financed by expanding Virginia‟s Medicaid program to accept new federal funds to cover up to 400,000 uninsured people. The expansion would free up $500 million a year in the state‟s general fund, and he would invest it in public education, McAuliffe said.” (Ray Reed, “In Lynchburg, McAuliffe Calls For End To

SOL Tests,” The News & Advance, 9/4/13)

But The Liberal Commonwealth Institute & Chmura Analytics Peg Projected New Tax Revenues As A Result Of Medicaid Expansion To Average Between $50 And $60 Million Each Year According To The Liberal Commonwealth Institute, Medicaid Expansion Will Generate $530 Million In State Income & Sales Tax Revenue Between 2014 & 2022. “The federal funds for Medicaid expansion would also support about 23,000 health care sector employees generating an additional $530 million in state income and sales tax revenue through 2022.” (Massey Whorley & Michael Cassidy, “Medicaid Expansion Would Pay For Itself,” The Commonwealth

Institute, August 2013)

Chmura Economics & Analytics Estimates Medicaid Expansion To Provide $303.6 Million In New Revenues Between FY14-19 In The Next Six Years, An Average Of $50.6 Million Per Year. “Table 5.4: Estimated Budgetary Impact (Average 2014-2019, $ Million)… Health Care Sector Impact… Individual Income Tax $34.3 Corporate Income Tax $6.0 Business Impact Sales Tax $0.1 Individual Income Tax $0.3 Corporate Income Tax $0.2 Household Impact Sales Tax $4.0 Individual Income Tax $3.3 Corporate Income Tax $2.4.” (Christopher S. Bailey, “The Economic Impact Of The Medicaid Expansion On Virginia‟s Economy,” Chmura Economics & Analytics, 12/7/12)

Contingent Upon Medicaid Expansion, A Budget Compromise In 2013 Created A Fund To Capture Any General Fund Savings For Medicaid Expansion In The Short-Term To Help Pay For Medicaid Expansion In The Long-Term A 2013 Budget Compromise Allowed For The Creation Of The Virginia Health Reform & Innovation Fund To Be Established On The Condition Of Medicaid Expansion. This Fund Would Capture General Fund Budget Savings Until The Department Of Planning & Budget Determines That General Fund Expenses Incurred From Coverage Of Newly Eligible Individuals Exceeds Associated Savings. Should This Fund Be Utilized, There Will Be No Budget Savings For Other Priorities, Limiting McAuliffe To The Use Of New Tax Revenues From Expansion. (Virginia State Budget, Conference Report Amendment 307 20c, “Provide Authority For

Medicaid Reform & Expansion,” leg2.state.va.us, Accessed 10/7/13; See 7a & b)

The Commonwealth Institute Relies On Capturing Medicaid Expansion Savings To Justify Expansion. “To help offset future costs, the 2013 General Assembly created a special fund to hold the savings from expansion. This would allow for the $1.64 billion in savings from expansion to offset the $1.60 billion in state costs. Taking this action would help ensure that the state is financially prepared to assume its share of expansion costs and relieve other state budget pressures on key priorities like public safety or education.” (Massey

Whorley & Michael Cassidy, “Medicaid Expansion Would Pay For Itself,” The Commonwealth Institute, August 2013)

McAULIFFE HAS REFUSED TO SAY HOW MUCH HIS PLANS COST

McAuliffe Has Refused To Say How Much His Plans Would Cost, But Admitted That Without Medicaid Expansion, There’s Not Money To Be Spent The Associated Press: “...Pressed To Say How Much His Public Education Funding Plan Would Cost, [McAuliffe] Couldn’t, Saying Only That Medicaid Expansion Was Necessary To Free Up State Money For It.” (“Virginia Candidates For Governor Square Off In Influential Prime-Time Televised Debate,” The Associated Press, 9/25/13) McAuliffe Said “There’s Not Money To Be Spent” For His Budget Proposals If Medicaid Expansion Is Not Passed. BEN PERSHING: “Mr. McAuliffe, you proposed spending more money on teacher salaries, on pre-K education, on community colleges. Now we haven‟t heard quite enough specifics to put an exact price tag on it. But we‟re wondering how exactly would you pay for that, especially if the General Assembly doesn‟t approve Medicaid expansion?” MCAULIFFE: “Very important question. And what I‟ve said is responsible budgeting. First of all, when I‟m governor, we‟re gonna look at the efficiencies we can bring to the government. And then we‟re gonna work together to get that Medicaid expansion. If we don‟t get the Medicaid expansion, we can‟t bring in the efficiencies, then I agree with you. There‟s not money to be spent.”

(Virginia Gubernatorial Debate, McLean, Va., 9/25/13)

McAULIFFE’S SPENDING PROPOSALS ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE OR REALISTIC

The Washington Post Has Already Pointed Out That McAuliffe’s Plan To Increase Education Funding With Funds Made Available From Medicaid Expansion Is “Not Sustainable Or Realistic” McAuliffe Wants To Pay For Increases In Education Funding With Temporary State Funds That Will Be Available If The Medicaid Expansion Passes. “McAuliffe, the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, wants to spend more on pre-kindergarten education, community colleges and other programs. In a state resistant to tax increases, where would he find even the relatively small amounts of money he‟d like to marshal? Mr. McAuliffe‟s answer sounds counterintuitive: Expand Virginia‟s Medicaid program…” (Editorial,

“Medicaid‟s No Cure-All For McAuliffe‟s Budget Plan,” The Washington Post, 9/20/13)

“Counting On [Medicaid Expansion] As A Revenue Source… Poses Several Problems.” “Some economists argue that states that expand their Medicaid system will reap a revenue windfall even beyond the direct federal support. One reason: States would no longer have to pick up the tab for emergency-room care for those who are newly covered by Medicaid. Another: The increased Medicaid spending would generate jobs and, therefore,

income-tax revenue. Counting on this program as a revenue source to fund a broad economic agenda poses several problems.” (Editorial, “Medicaid‟s No Cure-All For McAuliffe‟s Budget Plan,” The Washington Post, 9/20/13) The Washington Post: Expanding Medicaid Is “Not A Sustainable Or Realistic Way To Finance” McAuliffe’s Proposed Spending Increases. “Expanding Medicaid is the right thing to do. But it is not a sustainable or realistic way to finance new spending in other areas.” (Editorial, “Medicaid‟s No Cure-All For McAuliffe‟s Budget

Plan,” The Washington Post, 9/20/13)

The Washington Post: “Future Governors Would Have To Cut Back On Mr. McAuliffe’s Higher Funding Levels For Education Or Find Another Source Of Revenue. And even estimates of an eight-year windfall may be optimistic.” (Editorial, “Medicaid‟s No Cure-All For McAuliffe‟s Budget Plan,” The Washington Post, 9/20/13)

The Vice Chairman Of The Panel Exploring Medicaid Expansion In Virginia Says It’s Unlikely Virginia Will Be In A Position To Move Forward On Medicaid Expansion In The Near Future Del. Steve Landes, Vice Chairman Of A Panel Exploring Medicaid Expansion In Virginia, Said It Could Take Months Or Years To Determine If Medicaid Has Been Sufficiently Reformed To Merit Expansion. “The vice chairman of a panel exploring Medicaid reform and expansion in Virginia told fellow House Republicans this week that the program is unlikely to be broadened anytime soon. It could take months, if not years, to determine if the federal-state health-care program has been sufficiently reformed to merit expansion, Del. Steve Landes (R-Augusta) said in a confidential memo to his caucus.” (Laura Vozzella, “Virginia Medicaid Panel Member
