SOUTH KINGSTOWN � The state Labor Relations Board has issued a preliminary determination upholding an unfair labor practice complaint by the University of Rhode Island�s faculty union.

Robyn Golden, relations board administrator, confirmed the preliminary order on Tuesday and said that the board has reviewed the facts of the case, including testimony, and decided that there was a violation as stated in the complaint.

Golden said the board�s lawyer will now draft the order, which goes before the Labor Relations Board at an unspecified date. In her 11 years with the board, Golden said, there have been times when the board reversed itself, but it�s uncommon.

No details of the decision were available Tuesday, but Frank Annunziato, executive director of the American Association of University Professors, a 700-person faculty union, said the union�s lawyer confirmed the decision.

The union filed the complaint last May after the then-Board of Governors for Higher Education rejected a three-year contract calling for annual 3-percent raises. In its complaint, the union charges that the board failed to ratify its contract with the union in a timely manner.

The union had argued that the board broke the law by refusing to ratify a contract that the board had supported until Governor Chafee asked them to reject it.

�We�re happy that the board has sustained our complaint,� Annunziato said. �We�d like to have some stability.�

Annunziato said Tuesday that both sides had reached a tentative agreement more than a year ago and the union was ready to vote on the proposal. But the Board of Higher Education refused after the governor told them to vote against it, according to Annunziato.

�We claimed they had welshed on the agreement,� he said Tuesday. �We said that constitutes an unfair labor practice.�

The Rhode Island Department of Education and the state Board of Education declined to comment on the ruling, stating that they had not received notification from the Labor Relations Board. Governor Chafee also did not return a request for comment.

The URI faculty filed an unfair labor practice charge against the then-Board of Governors for Higher Education last May, shortly after the board rejected a three-year contract. (That board has since been disbanded and its role has been assumed by the Board of Education).

The complaint asked the Labor Relations Board to order the Board of Governors to ratify the contract with the American Association of University Professors. Annunziato claims that the Board of Governors reneged on its promise to ratify a contract that called for 3-percent raises for each of the contract�s three years.

Annunziato said the Board of Governors had reached a tentative agreement with the faculty and agreed to put it in writing until Chafee intervened and told the board to reject the raises.

At the time, Chafee said he was encouraged that the board voted against the contract �at a time when Rhode Islanders are struggling and when other employees are making a daily sacrifice to help the state remain fiscally healthy.�

Then-Board of Governors Chairman Lorne Adrain had fought for contract�s approval but was unsuccessful. The board last spring also rejected three other contracts that called for 3-percent raises for URI graduate student assistants, and separate staff associations at Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island.

According to Annunziato, faculty salaries are affecting the university�s ability to recruit and retain highly qualified staff. He said the faculty has been working without a new contact since 2010 and that members haven�t had a raise in four years.

�If you look at other land-grant universities in New England,�� he said, �we are last (in faculty salary) except for the University of Maine in Orono. Our national organization does a survey every year. Of all of the major research institutions, we are in the lowest quintile across the board. It�s a dire situation here.�

The University of Connecticut recently announced that it plans to hire 600 new faculty members. At the Storrs campus, the University of Connecticut has more than 2,000 faculty members to URI�s 700, Annunziato said.
