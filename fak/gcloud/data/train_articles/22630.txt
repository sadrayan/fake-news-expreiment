2724 Pacific Avenue
Renowned as one of the most significant properties in San Francisco, this legendary estate truly represents the best of City living.

The mansion’s ambiance is decidedly elegant — worthy of entertaining international dignitaries — yet eminently livable, with a succession of spacious rooms that flow easily from one to the other for comfortable daily living. Many fabulous events, both large-scale and intimate family-friendly, have been hosted at the residence over the years.

The home’s setting is the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance — a pinnacle location in Pacific Heights on almost two-thirds of an acre with a 142-foot frontage and a rear perimeter of 191 feet. Glorious formal gardens and terraces wrap around the entire home, while iconic views of San Francisco Bay provide an unrivaled backdrop.

This truly incomparable world-class estate was originally designed by architect E. A. Hermann in 1894 for Captain Hermann Meyer and his wife and eight children. The home has been masterfully renovated over the years to restore its magnificent architectural qualities while ensuring the best of 21st century living.

Making a commanding first impression, the architecture reflects Queen Anne style — with its asymmetrical shape, round tower, and steeply pitched roof lines. True to its character are classical embellishments that include Ionic columns, fluted pilasters, and dentil moldings — all blended with a color palette deemed historically authentic.

Elaborate wall and ceiling moldings support layers of millwork, intricate patterns of parquetry grace the hardwood floors, and soaring windows at every turn bathe the rooms in natural light. Towering three levels above the street, the four-level, 13,500+/- square-foot floor plan is comprised of seven bedrooms, grand public rooms, numerous flexible-use rooms, plus an amazing, one-of-a-kind glass solarium.

Adding layers of privacy are gated pedestrian and auto entrances, yet beyond the sanctuary afforded within the gates, the pulse of The City is ever apparent outside with its sense of energy, diversity, and excitement that only urban living can offer. Exceptional culinary experiences, boutique shopping, parks for tennis and recreation, and a tapestry of sidewalks for jogging and dog walking are all just moments away. Providing a sense of peaceful seclusion with a setting reminiscent of a country estate, this legendary residence is a world-class destination to call home.
