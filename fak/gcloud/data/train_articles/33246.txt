Gloria Allred withdraws from Summer Zervos' case against Trump
(CNN) Women's rights attorney Gloria Allred has withdrawn from representing Summer Zervos in her defamation suit against President Donald Trump.

"Our withdrawal has nothing to do with the merits of her case against President Trump," Allred said. "We will have no comment regarding the reasons for our firm's withdrawal. We continue to wish Summer the very best in her pursuit of justice."

Zervos said in a statement Friday that she "decided to part ways with Gloria Allred purely for personal reasons, having nothing to do with her work as my attorney.

"I look forward to having my day in court with my current legal team. I will have no further comment on this matter," Zervos said.

Zervos, a former contestant on NBC's "The Apprentice," filed a defamation suit against Trump in January 2017, alleging that he defamed her after calling her a liar when she publicly accused him of sexual misconduct.
