Another justice leaving Florida Supreme Court

FOR THE RECORD - ********** CORRECTION OR CLARIFICATION PUBLISHED JUNE 5, 2008 ********** Because of an editing error, an article on Page B3 of the May 24 Local & State section about the resignation of Florida Supreme Court Justice Kenneth B. Bell misstated the medical condition of Terri Schiavo, a Pinellas County woman who died in 2005 after the removal of her feeding tube. Schiavo, whose case was considered by the court, was severely brain-damaged but was not brain-dead. *************************************************************************

Justice Kenneth B. Bell said he would leave the court Oct. 1, marking the second departure this year of a conservative justice appointed by former Gov. Jeb Bush.

TALLAHASSEE -- Gov. Charlie Crist was handed the chance Friday to re-shape the Florida Supreme Court after the second justice in three months announced he would resign from the bench.

Bell, 52, was appointed in December 2002. In a letter to Crist on Friday, he cited "family reasons" for wanting to return to his hometown of Pensacola. Justice Raoul G. Cantero expressed a similar concern when he announced earlier this year he wanted to move his family back to his hometown of Miami.

"I wish I could continue to serve," Bell wrote. "However . . . my family responsibilities require that I return full-time to Pensacola."

Combined with age restrictions that will force out two more judges next year, Crist will be able to name four justices to the seven-member court in his first term -- assuming he doesn't leave office to serve as John McCain's vice president.

"Historically, I don't think a governor's been in that position before," said retired Justice Stephen Grimes, a lawyer with Holland & Knight in Tallahassee. "He's got some heavy decisions to make."

Bell, the first appointed justice from west of Tallahassee since 1917, and Cantero, 47, are the court's two youngest justices.

In addition to naming them, Bush, along with the late Gov. Lawton Chiles, named current Justice Peggy Quince, slated to take over next month as the court's first black female chief justice.

Chiles has the record -- appointing five justices to the court -- but those nominations were spread out over his nearly eight years in office. Before 1975, justices were elected, not appointed.

Although Crist is more of a political centrist than Bush, Grimes said he didn't expect the governor's nominees to tilt the balance of the court drastically.

In a statement, Crist dodged the bigger-picture implications and called Bell "well-liked and respected by all who served alongside him."

Bell and Cantero were the court's staunchest conservatives. Both opposed the court's 4-3 ruling in 2006 that struck down Bush's "opportunity scholarship" private-school voucher program for children who attended failing schools.

But they both joined the majority in 2005, overruling efforts by Bush and the Legislature to reinsert a feeding tube in Terri Schiavo, a brain-dead Clearwater woman who died 13 days after the tube was removed.

Crist hasn't yet nominated a replacement for Cantero, whose resignation is effective in September, and it could be the end of the year before he names successors. Crist will make his picks in each vacancy from three to six finalists recommended by the Supreme Court Nominating Commission from a field of applicants.

The constitutional retirement age of 71 will force Justices Harry Anstead and Charles Wells of Orlando to leave the court in 2009.
