Canadian artist IronKite used this mastodon-excavation phototaken in 2000 in Hyde Park, New Yorkas the basis for his entry in an online photo-manipulation contest.The altered photo lies behind persistent Internet rumors, spread since 2004, of archaeologists unearthing ancient human giants.IronKite digitally superimposed a human skeleton over the mastodon-dig photo, he told National Geographic News in December 2007.The artist later added a man holding a shovel. His clothing was re-colored to match that of the man in the above, authentic picture. The goal, IronKite said, was to make the shoveler appear to be part of the excavation team.
