Learn more about NIKE, Inc. contract manufacturing network and countries where we do business

About this site

Virtually all NIKE, Inc. materials and finished products are sourced from, or manufactured by, independent suppliers that also make or provide products for other global companies. That means that NIKE does not own, operate or employ workers at these locations. NIKE also has license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell products using NIKE-owned trademarks.

The suppliers featured on this map are those used by NIKE, Inc., licensees or agents to manufacture finished goods, as well as materials suppliers.

The NIKE, Inc. company portfolio includes Nike, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. The data on this site is reflective of, and can be filtered by, Nike (which includes the Jordan Brand), Converse and Hurley.

Contract factories that manufacture finished goods for NIKE, Inc. provide the data, which is then validated when audits are performed during the year. These suppliers are required to adhere to a rigorous set of compliance standards, including NIKEâ€™s Code of Conduct and Code Leadership Standards. This site is updated quarterly.
