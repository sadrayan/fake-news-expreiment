County exec. candidates weigh in on fate of Domes
Candidates for Milwaukee County executive are weighing in on the fate of the ailing Mitchell Park Domes.

Incumbent County Executive Chris Abele said he doesn’t plan to rush a decision on the future of the Domes until taxpayers have had ample time to make their own points.

“If the residents say, 'Hey, county, tear down the Domes.' If the residents say they don't want to rebuild the Domes, I'm not going to tell them they're wrong,” said Abele.

The county is researching options for the Domes.

Abele suggested an amphitheater as a replacement for the attraction.

“It would be a big draw and cost a ton less,” he said.

Abele’s opponent, State Sen. Chris Larson, is determined to save the Domes.

“I was at the public hearing last week,” said Larson. “I heard from hundreds of our neighbors who made it perfectly clear they want to make sure that this legacy continues.”

He called the Domes part of the county’s “heritage.”

“I think the question is, we need to do what we can to preserve them for the next generation,” Larson said.
