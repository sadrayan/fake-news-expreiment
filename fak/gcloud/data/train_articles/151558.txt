On Memorial Day, Trump Honors ‘Our Heroes’ at Arlington
WASHINGTON — President Trump paid tribute to and mourned the loss of fallen soldiers on Monday with a traditional Memorial Day visit to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, vowing that “we will never forget our heroes.”

After laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns on a gray and unseasonably cool day, Mr. Trump addressed a cheering crowd that included Gold Star families, honoring “the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom.”

Mr. Trump spoke of the soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors who came from “every generation, from towering cities and windswept prairies, from privilege and from poverty,” but were united in arms and in their sacrifice.

And he singled out several of them for praise. He recognized former Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, who was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in January, and Ray Chavez, a Navy veteran and the oldest living survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
