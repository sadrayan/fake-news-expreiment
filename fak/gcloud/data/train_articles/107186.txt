His research and teaching interests are in the area of Nigerian politics, political Islam, and ethnic politics. His first book, Muslims Talking Politics: Islam, Democracy, and Law in Northern Nigeria, was published in 2016 by the University of Chicago Press; it explores the emergence of popular demands for the expansion of Islamic law in new Muslim-majority democracies. His second, Boko Haram (co-authored w/Carmen McCain), will be published in November 2018 by Ohio University Press; it is an accessible social history of the Boko Haram insurgency and its impact on Nigerian politics, society, and popular culture. His most recent work focuses on the perils of ethno-religious powersharing in uncertain African democracies.

Dr. Kendhammer has lived and conducted research in Cameroon and Nigeria, and was a Fulbright Fellow in Nigeria in 2007-08, based at Usmanu Danfodiyo University in Sokoto. His work has appeared in many academic journals, including Nationalism and Ethnic Politics, Comparative Politics, Journal of Human Rights, and Ethnic and Racial Studies.

He speaks regularly on these subjects to government and international media.
