Subject: Renewed inquiry for a fact check, Austin American-Statesman

Senator Buckingham:

Hello again.

I am sharing below information provided by a spokeswoman for the Travis County sheriff’s office, which says that 34 were released, not hundreds. Senator, if you have other information or comment, I’d be glad to hear from you soon. I am inquiring on behalf of the PolitiFact Texas fact-checking project.

As I told Keith today, we seek on-the-record comment and information, without restrictions.

"Residents of Travis County need to know that the Travis County Sheriff's Office has ignored hundreds of requests to detain inmates suspected to have committed violent crimes while being in our country illegally."
