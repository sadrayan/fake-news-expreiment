President Obama concluded a star-studded evening of fundraising in Los Angeles Wednesday, appearing with singer Cher, actresses Ellen DeGeneres and Julia Roberts, and "Glee" stars Jane Lynch and Darrin Criss, among others.

In L.A. for two fundraisers (one for LGBT activists), Obama lauded the progress the country has made on gay rights — telling a story about a straight Marine who thanked him for ending the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy of the U.S. military.

“I could not be prouder of the work that we’ve done on behalf of the LGBT community,” said Obama in front of a crowd of about 600 at the Beverly Wilshire hotel.

Criss and DeGeneres introduced Obama, and the president was joined by L.A. mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, California Attorney General Kamala Harris, Cher, actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson of Modern Family and others.

At a second, smaller fundraiser at the home of Fox's "Glee" creator Ryan Murphy, Obama joked that he would not be breaking into song.

He was joined at that fundraiser by Witherspoon Banana Republic/Gap Inc. president Jack Calhoun, Glee actress Jane Lynch, and HBO executive Michael Lombardo.

"The key in 2012 is going to be how badly do we want it. Are we willing to fight for that vision with even greater determination than we did in 2008," Obama told supporters, who each pay $25,000 a ticket.

Obama wraps up his fundraising tour with a fundraising breakfast in L.A. on Thursday — a two day swing that is expected to bring in at least $5.3 million for his reelection bid.
