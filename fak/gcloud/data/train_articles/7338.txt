Megyn to Rand Paul: Why Weren't You First to Announce a 2016 Run?
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was on “The Kelly File” tonight to react to the news that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) will seek the Republican nominee for president in 2016.

Megyn Kelly asked Paul about some of his supporters who were in the audience at Cruz’s announcement, sporting “Stand With Rand” shirts.

“We were glad to see them there and organized and excited about the possibility of me running,” he said.

Paul said that he didn’t hear much that he disagreed with during Cruz’s speech today.

“We kind of come from the same wing of the party,” he said. “If you look at our voting records, you’ll find that we’re very, very similar.”

The Kentucky senator said that he and Cruz are different in their approach to growing the Republican Party. Paul explained that he tries to bring in new people through the messages of liberty and the Bill of Rights.

Kelly asked Paul why Cruz beat him to an announcement.

“Why weren’t you first?” she asked.

Paul told Kelly that he’s thinking about a 2016 run and will make an announcement soon. He also discussed early polling and the likelihood that the Republican nominee will go up against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.

“Nobody is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself,” Paul said of early polling numbers.

The Kentucky senator said that the GOP nominee must go after the Clintons and their corruption. He added that Hillary Clinton should be called out for not being a consistent defender of women’s rights.

“We won’t win unless we do aggressively combat her and make sure that she has to explain her record as well,” he said.
