We’re Not Renaming the Vagina
Dear Readers,

Some people are under the impression that Healthline is now using the term “front hole” instead of vagina. This is simply not true.

As one of the world’s leading health websites, we place a huge emphasis on standards of accuracy, integrity, and balance. Every article we publish undergoes a rigorous editorial process and extensive medical review.

In the LGBTQIA Safe Sex Guide, we use both front hole and vagina. “Front hole” is one of the numerous, accepted terms for genitalia we use specifically for certain members of the trans community who identify with it. In no instance in this guide are we saying we want to replace the word vagina.

“Front hole,” as another term for vagina, is also used by the National Institutes of Health, Human Rights Campaign, BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth journal, and Fenway Health in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, the National LGBT Health Education Center, and the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers.

In addition to scientific, clinical terminology, we also use unbiased, inclusive, and contemporary terms in order to best serve all our readers.

The LGBTQIA Safe Sex Guide was created for a specific audience. Nothing in the article indicates we’re endorsing a change in verbiage. It’s clear in its purpose to present unbiased, expert-backed content toward health seekers in the LGBTQIA community. Simply put, our purpose in creating this guide was to provide safe sex information for those who are so often left out of this conversation.

Healthline is proud to be an active participant in the ongoing discussion about sexual health and well-being.

Healthline Team
