Amazon is nearing a deal to put part of its second headquarters in New York City, in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, The New York Times reported on Monday. The other part of HQ2 will reportedly be in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia.

The deal seems to have taken months of deliberating on Amazon's part, as well as plenty of promises from New York politicians.

"I am doing everything I can," Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters on Monday of his attempts to woo Amazon. "We have a great incentive package."

He added: "I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes."

According to The Times and the New York Daily News, these incentives could include hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies.
