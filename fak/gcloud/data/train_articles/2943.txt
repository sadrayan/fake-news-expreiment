Donald Trump & Congressman Heck share a reckless anti-immigrant agenda that would tear families apart



On issue after issue, Congressman Heck shares Trump’s dangerous and reckless agenda

Las Vegas, NV – Tomorrow, Donald Trump will reportedly announce his candidate for Vice-President. But no matter whom Trump picks, he already has an ideological soul mate on the Republican ticket with him in Nevada, Congressman Heck. Yesterday, the Cortez Masto campaign released a report highlighting how on issue after issue, Donald Trump and Congressman Heck share the same reckless agenda that is good for the special interests funding their campaigns but devastating for Nevada families.

It’s no wonder Congressman Heck says he has “high hopes” for Donald Trump – they share the same policy agenda. Just on the issue of immigration alone, it is next to impossible to find a policy difference between Trump and Congressman Heck.

Both Donald Trump and Congressman Heck:

· Opposed the 2013 Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill.

· Would stop DACA & DAPA, risking deportation for millions of immigrants.

· Would end birthright citizenship and repeal the 14th Amendment.

· Opposes the DREAM Act and providing immigrants access to education.

· Praised Arizona’s immigration law that would promote racial profiling.

· Campaigned with Joe Arpaio, who is best known for inhumane treatment of immigrants.

“Donald Trump and Congressman Heck’s anti-immigrant agenda would tear families apart and keep millions of undocumented immigrants in the shadows,” said Zach Hudson, spokesperson for Catherine Cortez Masto for Senate. “As Nevada’s next Senator, Catherine Cortez Masto will work with Republicans and Democrats to solve problems like keeping families together and finally passing comprehensive immigration reform. In contrast, Congressman Heck shares Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant policies that would be devastating for Nevada families.”
