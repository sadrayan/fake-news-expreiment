Dan Kohl Announces Campaign for Congress
Will challenge the most partisan member of the House.

Today business executive and non-profit leader Dan Kohl announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in Wisconsin’s 6th Congressional District, and released the following statement:

“I’m 51 years old and I cannot remember a time when people in this country were so anxious about the present and so concerned about their futures and their children’s future.

I’m running for Congress because Washington is broken, and our Congressman puts his party’s priorities ahead of our priorities. Our district is currently represented by the single most partisan member of the House, and that hasn’t helped create a single job here in Wisconsin. We can and must do better.

We need leaders who will focus on common sense solutions, expanding opportunity, and getting things done. Now, more than ever, we need elected leaders who will fight for the many, and not just the few at the very top.

I’m not a career politician and I don’t profess to have all the answers. What I can tell you is that I will work hard, stand up for our values, and get things done for the people of the district.”

In the coming months, Dan will be engaging, listening to, and learning from residents at a series of public events and informal listening opportunities in each county of the 6th District.
