Candidates
Who really wrote Shakespeare's plays?



Recent calculations suggest that there are more than 66 individual candidates.

These eight candidates are perhaps the most-well known:

Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban, (1561- 1626) Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (?1550- ?1604), Christopher Marlowe (1564- ?1593), Sir Henry Neville (1562- 1615), Mary Sidney Herbert, Countess of Pembroke (1561- 1621), William Shakspere (1564- 1616), William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby (1561- 1642). There is also a group theory relating to the authorship of the plays.
