CNN Denies Reports That Network Accidentally Aired 30 Minutes of Porn
CNN has denied reports that the network accidentally aired 30 minutes of hardcore pornography on Thursday night.

According to multiple news outlets including The Independent, viewers in Boston, Massachusetts, who were watching the newest episode of “Anthony Bourain’s Parts Unknown” got a rude awakening when explicit material starring adult transsexual actress Riley Quinn was played instead.

The publication claimed the error stemmed from RCN, a local cable TV provider in New Jersey that provides CNN for the city.

“Despite media reports to the contrary, RCN assures us that there was no interruption of CNN’s programming in the Boston area last night,” a CNN spokesperson told TheWrap.

According to The Independent, only viewers in Boston experienced the mistake. One viewer expressed her concerns on Twitter, “I can’t wait until [RCN] wakes up [tomorrow] & realizes that hardcore porn was broadcast on [CNN] instead of [Parts Unknown] tonight,” user @Solikearose wrote on Twitter, who has since deleted her account because “weirdos sending me hate mail in the wake of # bourdainporn,” she added.

Reps for RCN have not yet responded to TheWrap’s request for comment.
