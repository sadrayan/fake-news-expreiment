Hillary Clinton wins over a voter
Story highlights Hillary Clinton is a lifelong Methodist, but she rarely speaks -- at least at any length -- about her faith.

Rev. Frederick Donnie Hunt at Main Street Bakery was won over by Clinton's religious knowledge.

Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) Hillary Clinton is a lifelong Methodist, but you wouldn't know that by listening to most of her speeches. She rarely speaks -- at least at any length -- about her faith.

But the presidential candidate broke with that tradition on Wednesday when she reflected on her religious study and background, during an impromptu conversation with Rev. Frederick Donnie Hunt at Main Street Bakery.

Hunt came to the yellow-walled bakery to enjoy a sweet treat while he studied the Bible, unaware -- he said after -- that a presidential candidate was about to visit. His quiet reflection was abruptly turned upside down when around 20 press and campaign staff rolled into the bakery with Clinton.

"We are heading out of town and we were told to stop by and get some good stuff to take with us," Clinton said as she walked through the door, flanked by dozens of cupcakes and cakes.

After chatting with the bakery's staff and picking out some cupcakes for the road, the presidential candidate sidled up to Hunt and asked him what he was studying.
