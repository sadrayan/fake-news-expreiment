Suspect Arrested For Bedford Co. Shooting Spree
SHELBYVILLE, Tenn. - Deputies with the Bedford County Sheriffâ€™s Office said the man responsible for shooting several churches there has been arrested and put behind bars.

The suspect was identified as 35-year-old Wendell Buchanan.

Officials said Buchanan shot at several church buildings using what was believed to be a high powered assault rifle.

Workers at the Horse Mountain Church of Christ said their building was shot at on at least two different nights.

Two other churches, a University of Tennessee extension office, and several Charter Communications cable boxes were also damaged by gunfire.

Investigators said they got a good description of the suspect's car. When Buchanan was seen driving by one of the damaged churches Saturday, an officer with the Shelbyville Police Department pulled him over and arrested him.
