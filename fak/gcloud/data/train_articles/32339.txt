Mike DeWine and Richard Cordray debate in Cleveland: An issue-by-issue recap
CLEVELAND, Ohio — Mike DeWine and Richard Cordray covered plenty of ground on Monday night during the third and final debate between the candidates for Ohio governor.

The issues were wide-ranging in the hour-long debate, held at Cleveland State University’s Glasscock Auditorium and sponsored by the Ohio Debate Commission. And as is often the case, the answers the candidates gave didn’t necessarily match the questions they were asked.

DeWine, a Republican and Cordray, a Democrat, are running to succeed outgoing Republican Gov. John Kasich, who is term-limited. The election is on Nov. 6.

Here’s a run-down of what topics were discussed on Monday.
