The rise of the terrorist group ISIS in Mosul, Tikrit, and other villages in Iraq has overwhelmed the country’s government and military.

Burning down villages, executing civilians and soldiers, they have created a reign of terror that U.S. Armed Forces fought and died to end. Iraq veterans have begun to question whether their sacrifices were worth the cause.

And new information about the brutal leader of ISIS is not bound to make the U.S. government’s actions regarding Iraq look any better: from 2005 until 2009, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was in U.S. custody at our now-closed Camp Bucca near Umm Qasr in Iraq, Examiner reports.

In 2003, following the initial invasion into Iraq, some reports suggest Baghdadi was drawn into the emerging al Qaeda forces and, quickly rising through the terrorism network, became known for the atrocities he and his followers committed. Via Examiner:

There, presiding over his own sharia court, he gained a reputation for brutality, publicly executing those suspected of aiding the US-led coalition forces – the same brutality that has become familiar to those living in Syria under his group’s control. During his rise to power in the leadership of al-Qaida in Iraq in 2010 – and later of Isis – he murdered prominent Sunnis as well as Shia civilians in bombings.

He was released by President Obama from the Iraqi prison in 2009, and since then he’s had time to form a plan and collect and train an army of terrorists – an estimated 7,000 men.

Late last year Baghdadi announced that he was creating a new group to be merged with a rival al Qaeda affiliate, active in Syria.

The President and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in their short-sighted attempts to make good on campaign promises, have unleashed a monster unto the people of Iraq who worked so hard to help the Americans free their nation. Baghdadi is not only a threat to Iraqis, but also to our country and our way of life.
