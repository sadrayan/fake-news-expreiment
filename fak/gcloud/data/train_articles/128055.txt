What it's like inside the secret, members-only club hidden in Disneyland
Welcome to your dream experience. Instagram/Disneyland33member If you're looking for the ultimate exclusive Disney experience, visiting Club 33 in Disneyland is it.

Located in the center of New Orleans Square, now at 33 Orleans Street, the club is a members-only dining experience consisting of the restaurant and the jazz lounge Le Salon Nouveau. Members also get access to the 1901 Lounge in California Adventure. It's also the only place to serve alcohol in the California park.

The club was originally designed as a place for Walt Disney to entertain guests and business associates, but he died about five months before it was officially opened.

The invite-only membership has a waitlist that has been opened and closed over the years due to high demand. According to one Club 33 member, there is a $25,000 to $100,000 initiation fee and $12,500 to $30,000 annual fee, depending on the level of membership.

The whole experience is super secretive, but one Club 33 member, who runs an Instagram account dedicated to photos of the exclusive experience, shared some pictures with us.
