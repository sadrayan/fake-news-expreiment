Age of Congress: How young Democrats are shaping the House leadership fight
There’s a new crop of lawmakers starting on Capitol Hill today, some who are three generations removed from current Democratic leadership. That divide — set to be the largest in more than 50 years — had an insurgent group of younger Democrats calling for change at the top.

But it did not prevent California Rep. Nancy Pelosi from returning as speaker — the first to reclaim the gavel in decades. Pelosi, Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Rep. James Clyburn (S.C.), the top three House Democrats, all in their late 70s, are poised to return to the top three slots in Democratic leadership.

[Does Pelosi have the votes to become speaker?]

While no Democrat emerged to challenge Pelosi, at least 11 freshmen indicated they would not back her for speaker. In the end, most incumbents who had opposed Pelosi struck a term limits deal that would allow her to serve for four more years, giving her the necessary votes.
