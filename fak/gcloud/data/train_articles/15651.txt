When David spoke of “gay and lesbian rights” he wasn’t just referring to marriage equality rulings. There are other rights being adjudicated. I am sure that this is something from the Human Rights Campaign. Sorry for the delay. But I needed to talk to him and that just happened.

Subject: RE: Claim unsupported?

We presume that when someone speaks, they have factual backup. Fire my way?

Nothing in the words before or after his remark referenced anything but gay marriage.

David is a careful and measured thinker. Gay and lesbian rights is widely understood to mean more than just the right to marry.
