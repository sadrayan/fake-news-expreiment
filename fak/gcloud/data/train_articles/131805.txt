WASHINGTON (WNB) - The Obama administration issued a press release Wednesday night in response to photos circulating the internet showing Vice President Biden molesting the wife of new Department of Defense head Ashton Carter.

"To call Vice President Biden's warm interaction with his guest anything other than congenial and proper would be incorrect. The Vice President is well known for exuding an affectionate playfulness that personifies his unique ability to put anyone at ease," said the statement.

Critics say the press release didn't go far enough in explaining why Biden's pants were down or why he apparently unclasped Mrs. Carters' bra.
