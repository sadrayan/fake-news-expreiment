Is the Sea Level Stable at Aden, Yemen?
3.1 Data Analysis for Aden

The data of Aden, Yemen are the only long-term tide gauge record to consider understanding the sea-level rise in the Arabian Peninsula. Aden has data collected over a sufficiently long-time window, starting in 1879 and ending in 2013, despite many gaps. The single record is the composition of five different sets of data misaligned, very likely obtained from different tide gauges in different locations. Data are available from PSMSL ( 2017b The data of Aden, Yemen are the only long-term tide gauge record to consider understanding the sea-level rise in the Arabian Peninsula. Aden has data collected over a sufficiently long-time window, starting in 1879 and ending in 2013, despite many gaps. The single record is the composition of five different sets of data misaligned, very likely obtained from different tide gauges in different locations. Data are available from PSMSL () (Station ID: 44, Latitude: 12.788333, Longitude: 44.974167, Time span of data: 1879–2013, Completeness (%): 50).

PSMSL has two sets of data. The first is “ metric ”, basically raw data. The second is data with historical adjustments not properly documented, the “ revised local reference ” (RLR), where PSMSL reduces the data set to a common reference point and re-aligns the data that were often misaligned to produce a long record.

While adjustments are certainly necessary to produce a tide gauge record that may be analysed to infer a trend of the local relative sea level, the way that the alignment is performed may introduce rising or decreasing trends even where the true sea level is oscillating without any trend. How can we perform a proper alignment of data when there are gaps of years and the tide gauge has been moved, destroyed, or replaced? It is hard to say, as there is usually no extra information to lead to a correct decision.

Data from PSMSL (PSMSL), downloaded September 12, 2017 The metric data for Aden, Yemen, Fig.a, b, clearly show 5 sets of misaligned measurements: 1879–1893; 1916–1933; 1937–1956; 1957–1969; 2007–2013.

There may be other misalignments, as the sections of the older Aden data are taken from the several editions of the Publications Scientifiques (Pub Sci) which are available as pdfs on the PSMSL website. They are for: 1879–93 (A), 1916–1933 (D1), 1937–1956 (D2), 1957–1958 (E), 1959–1960 (F), and 1960–1964 (G). There is no information about the origin of the data 1964–1969. The letters refer to the editions of the Pub Sci. All data should be mean sea level (MSL) except for 1937–1956 which are MTL (high and low waters). The different sets explain the jumps in the metric data.

As far as the 1879–93 data are concerned, officially was the information in Pub Sci A led PSMSL in 2008 to determine an “RLR factor” for that set which looked anomalous. It was not till 2013 that PSMSL realized that there was more information available in the annual-mean values for 1894–1920 that tacked on to the 1879–93 data and were implied to be the same datum. Therefore, there could not be a jump given no gap in between. That, in turn, implied that the RLR factor for 1879–93 should be the same from the start of the record all the way to 1933. PSMSL also made a subjective correction to convert the 37–56 data from MTL to MSL.

From this figure, we may notice:

Each individual data set does not show any sign of rising sea levels.

From the data 1879–1893 and 1916–1933 considered aligned, the rate of rise is 0.139 mm/year. This record is 54 years long but with gaps.

From the data 1937–1956, the rate of rise is 0.488 mm/year. This record is only 20 years long and not long enough to infer any trend.

From the data 1957–1969, the rate of rise is 0.278 mm/year. This record is only 12 years long and not enough to infer any trend.

By considering the data 1937–1956 and 1957–1969 aligned (which they are clearly not), the rate of rise is 1.89 mm/year.

The alignment of the data collected with a new instrument after 2007 is probably also mistaken.

Starting from October 2007, there is a new tide gauge providing 1 min sea-level data to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Sea Level Station Monitoring Facility Ostend. It is claimed that as the relationship for the prime bench mark remains the same, there is no need to alter RLR, but it does not seem the case. The alignment appears to be far from but perfect.

As reported in Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) (GLOSS 2006 As reported in Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) (GLOSS), the Great Triangulation Survey of India (GTS) provided various benchmarks around Tawahi Port of Aden. However, the primary benchmark at Fairway House/Post Office House next to Post Office Pier was no longer existing at the time of the report, while the other remaining vertical bench mark at the North-East corner of the Port Engineers Office (PEO) and at the Pilots Pier tide gauge hut were in poor condition and in need of urgent repairs or replacement.

Problem of understanding sea levels when using different instruments over the years is that the sea levels fluctuate with very well-known inter-annual, decadal, and multi-decadal oscillations, so the sea level is not the same every year. In addition, you do not have any measure of the absolute position of the different instruments, as the global positioning system (GPS) tracking of fixed domes is only recent and still inaccurate, not many tide gauges have a nearby GPS dome, not many tide gauges with a nearby GPS dome have their position tracked vs. the GPS dome. The alignment of the data collected with a 40 years long gap is often completely arbitrary.

The RLR data for Aden, Yemen, show that the misaligned measurements have been composed to produce a high trend, high acceleration record. After the latest PSMSL corrections and addition to generate the RLR data, there is a trend of + 1.28 mm/year and a large acceleration of + 0.0164 mm/year 2 in the 134 years long but 50% complete tide gauge record.

Within the short time window 1937–1969, the trend has been increased to + 2.60 mm/year from the + 1.89 mm/year of the previously misaligned data. One would have expected the data 1937–1956 to be shifted up vs. the data 1957–1969. The adjustment has done just the opposite, and the data are being shifted down. Similarly, the data before 1937 have all been shifted down. The data collected since 2007 have not been moved vs. the data collected 1957–1969.

There is a RLR diagram for the adjustments and few notes in the station documentation detailing some of the recent corrections that are responsible for the RLR trend. 5.141 m are added to data values up to 1933 to refer to RLR of year 1964. 5.625 m are added to data values 1937 onwards to refer to RLR of 1964. In 2013, the historic data for Aden 1879–1933 has been reviewed. The RLR factor for that period has been reset. In 2016, a value of MTL–MSL = 16 mm has then been applied to the RLR data for the period 1937–1956.

It must be mentioned that other data were collected for Aden, but they are not used by PSMSL. As written in PSMSL ( 2016 It must be mentioned that other data were collected for Aden, but they are not used by PSMSL. As written in PSMSL (), there are also early automatic tide gauge data for a few months of 1846 with the lack of information about the vertical datum despite being tabulated, reduced to a nominal MSL and published, as well as early annual data for 1877 and 1879 published in the Great Trigonometrical Survey (GTS) records. A new self registering tide gauge was set up in 1879 and the PSMSL record starts in this year.

As reported by the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS 2004 As reported by the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS), there was in that year operational a tide gauge that is measuring without any major problems since 2001. Yet, no calibration operation was carried out and no data retrieval or processing or archiving system was in use. Within Aden Harbour, a level gauge was deployed in 1969. This instrument had operated well up till 1994, but PSMSL declares that they stopped getting data in 1969, and data transmission was only resumed in 2007. The report mentioned that a new generation tide gauge was installed at the entrance of Aden Harbour same year 2004. It was equipped with other sensors and data transmitted in real time through VHF to a processing unit located near the Aden International airport.

As better clarified in GLOSS ( 2006 As better clarified in GLOSS (), tide gauges have operated at the Port of Aden from 1879 up to approximately 1986, and later from 2000 to present date. The data have only been submitted to IOC GLOSS/PSMSL for the period of 1879–1969. Tide gauges have previously operated from the Post Office Pier, Tawahi at Aden and from the existing tide gauge hut at Pilots Pier, Tawahi. From approximately 1974 up to around 1986, a Munro float tide gauge was located at the Pilots Pier tide gauge hut. The instrument has been removed from the tide gauge hut. The tide gauge hut at the Pilots Pier was used for the Tide Monitor pressure gauge operated from 2000 to 2005. A similar gauge operated at Al Hudayda from 2001 to 2002. An integrated weather station/sea-level/wave gauge system was installed in 2004 and was fully operational in 2006 at the Port Control Tower, Ras Marbut, Steamer Point at Tawahi. This is the only operational tide gauge in Aden as per 2006.

Researchers must be cautious with any time series that comes in chunks like Aden, but there are some similarities with Mumbai, the nearest long record although across a large ocean, that may help address the issues.

Finally, officially, the radar data were aligned to benchmarks using dipping measurements. There are offsets in using radar data which must be estimated by either dipping or tide pole measurements. The Aden installation happened at about 2008 as gauges in several places in Africa and the Indian Ocean, and the same methods were used for all of them.
