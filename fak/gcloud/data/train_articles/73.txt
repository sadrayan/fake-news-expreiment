No, Johnny Depp Did Not Say This About Rockford Residents
When it comes to New Year's resolutions, could we all agree on one together? How about this- stop believing everything you read on the internet. Clint Eastwood isn't moving to Rockford ; Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't want to escape the Hollywood lifestyle in Harvard and Johnny Depp most certainly didn't praise Rockford residents on the radio this morning.

According to an article from the Daily 10 News , during a radio interview this morning, Depp "took a moment to praise Rockford, Illinois residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently."

Just to be sure, because this could've been a radio interview in LA or god knows where, I checked the web (when you're a person who works in the media, you're taught to check two sources before you report anything) and the only thing Depp was up to this morning was divorce damage control .

I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that you'll probably see this story come up in your Facebook news feed at some point today; do me a favor would you? Please don't share it...because it's not true.
