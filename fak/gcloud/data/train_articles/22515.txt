How Far Away Is the Moon?

How far is the Moon from Earth?

You might be surprised. Often when we see drawings of the Earth and the Moon, they look really close together.



Don’t be fooled! They’re actually really far apart. The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 km) away. How far away is that? That’s 30 Earths.

Average distance?

Why mention the average distance? Well, the Moon is not always the same distance away from Earth. The orbit is not a perfect circle.



When the Moon is the farthest away, it’s 252,088 miles away. That’s almost 32 Earths. When it's closest, the Moon is 225,623 miles away. That’s between 28 and 29 Earths.

So far apart!

The Moon definitely seems close because we can see it so well without a telescope,

but remember, it’s farther away than most people realize!
