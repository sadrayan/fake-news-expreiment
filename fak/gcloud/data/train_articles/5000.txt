Florida Retirement System Actuarial Assumption Estimating Conference

Last conference held: October 16, 2009

The Florida Retirement System Actuarial Assumption Conference met on October 16, 2009 and adopted the assumptions to be used in the actuarial valuation of Floridaâ€™s Retirement System. The preliminary results show that the state is no longer in a surplus position --- indicating that an unfunded actuarial liability developed prior to July 1, 2009. On an actuarial basis, the system is only 87.6% funded, largely based on unfavorable asset performance in Fiscal Year 2008-09. The report addressed information received through July 1, 2009.
