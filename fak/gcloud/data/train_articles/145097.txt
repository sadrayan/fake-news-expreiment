'A proper Christian burial:' Sutherland Springs funeral homes prepare to send off family, friends
Sutherland Springs lost 26 people on Sunday, when a gunman clad all in black opened fire at the church his in-laws sometimes attended. They weren't at First Baptist that day, but 60 or so other churchgoers became targets in what authorities have called "an ongoing domestic situation."



Many are still holding out hope for injured loved ones, now on day three in the hospital. Those who count their families among the 26 victims are still reeling from a massacre that seems unreal and starting the bewildering job of laying their families and friends to rest.

Usually an arduous and costly undertaking, planning the funerals of those who lost their lives on Sunday will hopefully be at least slightly smoother for the people of Sutherland Springs as the state of Texas, local businesses and donors from around the world seek to help.
