Kobach Confirms He's Unpaid Adviser For Romney
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) _ Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach confirms that he's serving as an unpaid adviser on immigration issues to Republican Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.

Kobach told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he's been

advising the former Massachusetts governor since the beginning of

this year. Kobach said he started serving as an adviser even before

he formally endorsed his fellow Republican last month.

The Kansas secretary of state is a former law professor who's known nationally for advising state and local officials about cracking down on illegal immigration. He helped draft tough laws in Alabama and Arizona.

Kobach said he advised Romney during Romney's unsuccessful 2008 campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.
