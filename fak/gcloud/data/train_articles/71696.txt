For release 10:00 a.m. (EDT) Friday, May 17, 2019 USDL-19-0813 Technical information: Employment: (202) 691-6559 * sminfo@bls.gov * www.bls.gov/sae Unemployment: (202) 691-6392 * lausinfo@bls.gov * www.bls.gov/lau Media contact: (202) 691-5902 * PressOffice@bls.gov STATE EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT -- APRIL 2019 Unemployment rates were lower in April in 10 states and stable in 40 states and the District of Columbia, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Four states had jobless rate decreases from a year earlier, 1 state had an increase, and 45 states and the District had little or no change. The national unemployment rate declined by 0.2 percentage point from March to 3.6 percent and was 0.3 point lower than in April 2018. Nonfarm payroll employment increased in 10 states in April 2019, decreased in 1 state, and was essentially unchanged in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Over the year, 29 states added nonfarm payroll jobs and 21 states and the District were essentially unchanged. This news release presents statistics from two monthly programs. The civilian labor force and unemployment data are modeled based largely on a survey of households. These data pertain to individuals by where they reside. The employment data come from an establishment survey that measures nonfarm employment, hours, and earnings by industry. These data pertain to jobs on payrolls defined by where the establishments are located. For more information about the concepts and statistical methodologies used by these two programs, see the Technical Note. Unemployment Vermont had the lowest unemployment rate in April, 2.2 percent. The rates in Pennsylvania (3.8 percent), Vermont (2.2 percent), and Wisconsin (2.8 percent) set new series lows. (All state series begin in 1976.) Alaska had the highest jobless rate, 6.5 percent.
