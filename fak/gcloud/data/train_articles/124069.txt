Michelle Obama In Wes Gordon – 2012 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards
Michelle Obama made a surprise appearance at the 2012 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards in LA on Saturday afternoon to present singer Taylor Swift with the ‘Big Help’ award.

The First Lady wore a Wes Gordon Spring 2012 tunic with silver metallic Helmut Lang jeans.

Her Wes Gordon ¾ length-sleeved tunic with a silver embellished houndstooth print is slightly modified from the version presented on the model; the plunge isn’t so deep and Mrs O has opted to turn down the collar.

Simple black pumps completed her look.

I think she found the right balance of looking event appropriate, age appropriate and stylish.
