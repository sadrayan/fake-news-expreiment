Conspiracy Theorists Meet on New Dating Website
“Awake,” among conspiracy theorists, means the same thing as “aware” or “switched on.” It means you can see things that normal people can’t: you’ve put together the facts, connected the dots, and can now say confidently that chemtrails are being sprayed into the atmosphere to control human behavior, or that reptoid aliens are running the world’s banks. The Daily Dot reports that the creator of the site prefers to put it another way:

Awake Dating is a site focused on pairing up people who identify as “awake,” which Jarrod Fidden, the COO of Awake Dating, defines as “one who has investigated and come to his or her own conclusions on a collection of topics and issues. And through this research and critical thinking, [he] has ‘woken’ from the fantastic false dream carefully crafted for the ‘consumer.’”

But meeting people can be tough, especially when you’re looking for a partner who shares your worldview. Normal dating sites may not really cater toward you and your belief system, and you might be marginalized in everyday life.

That’s where “Awake Dating” comes in. The new site aims to connect the “awake” with one another, and match them up based on their set of beliefs — in some ways, no different from dating by religious preferences (except instead of discussing God, you may be talking about Illuminati lizard people).

The YouTube ad for the site pokes fun at the way outsiders portray the “awake” with humorous photographs and a catchy tune about anti-vaxxers and false flags:

It’s possible that this page is an extended troll, but even if it is, there are other dating sites that cater to the conspiracy theory set.
