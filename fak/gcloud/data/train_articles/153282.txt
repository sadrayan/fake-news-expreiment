Was the alliance's Syrian shock and awe just a useful diversion?
Donald Trump's, Theresa May's and Emmanuel Macron's moral posturing on Bashar al-Assad's latest chemical weapons outrage left them no choice but to launch a retaliatory attack on Damascus.

But as some critics have noted, it has also proved convenient timing for the trio, seeking diversions from their own domestic issues.

Trump's problems, which include the ongoing Russia investigation, the "Stormy" Daniels saga, and the release of James Comey's intriguing memoir, are well documented.

Macron, who was voted into office in the hope he could restore order to the troubled French economy, has been taking heavy fire over both the nature and extent of some quite unpopular reforms and May is still working through the fallout from the Brexit vote.

While such cynicism is understandable - princes, presidents and demagogues have been in the habit of unleashing diversionary doses of "shock and awe" on alleged enemies of humanity whenever they wanted to look statesman-like for millennia - that doesn't mean it is justified.
