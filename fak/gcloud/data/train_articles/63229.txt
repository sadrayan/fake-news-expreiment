Sign the petition calling on twitter to suspend trump’s account

Trump has launched a despicable and irresponsible attack on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, sharing a propaganda video questioning the Congresswoman's loyalty to the United States. This is as dangerous as it is unprecedented. Representative Omar is receiving countless death threats as the president of the United States is inciting violence against a Black Muslim sitting member of congress, putting her life at risk.

Tell Jack Dorsey from Twitter to take down Trump's hateful video and permanently suspend his Twitter account. We don’t have to give hate a platform
