Low’s Subleading Soft Theorem as a Symmetry of QED

V. Lysov, S. Pasterski and A. Strominger



It was shown by F. Low in the 1950s that the subleading terms of soft photon S-matrix elements obey a universal linear relation. In this paper we give a new interpretation to this old relation, for the case of massless QED, as an infinitesimal symmetry of the S-matrix.

Generalizing the Soft Factor/Classical Connection
