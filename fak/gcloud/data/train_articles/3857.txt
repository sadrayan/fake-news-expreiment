Congressional Scorecard - FreedomWorks
FreedomWorks identifies the most important votes on issues of economic freedom and scores Members of Congress based on their votes. We use a scale of 100, so the higher the score the more often the Member is on our side fighting for lower taxes, less government and more freedom.

Remember: Politics go to those who show up. So show up at their office. Show up on the phone. Show up in the mail. And let them know you are watching their votes closely. Take our scorecard with you and let them know both what you like and what you dislike.
