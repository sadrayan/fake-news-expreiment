France fears that Russia is trying to push Marine Le Pen to victory
France’s top intelligence agency fears that Russia is trying to sway the upcoming presidential elections in favor of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

On Wednesday, the satirical weekly newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné reported that France’s Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) believes a disinformation campaign coordinated by the Kremlin threatens to undermine April’s election.

The report suggests Russia will seek to help Le Pen’s chances by using bots to post millions of positive messages about the National Front candidate online. The agency also believes Russia may seek to upend Le Pen’s opponents by publishing their confidential emails.

The allegations are being taken seriously, so much so that Le Canard claims the next defense meeting at the Élysée Palace will address this subject specifically.
