BREAKING: FCC Fines NFL $5 Million After Kneeling Incident
In a live NFL broadcast, a football player managed to do something so reprehensible that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had no choice but to swiftly fine them.

Steelers player Antonio Brown kneeled during the National Anthem. But that wasn’t the most offensive part. He also held up his middle finger as he did it. Now the anthem wasn’t televised during Sunday’s game, but cameras went live while Brown’s finger was still in the air — a violation of the FCC’s primetime regulations and a fineable offense.

Since the fine is based on the number of households reached, on average, over the past five years, this means the NFL is losing a lot of money. According to Fox News, the FCC “almost immediately responded by notifying the NFL of a $5 million fine for the incident.”

This is the latest in a series of financial mishaps that is thrusting the NFL into ruin. Not only is viewership dropping, but they have been hit by this new fine as well as the loss of advertisers.

The NFL made a huge mistake when they failed to deal with anti-American displays by players. Now Americans are “tuning out” and the league is in danger of dying off. Fortunately, the return of the XFL, which has mandatory anthem rules, comes next year. Americans will once again have a sporting tradition they can be proud of.
