De Blasio Defends NYPD’s Muslim Surveillance

Weeks after other potential 2013 mayoral candidates took positions on police monitoring of Muslims, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio on Wednesday spoke in defense of one of the New York Police Department’s most controversial tactics.

In a speech on public-safety issues, de Blasio said he believes police are acting in good faith to protect New Yorkers and follow the law through the surveillance program. He also called on Mayor Michael Bloomberg to lower the number of “unsubstantiated” stop-and-frisk searches by police, and he urged an independent budget for the Civilian Complaint Review Board tasked with handling noncriminal allegations of police misconduct.

The speech marked the public advocate’s first statement on NYPD surveillance of Muslim groups, which has come under fire from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and other politicians, including some of his potential rivals in the 2013 mayor race.

“I defend without question the NYPD’s obligation to pursue specific and credible threats,” de Blasio said Wednesday morning at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He said he had been reassured by Police Commissioner Ray Kelly that the NYPD is acting appropriately.
