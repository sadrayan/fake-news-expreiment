Trump retweets alt-right conspiracy theorist amid Charlottesville fallout
Jack Posobiec. @JackPosobiec/Twitter Days after a white nationalist rally turned deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia, President Donald Trump retweeted an alt-right conspiracy theorist Monday night.

Trump's retweet originated from Jack Posobiec, a prominent alt-right figure who reportedly was behind a viral post-election photo of a "Rape Melania" sign shown among anti-Trump protesters.

Posobiec, who is a leading pro-Trump internet personality, was also a proponent of the Pizzagate scandal â€” a 2016 conspiracy that falsely claimed Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, ran a child sex-slavery ring from a pizza parlor in Washington D.C.

In the message Trump retweeted Monday night, Posobiec shared a link to a story about gun violence in Chicago, in which nine people were killed between Friday and Monday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

"No national media outrage. Why is that," Posobiec wrote.

Trump's retweet follows days of criticism for his hesitation to forcefully condemn the white nationalist movements connected to the violence in Charlottesville. In his first public acknowledgement of the events on Saturday, Trump claimed that "many sides" were responsible. Backlash from Republicans and Democrats quickly followed.

After reportedly facing pressure from his own staff, Trump on Monday said that members of the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists who engender violence are "criminals and thugs." However, following that statement, Trump bemoaned the response, saying the media "will never be satisfied."
