Revisiting the Romneys' La Jolla beach house -- and its car elevator
San Diego, the most conservative big city in the state, is a natural fit for a high-profile Republican like Mitt. How natural? In 2012, Romney lost to Obama by 42 points in Los Angeles, and by 70 points in San Francisco. In San Diego, he lost by a mere 7.6 points. Is it any surprise that Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain owns two condos in Coronado? Or that Texas Gov. Rick Perry told the New York Times Magazine last year he vacations annually in San Diego and would move there if he could afford it?
