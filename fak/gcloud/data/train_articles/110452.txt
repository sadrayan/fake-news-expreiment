USPS may destroy 'unsafe' stamps

Run! Jump! Leap! It all seems pretty innocent, but the U.S. Postal Service is faced with a decision to destroy its series of "Just Move" stamps because of safety concerns, according to Linns Stamp News, and we're not talking about a paper cut on your tongue.

The colorful cartoon stamps, based on Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative, were intended to encourage an active lifestyle and raise awareness about physical activity. But the images on some of the stamps are not kosher with the President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, according to the stamps designer, Eli Noyes, who told Linns, "Apparently the President’s Council [on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition] and the Let’s Move people saw them and had issues with them."

The stamps in question: a skateboarder sans kneepads, a swimmer doing a cannonball, and a kid doing a headstand without a helmet. Because of these issues, it's likely you won't ever get to send your mail with these particular adhesives.

A spokesman at the USPS told Yahoo the stamps are sitting at a printer in upstate New York, awaiting a decision on their fate.

What do you think? Is eliminating these stamps unnecessary. Is it the right thing to do? Do you even use stamps anymore?
