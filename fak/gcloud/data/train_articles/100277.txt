Surfer grows an 'ICE-BEARD' after braving below zero temperatures in Michigan
Daniel Schetter grew up surfing on Lake Superior in Michigan, US, and wears a wet-suit designed to withstand the freezing temperatures of -31 C with wind-chill.

Photographer Devon Hains, 24, told how his friend got a numb face and was in a little pain by the time he finished the surfing session, with icicles hanging from his beard and eyebrows.

He said: "We were there from about 1pm-4.30pm, leaving as the sun was setting.

"Dan was hoping to get an ice beard going since it was so cold outside, -31 degrees C with the wind chill factor.

"Perfect conditions to grow an ice beard.
