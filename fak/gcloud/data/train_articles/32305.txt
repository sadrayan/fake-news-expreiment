City of Madison, Wisconsin
Property Tax Payment Deadline Information

Due to the extreme cold and City offices remaining closed on January 31, we want property tax payers to know about a grace period for the January 31 deadline for first installment:

Payments may be made by mail or in person at our office until 4:30 pm on Thursday, February 7, 2019. Payments must be in our hands by 4:30 pm February 7, 2019 to be considered timely. Mail received after that time will be delinquent regardless of the postmark. If you failed to pay at least the first installment, your taxes will be delinquent and due in their entirety. Delinquent taxes are charged 1% interest and .5% penalty each month. These charges are assessed on the first day of each month on the current balance.
