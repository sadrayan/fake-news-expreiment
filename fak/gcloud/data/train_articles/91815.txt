Minneapolis launches hate-crime hot line
The city of Minneapolis has set up a hot line for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.

The service, operated through the city's 311 help line, is aimed to aid targets of any "harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice," according to a city news release issued on Monday.

The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.

"Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States," Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city's website. "In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated."

The City Council last fall passed a resolution condemning violence and hate speech against Muslims.

Callers in Minneapolis can access the service through the city's 311 hot line, which is staffed between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays and between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on weekends.

Anyone calling from outstate must dial 612-673-3000.

Incidents may also be reported to the Department of Justice at 612-664-5600.
