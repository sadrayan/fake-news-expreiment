Trump incorrectly says murders are up in New York
During a discussion about crime, Donald Trump again portrayed himself as a candidate of law and order. He pointed to stop-and-frisk, a tactic utilized by police in New York, as something he thinks helped that city and could work nationally. “We have to bring back law and order,” Trump said.

Trump criticized New York moving away from the practice (it was deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013), suggesting that current Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) should have fought to keep it in place.

Hillary Clinton pointed out that even after de Blasio took office, and after New York moved away from stop-and-frisk, crime has continued to drop, including murders.

“You’re wrong,” Trump said, interrupting her. “Murders are up.”

Trump is incorrect. So far this year, murders are down from the same point last year, falling to 246 murders through last week from 257 such killings a year earlier, according to New York police data. In addition, shootings have dropped this year, with 10 percent fewer shooting victims through the same point.

Last year, murders did go up in New York City, rising to 352 from 333 the year before. (Numerous cities saw spikes in homicides last year, and FBI crime data released hours before the debated showed homicides were up nationwide.) Still, historically, New York is far safer than it was just a few years ago. The 352 murders reported last year was still nearly 200 killings behind the total in 2010, when stop-and-frisk was in effect.
