Senate rejects measure to defund Planned Parenthood
As expected, the Senate has voted down a measure to defund Planned Parenthood, with five Republicans voting with Democrats to keep the funding in place.

The vote was 42-58.

Republicans voting against the stand-alone resolution to defund Planned Parenthood were: Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine.

The same resolution passed the House earlier today by a vote of 241 to 185. Seven House Republicans voted to keep the Planned Parenthood funding, while 10 Democrats voted to eliminate it.

The budget agreement completed last Friday included a deal to eliminate a “rider” attached to the must-pass funding bill that would have cut “Title X” funding for women’s health organizations that also conduct abortions.
