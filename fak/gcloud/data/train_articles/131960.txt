Michigan GOP tried to pass bill marking immigrants' licenses with YELLOW STARS
Credibility here is lacking on another issue. It isn't that people believe Hitler seized power "he was democratically elected" you state. In 1933 Hitler ran for office, and former President Hindenberg ran against him. Hindenberg won. Hitler though was leading a party with a lot of support and leveraged that into pressuring Hindenberg into appointing him Chancellor. A year later Hindeberg died in office, as Chancellor Hitler appointed HIMSELF president and abolished the office of Chancellor. There was no new elections in Germany after Hindenberg was elected in '33 until 1948. Hitler did indeed seize power, he was NEVER elected by a majority, or elected at all. These are easily fact checked, and your failure to do so undermines all other claims.
