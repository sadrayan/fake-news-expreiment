Eluding Gangs in Honduras, Then Falling Victim to One on Long Island
MS-13 was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by immigrants from El Salvador escaping civil war. The gang developed in El Salvador after some members were deported, growing into a transnational gang throughout Central America. It developed in the Latino immigrant-heavy towns of Suffolk County — Brentwood and Central Islip — around 1998, and over the past two decades has been organized in cliques bearing names like the Brentwood Locos Salvatruchas.

Ms. Fuentes said she had heard about how vicious the gang had become in Brentwood. “But I would never imagine anything like this,” Ms. Fuentes, 20, said on Friday. She said that Jefferson had become a soccer star at his Florida high school and that he, along with his father, sister and grandmother, came to visit from Pompano Beach last week.

After they were notified by police of the deaths, Ms. Fuentes and her mother drove all night from Florida. Jefferson, Ms. Fuentes said, was identified by a tattoo on his arm: “In God’s hands.”

“They both always had a great attitude,” she said of Jefferson and Michael. “They were never mad and they were always trying to make sure everybody else was O.K.”

Ms. Fuentes said that Jefferson had been in the process of applying for asylum because in Honduras, “the gangs are waiting for you on every corner.” Instead, his body will be buried in his hometown, Santa Rita, Honduras.
