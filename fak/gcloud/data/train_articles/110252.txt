New American Tea Party
We have received hundreds of questions about an email circulating that urges folks to send tea to Washington on April 1st or April 15th. This effort is not endorsed by the New American Tea Party, so we can’t answer any questions about it. It is a neat idea, but things like that will likely either be held up getting scanned or end up getting thrown away due to security precautions.

Keep an eye on the April 15th tea party resurgence and stay tuned for details for a tea party coming to a city near you. In the mean time, sign up if you haven’t already via the “Keep Me Informed” link (above) and our Facebook group and pass it on to friends, relatives, and colleagues!
