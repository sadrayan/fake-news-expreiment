The Prime Minister Hosts the Iftar with the Islamic Diplomatic Corps in Japan (The Prime Minister in Action)
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hosted an Iftar with the Islamic Diplomatic Corps in Japan at the Prime Minister's Office.

The Prime Minister said in his opening address,

“I am extremely delighted to host this Iftar today. I would like to extend my warm welcome to H.E. Mr. Waleed Siam, Ambassador of the Permanent General Mission of Palestine to Japan, and all the members of the Islamic Diplomatic Corps in Japan; distinguished guests; and Mr. Kosei Inoue, a gold medalist in judo at the Sydney Olympic Games, coach of Japan’s men’s national judo team, and an instructor who has been teaching judo in Palestine and the Arab world.

Since assuming the post of Prime Minister, I have made official visits to many Islamic countries in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others. I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence. The Japanese people sincerely hope for peace and prosperity in the Middle East. However, unfortunately at the present time the Middle East faces a very challenging situation, a fact that deeply pains the people of Japan.

Tonight I greatly look forward to spending an enjoyable evening with our friends from the Arab and Islamic world. I hope that our Japanese guests and Arab guests will take this opportunity to deepen exchange and forge new relationships for the future.”
