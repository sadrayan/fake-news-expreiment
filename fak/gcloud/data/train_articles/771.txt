Deadly Force: Arming America's Police
Fault Lines investigates how the flow of federal dollars and combat equipment is transforming US police departments into military-like forces.

US police forces are increasingly using military-style tactics to carry out even the most routine daily operations.

SWAT raids occur at an estimated 50,000 raids per year and the majority that take place involve low-level crimes.
