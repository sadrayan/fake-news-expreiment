Some qualities to observe in regards to the finalized ranking:Ranking does not rely solely on total number of weapons available to any one country; there is also a focus onNuclear weapons/stockpiles are NOT taken into account; recognized/suspected nuclear powers are given a bonus.First World, Second World, and Third World statuses are taken into account.Geographical factors, logistical flexibility, natural resources, and local industry are influencial to the final ranking. Total available manpower is a key consideration as it directly influences many other categories.Land-locked nations are NOT penalized for lack of a standing navy; naval powers ARE penalized for lack of diversity in available assets.

Increases/declines are based on many factors and can be related to equipment/manpower attrition, financial instability, population/resources fluxes, and the like. Additionally, changes to the GFP formula may also affect a nation's rising/declining position on this list.The values used in the finalized GFP ranking are constructed from information that is publicly available from various resources at the time of publishing - though it remains an impossibility to showcase presented valuesdue to limited reporting, a nation's lack of transparency, and other factors beyond our control. In some cases, estimates are used which may be based on previous years' data or, in its place, averages may be applied to complete the entry.
