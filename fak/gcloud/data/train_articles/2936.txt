Cassidy Comments on Senate Agreement to Authorize VA Clinics
WASHINGTON – Today, Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) commented on the Senate’s agreement to authorize veterans affairs (VA) clinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles. The House of Representatives passed bipartisan legislation to authorize these clinics 177 days ago. Dr. Cassidy, along with the Louisiana Republican delegation, wrote a letter urging veterans to advocate for Senate action on passing legislation that would improve veterans’ access to VA clinics.

Dr. Cassidy released the following statement:

“It’s been more than 177 days since the House passed bipartisan legislation that would authorize these VA clinics. Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate healthcare did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action. We need to continue working towards patient-centered solutions so all veterans have access to quality healthcare.”
