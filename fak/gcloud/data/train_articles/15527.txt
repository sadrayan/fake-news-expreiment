The American diplomats were taken hostage in Tehran on November 4, 1979 and held until Jan. 20, 1981. So it started in the 70s but was mostly in the 80s.

Each year on Nov 4 there are demonstrations outside the former US Embassy in Tehran commemorating the takeover. However, this is not a national holiday like Thanksgiving, Christmas or the 4th of July. A list of Iranian national holidays can be found at http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/iran/

"Death to America" is an Iranian revolutionary slogan that is shouted or chanted at most events related to the revolution. I am sure that it would be heard at the Nov 4 demonstrations, but I am unaware that it is the formal name of the day or event. This slogan is shouted every Friday at the weekly prayer services held across Iran.

Usually in Iran the hostage crisis is referred to as the attack on the "Den of Spies."
