Making College More Affordable and Accessible
Hi. I'm Scott Walker.



One of my top priorities is making college more affordable for students and working families in Wisconsin. That's why I am proud that we froze tuition at all University of Wisconsin campuses for four years in a row.



Before our freeze, tuition went up by 118% over ten years. In fact, the average annual increase was over 8%. You see, years ago, former Governor Jim Doyle cut $250 million from the UW System but he allowed most of it to be made up through higher tuition costs. We froze tuition.



Today, the overall University of Wisconsin System budget is the largest it has ever been. That's right. The overall budget has never been larger and for the first time in history, tuition is frozen four years in a row.



These facts might be surprising because of the resolutions recently passed by some UW faculty members across the state. They point to the budget and affordability but the real issue for them is the fact that we altered the jobs for life tenure program.



In contrast, we believe the focus should be on providing students with the best education possible - in a way that makes college affordable and accessible.

Replacing jobs for life tenure with reasonable expectations for teaching just makes sense.
