Guide Dogs for the Blind: Michael Hingson and his Guide Dog Roselle
As was the case with many Americans, Michael Hingson's life changed dramatically on September 11th. He and his Guide Dog Roselle were the lucky ones, however, in that they escaped the World Trade Center attack. As a 9/11 survivor and Guide Dog user, he was thrust into the international limelight, appearing on many news shows, including Larry King Live.

Michael and Roselle have since become well-known as representatives of the strength of the human/animal bond, and have been successful in communicating the power of that bond in many media interviews and public presentations. Michael has traveled with a Guide Dog for 40 years and embodies the lifelong partnerships created by Guide Dogs for the Blind and those they serve.

Prior to becoming the National Public Affairs Representative for Guide Dogs for the Blind, Michael was district sales manager for Quantum Data Protection Division of Irvine, Calif., overseeing a sales force and field operations. He has a master's degree in physics from the University of California at Irvine. He is a former member of the California State Guide Dog Board, and is a member of the National Federation of the Blind. Michael lives with his wife in Northern California.
