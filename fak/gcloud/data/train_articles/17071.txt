2 2015 12 2 California San Bernardino Syed Rizwan Farook; Pakistan national Tashfeen Malik 28; 29 14 14 24 0 1 1 0 at the Inland Regional Center terrorist attack Law enforcement officials confirmed that 14 people are dead and 21 wounded in a shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Sources said the two assailants, who were heavily armed and possibly wearing body armor, opened fire on a holiday party. The two attackers, who were married, were killed in a gun battle with police. They were U.S.-born Syed Rizwan Farook and Pakistan national Tashfeen Malik, and had an arsenal of ammunition and pipe bombs in their Redlands home. Federal law enforcement officials say Malik pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a Facebook post, but the FBI chief said there is no sign the couple were part of a terrorist network. FBI officials announced Friday that the agency is officially investigating the shooting as terrorism. Other federal law enforcement sources say it still might also be workplace related. http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/03/us/what-we-know-san-bernardino-mass-shooting/index.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack
