BREAKING: Girl Who Wiped Nose With Flag At Trump Rally Is Pelosi’s Granddaughter
Liberals are gushing over their ability to find a child in the audience who wiped her nose with the flag, but as usual they aren’t telling the full story.

The girl was a liberal plant — Nancy Pelosi’s granddaughter Adrianna Pelosi — very conspicuously used a flag to pick her nose. According to liberals in a secret planning group on the Dark Web, she had waited in line for hours to get a spot behind the President at his rally. During this time, she had no adult supervision.

You can see her do it below:

You’ve met Plaid Shirt Guy. Now may I introduce Snot Flag Girl. It turns out Trump supporters are just fine with disrespecting the flag as long as you’re not kneeling or African-American. Color me shocked.pic.twitter.com/rplmm3Oz8f — Andrew Wortman (@AmoneyResists) September 8, 2018

This is just another dirty liberal trick intended to make patriotic, red-blooded Americans look bad. Liberals will stop at nothing to push their agenda on the rest of us. But we’re the silent majority who got sick of being silent. We are the last line of defense against creeping liberal fascism.

For the Democrat party to use a child to create a fake outrage is a new low — one that should end with Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment from the House of Representatives.

It’s time to stop playing nice. Lock Nancy Pelosi up and throw this little brat in Juvie for disrespecting our flag! Let’s Make America Great Again!
