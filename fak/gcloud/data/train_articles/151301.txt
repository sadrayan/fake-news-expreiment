Man Killed in Brooklyn Fire As Panel Urges Sprinkler Law
One man was killed and three people were injured last night in a fire in a high-rise apartment building in Brooklyn that officials say was started by a cigarette.

The fire occurred just hours after a mayoral panel proposed stringent new fire regulations in residential buildings, including rules requiring sprinklers.

The fire, at 541 Wythe Avenue in the Williamsburg section, killed Santander Oregallo, 65, who was found dead in his apartment, said Bruce Lyall, a Fire Department spokesman.

Three other residents of the 26-story building were treated for minor smoke inhalation, he said. Two were taken to Long Island College Hospital and one was treated at the scene, he said.

Officials said they believe the fire was caused by a cigarette in Mr. Oregallo's apartment. ''From what we can tell, it was a case of careless smoking,'' Mr. Lyall said. The fire, he added, was confined to Mr. Oregallo's 24th floor apartment, which did not have sprinklers.
