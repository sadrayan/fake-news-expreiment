JUNEAU � In her first year as governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin raised taxes on the oil industry, pushed through ethics legislation amid a burgeoning corruption investigation of Alaska lawmakers, bucked her party�s old guard, and ordered her administration to seek fewer congressional earmarks after Alaska�s �bridge to nowhere� became a national symbol of pork barrel spending.

The 43-year-old governor has also emerged as a national figure and a media darling, showing up on news and talk shows and even posing for Vogue magazine.

Alaska�s first female governor, a former Miss Wasilla, says it�s her responsibility to be available even to fashion magazines if it can help change the state�s reputation for graft and gluttony at the public trough.

�We�ve got to make sure the rest of the United States doesn�t believe the only thing going on in Alaska is FBI probes and corruption trials,� Palin said.

She has dismissed speculation she might leave Juneau for higher office before her term expires in 2010, saying, �My role as governor is where I can be most helpful right now unless something drastic happens, and I don�t anticipate that right now.�

Nevertheless, John J. Pitney Jr., a political scientist with Claremont McKenna College in California and former analyst for congressional Republicans, said Palin could be an ideal presidential running mate next year.

�What separates her from others is that at a time when Republicans have suffered from the taint of corruption, she represents clean politics,� Pitney said.

�The public stereotype of Republican is a wrinkled old guy taking cash under the table,� he said. �One way for Republicans to break the stereotype is with a female reformer.�

Party labels seem to mean little to Palin. Her revenue commissioner is a Democrat. Her husband, Todd, a blue-collar worker on the North Slope, is an independent.

The mother of four is often seen bounding down the Capitol stairwell, carrying a pink backpack, rushing to get her 6-year-old daughter, Piper, off to school on time � something Pitney said could make Palin appealing to a national audience.

A former mayor of Wasilla, Palin ran on ethics reform and trounced incumbent Gov. Frank Murkowski in the 2006 GOP primary. In the general election, she easily beat Democratic former Gov. Tony Knowles.

Palin immediately took on the state�s most lucrative industry, questioning whether Alaska � which gets about 85 percent of its revenue from big oil � is getting its fair share of the oil companies� billions of dollars in profits.

She got what she wanted from the GOP-controlled Legislature, but only by relying heavily on Democratic votes. She won approval last month to boost taxes on oil company profits from 22.5 percent to 25 percent. That could bring in an additional $1.6 billion annually for the state, depending on oil prices.

The state is currently evaluating bids for the right to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline to deliver Alaska�s natural gas to the rest of the nation. How that will eventually play out is still very much up in the air.

In her first year, Palin has demonstrated a flair for timing and public relations.

She signed an ethics reform bill the day a former Alaska lawmaker was convicted of bribery. She visited Alaska troops in Kuwait. She prefaced the announcement of this year�s Permanent Fund dividend amount with a much-quoted, �Oh baby!�

Palin�s climb up the national political celebrity ladder is happening without the backing of the state Republican Party, led by Randy Ruedrich. In 2004, as chairwoman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, Palin exposed Ruedrich for ethics violations when he was a fellow commissioner.

Ruedrich acknowledged Wednesday that he and Palin haven�t talked at all since her election but said it isn�t that big a deal. �I talk to others in her administration,� he said. �I didn�t talk to Frank about much, either.�

Palin has also challenged her party�s establishment by asking Ted Stevens, Alaska�s once untouchable senior senator, to explain publicly why federal investigators raided his Girdwood home in a far-reaching investigation of Alaska corruption.

�I don�t sweat it at all that the partisanship isn�t playing a big part of my agenda,� Palin said. �What that tells me is this: that I�m on the right track, and that it hasn�t stopped us.�
