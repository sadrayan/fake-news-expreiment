Liberal "Ready for Hillary" Sticker Gets a Makeover, and it's LEGENDARY
There are many reasons to not vote for former FLOTUS Hillary Clinton as President of the United States.

This meme sums up why most Americans will not vote for Hills come November, 2016 (hopefully)…

If you do cast a vote for this lady, you are proving to the world how foolish America has become.

Clinton, really? With all her faults, and lying, and downright BS?

For shame.

Lefties always seem to forget about the Whitewater controversy from back in the day.

How about Travelgate, Filegate, Chinagate, anything ringing a bell? If not, click here.
