No smoking if the kids are in the car, says England
Story highlights England has banned smoking in cars where children are present

The law will come into force from October 1

"Three million children are exposed to second-hand smoke in cars," the Public Health Minister said

(CNN) England has banned smoking in cars where children are present -- a law that will come into force from October 1, with offenders facing a fine of Â£50 ($77).

The law states that it will be an offence to smoke in a private vehicle with someone under age 18 in the car, and to fail to prevent smoking under the same circumstances.

The legislation applies to enclosed, private vehicles but not to anyone driving alone.

"Three million children are exposed to second-hand smoke in cars, putting their health at risk," the Public Health Minister Jane Ellis said.

"We know that many of them feel embarrassed or frightened to ask adults to stop smoking, which is why the regulations are an important step in protecting children from the harms of second-hand smoke."
