Children at Maptela Day Care Centre, a USAID/PEPFAR-supported day care center for orphans and vulnerable children in Soweto

Dr. Jill Biden, wife of the U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, visited the Mapetla Day Care Centre in Soweto. Supported by the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through USAID, Mapetla provides care and early education for over 100 orphans and vulnerable children, including life skills development and preparation for primary school. Also at the Centre was Kami, the HIV-positive Muppet from Takalani Sesame, South Africa’s version of Sesame Street. Together Dr. Biden and Kami distributed soccer balls to the children in celebration of South Africa hosting the first World Cup on the African continent.
