This FAQ is for anyone who wants to know more about the salary cap, trade rules, and other aspects of the NBA's 2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement. There is a lot of information here, so there are several ways to navigate this document. A simple text search within your browser is the easiest way to find something if you know what you're looking for -- that's why I kept the entire FAQ on one page. You can go to the table of contents to see a list of all the questions, or if you want to know about a particular topic you may be able to find it in the index. You can also go straight to the questions. You can find an overview of the differences between the 2017 and 2011 CBAs in the appendix. If you've been following this FAQ for a while, you can go to the revision history to see if anything has changed. Finally, you can see who wrote this thing or view the copyright notice. Enjoy!

1. What is a salary cap? Why have one? A salary cap is a limit on the amount teams can spend on player contracts, which helps to maintain competitive balance in the league. Without a salary cap, teams with deeper pockets could simply outspend the remaining teams for the better free agents. The basic idea behind a salary cap is that a team can only sign a free agent if its total payroll will not exceed the cap -- so a team with deep pockets is on a more level playing field with every other team. While this is true in theory, NBA teams in big markets nevertheless have been able to significantly outspend teams in small markets. For example, for the 2016-17 season (the final season under the previous CBA) the lowest team payroll was approximately $80.5 million1 and the highest was over $127.5 million (plus an additional $27.3 million in luxury tax). As a result, there is now a weak to moderate correlation between team payroll and regular season wins. For the 2016-17 NBA season the correlation coefficient2 was about 0.35. It was much stronger in the past -- for example, in 2010-11 (the last season under the 2005 CBA) the correlation coefficient was 0.53, indicating that deep-pocket teams were able, to a certain extent, to buy their way to success. Interestingly, this correlation was only 0.13 (nearly orthogonal) in the 2001-02 NBA season. One possible explanation for this variation is the changes in the league's luxury tax and revenue sharing systems over time. 1 Although this was below the league minimum payroll of $84.7287 million, so the team was surcharged. 2 A correlation coefficient is a number between -1 and 1, with a coefficient near 1 indicating a strong positive correlation (e.g., as payroll goes up, wins go up); a coefficient near -1 indicating a strong negative correlation (e.g., as payroll goes up, wins go down); and a correlation near 0 indicating no correlation (e.g., payroll and wins are unrelated).

2. What is a soft cap? What is the difference between a soft cap and a hard cap? Which does the NBA have? The NBA has a soft cap. A hard cap cannot be exceeded for any reason. A soft cap like the NBA's contains exceptions which allow teams to sign players or make trades that exceed the cap under certain conditions. In practice, few NBA teams are under the cap during a season. Certain components of the NBA's system function as a hard cap under specific circumstances. See question number 20 for more information.

3. Why have a soft cap? A soft cap promotes a team's ability to retain its own players. Nobody likes it when a player plays with one team his entire career, the fans love him, he wants to stay and the team wants to keep him, but he has to leave because the team cannot offer him a satisfactory contract. The exceptions under a soft cap allow teams to keep players under these kinds of circumstances. In addition, they allow teams to make a limited number of changes (replacing department players, improvements, etc.) every year.

4. What is the Collective Bargaining Agreement? It's the legal contract between the league and the players association that sets up the rules by which the league operates. (It's commonly abbreviated as "CBA," which is not to be confused with either the Chinese Basketball Association or the Continental Basketball Association. The abbreviation CBA will be used in the remainder of this document.) The CBA defines the salary cap, the procedures for determining how it is set, the minimum and maximum salaries, the rules for trades, the procedures for the NBA draft, and hundreds of other things that need to be defined in order for a league like the NBA to function. The CBA also prevents the NBA from being in violation of federal antitrust laws. Many of the league's practices (such as the salary cap and draft) would violate antitrust laws were they not agreed to via collective bargaining (see question number 118).

5. Has there always been a salary cap? It may surprise you to learn that the NBA first had a salary cap in 1946-47, its first season. The cap that season was $55,000, with most players earning between $4,000 and $5,000. Star player Joe Fulks earned $8,000, and Tom King earned a league-highest $16,500 for his combined duties as player, publicity director and business manager for the Detroit Falcons. The "modern" NBA salary cap began in 1984-85, at $3.6 million. It made steady but gradual increases of around $1-2 million each season until 1994-95, when it was $15.964 million. Armed with a big TV contract from NBC, the salary cap jumped to $23.0 million in 1995-96, and increased to $26.9 million in 1997-98, the last season of the 1995 CBA (a 647% increase in 13 years). The ABC/ESPN TV contract, which took effect with the 2002-03 season, provided $4.6 billion over six years, but less in 2002-03 than NBC paid in 2001-02. As a result, the salary cap went down for the first time ever in 2002-03. Under the 2005 CBA the salary cap started at $49.5 million, and finished at $58.044 million, a 17.26% increase, and averaging 3.45% per year. However the salary cap decreased in 2009-10, dropping from $58.68 million to $57.5 million. Under the 2011 CBA the salary cap started at $58.044 million and finished at $94.143, a 62.19% increase. This was driven largely by the new national TV deals that took effect in 2016. See question number 6 for more information on NBA labor history.

6. What's the history of the CBA? Bob Cousy began to organize the NBA players in 1954, although the league refused to recognize the union until 1957. A near strike at the 1964 All-Star game forced the league to adopt a pension plan. The first CBA was established in 1970, and new agreements followed in 1973, 1976 and 1980. The 1976 CBA coincided with the settlement of the "Oscar Robertson" suit, which was filed by the players association in 1970 to block the NBA-ABA merger. The 1976 agreement also provided limited free agency through the elimination of "option" clauses that bound players to teams in perpetuity. With the 1983 agreement the parties agreed to share league revenues. This agreement also instituted the modern salary cap, which went into effect in 1984. When this agreement expired the players filed an antitrust lawsuit, resulting in the "Bridgeman" agreement which brought unrestricted free agency, reduced the draft to two rounds, and added anti-collusion provisions. Another antitrust lawsuit ensued in 1994 following the expiration of the 1988 CBA, challenging the salary cap, college draft, and right of first refusal provisions. The parties eventually reached a "no-strike, no-lockout" agreement that allowed the 1994-95 season to be played. The parties came to terms on a new agreement in 1995, but the players tabled a ratification vote and instead filed for union decertification. The league responded by imposing a lockout. The parties quickly came to an agreement, and the players subsequently voted against decertification. A new six-year agreement was ratified which lifted the lockout before any games were missed, although the agreement was not actually signed until 1996. The NBA exercised its option to terminate the 1995 CBA following the 1997-98 season, eventually imposing a lockout which took effect on July 1, 1998 and resulted in the cancellation of the start of the 1998-99 season and the 1999 All-Star weekend. The parties reached agreement on a new six-year agreement in early 1999, just in time to salvage a minimal 50-game season. The new agreement introduced maximum salaries, the Mid-Level exception, and the escrow and luxury tax systems. The league invoked its option to extend this agreement through the 2004-05 season. The NBA and players association ratified a new agreement in July 2005, which expired at the end of the 2010-11 season. The league had the option to extend it through the 2011-12 season, but elected not to do so, citing $300 million in losses during the 2010-11 season alone. When the 2005 CBA expired in July 2011, the league once again imposed a lockout (see question number 7), which was settled in late November 2011. As a result, the 2011-12 season was reduced to 66 games. The 2011 CBA had a 10-year term, but a mutual opt-out after the 2016-17 season. The sides agreed to terms for a new CBA before the opt-out date, which took effect on July 1, 2017. Here is a summary of the league's collective bargaining agreements: Start Year End Year Milestones 1970 1973 First CBA. Increased minimum salaries. Added playoff pool and per diem. 1973 1976 Arbitration. 1976 1979 Suit blocking NBA/ABA merger settled. Added limited free agency (with team compensation). 1980 1983 No-trade clauses eliminated. 1983 1987 Added Salary Cap, "Bird" rights. Technically not a new CBA, rather a Memorandum of Understanding modifying the terms of the 1980 agreement. 1988 1994 Added unrestricted free agency. Length of draft reduced. 1994 1995 Temporary "No-strike, no-lockout" agreement. 1995 1998 Ended 1995 lockout. Added rookie scale contracts. Not actually signed until 1996, and re-opened in 1998. 1999 2005 Settled 1998-99 lockout. Added maximum salaries, Mid-Level exception; escrow & luxury tax. 2005 2011 Luxury tax in effect every season. Reductions in contract lengths & raises. 2011 2017 Players' guaranteed share of revenue reduced. Further reductions in contract lengths & raises. Greater penalties for taxpaying teams. Originally effective through 2020-21; with a mutual opt-out for 2017. 2017 2024 Designated veteran provision. Two-way contracts. Mutual opt-out for 2023.

7. What happened to the negotiations in 2011, and why did they go so smoothly in 2016? The 2005 CBA guaranteed the players 57% of BRI (see question number 12). Coupled with sharply rising expenses, slowing revenue growth caused in part by the economic downturn in 2007-08, and other factors, 22 of the 30 teams lost money in 2009-10, collectively losing a reported $370 million. As a result, the owners sought a complete reset of the league's economic system. The players disagreed over the extent of the losses, and maintained that the league's problems could be addressed through better management and revenue sharing. As a result, the sides were nowhere near an agreement when the 2005 CBA expired in July 2011. The league imposed a lockout, which led to the players filing multiple unfair labor practices charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), a union disclaimer of interest (see question number 118) and subsequent class action lawsuits, several players signing to play overseas (eligible to receive a Letter of Clearance allowing them to do so as long as their overseas contracts let them return to the NBA when the lockout ended), and the cancellation of the entire preseason and the first 16 games of the regular season. The sides ultimately ratified a new CBA in early December 2011, and a 66-game 2011-12 season opened on Christmas Day, 2011. The 2011 CBA was effective through the 2020-21 season, but there was a mutual opt-out allowing the agreement to be terminated at the conclusion of the 2016-17 season. The sides agreed to terms on a new agreement in December 2016, which superseded the 2011 CBA and took effect on July 1, 2017. Many factors were involved in the comparative ease of the 2016 negotiation process, including the improved financial state that resulted from changes made in the 2011 CBA, the influx of new revenue starting in 2016 that came as a result of new national TV contracts, an improving economy, skyrocketing franchise values, and new leadership at both the league and union, with Adam Silver replacing David Stern as NBA Commissioner, and Michelle Roberts replacing Billy Hunter as NBPA Executive Director.

8. Do any unresolved issues remain from the 2017 labor agreement? In 2011 the sides were rushed to complete and ratify the agreement in time to open the season on Christmas Day, so they put off discussing several issues. In 2017 they had more time to work through the issues, so very few items were identified to be discussed at a later date: The review and approval of wearable biometric devices (see below).

The establishment of a player mental health and wellness program, a long-term care insurance plan, and additional financial education programming.

The league and union agreed to bargain over new player conduct rules beginning in 2017-18.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver mentioned the need to continue thinking about the age for draft eligibility (see question number 55) but no official determination has been made to re-open discussions on this issue. The review and approval of wearable biometric devices will be conducted by a joint advisory committee to be established after the agreement takes effect. Wearable devices are devices that are worn by the player, and measure movement information, biometric information, and/or other health, fitness and performance information. Teams will request that the committee review specific devices. Their standard will be whether the device is potentially harmful, has been vetted for effectiveness, and provides adequate security. Approved devices can be worn in practice, but not games, and the player may decline to wear a device. The device can only be used to measure health and performance information, or data for team on-court strategic and tactical use. The data cannot be used for player contract purposes. The player must be given access to his own data.

9. When will the current CBA expire? The CBA runs through the 2023-24 season, although either side may opt out after the 2022-23 season. To do so, notice must be given by December 15, 2022. The CBA also may be terminated early under certain conditions: Certain types of collusion (the players association may terminate).

National TV revenue drops significantly in the next television agreement (the league may terminate).

Certain "force majeure" events (such as war or terrorism) make it impossible or economically impractical for the league to fulfill the agreement (the league may terminate).

Certain provisions of the CBA are struck down in court (either side may terminate).

10. What changes did they make in the 2017 CBA? Please see the appendix for a summary of the differences between the 2017 and 2011 CBAs. The appendix includes links to sections in this document with additional information. In addition, the final editions of this FAQ for previous CBAs may be found at the following locations: CBA Previous edition of FAQ 2011 www.cbafaq.com/salarycap11.htm 2005 www.cbafaq.com/salarycap05.htm 1999 www.cbafaq.com/salarycap99.htm

11. What is included in Basketball Related Income (BRI)? Basketball Related Income (BRI) essentially includes any income related to basketball operations received by the NBA, NBA Properties1, NBA Media Ventures, or any other subsidiaries. It also includes income from businesses in which the league, a league entity or a team has an ownership stake of at least 50%. BRI includes: Regular season gate receipts, minus taxes, facility fees, reasonable expenses, and certain charges including those related to arena financing

Broadcast rights

Exhibition game proceeds, minus summer league expenses

Playoff gate receipts

The value of all complimentary tickets, minus "excluded complimentary tickets" (1.9 million tickets in 2018-18, increasing by 50,000 each season thereafter)

The value of complimentary suite admissions

Novelty, program and concession sales (at the arena and in team-identified stores within proximity of an NBA arena)

Parking

Proceeds from team sponsorships

Proceeds from team promotions

Arena club revenues

Proceeds from summer camps

Proceeds from non-NBA basketball tournaments

Proceeds from championship parades

Proceeds from mascot and dance team appearances

Proceeds from beverage sale rights

Proceeds from cart/kiosk sales in and around the arena

50% of proceeds from tours and ATM fees in arenas 2

50% of proceeds from arena signage 2

50% of proceeds from luxury suites 2

50% of proceeds from arena naming rights 2

50% of the proceeds from team practice facility naming rights 2

Proceeds from other premium seat licenses

Proceeds received by NBA Properties, including international television, sponsorships, revenues from NBA Entertainment, the All-Star Game, and other NBA special events.

Proceeds from gambling on NBA games, except from casinos or other gambling businesses owned or operated by a team, a related party or a league-related entity Some of the things specifically not included in BRI are proceeds from the grant of expansion teams, fines, all forms of revenue sharing, interest income, and the sale of assets. 1 NBA Properties controls the licensing rights for the names, logos, photos & footage, uniforms, league & team programming, and editorial content for the league and teams. 2 Less 50% of taxes and reasonable expenses.

12. How is the salary cap set each year? The salary cap is calculated based on projected amounts for Basketball Related Income (BRI) and benefits for the upcoming season. The projected BRI is a matter of negotiation between the league and players association. Each year the sides meet to try to agree on an amount. If they cannot agree by the end of the previous season (June 30), they instead use: The set amount for national broadcast rights (which is determined in advance), plus

The BRI for the previous season (other than national broadcast rights), increased by 4.5%. The salary cap calculation takes 44.74% of projected BRI, subtracts projected benefits, and divides by the number of teams in the league1. The following adjustments are then made to the result: If the league didn't pay the players enough the previous season, i.e., if they had to cut the players a supplemental check to make their guarantee, then the shortfall, divided by the number of teams in the league 1 , is added to the cap. For example, in 2015-16 there was a shortfall of $130.9 million, which led to a $4.36 million increase in the 2016-17 cap.

, is added to the cap. For example, in 2015-16 there was a shortfall of $130.9 million, which led to a $4.36 million increase in the 2016-17 cap. If there is an overage -- i.e., if the players were paid more (pre-escrow) than their guaranteed share in the previous season -- and the system is getting close to exceeding what the league can get back through the escrow system, then the cap (and tax level) may be reduced in order to put on the brakes (see question number 17 for more information). Here are the salary cap amounts for each season under the 2017 CBA: Season Salary cap 2017-18 $99.093 million 2018-19 $101.869 million The salary cap adjusts each year on July 1, at the start of the July Moratorium (see question number 105). 1 All formulas that divide by the number of teams in the NBA (currently 30) ignore any expansion teams in their first two seasons in the league.

13. Exactly what is included when computing total team salaries? What is cap room? What is a cap hold? A team's cap room (referred to simply as "room" in the CBA) refers to its ability to sign players to free agent contracts. If a team is above the cap, then its room is limited to the exceptions it possesses. If the team is below the cap, then its room is how far it is below the cap when all salaries and cap holds are included. Cap holds are "placeholders" for players the team is expected to sign in the future. For example, a team is expected to sign its unsigned first round draft pick, so an amount is reserved for this signing in the form of a cap hold. A team $10 million below the cap with $4 million in cap holds therefore has $6 million in room. A team $5 million under the cap with $6 million in cap holds is not considered to be under the cap at all, and must use exceptions to sign players. The following are included in team salary: Salaries of all active and inactive players 1 , including likely bonuses.

, including likely bonuses. The full season salary of any players the team acquires in midseason trades.

Salaries paid or payable to waived players, minus any set-off amounts 2 and subject to the Stretch provision (see question number 65).

and subject to the Stretch provision (see question number 65). Any salary still being paid to retired players (see question number 61).

A cap hold for amounts paid or expected to be paid in conjunction with certain grievances.

A cap hold for salaries in contracts that have been agreed to but not yet executed (i.e., verbal agreements or agreements pending physicals) 3 .

. A cap hold for a percentage of the previous salary of every unrenounced free agent (see question number 37).

A cap hold for salaries offered in offer sheets to restricted free agents (see question number 42).

A cap hold for 120% of the "scale" amount for the team's unsigned first round draft pick(s) (see question number 50). This amount begins to apply to team salary immediately upon selection in the draft 4 . This amount can be excluded from the team salary for the current season if, before the season starts, the team and player agree in writing that the team will not sign the player during that season.

. This amount can be excluded from the team salary for the current season if, before the season starts, the team and player agree in writing that the team will not sign the player during that season. A cap hold called an "incomplete roster charge" if the team has fewer than 12 players (players under contract, free agents included in team salary, players given offer sheets, and first round draft picks). This charge is equal to the rookie minimum salary for each player fewer than 12. For example, if there are 11 players included in team salary, then an amount equal to the rookie minimum salary is added to the team salary 5 ; if the roster is completely empty, then 12 times the rookie minimum salary is added to the team salary. This charge only applies during the offseason.

; if the roster is completely empty, then 12 times the rookie minimum salary is added to the team salary. This charge only applies during the offseason. A cap hold for the combined amount of any Mid-Level, Bi-Annual, Disabled Player (see question number 25) and trade exceptions (see question number 87) available to the team (see question number 26), if the team is under the salary cap. (Teams may renounce these exceptions, in which case they no longer are included in team salary.)

Salaries for completed contracts (such as 10-day contracts) are included in team salaries for the remainder of that salary cap year (through June 30). They use a slightly different calculation for determining the team salary in relation to the Apron (see question number 20). This applies to the Bi-Annual, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level, and Taxpayer Mid-Level exceptions (see question number 25), and for Sign-and-Trade transactions (see question number 92). For these purposes they use the team salary as defined above, with the following modifications: All unlikely bonuses are included for contracts and extensions signed under the current CBA.

Amounts that could be included in team salary as the result of certain grievances are included.

For rookies and players with one year of experience who were signed as free agents (not as draft picks) and whose salary is less than the two-year minimum salary, the two-year minimum salary is used in place of their actual salary.

For the team's restricted free agents, the amount of any outstanding qualifying offer or first refusal exercise notice (both including unlikely bonuses), whichever is greater, are included.

The amount of any required tenders for the team's draft picks is included (80% of the scale salary for first round picks; the rookie minimum salary for second round picks).

The amount of any cap holds for empty roster spots (below 12). 6

Cap holds for free agents are excluded.

Cap holds for first round draft picks are excluded.

Cap holds for the team's outstanding exceptions are excluded. They do this because those exceptions and sign-and-trade transactions affect whether the team is subject to a hard cap (see question number 20), and these modifications to the team salary calculation ensure that subject teams remain below the Apron. The following are not included in team salaries: The full season salary of any players the team trades away in midseason trades.

Salaries of some players with long-term or career-ending injuries or illnesses (see question number 61).

The salaries for the team's two-way players (see question number 82).

The "scale" amount for the team's unsigned first round draft pick(s) when the player signs with a non-NBA team. The scale amount is excluded from the team salary on the date he signs a non-NBA contract or the first day of the regular season, whichever is later. The scale amount goes back onto the team salary on the following July 1 or when his non-NBA contract ends, whichever is earlier. In other words, these cap holds are removed for players playing elsewhere during the regular season only. Scale amounts are also excluded from team salary when the team and player both agree in writing that they will not sign a contract that season.

For rookie scale contracts that pre-date the 2017 CBA, the amount of the "conforming increase" (see question number 47) to bring the rookie scale amounts in line with the 2017 CBA (the amount of the conforming increase is excluded unless the pre-increase amount is less than the current minimum salary, in which case the current minimum salary is applied to team salary).

Salaries from summer contracts (see question number 70).

Salaries of players selected in an expansion draft (see question number 114) and waived by the expansion team prior to the start of the season.

Salary not paid to players due to set-off 2 (see question number 65).

(see question number 65). For certain purposes, 50% of salary not paid to players who were suspended by the league is excluded. For example, if a player with a $10 million salary is suspended by the league for exactly half the season, then he loses $5 million, and 50% of this amount, or $2.5 million, is excluded from certain calculations including escrow and luxury tax. The team does not receive extra cap room which it can use to sign another player.

Any bonus amounts for called for in Exhibit 10 of a player's contract (see question number 83). 1 For players who have been in the NBA for three or more seasons and are playing under a one-year, 10-day or Rest-of-Season contract at the minimum salary, the minimum salary for a two-year veteran is used in place of the player's actual salary (see question number 22). 2 Set-off amounts are not deducted from team salary until after the end of the regular season; however they apply set-off retroactively to the final game of the regular season. 3 During the July Moratorium (see question number 105), teams may not enter into verbal or written agreements with most free agents. Therefore any such agreements that are struck during the Moratorium are still characterized as negotiations, and do not count toward team salary. 4 The scale amount is applied immediately upon selection in the draft, but is applied to the team salary for the next salary cap year, which is the salary cap year in which a rookie scale contract can be signed. For example, as soon as a team makes a pick in the 2018 draft, the scale amount is applied to the team's 2018-19 team salary. Nothing is applied to the team's 2017-18 team salary. 5 Since teams are required to have at least 13 players on their rosters (see question number 79), the roster charge reserves a minimum amount of cap space to sign 13 players. For example, if a team has 11 players on its roster, the roster charge reserves cap space to sign the team's 13th player, and the remainder can be used to sign the 12th player. 6 Roster charges for empty roster spots are included for Apron purposes; however additional roster charges are not added to replace other things that are excluded. For example, a team that has nine players under contract, two free agent cap holds and one empty roster charge is considered to have nine players under contract and one empty roster charge for Apron purposes.

14. Is there a minimum amount each team must spend on its payroll? There is a minimum team salary (see question number 13), which for this purpose includes the salaries of players who suffered career-ending injuries or illnesses (see question number 61), and excludes all cap holds. The team salary must be at or above 90% of the salary cap on the date of the team's last regular season game: Season Minimum Violators 2017-18 $89,183,700 Bulls ($3.4 million), Mavericks ($3.3 million) 2018-19 $91,682,100 For minimum team salary purposes the salary of a player who changes teams through trade or waivers is divided among the teams for which he played. For example, if a $10 million player is traded exactly 60% of the way through the season, then the player's original team counts $6 million of the player's salary for minimum team salary purposes, and the player's new team counts $4 million of the player's salary for minimum team salary purposes. Any salary included in team salary as a result of international buyouts (see question number 77) is excluded from team salary for minimum team salary purposes. Teams with a team salary below the minimum are surcharged for their shortfall, with the money distributed among the players on that team. The determination of how the money is distributed is up to the players union. Most recently they have distributed a full share to players who had spent at least 41 games on the team's roster, and a half share to players who had spent 20 to 40 games on the team's roster. However, a player cannot receive more than the maximum salary as a result of a shortfall payment.

15. What percentage of revenues do the players receive? Player contracts are individually negotiated between players and teams, and several factors control the amount each player individually can receive. Collectively, the players are guaranteed to receive 50% of forecasted revenues1, plus (or minus) 60.5% of the amount by which revenues exceed (or fall short of) the forecasts, with a lower limit of 49% of BRI and an upper limit of 51% of BRI. Here are the revenue forecasts for 2017-18 through 2023-24, with 50% of the forecast value (upon which the guarantee is based): Season BRI Forecast 50% of Forecast 2017-18 $5.318 billion $2.659 billion 2018-19 $5.557 billion $2.7785 billion 2019-20 $5.807 billion $2.9035 billion 2020-21 $6.069 billion $3.0345 billion 2021-22 $6.342 billion $3.171 billion 2022-23 $6.627 billion $3.3135 billion 2023-24 $6.926 billion $3.468 billion For example, if BRI for 2017-18 is $5.418 billion (i.e., revenues exceed forecasts by $100 million), then the players collectively are guaranteed $2.7195 billion, which comes from: $2.659 billion, which is 50% of the $5.318 billion forecast, PLUS

$60.5 million, which is 60.5% of the amount by which BRI ($5.418 billion) exceeded the forecast ($5.318 billion) If instead BRI for 2017-18 was $4.8 billion, then the players' guarantee would be $2.352 billion, which comes from: $2.659 billion, which is 50% of the $5.318 billion forecast, MINUS

$313.39 million, which is 60.5% of the amount by which BRI ($4.8 billion) fell short of the forecast for 2017-18 ($5.318 billion).

The above equals $2.346 billion, which is below the lower limit, so the players would receive 49% of BRI, or $2.352 billion. Here is what actually happened in each season: 2017-18 Forecasted BRI: $5.318 billion Actual BRI: $7.147 billion Excess or shortfall: $1.829 billion excess 60.5% of excess or shortfall: $1.107 billion 50% of forecasted BRI: $2.659 billion Theoretical guarantee (50% of forecast plus/minus

60.5% of excess/shortfall): $3.766 billion (51.02% of BRI) Actual guarantee (49%-51% of BRI): $3.645 billion (51.00% of BRI) Since individual salaries are negotiated before the season starts (in many cases years before), and BRI is not determined until the season concludes, there are mechanisms in place to adjust when salaries miss their target. If the players receive less than their guaranteed share of BRI, the league cuts a check to the players association for the difference, and this amount is distributed to the players (this happened in 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17, under the 2011 CBA). The escrow system adjusts the players' salaries when they earn more than their guaranteed share (see question number 16). An additional benefits pool is funded with 1% of BRI, which comes out of the players' share. This pool is used to fund various benefits and annuities for players who have vested. If there is an escrow overage (see question number 16) and the escrow fund is not large enough to bring salaries and benefits down to the players' designated share, they take the remainder out of this pool. 1 BRI forecasts for all seasons covered by the CBA were determined when the CBA was negotiated. Forecasted BRI is different from projected BRI, which is calculated each June on the basis of the league's financial performance in the preceding season (see question number 12).

16. How does the escrow system work? What is it for? The escrow system works hand-in-hand with the players' revenue guarantee (see question number 15) to control the amount of league revenues that go to the players. The escrow system tries to ensure that salaries & benefits do not exceed the players' guaranteed share of BRI. To do this, 10% of the players' salaries1 is withheld from their paychecks and deposited into an escrow account. At the end of each season they compare the players' guaranteed share of BRI to the amount they were actually paid in salaries & benefits. If there was an overage (i.e., if the players were paid more pre-escrow than they were guaranteed), then the amount of the overage is returned to the teams from the escrow account. The players then receive any escrow money that remains. It is also possible that they find themselves at the end of the season with insufficient escrow funds to cover the overage. Here are some examples to illustrate what could happen in the escrow process. In Example A there is not an overage. In Example B there is an overage, but the escrow is sufficient to reduce salaries to the designated percentage. In Examples C there is an overage, which the escrow is insufficient to cover. Example A Example B Example C BRI: $5.318 billion $5.318 billion $5.318 billion Designated share: $2.659 billion $2.659 billion $2.659 billion Salaries: $2.4 billion $2.6 billion $2.8 billion Benefits: $225 million $225 million $225 million Amount held in escrow: $240 million $260 million $280 million Overage (amount salaries & benefits

exceeded designated share): $0 $166 million $366 million Returned to owners: $0 $166 million $280 million Given to players: $240 million2 $94 million $0 In Example A, salaries & benefits are less than the designated share, so the escrow money isn't needed. The players get to keep it all, in addition to receiving a supplemental payment to meet their guaranteed share. In Example B the escrow system successfully lowers salaries back down to the designated share, and the players get to keep what's left over. In Example C there isn't enough escrow money to lower salaries back down to the designated share. The players "owe" $366 million, but the escrow account contains only $280 million. The owners receive the entire balance of the escrow account, but the players don't have to pay any additional money (see question number 17 for more information on this situation). Here is what actually happened in each season: 2017-18 BRI: $7.147 billion Designated share: $3.645 billion Salaries: $3.349 billion Benefits: $297 million Amount held in escrow: $338 million Overage/underage (amount salaries & benefits

exceeded designated percentage): $1.5 million Overage amount retained by NBA: $1.5 million Remainder of escrow given to players: $336.5 million Supplemental check to players

(in event of an underage): N/A Question number 19 describes how the escrow money is distributed to the teams. 1 For Two-Way players (see question number 82), only the player's NBA salary, and not his G-League salary, is subject to escrow withholding. 2 Includes the entire escrow balance, plus a supplemental payment to meet the players' revenue guarantee (see question number 15)

17. What happens when there's not enough money in the escrow account? Players never lose more than 10% of their salaries to the escrow system1. If they reconcile the numbers after the season and discover that the escrow fund is insufficient to return salaries & benefits back down to the players' designated share, they take the shortfall out of the supplemental benefits pool that is funded with 1% of BRI (see question number 15). If they exhaust the entire supplemental benefits pool and still haven't brought salaries down to the designated share, they stop there. The players don't lose any additional money, and will earn more than their designated share that season. However, there is a system in place to try to prevent this from happening. If there is an overage -- i.e., if the players were paid more than their guaranteed amount in the previous season (pre-escrow) -- and the system is getting close to exceeding what the league can get back through the escrow system, then the cap and tax levels may be reduced in the following season in order help put on the brakes. If the overage was less than 6% then no action is taken.

If the overage was between 6% and 9%, then they look at projected BRI (see question number 12). No action is taken if projected BRI will be high enough to fix the problem on its own. If the projected BRI is not high enough, then the cap and tax levels are reduced.

If the overage exceeds 9%, they put on the brakes (by reducing the cap and tax levels) without regard to projected BRI. For example, if the total salaries and benefits for 2019-20 are $4.686 billion and this results in an overage of $351 million (7.5% of total salaries and benefits), and if the projected BRI for 2020-21 exceeds the BRI for 2019-20 by 9%, then the 2020-21 salary cap is adjusted downward by $0.8 million, and the tax level is reduced by $1.07 million. If the players ever end up earning more than their designated share due to a substantial decline in revenues, then both sides will negotiate in good faith to revise the CBA in order to address the issue. 1 The exception is when there is money that should be on deposit with the escrow agent but is not, for example if there is a procedural or accounting error. Any such shortfall is deducted from the players' salaries the following season.

18. What is the "luxury tax?" Why does it exist? How is it determined? Who pays it? The luxury tax is a mechanism that helps control team spending. While it is commonly referred to as a "luxury tax," the CBA simply calls it a "tax" or a "team payment." It is paid by high spending teams -- those with a team salary exceeding a predetermined tax level. These teams pay a penalty for each dollar their team salary (with a few exceptions, see below) exceeds the tax level. The tax level is determined prior to the season, and is computed by taking 53.51% of projected BRI (see question number 12), subtracting projected benefits, and dividing by the number of teams in the league1. The tax level may be adjusted from there, based on what happened during the previous season: If the league didn't pay the players enough the previous season, i.e., if they had to cut the players a supplemental check to make their guarantee, then the shortfall, divided by the number of teams in the league 1 , is added to the tax level. For example, if the players are paid $90 million less in 2017-18 than they are guaranteed, then the 2018-19 tax level is adjusted upward by $3 million.

, is added to the tax level. For example, if the players are paid $90 million less in 2017-18 than they are guaranteed, then the 2018-19 tax level is adjusted upward by $3 million. If there is an overage -- i.e., if the players were paid more (pre-escrow) than their guaranteed share in the previous season -- and the system is getting close to exceeding what the league can get back through the escrow system, then the tax level (and salary cap) may be reduced in order to put on the brakes (see question number 17 for more information). Teams pay an incremental tax rate based on their team salary as of the team's last regular season game, and whether the team is a "repeat offender," i.e., whether they were also taxpayers in at least three of the four previous seasons: Team salary above tax level Non-repeater Repeater Lower Upper Tax rate Incremental maximum Tax rate Incremental maximum $0 $4,999,999 $1.50 $7.5 million $2.50 $12.5 million $5,000,000 $9,999,999 $1.75 $8.75 million $2.75 $13.75 million $10,000,000 $14,999,999 $2.50 $12.5 million $3.50 $17.5 million $15,000,000 $19,999,999 $3.25 $16.25 million $4.25 $21.25 million $20,000,000 N/A $3.75, and increasing $.50 for

each additional $5 million. N/A $4.75, and increasing $.50 for

each additional $5 million. N/A For example: A team with a team salary $12 million over the tax level pays a tax of $21.25 million (the incremental maximum of $7.5 million for $0 to $4,999,999, plus the incremental maximum of $8.75 million for $5 million to $9,999,999, plus $2 million times the incremental rate of $2.50 for $10 million to $14,999,999).

A team that was a taxpayer in three of the four previous seasons, with a team salary in the current season $4 million over the tax level pays a tax of $10 million ($4 million times the repeater rate of $2.50 for $0 to $4,999,999). When determining the amount of tax a team owes, the league uses its team salary (see question number 13) on the date of its last regular season game (i.e., if a player is traded away before the end of the season, then none of his salary is taxed), with the following adjustments: Cap holds and exceptions are ignored.

Any "unlikely bonuses" (see question number 74) that were actually earned are added to the team salary.

Any "likely bonuses" (see question number 74) that were not earned are subtracted from the team salary.

Any trade bonuses (see question number 99) for players received in trade after the last regular season game are added to the team salary. This amount may be pro-rated -- see question number 100 for details.

Any amounts from settlements of grievances are added to the team salary.

For players who signed as free agents (i.e., not draft picks) under the current CBA, and make less than the two-year minimum salary, the minimum salary for a two-year veteran is used in place of their actual salary. 2

For minimum salary players whose salary is partially paid by the league (see question number 22) only the amount paid by the team (the two-year minimum salary) is taxed. Here are the tax levels in each season, and the teams that paid the tax: Season Tax Level Taxpaying Teams (amount paid in $millions) 2017-18 $119,266,000 Cavs ($50.7), Warriors ($32.3), Thunder ($25.4), Wizards ($7.0) 2018-19 $123,733,000 In addition to the financial penalties, a number of restrictions are placed on taxpaying teams, which are described in question number 20. Where does the tax money go? This is described in question number 19. 1 All formulas that divide by the number of teams in the NBA (currently 30) ignore any expansion teams in their first two seasons in the league. 2 If a player in this situation was non- or partially-guaranteed and waived prior to Jan 10 (when all contracts become guaranteed for the remainder of that season), his salary is taxed at the two-year veteran minimum salary, pro-rated for the number of days the player was on the roster. For example, if the player's contract was terminated on the third day of the regular season, his salary for tax purposes is 3/177 of the two-year veteran minimum salary.

19. Where does the escrow and luxury tax money go? The money collected from the escrow (see question number 16) and luxury tax (see question number 18) systems may be distributed to teams or used for league purposes, subject to certain rules: Escrow money: Some or all of the escrow money may be given to teams, but only if given to all teams in equal shares.

Any escrow money not distributed to teams will be used for "league purposes." Tax money: Up to 50% of the tax money may be given to non-taxpaying teams. Note that there is no requirement that any of the tax money be distributed to teams in this manner.

Any tax money not distributed to teams will be used for "league purposes." In other words, at least 50% of the tax revenue will be used for league purposes each season. "League purposes" essentially means for any purpose the league decides, including distributing the money back to teams. Currently 50% of the tax revenue is used as a funding source for the revenue sharing program, and the remaining 50% is distributed to non-taxpaying teams in equal shares. To understand the consequence of crossing the tax line, consider a team just below the tax line that suffers injuries and needs to sign a replacement player. This team would pay the player's salary, pay tax on the amount by which they are now above the tax line, and forfeit any tax distribution they otherwise may have received. Here is what actually happened to the escrow and tax money in each season: 2017-18 BRI: $7.147 billion Designated share: $3.645 billion Designated share percentage: 51.02% of BRI Total salaries and benefits: $3.646 billion Escrow collected: $338 million Overage1: $1.5 million Escrow share per team: $50,000 Tax level: $119.266 million Total tax collected: $115.4 million Tax share per team: $2.219 million Used to fund revenue sharing: $57.694 million 1 Salaries & benefits minus designated percentage.

20. Other than financial penalties, are there restrictions on taxpaying teams? What is the "Apron?" What is the hard cap? In addition to the tax payments described in question number 18, taxpaying teams have the following restrictions: Taxpaying teams do not receive a distribution from the league wide tax fund. However, they remain eligible to receive a distribution from the escrow fund (see question number 19) and from revenue sharing (see question number 21).

Taxpaying teams can acquire less salary in a simultaneous trade (see question number 86). Further restrictions kick-in once a team crosses a point known as the Apron. In 2017-18 the Apron is the point $6 million above the tax threshold. In subsequent seasons the Apron rises or falls by one-half the percentage that the salary cap rises or falls. Here are the tax and Apron amounts in each season: Season Tax Level Apron 2017-18 $119,266,000 $125,266,000 2018-19 $123,733,000 $129,817,000 Teams with a team salary above the Apron have the following additional restrictions. Note that they use the team salary at the conclusion of any transaction to determine whether a team is over the Apron (for example in a sign-and-trade transaction, they look at what the team salary would be after the trade is completed). Teams above the Apron cannot use the Bi-Annual exception (see question number 25).

Teams above the Apron have a smaller Mid-Level exception (see question number 25). It can be used to offer a mid-level contract no longer than three years, while other teams can offer four. The starting salary is also lower.

Teams cannot receive a player in a sign-and-trade transaction (see question number 92).

Teams above the Apron do not have the same protections under the Gilbert Arenas provision (see question number 43). Under the Arenas provision other teams can offer restricted free agents salaries starting up to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. If a team with the right of first refusal does not have Early Bird rights to the player and is over the Apron, it will have only the smaller Taxpayer Mid-Level exception at its disposal, and cannot match an offer for the full Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. The transactions listed above are reserved for teams that are below the Apron. This applies to the entire season in which one of these exceptions is used -- for example, if a team is below the Apron and utilizes its Bi-Annual exception, it commits itself to remaining below the Apron for the remainder of that season (through the following June 30). In other words, when a team is below the Apron and uses its Bi-Annual exception, receives a player who is signed-and-traded, or uses its Mid-Level exception to sign a player to a contract larger than allowed by the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, the team becomes hard-capped at the Apron for the remainder of that season. This eliminates any potential loophole where a team could first use one of these exceptions and subsequently add salary to go above the Apron, since the reverse -- adding salary first and then using the exception -- would be illegal. If a team is hard-capped, it cannot exceed the Apron under any circumstance. If the team subsequently needs to sign a player (for example, to replace injured players) it must first create room under the Apron by waiving player(s) with non-guaranteed salary, waiving player(s) with guaranteed salary and utilizing the stretch provision, trading downward in salary, etc. A team that is hard-capped can sign players to non-guaranteed contracts for training camp or the regular season, but must rid themselves of such players before their salary would take the team above the Apron. A team subject to the hard cap can also sign players to Rest-of-Season contracts during the season, as long as the salary pro-ration keeps the team below the Apron. A modified version of the team salary calculation is used for all transactions related to the Apron and to the hard cap. See question number 13 for details.

21. How does revenue sharing work? How is it different from the luxury tax? The high revenues generated by big-market teams increase BRI, which increases the salary cap, which increases the amount all teams (including low-revenue, small-market teams) are forced to spend on player salaries -- which leads to an unsustainable system. The league's revenue sharing plan works in parallel with the CBA (including the luxury tax) as a one-two punch to address franchise economic disparity. It is designed to help redistribute money from high-revenue teams (generally in big markets) to needier teams (generally in small markets), leading to sustainability and profitability for all 30 teams. The NBA has had some form of revenue sharing in place since the 2005 CBA. Under the 2005 agreement it was funded entirely through luxury tax revenues, and redistributed an average of $40 million per season. However in many cases teams merely got back money they had put into the pool themselves, so the net redistribution of money was much lower than the gross distribution. Under the current plan, for example, $153 million was redistributed to small-market teams in 2013-14. The concept behind the plan is that teams contribute an equal percentage of their total revenues into a common pool (minus certain expenses such as arena expenses), then receive an allocation equal to a 1/30 share of the pool1. Small market teams with lower revenues will therefore contribute less than they receive, and will be net beneficiaries under the plan. Large market teams will contribute more than they receive, and will be net payers under the plan. Other components of the plan are as follows: The plan makes teams responsible for meeting revenue benchmarks, based on the size of the market (determined on the basis of the number of TV households in the team's designated market area) in which they play. Any team that falls short of its benchmark has to make up the difference in its contribution into the pool -- in other words, teams are penalized for underperforming. Revenue benchmarks range from 65% (New Orleans) to 160% (New York and Brooklyn) of the league average revenues.

Teams falling short of their revenue expectations are required to work with the league office to develop and implement a business improvement plan, which could include reorganizing business operations, hiring or replacing staff, or adopting new sales strategies. If a team fails to satisfactorily implement such a plan it could forfeit a portion of its revenue sharing payments (up to 25%).

The percentage of revenues teams contribute to the pool is based on the percentage of league-wide revenues that go to player salaries. For example, if player salaries are 50% of league-wide revenues, then each team would contribute 50% of its revenues into the pool.

Teams in markets with fewer than 1 million TV households do not have to contribute more than 15% of their revenues.

Teams in markets with more than 2.5 million TV households cannot receive a revenue sharing payment. Teams in markets with 2 million to 2.5 million TV households receive a percentage of a full payment (for example, a team with 2.25 million TV households receives a 50% payment). A team with fewer than 2 million TV households receives a full payment.

If a team is profitable without revenue sharing, it receives a smaller or no payment. Any payments from revenue sharing that would lead a team to have a profit over $10 million are eliminated.

High revenue teams are limited in the amounts they have to pay. No team pays more than 30% of its profits in excess of $5 million.

The plan contains an additional discretionary fund of $15 million each year. Teams can apply for assistance payments from these funds.

Revenue sharing calculations are performed and payments are made the February following the season. For example, revenue sharing reconciliation for the 2017-18 season will occur February 2018. The following chart is a simplified illustration of what might happen to teams under the revenue sharing plan. Team A is a low-revenue, small-market team, and Team B is a high-revenue, big-market team: Team A Team B Total revenues (minus expenses): $84.0 million $281.0 million Profit before revenue sharing: ($20.0 million loss) $165.0 million Percentage to fund pool: 55.8% 55.8% Amount contributed into pool: $46.9 million $156.8 million Total pool size: $2.073 billion $2.073 billion Amount received (1/30 of pool): $69.1 million $69.1 million Net paid/received: $22.2 million received $87.7 million paid Contribution limits: N/A $48.0 million Actual amount paid/received: $22.2 million received $48.0 million paid Profit after revenue sharing: $2.2 million $117.0 million The revenue sharing pool is always "fully funded," i.e., it is always funded to its full amount despite some teams having contribution limits. When there is a shortfall, the difference is made up through luxury tax receipts and collective league sources -- 50% of tax revenues goes to fund revenue sharing, with the remaining 50% distributed back to non-taxpaying teams. 1 The pool itself really exists only on paper. A team that "contributes" $150 million into the pool and "receives" $70 million really just sends in a check for the $80 million difference.

22. What is the minimum salary a player can receive? Minimum salaries for all seasons of a contract are based on the minimum salary scale in effect when the contract is signed. To determine the salary for each season of a multi-year, minimum salary contract, read diagonally across the chart below. For example, if a five-year veteran signs a three-year contract, his first-year salary will be the Year 1 salary for a five-year veteran; his second-year salary will be the Year 2 salary for a six-year veteran; and his third-year salary will be the Year 3 salary for a seven-year veteran. Minimum salary scale for contracts signed in 2018-19: Years in NBA1 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 0 $838,464 1 $1,349,383 $1,416,852 2 $1,512,601 $1,588,231 $1,663,861 3 $1,567,007 $1,645,357 $1,723,707 $1,802,057 4 $1,621,415 $1,702,486 $1,783,557 $1,864,628 $1,945,700 5 $1,757,429 $1,845,301 $1,933,172 $2,021,044 $2,108,915 6 $1,893,447 $1,988,119 $2,082,790 $2,177,462 $2,272,134 7 $2,029,463 $2,130,936 $2,232,410 $2,333,883 $2,435,356 8 $2,165,481 $2,273,755 $2,382,030 $2,490,305 $2,598,579 9 $2,176,260 $2,285,073 $2,393,886 $2,502,699 $2,611,513 10+ $2,393,887 $2,513,582 $2,633,277 $2,752,971 $2,872,666 The minimum salary scale amounts for the 2017-18 season were negotiated into the agreement. For each subsequent season the minimum salary scale amounts are determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap to the previous minimum salary scale amounts. For example, if the salary cap increases by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then all minimum salary scale amounts also will increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19. The minimum salary scales for previous seasons can be found HERE. Players on minimum-salary contracts may receive salary advances and deferred compensation (see question number 115), as well as trade bonuses (see question number 97) and Exhibit 10 bonuses (see question number 83). They cannot receive loans or other types of bonuses. Two-Way players (see question number 82) receive the NBA rookie minimum salary (no matter how many years of NBA service they have) on a per-day basis, for each day they are with their parent club. For each day they are on the team's G-League affiliate, they receive a pro-rated portion of the G-League scale salary for that season. Minimum salaries begin to pro-rate starting on the first day of the regular season -- see question number 28). Any salaries below the applicable minimum salary in contracts that pre-date the current CBA are automatically revised upward to the applicable minimum salary. When a player has been in the NBA for three or more seasons, and is playing under a one-year, 10-day or Rest-of-Season contract at the minimum salary, the league reimburses the team for part of his salary -- any amount above the minimum salary for a two-year veteran. For example, the minimum salary for a two-year veteran in 2017-18 is $1,471,382, so for a ten-year veteran, with a minimum salary of $2,328,652, the league would reimburse the team $857,270. Only the two-year minimum salary is included in the team salary, not the player's full salary. They do this so teams won't shy away from signing older veterans simply because they are more expensive than younger veterans. Other notes on league reimbursement of minimum-salary contracts: The team is reimbursed even if the player is waived during the season, as long as the player was paid more than the minimum salary for a two-year veteran.

If the player is traded mid-season the reimbursement is pro-rated between the two teams, in proportion to the amount of time he spent with each team.

For a Rest-of-Season contract (see question number 28) the reimbursement threshold (the two-year veteran minimum salary) itself is pro-rated. For example, the minimum salary for a two-year veteran in 2017-18 is $1,471,382. If a team signs a ten-year veteran to a Rest-of-Season contract on the 60th day of this 177-day season, the league would reimburse the team for any salary paid above $972,608, which is 117/177 of $1,471,382. The pro-rated $972,608 amount also would be included in the team salary. First round draft picks have a more restrictive salary scale, based on their draft position (see question number 47 for more information). 1 A player is credited with a year of service for each season in which he is on a team's active list or inactive list for at least one day during the regular season.

23. What is the maximum salary a player can receive? Are there exceptions to the maximum salary? Here are the league-wide maximum salaries for the first season of a new contract: Years in NBA1 Defined maximum salary 2017-18 2018-19 0 - 6 25% of cap $24,773,250 $25,467,250 7 - 9 30% of cap $29,727,900 $30,560,700 10+ 35% of cap $34,682,550 $35,654,150 The above maximum salaries are for the general case, but there are exceptions. The first exception is that in a multi-year contract only the first season's salary is subject to the maximum. The latter seasons of a contract can have salaries above the maximum, although there are restrictions about how big raises can be from year to year (see question number 53). The second exception is that the maximum salary in the first season of a contract is never less than 105% of the salary in the last year of the player's previous contract. For example, a seven-year veteran free agent who most recently earned $30 million has a maximum salary of at least $31.5 million, even if that is above the league-wide maximum. A free agent does not have to re-sign with the same team in order to receive 105% of his previous salary, although the team that signs him is subject to the same salary cap restrictions as with any other free agent. The third exception is that certain players qualify for the next-higher maximum salary band (for example, a player with four years of experience can sign for 30% of the cap, which is normally reserved for players with seven-to-nine years of experience) at specific points in their careers. This is covered in question number 24. When a team distributes money to its players because it did not spend at least the minimum team salary (see question number 14), no player can receive a distribution that takes his salary above the maximum salary. For example, if a player's salary is $500,000 below the maximum salary, his distribution is limited to $500,000. Players whose salary is at or above the maximum salary cannot receive a distribution. Any money a player forfeits in this manner is redistributed to the other players on his team. 1 A player is credited with a year of service for each season in which he is on a team's active list or inactive list for at least one day during the regular season.

24. What is the Designated Player rule? What are the performance criteria for earning a higher maximum salary? Certain players can receive contracts or extensions that are more favorable (in years and/or salary) than they ordinarily could receive. This applies to players who are finishing their rookie scale contracts (and other players with four years of experience), who can receive a starting salary up to 30% of the cap (which is normally reserved for players with 7-9 years of service). It also applies to players who are finishing their rookie scale extensions (and other players with eight or nine years of experience), who can receive a starting salary up to 35% of the cap (which is normally reserved for players with at least 10 years of service). In addition, players signing a rookie scale extension can be designated by their team to receive a longer extension, totaling six seasons (including the season remaining on their rookie scale contracts). In order to qualify for the higher maximum salary, players must meet certain performance criteria1. At least one of the following must be true: The player was named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team in the most recent season, or both of the two seasons that preceded the most recent season.

The player was named the Defensive Player of the Year in the most recent season, or both of the two seasons that preceded the most recent season.

The player was named the NBA Most Valuable Player in any of the three most recent seasons. For example, if this is the 2018 offseason, then a player meets the performance criteria if he accomplishes any of the following: Named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team in 2017-18

Named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team in both 2015-16 and 2016-17

Named the Defensive Player of the Year in 2017-18

Named the Defensive Player of the Year in both 2015-16 and 2016-17

Named the NBA Most Valuable Player in 2015-16, 2016-17 or 2017-18 The naming of these rules and criteria are somewhat inconsistent and confusing. The Designated Veteran rule allows teams to sign or extend players with eight or nine years of service to a higher salary (up to 35% of the cap). The Designated Rookie rule allows teams to sign players finishing their rookie scale contracts to longer extensions, but does not provide for the higher maximum salary (up to 30% of the cap). In fact, there are no performance criteria the player must meet to qualify for the Designated Rookie rule -- he just needs to be designated by his team to receive a longer extension. The higher maximum salary for these players is provided by the 5th Year, 30% Max criteria. And while the criteria are the same for players with eight or nine years of experience to qualify for the higher maximum salary (up to 35% of the cap), the CBA calls it the "Designated Veteran Player 35% Max Criteria" for these players. A player's eligibility for a higher maximum salary doesn't imply he will actually receive that amount -- as with all contracts, the actual salary is a matter of negotiation between the player (or his agent) and his team. However, a Designated Rookie must receive at least 25% of the cap. In addition, for players entering their fifth season the exact percentage of the cap can be based on how the player meets the 5th Year, 30% Max criteria. For example, a rookie scale extension can specify that the player will receive 27% of the cap if he meets the criteria by being named to the All NBA Second Team, 28% if he meets the criteria by being named to the All NBA First Team, or 30% if he meets the criteria by being named Most Valuable Player. There is a limit to the number of designated players a team can have on its roster at a time. A team can have up to two designated rookies (who received a longer rookie scale extension) and up to two designated veterans (who received higher than the 30% maximum salary) at any time.2 However, only one designated rookie and one designated veteran may have been acquired from another team in a trade. A designated veteran extension can only be signed from the end of the July Moratorium through the last day before the start of the regular season. A player who signs a designated veteran contract or extension can't be traded for one year after he is signed. In summary, the kinds of contracts and extensions that can be signed using the Designated Player rule and the 5th Year, 30% Max Criteria are as follows: Type Qualifications Maximum Salary Maximum Years Designated Rookie Extension Entering 4th season of Rookie Scale Contract; designated by team 25% of cap (30% if meets 5th Year 30% Max Criteria) 6 (including remaining year on current contract) Free Agent Contract after Rookie Scale Contract Finished Rookie Scale Contract, or 2nd round pick or undrafted player with 4 years of service; designated by team 25% of cap (30% if meets 5th Year 30% Max Criteria) 5 Designated Veteran Extension 7 or 8 years of service when extension signed; 1 or 2 years remaining on contract; with same team continuously (unless traded during first four years in the league); meets Designated Veteran Player 35% Max Criteria3 35% of cap 6 (including remaining years on current contract) Designated Veteran Contract 8 or 9 years of service; with same team continuously (unless traded during first four years in the league); meets Designated Veteran Player 35% Max Criteria 35% of cap 5 The mechanisms for extensions are covered in question number 58. 1 In 2017 only, the previous criteria applied for players finishing their fourth season to earn the 30% maximum: A) The player was named to the All-NBA First, Second or Third team at least twice; B) The player was voted as a starter in the All-Star game at least twice; OR C) The player was named the NBA Most Valuable Player at least once. 2 Players who were waived continue to count toward the team's limit of two designated players for the remainder of the original term of the waived contract. However, if the player's cap hit was stretched (see question number 64), the player does not count toward the limit during any stretched-over season. For example, if a designated veteran is waived in 2020 with only the 2020-21 season remaining on his contract, and his cap hit is stretched across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, the player will count toward the limit of two designated veteran players in the 2020-21 season only. 3 Russell Westbrook and James Harden were grandfathered into this rule. Even though each had signed an extension in 2016, they are allowed to sign new extensions per the Designated Veteran rule in 2017 (both players) or 2018 (Harden only) if they remain with the same teams (Oklahoma City and Houston, respectively) and meet the performance criteria.

25. What are salary cap exceptions? The basic rule of the NBA's salary cap is that a team can't sign a player or make a trade that leaves the team's team salary above the cap, unless the team is using an exception. In a system with a soft cap, exceptions are the mechanisms that allow teams to function while above the cap. Some exceptions are available only for making trades, and are described in detail starting in question number 84. The exceptions available for signing players are as follows1: LARRY BIRD EXCEPTION -- This exception allows teams to exceed the cap in order to re-sign their own free agents, up to the player's maximum salary. Teams are said to have "Bird rights" to players who qualify. To qualify for this exception a player essentially must play for three seasons without clearing waivers or changing teams as a free agent, however there are nuances to this rule, which are explained in question number 32. This means a player can qualify by playing under three consecutive one-year contracts, a single contract of at least three years, or any equivalent combination. It also means that when a player is traded, his Bird rights are traded with him, and his new team can use the Larry Bird exception to re-sign him. These contracts can be up to five years in length, with raises up to 8% of the salary in the first season of the contract. Players who qualify for this exception are called "Qualifying Veteran Free Agents" in the CBA, and this exception is formally a component of the Veteran Free Agent exception. The 1983 CBA introduced the modern salary cap, and with it the provision allowing a team to exceed the cap to re-sign its own players. It is commonly believed that this exception acquired its common moniker because Larry Bird was the first such player to be re-signed. However, this is apocryphal, as Bird signed a seven-year contract in 1983 (before this provision took effect), and did not sign another until 1988. Starting January 10 of each season, this exception begins to reduce in value. See question number 26 for details. EARLY BIRD EXCEPTION -- This is a weaker form of the Larry Bird exception. It also allows teams to exceed the cap to re-sign their own free agents, but with more limited contracts than the Larry Bird exception. To qualify for this exception the player must play for two seasons without clearing waivers or changing teams as a free agent (see question number 32 for details and nuances to this rule). A team may use the Early Bird exception to re-sign its own free agent for up to 175% of his salary in the previous season (not over the maximum salary, of course) or 105% of the average salary in the previous season3, whichever is greater (see question number 31 for the definition of "average salary"). Early Bird contracts must be at least two seasons in length, which prevents teams from using the Early Bird to sign a one-year contract, then signing the same player with the full Larry Bird exception the following season. Early Bird contracts can be up to four years in length, with raises up to 8% of the salary in the first season of the contract. Early Bird is also a component of the Veteran Free Agent exception, and qualifying players are called "Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agents" in the CBA. If the player is a restricted free agent with two years of service and qualifies for the Early Bird exception, then the player's prior team may use the Early Bird exception to match an offer sheet he receives from another team under the Gilbert Arenas provision (see question number 43. This is true even if the starting salary for the Early Bird exception is lower than the starting salary in the offer sheet, which is based on the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. A team can renounce its Early Bird rights to a player, and instead re-sign him with the Non-Bird exception (see below). They might do this in order to sign the player to a one-year contract, instead of the minimum two years required by the Early Bird exception. Starting January 10 of each season, this exception begins to reduce in value. See question number 26 for details. NON-BIRD EXCEPTION -- This is also a component of the Veteran Free Agent exception. Its name is somewhat of a misnomer, since Non-Bird really is a form of Bird rights. Players who qualify for this exception are called "Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agents" in the CBA. They are veteran free agents who are neither Qualifying Veteran Free Agents nor Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agents, and include the following: Players who finished the season with a given team, who have played no more than one season without clearing waivers or changing teams as a free agent.

Players who were Early Bird free agents, but whose team renounced its right to use the Early Bird exception to re-sign the player.

Players who were to be Larry Bird or Early Bird free agents, were playing on one-year contracts, and were traded mid-season. This exception allows a team to re-sign its own free agent to a salary starting at up to 120% of his salary in the previous season (not over the maximum salary, of course), 120% of the minimum salary, or the amount needed to tender a qualifying offer (if the player is a restricted free agent -- see question number 42), whichever is greater. Raises are limited to 5% of the salary in the first year of the contract, and contracts are limited to four seasons when this exception is used. A partial season counts as a full season for the tenure calculation related to Bird rights. If a team signs another team's free agent to a Rest-of-Season contract mid-way through the season, then at the end of that season the player is a non-Bird free agent. Starting January 10 of each season, this exception begins to reduce in value. See question number 26 for details. NON-TAXPAYER MID-LEVEL EXCEPTION -- This exception is available only when a team is below the "Apron" (see question number 20). This determination is made after the exception is used, so a team below the Apron cannot use this exception if doing so takes it above the Apron. It cannot be used by a team that has already used the Taxpayer Mid-Level Exception or the Room Mid-Level exception. It allows a team to sign any free agent to a contract with a starting salary up to the following: Season First-year salary 2017-18 $8.406 million 2018-19 $8.641 million The Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception amount for the 2017-18 season was negotiated into the agreement. For each subsequent season the exception amount is determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap to the previous exception amount. For example, if the salary cap increases by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the exception amount also will increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19. This exception may be split and given to multiple players. It may be used for contracts up to four years in length, with raises up to 5% of the salary in the first year of the contract. Signing a player to a multi-year contract does not affect a team's ability to use this exception every year -- for example, a team can use this exception to sign a player to a four-year contract, and use it again the following year to sign another player. Also see question number 26 for more information on the availability and use of this exception. If the player is a restricted free agent with one or two years of service and receives an offer sheet from a new team under the Gilbert Arenas provision, the player's prior team may use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception to match the offer sheet (see question numbers 42 and 43). Again, this exception is only available to teams that are below the "Apron." Teams above the Apron instead must use the smaller Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (see below). Further, any team that uses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception cannot go above the Apron for the remainder of that season. In other words, once a team uses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, it is hard-capped at the Apron (see question 20 for more information). However, if a team uses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception but does not exceed the constraints of the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (e.g., in 2017-18 they use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception to sign a player for $5.192 million or less), then the team is allowed to later exceed the Apron (i.e., it is not hard-capped). If the team later exceeds the Apron, then it is considered to have used the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception rather than the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. But the converse is not true -- if a team is above the Apron and spends any of its Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, it cannot drop below the Apron and spend the remaining money as part of its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. Finally, a team that was above the Apron but did not spend any of its Taxpayer Mid-Level exception has full access to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception if it later drops below the Apron. A different team salary definition is used for determining whether a team is above or below the Apron. See question number 13 for details. In addition, this exception begins to pro-rate downward daily starting on January 10 each season (see question numbers 26 and 28), and expires following the last day of the team's regular season. TAXPAYER MID-LEVEL EXCEPTION -- This exception is available only when a team is above the "Apron" (see question number 20). This determination is made after the exception is used, so a team below the Apron must use this exception rather than the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception if doing so takes it above the Apron. It cannot be used by a team that has already used the Bi-Annual, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level or the Room Mid-Level exception. It also cannot be used if the team has received a player that season in a sign-and-trade transaction (see question number 92). It allows a team to sign any free agent to a contract with a starting salary up to the following: Season First-year salary 2017-18 $5.192 million 2018-19 $5.337 million The Taxpayer Mid-Level exception amount for the 2017-18 season was negotiated into the agreement. For each subsequent season the exception amount is determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap to the previous exception amount. For example, if the salary cap increases by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the exception amount also will increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19. This exception may be split and given to multiple players. It may be used for contracts up to three years in length, with raises up to 5% of the salary in the first year of the contract. Signing a player to a multi-year contract does not affect a team's ability to use this exception every year -- for example, a team can use this exception to sign a player to a three-year contract, and use it again the following year to sign another player. Also see question number 26 for more information on the availability and use of this exception. If the player is a restricted free agent with one or two years of service and receives an offer sheet from a new team under the Gilbert Arenas provision, the player's prior team may use the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception to match the offer sheet, but only if the offer is within the constraints of the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (see question numbers 42 and 43). If a team uses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception but does not exceed the constraints of the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception (e.g., in 2017-18 they use the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception to sign a player for $5.192 million or less) and the team later exceeds the Apron, then the team is considered to have used the Taxpayer Mid-Level exception rather than the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. But the converse is not true -- if a team is above the Apron and spends any of its Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, it cannot drop below the Apron and spend the remaining money as part of its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. Finally, a team that was above the Apron but did not spend any of its Taxpayer Mid-Level exception has full access to the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception if it later drops below the Apron. A different team salary definition is used for determining whether a team is above or below the Apron. See question number 13 for details. In addition, this exception begins to pro-rate downward daily starting on January 10 each season (see question numbers 26 and 28), and expires following the last day of the team's regular season. ROOM MID-LEVEL EXCEPTION -- This exception is available only to teams that drop far enough below the cap to use cap room, and therefore lose their Bi-Annual, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level and Taxpayer Mid-Level exceptions (see question number 26). This exception cannot be used if the team already has used the Bi-Annual, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level or Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. This exception becomes available once the team salary drops far enough that the team loses its other exceptions, and expires following the last day of the regular season. It allows a team to sign any free agent to a contract with a starting salary up to the following: Season First-year salary 2017-18 $4.328 million 2018-19 $4.449 million The Room Mid-Level exception amount for the 2017-18 season was negotiated into the agreement. For each subsequent season the exception amount is determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap to the previous exception amount. For example, if the salary cap increases by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the exception amount also will increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19. This exception may be split and given to multiple players. It may be used for contracts up to two years in length, with raises up to 5% of the salary in the first year of the contract. Signing a player to a multi-year contract does not affect a team's ability to use this exception every year -- for example, a team can use this exception to sign a player to a two-year contract, and use it again the following year to sign another player. Also see question number 26 for more information on the availability and use of this exception. Once a team has used this exception, it can no longer use the Bi-Annual, Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level or Taxpayer Mid-Level exception. BI-ANNUAL EXCEPTION -- This exception is available only when a team is below the "Apron" (see question number 20). This determination is made after the exception is used, so a team below the Apron cannot use this exception if doing so takes it above the Apron. It cannot be used by a team that has already used its Taxpayer Mid-Level or Room Mid-Level exception. It allows a team to sign any free agent to a contract with a starting salary up to the following: Season First-year salary 2017-18 $3.290 million 2018-19 $3.382 million The Bi-Annual exception amount for the 2017-18 season was negotiated into the agreement. For each subsequent season the exception amount is determined by applying the percentage change in the salary cap to the previous exception amount. For example, if the salary cap increases by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19, then the exception amount also will increase by 4% from 2017-18 to 2018-19. This exception may not be used two years in a row (and if this exception was used under the previous CBA in 2016-17, it may not be used in 2017-18). It may be split and given to more than one player, and can be used to sign players for up to two years, with raises limited to 5% of the salary in the first season of the contract. Also see question number 26 for more information on the availability and use of this exception. A team that uses its Bi-Annual exception cannot go above the Apron for the remainder of that season. In other words, once a team uses its Bi-Annual exception, it is hard-capped at the Apron (see question 20 for more information). A different team salary definition is used for determining whether a team is above or below the Apron. See question number 13 for details. In addition, this exception begins to pro-rate downward daily starting on January 10 each season (see question numbers 26 and 28), and expires following the last day of the regular season. ROOKIE EXCEPTION -- Teams may sign their first round draft picks to rookie "scale" contracts even if they will be over the cap as a result (see question number 47). MINIMUM PLAYER SALARY EXCEPTION -- Teams can offer players minimum salary contracts even if they are over the cap. Contracts can be up to two years in length. In a two-year contract, the salary in the second year is specified in the minimum salary scale in effect when the contract was signed (see question number 22). The contract may not contain a bonus of any kind. This exception can also be used to acquire minimum salary players via trade. There is no limit to the number of players that can be signed or acquired using this exception. This exception begins to reduce in value after the first day of the season. For example, if there are 177 days in the season, then this exception reduces in value by 1/177 of its initial value each day. So if a team signs a minimum salary player 90 days into the season, it can pay the player only 87/177 of the minimum salary. See question number 88 for more information on how minimum salary players are handled in trade. DISABLED PLAYER EXCEPTION -- This exception allows a team which is over the cap to replace a disabled player who will be out for the remainder of that season (it can also be granted in the event of a player's death). This exception is granted by the league, based on an application from the team and a determination by an NBA-designated physician or Fitness to Play panel (see question number 62) that the player is substantially more likely than not to be unable to play through the following June 15. If this exception is granted, the team can acquire one player via free agent signing, trade or waiver claim, to replace the disabled player: The team may sign a free agent for one season only, for 50% of the disabled player's salary or the amount of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, whichever is less.

The team may trade for a player in the last season of his contract only (including any option years) 2 , who is making no more than 50% plus $100,000 of the disabled player's salary, or the amount of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception plus $100,000, whichever is less.

, who is making no more than 50% plus $100,000 of the disabled player's salary, or the amount of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception plus $100,000, whichever is less. The team may claim a player on waivers who is in the last season of his contract only (including any option years), who is making no more than 50% of the disabled player's salary, or the amount of the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception, whichever is less. Teams can apply for this exception from July 1 through January 15, and cannot apply after January 15. Once granted, the exception expires when a player is acquired, when the disabled player is traded or returns to the team, or on March 10 of that season, whichever comes first. This exception is granted on a season-by-season basis -- if the player will also be out the following season, the team needs to apply for this exception again the following season. This exception only can be granted to the team for which the player was playing when his injury or illness was known, or reasonably should have become known. A team cannot trade for an injured player and subsequently apply for a Disabled Player exception for that player. If a team's application for a disabled player exception is denied, the team must wait 90 days before submitting another request related to the same player, and then only for a new injury or aggravation of the same injury. Whether the application was approved or denied, the team can apply again (including for the same injury) the following season. If the disabled player comes back sooner than expected he may be activated immediately, and the replacement player is not affected. Don't confuse the Disabled Player exception with the salary cap relief teams sometimes receive after losing a player to a career-ending injury or death (see question number 61). The Disabled Player exception allows a team to acquire a replacement player. The salary cap relief removes a contract from the team's books. Also see question number 26 for more information on the availability and use of this exception. REINSTATEMENT -- If a player was banned from the league for a drug-related offense and later reinstated, his prior team may re-sign him for up to his previous salary, or the estimated average salary for the season in which he is reinstated, whichever is less. See question number 109 for more information on reinstatement.

No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes No No No No Other Cannot be used in consecutive seasons Restricted free agency following option years Approval from the league required. Can be used for a limited time only.

1 The Traded Player exception is not listed because it cannot be used to sign players. 2 This means the Disabled Player exception cannot be used to acquire a player in a sign-and-trade transaction. A sign-and-trade requires signing the player for at least three years (see question number 92). 3 The Estimated Average salary is defined as 104.5% of the average salary for the previous season, but the definition of the Early Bird exception says 105%. As of this writing it is not clear if this is a typo.

26. How do exceptions count against the cap? Does being under the cap always mean that a team has room to sign free agents? Do teams ever lose their exceptions? If a team is below the cap, then its Disabled Player, Bi-Annual, Mid-Level (either the Taxpayer or Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level, whichever applies to the team) and/or trade exceptions are added to their team salary, and the league treats the team as though they are over the cap1. This is to prevent a loophole, in a manner similar to free agent amounts (see question number 37). A team can't act like it's under the cap and sign free agents using cap room, and then use its Disabled Player, Bi-Annual, Mid-Level and/or trade exceptions. Consequently, the exceptions are added to the team salary (putting the team over the cap) if the team is under the cap and adding the exceptions puts them over the cap. If a team is already over the cap, then the exceptions are not added to their team salary. There would be no point in doing so, since there is no cap room for signing free agents. So being under the cap does not necessarily mean a team has room to sign free agents. For example, assume the cap is $100 million, and a team has $90 million committed to salaries. It also has a Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception for $9 million and a trade exception for $6 million. Even though its salaries put it $10 million under the cap, its exceptions also count toward team salary, increasing the total to $105 million, or $5 million over the cap. So the team actually has no cap room to sign free agents, and instead must use its exceptions to sign players. A team has the option to renounce its exceptions in order to reclaim its cap room. So in the example above, if the team renounced its Traded Player and Mid-Level exceptions, then the $15 million is taken off its team salary, which then totals $90 million, leaving the team with $10 million of cap room which then can be used to sign free agent(s). Starting January 10 of each season, the Mid-Level (Non-Taxpayer, Taxpayer and Room), Bird (Larry Bird, Early Bird and Non-Bird) and Bi-Annual exceptions begin to pro-rate2 (reduce in value). For example, if there are 177 days in the season, then these exceptions reduce in value each day by 1/177 of the amount remaining on January 10. So if a team had a $9 million Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception and spent $2 million before the start of the season, then on January 10, and each day thereafter, the exception would reduce in value by 1/177 of $7 million, or $39,548. Even if the team signs another player after January 10, the daily pro-ration would continue to be 1/177 of $7 million. A team's exceptions may be lost entirely, or the team may never receive them to begin with. This happens when their team salary is so low that when the exceptions are added to the team salary, the sum is still below the salary cap. If this happens when the exceptions arise on July 1, then the team doesn't get their exceptions at all. If the team salary ever drops below this level during the year, then the unused portions of any remaining exceptions are lost (and do not return if the team salary later increases). For example, assume there is a $100 million salary cap, and during the offseason a team has $80 million committed to salaries, along with a Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception for $9 million, a trade exception for $5 million, and an unrenounced free agent whose free agent amount is $10 million. The team's salaries and exceptions total $104 million, or $4 million over the cap. What if the free agent signs with another team? The $10 million free agent amount comes off the team's cap, leaving its team salary (including their remaining exceptions) at $94 million. This total is below the cap so the team loses its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level and trade exceptions. There is logic behind this. The whole idea behind an "exception" is that it is an exception to the rule which says a team cannot go over the salary cap. In other words, an exception is a mechanism which allows a team to function above the cap. If a team isn't over the cap, then the concept of an exception is moot. Therefore, if a team's team salary ever drops this far, its exceptions go away. A rule of thumb is that a team may have either exceptions or cap room, but it can't have both at the same time. However, a team in this situation does qualify to use the Room Mid-Level exception (see question number 25). 1 This is just for determining a team's ability to sign free agents and use salary cap exceptions. It has no effect on such things as the luxury tax. 2 The Traded Player and Disabled Player exceptions do not pro-rate in this manner. The Minimum Player Salary exception also pro-rates, beginning on the first day of the regular season.

27. If a team has more than one exception available to sign a particular player, are there any rules regarding which one it has to use? The team has the right to choose which of its available exceptions to use to sign a player. However, teams may not combine exceptions, or combine exceptions with cap room, in order to sign a player. For example, a team $5 million under the salary cap that has not used its $9 million Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception may not combine the exception and the cap room to sign a player for $14 million. This is explained more thoroughly in question number 90.

28. When a player signs mid-year for the rest of the season, is his salary pro-rated? What is a "Rest-of-Season" contract? A "Rest-of-Season" contract is exactly what its name implies -- it is a contract signed after the start of a season, which is in effect for the remainder of that season. With the exception of minimum-salary contracts, salaries do not pro-rate during the season. However, the exceptions that enable players to be signed are subject to pro-ration (see question number 26). For example, a team that has not used its Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception could use its full amount to sign a player on the last day of the regular season. By that day this exception will have pro-rated down to less than half its original value. However a player could sign a rest-of-season contract on that day for the entire pro-rated amount, earning it all for just one game. The minimum salary begins to pro-rate on the first day of the regular season. The minimum salary on a Rest-of-Season contract is based on the fraction of the season remaining when the contract is signed. For example, if there are 177 days in the season, then a minimum salary contract signed on the 60th day of the season is worth 117/177 of the full minimum salary amount.1 If a player signs a multi-year minimum salary contract partway through a season, then the first season is pro-rated and the salary in subsequent seasons is the full minimum salary. Raises are based on the actual salary in the first season of the contract. For example, if a free agent signs a two-year contract on the last day of the regular season and the salary for the first season is $1 million, then the second season salary may range from $950,000 to $1.05 million (plus or minus 5% of the first season salary). 10-day contracts (see question number 80) are also pro-rated. The salary on a 10-day contract is based on the number of days actually covered by the contract (a 10-day contract lasts 10 days or three games, whichever is longer). The G-League salary in a Two-Way contract (see question number 82) is pro-rated as well, if the contract is signed during the season. In addition, the 45 day maximum for NBA service on a Two-Way contract is also pro-rated. 1 It is not considered a
