NRA Launches Ad Campaign Against Manchin
FAIRFAX, Va.— The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) today launched a six-figure TV ad campaign highlighting that Sen. Joe Manchin cannot be trusted to support the rights of West Virginia's law-abiding gun owners.

“Voters deserve the facts before they head to the polls," said Chris W. Cox, chairman, NRA-PVF. "Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.”

The TV spot will run in the Charleston and Bluefield markets beginning today, Wednesday, Sept. 5. Manchin has a “D” rating from the NRA. He has supported criminalizing the private transfer of firearms between lifelong friends and some family members, which the Obama justice department said could only be enforced through federal gun registration.

In addition, Manchin has opposed veterans’ Second Amendment rights.

“Make no mistake, Joe Manchin cannot be trusted to vote with President Trump on our fundamental right to self-defense," Cox concluded.
