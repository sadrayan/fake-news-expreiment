Dirty little secret: Insurers actually are making a mint from Obamacare
Sprung observes that the experience of insurers in Medicaid, especially Medicaid managed care, shows how to expand publicly financed healthcare by offering "a program rather like Medicaid" to even more people. It might be open to all those with incomes below 200% of the poverty line and without access to employer-sponsored coverage, he suggests. The lowest-income enrollees still would get the plan for free or nearly free, and "higher income enrollees could buy in on a sliding scale," Sprung proposes. "Because payment rates would be more like those of our current programs than like private ones, premiums and copays would be lower."
