Oscars 2016 updates: How #OscarsSoWhite advocates will continue to fight for change, and behind-the-scenes images
At the 88th Academy Awards, "Spotlight," the film about the Boston Globe's investigation into priest abuse, won for best picture. Leonardo DiCaprio, heavily favored to win for lead actor, was not disappointed in his fifth chance to take home an Oscar for acting. His director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, had just gotten his second directing win in a row for "The Revenant." The film came into the night with the most nominations at 12 and won three.

Overall, "Mad Max: Fury Road" has the most bragging rights, with six statuettes from 10 nods in total.

The major upset of the evening was Sylvester Stallone's loss to Mark Rylance of "Bridge of Spies" for supporting actor.
