A review of the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate by four independent expert panels and comparison to the IARC assessment
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published a monograph in 2015 concluding that glyphosate is “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2A) based on limited evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in experimental animals. It was also concluded that there was strong evidence of genotoxicity and oxidative stress. Four Expert Panels have been convened for the purpose of conducting a detailed critique of the evidence in light of IARC’s assessment and to review all relevant information pertaining to glyphosate exposure, animal carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and epidemiologic studies. Two of the Panels (animal bioassay and genetic toxicology) also provided a critique of the IARC position with respect to conclusions made in these areas. The incidences of neoplasms in the animal bioassays were found not to be associated with glyphosate exposure on the basis that they lacked statistical strength, were inconsistent across studies, lacked dose-response relationships, were not associated with preneoplasia, and/or were not plausible from a mechanistic perspective. The overall weight of evidence from the genetic toxicology data supports a conclusion that glyphosate (including GBFs and AMPA) does not pose a genotoxic hazard and therefore, should not be considered support for the classification of glyphosate as a genotoxic carcinogen. The assessment of the epidemiological data found that the data do not support a causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma while the data were judged to be too sparse to assess a potential relationship between glyphosate exposure and multiple myeloma. As a result, following the review of the totality of the evidence, the Panels concluded that the data do not support IARC’s conclusion that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” and, consistent with previous regulatory assessments, further concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.

Exposures to glyphosate Unpublished reports of studies on exposure to glyphosate in applicators were provided by Monsanto Company which covered uses in agriculture and forestry (see Solomon 2016 Solomon K. 2016. Glyphosate in the general population and in applicators: a critical review of studies on exposures. Crit Rev Toxicol, in this issue. doi:10.1080/10408444.2016.1214678. for additional details and bibliography). Other data on exposures were obtained from the open literature as a result of searches in PubMed®, references in reviews, and Google Scholar®. These papers and reports were grouped into sources of exposures and the data analyzed as described below. Only one paper reported concentrations of glyphosate in air. In a study conducted in Iowa, Mississippi, and Indiana in 2007 and 2008, concentrations of glyphosate and its major environmental degradate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), were measured in air and precipitation (Chang et al. 2011 Chang FC, Simcik MF, Capel PD. 2011. Occurrence and fate of the herbicide glyphosate and itsdegradateaminomethylphosphonic acid in the atmosphere. Environ Toxicol Chem. 30:548–555.). For estimation of human exposure, it was assumed that there was 100% absorption of glyphosate from the air into the body of a 70 kg human breathing 8 m3 air (half a day for an adult) (US EPA 2009 US EPA. 2009. Exposure factors handbook: review draft. Washington (DC): U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Center for Environmental Assessment (No. EPA/600/R-09/052A), 1265 p. Available from: http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid =209866 [Archived].). Also, surface water measurements of glyphosate as part of the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program (USGS 2015 USGS. 2015. NAWQA Database. Reston (VA): United States Geological Survey (USGS). Available from: http://cida.usgs.gov/nawqa_public/apex/f?p=136:1:0, Accessed September 2 2015.) since 2002 were downloaded from the NAWQA data warehouse and then sorted by concentration. All values measured across the US between 2002 and 2014 were pooled for the analysis. Where concentrations were less than the level of detection (0.02 μg glyphosate acid equivalents (a.e.)/L), these values were substituted with a dummy value of “zero.” Although chlorine and ozone are highly effective in removing glyphosate and AMPA during purification of drinking water (Jönsson et al. 2013 Jönsson J, Camm R, Hall T. 2013. Removal and degradation of glyphosate in water treatment: a review. Aqua. 62:395–408.), it was assumed that treatment did not remove any glyphosate. The estimated concentrations are thus a worst-case. Studies documenting exposures through food and to “bystanders” (persons who are located within or directly adjacent to areas where pesticides are applied but who are not actively involved in the process) were reviewed and data extracted (Acquavella et al. 2004 Acquavella JF, Alexander BH, Mandel JS, Gustin C, Baker B, Chapman P, Bleeke M. 2004.

A critical review of glyphosate findings in human urine samples and comparison with the exposure of operators and consumers. J Verbr Lebensm. 10:3–12.). For those measurements, publications that provided actual systemic dose calculations were used rather than estimates calculated from default exposure factors (e.g. body weight (bw), water consumption, breathing rate, etc.). Where dietary exposures were calculated the urinary concentration was used to calculate the systemic dose on the assumption of 2 L of urine per day and a 60 kg person (Niemann et al. 2015 Niemann L, Sieke C, Pfeil R, Solecki R. 2015. A critical review of glyphosate findings in human urine samples and comparison with the exposure of operators and consumers. J Verbr Lebensm. 10:3–12.). In 2013, the JMPR reviewed dietary exposures to glyphosate (glyphosate, N-acetyl glyphosate, AMPA, and N-acetyl AMPA) and calculated the international estimated daily intakes (IEDI) of glyphosate for 13 regional food diets (JMPR 2014 JMPR. 2014. 5.21. Glyphosate (158) and metabolites. In: Pesticide residues in food 2013. Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues and the WHO Core Assessment Group on Pesticide Residues, Geneva,17 to 26 September 2013. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/Geneva, World Health Organization (WHO) (FAO Plant Production and Protection Paper No. 219), p. 225–228, 484–486. Available from: http://www.fao.org/publications/card/en/c/299ca869-ae51-5093-8407-9cb30782b9f5/.). These IEDIs were based on estimated mean residues from supervised trials under normal or good agricultural practice. The US EPA has calculated exposures to glyphosate using the Dietary Exposure Evaluation Model (DEEM, ver 7.81), based on tolerance levels for all commodities and modeled estimates of exposures from food and drinking water for the overall US population (US EPA 2012 US EPA. 2012. Glyphosate. section 3 registration concerning the application of glyphosate to carrots, sweet potato, teff, oilseeds (crop group (CG) 20) and to update the CG definitions for bulb vegetable (CG 3-07), fruiting vegetable (CG 8-10), citrus fruit (CG 10-10), porne fruit (CG 11-10), berry (CG 13-07), human health risk assessment. Washington (DC): U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (Decision No.: 459870), 28 p.). For studies using dosimetry, the normalization to systemic dose was conducted using the following assumptions: 70 kg adult, 2.1 m2 surface area for a 70 kg male (US EPA 2009 US EPA. 2009. Exposure factors handbook: review draft. Washington (DC): U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Center for Environmental Assessment (No. EPA/600/R-09/052A), 1265 p. Available from: http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid =209866 [Archived].), 10% penetration through clothing if not actually measured, 1% dermal penetration. The estimated systemic doses were ranked from smallest to largest and a cumulative frequency distribution derived. These values were plotted on a log-probability scale. The median (50th centile) and 90th centile values were calculated from the raw data using the Excel function < =percentile>. Where an applicator makes a single application, the systemic dose of glyphosate can be estimated from the total amount of glyphosate excreted in the urine over the 4 or 5 days following and including the day of application (Acquavella et al. 2004 Acquavella JF, Alexander BH, Mandel JS, Gustin C, Baker B, Chapman P, Bleeke M. 2004. Glyphosate for farmers and their families: results from the Farm Family Exposure Study. Environ Health Perspect. 112:321–326.). If applications are conducted every day, the amount excreted each day provides a time-weighted average for daily exposures. Because glyphosate is applied infrequently in normal agricultural practice, the assumption of a single initial exposure is considered appropriate for risk assessment purposes. Exposures via air Based on the above assumptions, inhaling glyphosate in air at the maximum measured concentration would result in an exposure of 1.04 × 10−6 mg/kg body mass (bm)/day. This is about five orders of magnitude less than the systemic ADI proposed by EFSA (2015 US EPA. 2012. Glyphosate. section 3 registration concerning the application of glyphosate to carrots, sweet potato, teff, oilseeds (crop group (CG) 20) and to update the CG definitions for bulb vegetable (CG 3-07), fruiting vegetable (CG 8-10), citrus fruit (CG 10-10), porne fruit (CG 11-10), berry (CG 13-07), human health risk assessment. Washington (DC): U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (Decision No.: 459870), 28 p.). Exposures via water The concentrations of glyphosate measured in US surface waters ranged from 0.02 to 73 μg/L. The 90th centile value was 0.79 μg/L (see Solomon (2016 Solomon K. 2016. Glyphosate in the general population and in applicators: a critical review of studies on exposures. Crit Rev Toxicol, in this issue. doi:10.1080/10408444.2016.1214678.) for details of the calculations), more than four orders of magnitude less than the EFSA ADI. Exposures from food and in bystanders Estimates of glyphosate exposures to bystanders and the general public have been reported by various investigators (Curwin et al. 2007 Curwin BD, Hein MJ, Sanderson WT, Striley C, Heederik D, Kromhout H, Reynolds SJ, Alavanja MC. 2007.

Dessau-Roßlau (Germany): Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), Umweltprobenbank des Bundes [Unpublished Report provided to] Berlin (Germany): German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR).). In these studies, the range for estimates of systemic doses was 0.000022–0.00063 mg/kg/day. These values are all less than the ADI suggested by EFSA. Exposure of applicators The 90th centile in the dosimetry studies was 0.021 mg/kg/day; about five-times less than the systemic EFSA ADI. The range of values for the systemic doses determined by biomonitoring was smaller than for the passive dosimeters. The 90th centile was 0.0014 mg/kg b.m./day; about 70-times less than the systemic EFSA ADI. In summary, there is a robust dataset on glyphosate exposures to humans. Even when using worst-case assumptions, systemic exposures to applicators, bystanders, and the general public are very small. Based on current RfDs and ADIs and measured exposures, there is an extremely large margin of safety from exposure to glyphosate via normal uses.

Discussion and conclusions Four Expert Panels conducted detailed reviews of glyphosate exposure, animal carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and epidemiologic studies. With respect to exposure, even when using a number of worst-case assumptions, systemic doses of glyphosate in human applicators, bystanders, and the general public are very small. Exposures of the general public are three or more orders of magnitude less than the US EPA’s RfD (1.75 mg/kg/day) as well the ADIs established by JMPR (1 mg/kg/day) and EFSA (0.5 mg/kg/day). The RfD is the allowable limit of daily exposure derived from toxicity studies, and even in the most exposed applicators (90th centile) the systemic dose was estimated at 20-fold less that the RfD. Exposures to the public are in the range of 0.00001–0.001 mg/kg bw/day while occupational exposures can range up to 0.01 mg/kg bw/day. Systemic exposures are even lower than the reported ranges since oral and dermal absorption of glyphosate is low. With respect to the animal cancer bioassay data, the Expert Panel conducted a thorough overall WoE evaluation that considered a much wider range of studies than IARC, all of which met Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines and were submitted to support glyphosate Annex I renewal in the European Union. These studies provided evidence that neoplasms naturally occurring in rodents are widely represented in non-exposed animals, as well as those exposed to doses well below those that might be expected in regulatory studies. The pattern of occurrence of these tumors was found to be inconsistent across and within species and no “novel” neoplasms appeared; progression of non-neoplastic to neoplastic lesions also was not seen. Further, the comparatively large number of studies performed would be expected to generate several numerical imbalances by chance. In fact, Haseman (1983 Haseman JK. 1983. A reexamination of false-positive rates for carcinogenesis studies. Fundam Appl Toxicol. 3:334–339.) has estimated that the overall false positive rate for animal bioassays that tested both sexes in two species, because of multiple comparisons, corresponds to 7–8% significance level for the study as a whole; the US Food and Drug Administration has estimated that the overall rate can approach 10%. After review of all available glyphosate rodent carcinogenicity data, the Panel concludes: The mouse renal neoplastic effects are not associated with glyphosate exposure, because they lack statistical significance, consistency, specificity, a dose-response pattern, plausibility, and coherence;

The association of hemangiosarcomas in the livers of mice is weak, lacks consistency, and there was no dose-response effect;

The association of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in male SD rats is weak, not seen in the majority of rat studies, lacks a dose-response pattern (the highest incidence is in the low dose followed by the high dose), plausibility and pre-neoplastic/malignant effects;

In one study, the significant positive trend in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas in male rats did not materialize, no progression to malignancy was evident and no glyphosate-associated pre-neoplastic lesions were present;

In one study, the significant positive trend in the incidence of thyroid C-cell adenomas in female rats did not materialize, the adenomas were only slightly increased in mid- and high doses, and there was no progression to malignancy. Overall, extensive reviews of the genotoxicity of glyphosate, AMPA, and GBFs that were available prior to the development of the IARC Glyphosate Monograph all support a conclusion that glyphosate (and related materials) is inherently not genotoxic. Further, evidence indicative of an oxidative stress mechanism of carcinogenicity is largely unconvincing. The Expert Panel concluded that there is no new, valid evidence presented in the IARC Monograph that would provide a basis for altering these conclusions. Lastly, the Expert Panel’s review of the glyphosate epidemiologic literature and the application of commonly applied causal criteria did not indicate a relationship with glyphosate exposure and NHL. In addition, the Panel considered the evidence for MM to be inadequate to judge a relationship with glyphosate. The extremely large margin of safety found in exposure monitoring studies is considered to be supportive of these conclusions. In summary, the totality of the evidence, especially in light of the extensive testing that glyphosate has received, as judged by the Expert Panels, does not support the conclusion that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” and, consistent with previous regulatory assessments, the Expert Panels conclude that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.
