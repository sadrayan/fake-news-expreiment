FBI Discovers Hacker Guccifer Missing From Jail, Whereabouts Still Unknown

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

An astounding Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that the Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar (known as Guccifer), who successfully gained access to all of the private and government emails of Hillary Clinton, was discovered missing yesterday by agents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who were sent to interview him at the US jail he was supposed to be in—and his whereabouts are still unknown. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

Marcel Lehel Lazar, aka Guccifer

According to this report, Guccifer is at the center of what is turning into one of America’s greatest political scandals for his hacking into the private email server of former Secretary of State (and current US presidential candidate) Hillary Clinton that, in turn, allowed the SVR to gain access to them too—and which recently an unnamed US State Department official admitted to the Washington Times both China and Israel now have possession of too.

As we had previously reported too, Guccifer first came to the attention of the SVR in 2011 when he attempted to hack into the computer systems of the Federation funded RT television network, after which he was able to be tracked and his hacked documents seized—some of which were then authorized to be leaked by Chairwoman of the Council of Federation Valentina Matviyenko that resulted in the 20 March 2013 RT article Hillary Clinton's 'hacked' Benghazi emails: FULL RELEASE.

In early March (2016), it should be further noted, after Chairwoman Matviyenko advocated releasing all of Hillary Clinton’s classified and top secret emails to the public, the Obama regime responded by rushing Guccifer from his Romanian prison cell to the US—and that NBC News kept secret from the American people for weeks afterwards.

Once in US custody, this SVR report continues, Guccifer (who described Hillary Clinton’s illegal email computer server as being “like an open orchid on the Internet”) reached a plea deal with the FBI that in exchange for his cooperation in the Hillary Clinton criminal investigation he would receive a minor prison sentence—and to which he pleaded guilty to on 25 May with his sentencing scheduled for 1 September.

While awaiting his sentencing, this report continues, Guccifer was imprisoned at the Detention Center Bureau (DCB), located in Alexandria, Virginia—but when 3 FBI agents tried to visit him there yesterday, they were informed that he had been moved to an undisclosed location on the evening of 25 May—which (coincidentally?) was just hours removed from a secret meeting held between former President Bill Clinton and the Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch.

SVR analysts note in this report that Attorney General Lynch was the only US government official authorized to move Guccifer from the DCB and that she did so using agents from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) who are under her direct control.

As to why Attorney General Lynch would want Guccifer out of the reach of the FBI, this report says, is likely due to the upcoming interview of Hillary Clinton by those FBI agents investigating her, and that some US news reports say may even be happening today.

And to the most critical information held by Guccifer against Hillary Clinton, this report continues, are the “encrypted computer keys” to emails sent by Secretary Clinton to the Clinton Foundation—and which a recent filing by the US State Department in a US Federal Court seeking to block their release estimated their staggering number at being around 34,000 emails.

The encryption algorithms of Hillary Clinton’s emails deciphered by Guccifer, this report explains, are like a key that specifies the transformation of plaintext into ciphertext, and vice versa for decryption algorithms. Keys also specify transformations in other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature schemes and message authentication codes.

Though not specifically commented on in this SVR report, it does strongly suggest that the Federation has been behind the release of many of these keys to various international news organizations and whistle blowing sites that have then published revealing stories about Hillary Clinton’s nefarious actions, including:

1.) How Hillary Clinton attempted to manipulate the debt negotiations between the European Union and Greece in an attempt to illegally enrich her son-in-law Marc Mezvinsky at the expense of the Greek people.

2.) How Hillary Clinton’s State Department conspired with US Air Force General Philip Breedlove to instigate a war with Russia against President Obama’s express order not to do so.

To if Hillary Clinton, or her husband, will ever be charged for their many crimes against the American people, this report concludes, is never likely to happen as these Western elites exist above the laws they force others to live under and have blackmail files on each other they constantly use to threaten one another—and that the Kremlin now has on Hillary Clinton too.
