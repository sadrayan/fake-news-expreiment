AMISOM Say 110 Al-Shabaab Killed in a Botched Attack on ENDF Base in Halgan Somalia
AMISOM made an update on the mission’s twitter feed confirming that its camp military manned by Ethiopian troops was early Thursday attacked by Al-Shabaab terrorists.

Ethiopian forces managed to respond to the attackers killing 110 militants.

AMISOM’s spokesperson Colonel Joe Kibet as quoted by local and international media said that Al-Shabaab suffered huge blow after their attack on base manned by Ethiopian troops failed.

AMISOM forces killed 110 Al-Shabaab including a foreign fighter and captured a large cache of weapons, Kibet said.

AMISOM has downplayed figures given by Al-Shabaab that it killed 60 AU soldiers as falsehood.

AMISOM troops and SNA jointly drove back the attackers who are now on the run with the joint forces in pursuit.
