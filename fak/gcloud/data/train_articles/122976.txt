N.J. Transit Engineer Has No Memory of Fatal Train Crash, Officials Say
HOBOKEN, N.J. — The engineer of the New Jersey Transit train that crashed into Hoboken Terminal on Thursday, killing one person and injuring more than 100 others during the busy morning commute, felt well rested and was unaware of any mechanical problems in the moments before the accident, federal investigators said on Sunday.

At a news conference in Hoboken, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board said they had interviewed the engineer, Thomas Gallagher, as well as the train’s conductor, who was not identified, and still were no closer to determining the cause of the crash. It was the first fatal accident on New Jersey Transit trains since 1996, Bella Dinh-Zarr, the vice chairwoman of the safety board, said.

Ms. Dinh-Zarr said that Mr. Gallagher, 48, had no recollection of the accident itself and that the first thing he remembered was waking up on the floor of the cab afterward. She said Mr. Gallagher had told investigators that his cellphone was turned off and stored in a personal backpack, which remains in the cab of the control car. She also said Mr. Gallagher had reported that the train was traveling about 10 miles an hour when it entered Hoboken Terminal — a fact that apparently contradicted initial reports that the train was moving at a higher speed.

New Jersey Transit announced on Sunday that all rail service in and out of Hoboken Terminal would remain suspended until further notice. However, the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line at Hoboken was back in service, the agency said.
