Texas House of Representatives
* The Texas House of Representatives has more than 40 committees and sub-committees that meet in public hearings. It is the goal of House Video/Audio Services to provide live broadcasts/web-casts of every meeting, but we are only capable of providing live broadcasts/web-casts of 8 public hearings simultaneously. Therefore, when more than 8 committees are meeting at the same time, some will not be broadcast/web-cast.

However, all House committee clerks are responsible for recording audio of every public hearing. You may listen to these recordings in CD or cassette format in the House Communications, Video/Audio Services office, located in the John H. Reagan Building at 105 West 15th Street, Room 330, Austin, TX. (Just North of the State Capitol) Copies of the audio recordings may be purchased for a fee. For more information, call (512) 463-0920. You may send your signed Open Records Request letter via fax at (512) 463-5729 or mail to the Texas House of Representatives, c/o Video/Audio Services, P. O. Box 2910, Austin, TX 78701.

Also please note: Video/audio programming is produced by the Texas House of Representatives. Chapter 306, Government Code, prohibits the use of video or audio materials produced by the House of Representatives in any political advertising.
