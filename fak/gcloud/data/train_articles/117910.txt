Cargo Manifest
What cargo did the Titanic carry?

Considering the size of the Titanic the amount of cargo carried seems small.

There are some interesting and curious items in the list, including 12 cases of ostrich feathers, 16 cases of Calabashes, 79 goat skins and 76 cases of "Dragon's Blood".

There was also a 25 H.P. Renault car, seemingly cased, the property of First Class Passenger William Carter.
