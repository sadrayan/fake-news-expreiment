I yield to no one in my contempt for this dysfunctional Congress, but calling a recess the vacation is a disservice. Members of Congress, of course, have tried to change the language, calling recesses "district work periods." That may be kind of lame, but the fact is most members use this time to travel to trouble spots or to go back and campaign or do meetings in their home districts or states. They are not laying back in the sun, but working. I would prefer more time in Washington legislating, and less time back in the district. But calling this a five-week vacation is a distortion of reality. Norm Ornstein

Good morning. I write seeking your analysis/comment for a fact check of Gov. Perry’s recent claim Congress is “on a five-week vacation.”

I am aware the recess is in keeping with a 1970 law. I also know you’re expert on the ways and history of Congress.

So: Is Congress on a five-week vacation? Why or why not?

Any other resource you suggest we consult?

I hope to complete this article very soon.

Thanks.
