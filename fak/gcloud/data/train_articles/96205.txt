Wisconsin Democrats Join Speaker Paul Ryan’s Call for Donald Trump to Release His Tax Returns





Wisconsin Democrats, including Senator Tammy Baldwin, Congressman Ron Kind, and State Senator Democratic Leader Jennifer Shilling are joining Speaker Paul Ryan’s call for Donald Trump to release his tax returns.

“The time is way past due for Donald Trump to release his tax returns, as every other major party nominee has done for the past 40 years. The people of Wisconsin and the people of America deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding,” said Senator Tammy Baldwin.

“We recently learned that Donald Trump’s business interests overseas could pose unprecedented conflicts of interest and threaten our national security. Trump needs to immediately release his tax returns to show the American people the extent of his international financial interests. The American people deserve transparency,” said Congressman Ron Kind.

“The people of Wisconsin deserve a President who meets the basic threshold for transparency. We need more insight into Donald Trump's business record other than his dispositions and his lawsuits,” said Senate Democratic Leader Jennifer Shilling.

Last week’s report offers a disturbing preview of the foreign entanglements that could influence Donald Trump, should voters make the grave mistake of electing him president. We now know that over the course of decades, The Trump Organization has been financially involved in more than a dozen countries on five continents -- including Russia, Ukraine, Libya, Turkey, China, and Brazil. These new revelations bring greater urgency to the need for Trump to release his tax returns, so the American people can what influences he might be subject to.
