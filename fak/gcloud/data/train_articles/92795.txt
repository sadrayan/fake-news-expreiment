New Rick Scott TV ad slams Crist for calling Obamacare 'great'
Gov. Rick Scott's re-election campaign launched a new TV spot Monday that takes aim at Democrat Charlie Crist for referring to Obamacare as "great" in a recent CNN interview.

The 30-second spot also shows a St. Augustine Record newspaper masthead and the headline: "300,000 health plans in Florida cancelled," an assertion that has been disputed by the state's largest health care provider, Florida Blue.

Scott's campaign said it will spend $2 million in a statewide TV ad buy set to begin Thursday, March 27.

In a statement, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera said: "Obamacare seems to only be ‘great’ for Charlie Crist and his political career.”

The Crist campaign's response: "When after four years, you have no record and no vision, you spend millions attacking your opponent. It's the Rick Scott playbook and Floridians have had enough."
