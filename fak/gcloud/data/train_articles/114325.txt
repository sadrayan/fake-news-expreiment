Investigative journalism in recent years is almost impossible to find. The New York Times and the Washington Post will not do it -- they are too beholden to the powers that be. That's why those papers are on the decline and in a death spiral.



Along comes Peter Byrne. He's an investigative journalist who is independent -- not on anyone's payroll -- who wants to get to the bottom of American scandals. This particular scandal is astounding and Byrne's book needs to be purchased by every American who cares about the country and how taxpayers are being scammed by their elected officials.



Bottom line: PEOPLE, WAKE UP - they are stealing the post offices in your town. They are selling premium properties to insiders for pennies on the dollar. They are doing this because they don't think you are paying attention. Certain members of Congress are profiting in the form of HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS because there is no oversight, and the nature of government today is that they can get away with anything, and there are no checks and balances.



Peter Byrne's book is the equivalent of Upton Sinclair's THE JUNGLE in this case. It is a wake up call for all Americans to heed. Stop obsessing with NFL football drafts, Dancing With The Stars or Kim Kardashian's makeup for her wedding. They are stealing your post offices from you, taxpayer, so stop being a sheeple, get this book, and see how deep the corruption goes.



Peter Byrne has courageously done the deep-dive necessary to alert Americans to the astounding level of graft of the US Congress in this shocking scandal.
