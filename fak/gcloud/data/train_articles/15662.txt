Hello again. A colleague is asking me to unpack the distinction between single-family residences and homesteads.

Is the following accurate?

Single-family residences sweep in townhouses, condominiums, row houses and owner-occupied duplexes as well as mobile homes, whether an owner lives there or not. Homesteads are limited to residences claimed as a homestead, which can qualify for state and local tax exemptions.

If so, in 2016 Austin had xxxx single-family residences. Among them, property-owners claimed xxxx homestead exemptions. Can you fill in my xxxxx blanks?

In 2016 there were 183,423 single family residences of which 130,253 claimed a homestead exemption.

Thanks,
