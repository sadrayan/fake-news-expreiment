While the controversy surrounding Victoria's fundraising campaign is unfortunate, it's important to remember that the investigation is ongoing and the party representing the campaign is standing by the original story. GoFundMe's internal safeguards have been activated, placing a hold on the account balance until the investigation is complete.Though the majority of giving on GoFundMe occurs directly between friends and family, viral campaigns will receive the attention and support of the greater public. Donors should always exercise caution before giving to GoFundMe campaigns. With over a million campaigns created and over $330M raised, it's not feasible for GoFundMe to research the claims presented by each and every user. Accordingly, donors should only give to people they personally know and trust - advice stated on each and every GoFundMe campaign.
