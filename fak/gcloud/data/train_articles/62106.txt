Remarks by President Trump Before Easter Church Service
Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church

Palm Beach, Florida

10:54 A.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: Happy Easter.

Q Happy Easter, Mr. President.

THE PRESIDENT: Happy Easter. Enjoy it.

Q Mr. President, what did you mean by no DACA deal?

THE PRESIDENT: Mexico has got to help us at the border. If they’re not going to help us at the border, it’s a very sad thing between our two countries.

Mexico has got to help us at the border. And a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA, and we’re going to have to really see.

They had a great chance. The Democrats blew it. They had a great, great chance but we’ll have to take a look, because Mexico has got to help us at the border. They flow right through Mexico. They send them into the United States. It can’t happen that way anymore. Thank you.
