Correct Time to Drink Water....Very Important.



This is interesting!! I knew you need your minimum water to flush the toxins out of your body, but this was news to me.



Correct Time to Drink Water....Very Important



From A Cardiac Specialist!



Drinking water at certain time maximizes its effectiveness on the body:



2 glasses of water after waking up - helps activate internal organs



1 glass of water 30 minutes before a meal - helps digestion



1 glass of water before taking a bath - helps lower blood pressure



1 glass of water before going to bed - avoids stroke or heart attack

Please pass this to the people you care about......
