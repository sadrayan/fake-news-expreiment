Gas caused ferocious explosion that killed couple, destroyed their house
The earth-shaking explosion that killed a Newfield couple and leveled their home Saturday was ruled to be caused by a gas build-up of some kind.

The Gloucester County Fire Marshal's Office determined that the explosion was caused by gas, but could not pinpoint the source of the gas leak or what sparked the blast, according to county spokeswoman Deb Sellitto. They also listed the nature of the explosion as "undetermined."

She said Monday that "numerous sources of ignition" set off the explosion that killed John, 73, and Carole Paladino, 72, at their Oakwood Drive home.

A spokesman for the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office said foul play is not suspected and its detectives are not yet making any other statements about the conclusions of their investigation.

The explosion occurred at 6:15 a.m. Saturday, sending debris all over the quiet residential neighborhood and shaking homes as much as a mile and a half away.
