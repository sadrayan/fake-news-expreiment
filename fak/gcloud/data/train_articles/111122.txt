Antibacterial and Antioxidant Activities of Quercetin Oxidation Products from Yellow Onion (Allium cepa) Skin
Four new quercetin-derived oxidation products (1−4) and lunularin-4-O-β-d-glucoside (5) were isolated from a water extract of onion (Allium cepa) skin, together with 17 other known compounds. Antibacterial assays for the isolated compounds showed that 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-dihydroxy-2-methoxybenzofuran-3-one (1) presented selective activity against Helicobacter pylori strains and 3-(quercetin-8-yl)-2,3-epoxyflavanone (4) showed antibacterial activity against MRSA and H. pylori strains at the same time that it increased susceptibility of MRSA to β-lactams. Evaluation of antioxidant activity against DPPH for the isolated compounds showed that the new derivative compounds (1−4) and 2,5,7,3‘,4‘-pentahydroxy-3,4-flavandione (6) are more active than quercetin.
