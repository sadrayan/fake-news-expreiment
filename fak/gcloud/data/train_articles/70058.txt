Sen. John McCain might miss Republican National Convention
Sen. John McCain and the Republican National Convention go hand-in-hand.

Since 1984, the senior Senator has attended every RNC, most recently Tampa in 2012.

But McCain told reporters Tuesday that he may not attend July's RNC in Cleveland because of his reelection bid for a sixth Senate term this November.

"John McCain will be working and campaigning in Arizona during the convention. He has always taken every election seriously, this year is no different," McCain's campaign spokeswoman, Lorna Romero, told ABC15.

McCain is campaigning against Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick. A recent Rocky Mountain Poll pitted the two candidates as even among voters surveyed.
