Scott, Hinojosa, More Than 100 Democrats Urge Appropriations Committee to Protect Pell Grant Funding

WASHINGTON – Today, Ranking Member Bobby Scott (VA-03) and Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee Ranking Member Rubén Hinojosa (TX-15) and 120 House Democrats sent a letter to Chairman Hal Rogers and Ranking Member Nita Lowey of the House Committee on Appropriations, and to Chairman Tom Cole and Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education (LHHS) Subcommittee, urging them to protect Pell Grant funding in the Fiscal Year 2017 Appropriations Bill.

Tomorrow, the House LHHS Subcommittee will mark up a FY 2017 Appropriations bill that proposes to reduce Pell Grant funding by over $1.3 billion. Redirecting funds away from the Pell Grant program places the program at risk for millions of Americans now and in the future by threatening to make college less affordable.

“Rescissions, cancellations, or funding level cuts will worsen the funding outlook for Pell Grants and make it harder to strengthen the program through reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which Congress is expected to tackle in the coming months and years,” the Members wrote. “Any current surplus balance reflects Congress’ intent and commitment to make college more affordable for millions of students through updating the Pell Grant program.

Last month, Ranking Member Scott, Ranking Member Hinojosa, and the Congressional Tri-Caucus released statements in opposition to a $1.2 billion cut to Pell Grant funding in the Senate Committee on Appropriations LHHS bill.

“We strongly oppose any harmful cuts to Pell funding in this year's appropriations vehicle that will make college more expensive for students in future years,” wrote Ranking Members Scott and Hinojosa in their previous letter to the Appropriations Committee on Pell Grants. “The LHHS appropriations bill should not balance other funding needs on the backs of low-income college students.”

The full text of today’s letter can be found here and below:

Dear Chairman Rogers, Chairman Cole, Ranking Member Lowey, and Ranking Member DeLauro:

In order for students to compete and excel in the 21st century economy, Congress must do more to ensure that they have access to a quality higher education and assurances that they will not be burdened by excessive student loan debt upon graduation. Pell Grants— the foundation of federal financial aid for low-income students—are critical to this effort. Last month, we were disappointed to see the Senate Committee on Appropriations cut $1.2 billion in Pell Grant funding to address other funding needs in its Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education (LHHS) funding bill. As the House Committee on Appropriations continues to work on its LHHS bill, we strongly oppose any harmful cuts to Pell funding in this year's appropriations vehicle that will make college more expensive for students in future years.

To support future improvements to the Pell Grant program that will enhance access and affordability for low-income students, it is critical to preserve all available resources in the program—including a $7.8 billion surplus Pell is carrying forward in fiscal year 2017.

Rescissions, cancellations, or funding level cuts will worsen the funding outlook for Pell Grants and make it harder to strengthen the program through reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which Congress is expected to tackle in the coming months and years. Any current surplus balance reflects Congress’ intent and commitment to make college more affordable for millions of students through updating the Pell Grant program.

The LHHS appropriations bill should not balance other funding needs on the backs of low-income college students. In 2017, we urge you to protect Pell Grants from damaging funding cuts that could make college less affordable for millions of Americans.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

ROBERT C. “BOBBY” SCOTT Ranking Member Committee on Education and the Workforce SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. CORRINE BROWN G.K.
