Patriot Program
The Patriot Program empowers incumbent Members to build strong and winning campaigns through goals, benchmarks, and accountability.

Designed in 2009, every Patriot Program Member plays a vital role in keeping our Republican team on offense and helps build a lasting and productive Republican Majority for the American people.

During this cycle, NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers and Patriot Program Chairman Rep. Ryan Costello are working to ensure that the programâ€™s members are ready to run well-funded and organized campaigns against their Democratic opponents.
