Just had a quick chat with our reporting team and they say we haven’t updated our Recovery Tracker since 2012 so you might want to check with the SBA directly to fact check this claim. Our data comes from USASpending.gov (uploaded by the SBA).

Hope that makes sense. Sorry we couldn’t be of more help!

Subject: Austin reporter with an urgent inquiry

Good afternoon.

I am researching a fact check of a claim that a Texas company, Pinnacle AIS, benefited from Obama stimulus dollars. The group making this claim cites as an indicator this web post by ProPublica. Is it accurate to say the web post shows Pinnacle AIS fielded an Obama stimulus-funded loan of $652,000? If not, what is accurate?

The company has told me that while it applied for such a loan, it ended up going to conventional funding for its project.

I seek an on-the-record response from ProPublica about this post.
