"I am a Bernie supporter, but he told me what to do," Murakami said, referring to Sanders' repeated pleas to supporters over the last two days to support Clinton and join together to support the Democratic party in opposition to Republican nominee Donald Trump.

But Murakami noted that some newer members of the party may not trust him too much with their protest plans, as a more long-standing member and office-holder of the state's party.
