Carly Fiorina to Valerie Jarrett: Shouldn�t Equal Pay Start at the White House?
President Barack Obama made a point of mentioning pay equity for women in his State of the Union speech last night, a line that got applause from Democrats but not a lot of love from the GOP. “Republicans don’t stand for equal pay — literally,” was the common Twitter line.

On Wednesday morning Republican businesswoman Carly Fiorina asked Jarrett why, if Obama believed so passionately in equal pay, he didn’t start with the White House.



“I am struck by the fact the president hasn’t really led in this regard,” Fiorina said on Morning Joe. “He’s not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House. …Why wouldn’t the White House take on the seniority system and say let’s pay women by merits and results?”

“White House women do earn equal pay for equal work,” Jarrett responded, and left that portion of the question there.

“The bill that’s currently before Congress would make it easier for women to find out if they are being discriminated against,” she continued. “The first bill the president signed, the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, was an important step….But there is no good reason why Congress hasn’t passed the Paycheck Fairness Act. And if they don’t think that does the job, what’s their solution?”
