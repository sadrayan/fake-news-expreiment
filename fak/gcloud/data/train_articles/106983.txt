Buchanan Says America Was Better When Blacks Knew Their Place
By Mary Washington

Former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan says America was a better place back in the 1950s.

“Back in the ‘50s everyone knew their place, whites over here, blacks over here, Mexicans over here and the women were at home raising the kids,” said Buchanan in an interview with the Conservative Chronicle. “Things functioned better when everyone understood where they needed to be.”

This is not the first time that Buchanan has looked backed on the era of legal segregation and rampant sexism fondly.

In an interview with NPR, Buchanan said America was a better country when it was dominated by white men.

“It’s an America like the country I — It’s an America like the country I grew up in, which was a pretty good country,” said Buchanan.

Many supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump like his message of making America great again. They seem to want go back to a past when minorities were neither seen nor heard.

In an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation,” “Barbara,” a Nevada voter who supports Trump, said she wanted to the country to return to a past era of “moral values.”

“I think that the laws that Obama has passed, the way the country has — I call it down turning. Some of the other people are proud of it and happy for it. I personally am against it, the homosexuals, the abortions. All the stuff, I am against,” she said.
