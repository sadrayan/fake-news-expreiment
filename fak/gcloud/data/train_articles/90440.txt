BEGIN TRANSCRIPT



CALLER: Hi, Rush. It's a pleasure to be here with you. I have two concerns that are quite bothersome to me. The first is on the oil leak, the big oil spill.



RUSH: Yeah?



CALLER: And I haven't heard anything about this but we know what happened in the ClimateGate situation, and we know about the faulty research and the faulty data, et cetera, and I'm sure that something like this has been done but it's a thought. Is it possible that somebody on the other side might have thought in their minds for the greater good to maybe not have done some maintenance on the oil lines, to maybe have what they thought might have been a controlled oil leak that got outta hand to try and shut off or shun the thought of having any more offshore oil drilling?



RUSH: Well...



CALLER: And all of a sudden we have this huge leak. The whole thing now shifts to we shouldn't be drilling offshore because of this leak.



RUSH: Charlie Crist already led the way there on suggesting we shouldn't be doing any more drilling. By the way, Charlie Crist sometime today, is going to announce that he's going to go for the Senate seat in Florida as an independent.



CALLER: Yes.



RUSH: And it's being reported, it's being reported he reached out to Rahm Emanuel. He tried to call Rahm Emanuel to try to get the White House behind his candidacy, and they wouldn't take the call because they're going to get behind Meek, who is the Democrat in this. I mean, it's amazing. Now, back to your question. Sure these kind of suspicions, the reason you haven't heard anything about is because nobody's got any proof.



CALLER: Right. I'm wondering if something has been launched to look into even something like this; that it wasn't just a spill, a break, but maybe something that was done purposefully.



RUSH: There was an explosion. There was an explosion and some people died in this. Now they're trying to contain the oil spill, which is pretty big. They're trying to surround it and corral it and tow it out there then they're going to set fire to it. You know, oil floats on water so what they're going to try to do is have a controlled burn of this stuff. Now, Homeland Security is investigating what happened here, which should inspire lots of confidence that we're gonna get to the bottom of it. Then the regime is going to have a statement here on the oil spill in the Gulf coming up pretty soon. After the regime speaks on this, we'll have a better idea because however this happened, accidentally, however it happened, the regime's going to use this for all it's worth. (laughing) We know this. So it really doesn't matter, Mike, if this was an accident or an act of sabotage. The regime will use the occasion of this event to its own political advantage. RUSH: Mike in South Florida, great to have you on the EIB Network, sir. Hello.CALLER: Hi, Rush. It's a pleasure to be here with you. I have two concerns that are quite bothersome to me.

RUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, I didn't hear this myself, but I have been informed that President Obama is sending SWAT teams to the Gulf oil rigs. SWAT teams? I'm waiting on audio sound bite confirmation of this, but why in the world would you send SWAT teams to Gulf oil rigs? Oh, I know! Obama probably thinks the tea party blew up the rig. That's what it is. (laughing) Yes. Of course the tea party did it! (laughing) Seriously, you know, this rig... We had this call from a guy out there who said nobody's talking about whether this was an act of sabotage because I guess they can't prove it, but they're going to send SWAT teams down there? He was going to send a SWAT team to the rig that blew up or are you going to send a SWAT team to other rigs? What's going on here? Remember, this rig blew April 21st, which is one day prior to "Erf" Day.



I have a story here from Reuters, September 24th, 2008 (shuffling paper) right here in my formerly nicotine-stained fingers: "Nobel Peace Prize winner and environmental crusader Al Gore urged young people on Wednesday to engage in civil disobedience to stop the construction of coal plants without the ability to store carbon." So you got the guru here urging civil disobedience, you got the regime sending SWAT teams down there to all the rigs in the Gulf. They're sending SWAT teams to all the rigs in the Gulf! Whoa ho-ho-ho. So obviously Obama thinks the tea partiers are expert scuba divers as well or maybe they have their own fleet of underwater submarines that can go deep enough to go undetected, set explosives, and hightail it back to the protests in Ohio, or wherever they (laughing) happen to be.



So 15 years of no global warming. "That's just anecdotal! It doesn't disapprove anything! It doesn't disapprove that there's a man-made threat going on." But one oil spill -- one oil spill which might have been intentional -- is enough to prove that offshore oil drilling is unsafe and should never be done. This is the logic we're forced to live with. There hasn't been any warming in 15 years, that doesn't mean anything. Those e-mails were hoaxed! The readings at the climate unit in East Anglia, they were all made up. "Doesn't matter. What matters is who leaked those e-mails. What the e-mails said doesn't matter." But those guys made it all up, and they wouldn't produce the data that led to their conclusions. They say they lost it. "Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter at all!" But it hasn't warmed in 15 years. "It doesn't matter." But I just saw a story you guys say you're looking for the "lost" heat. "Doesn't matter." One oil rig blows up, and it proves we can't dig, drill, find more oil.



RUSH: Now, here's the regime kicking into action here on the Gulf oil well or the rig explosion, President Obama mere moments ago in the Rose Garden before presenting the teacher of the year award.



OBAMA: I do want to speak briefly to the American people about the recent BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Earlier today DHS Secretary Napolitano announced that this incident is of national significance and the Department of Interior has announced that they will be sending SWAT teams to the Gulf to inspect all platforms and rigs and I have ordered the secretaries of interior and Homeland Security as well as administrator Lisa Jackson of the Environmental Protection Agency to visit the site on Friday to ensure that BP and the entire US government is doing everything possible not just to respond to this incident but also to determine its cause.



RUSH: Wow. All right, so SWAT teams, we're sending big sis down there, Janet Napolitano, to look at all the valves and stuff, make sure they're properly greased. He-he-he-he. Ahem. And Lisa Jackson is doing the same thing. So obviously the regime is open to the idea that this is not an accident. The regime is open to the possibility that this could well have been on purpose. Don't forget, the original Earth Day, 40 years ago, was inspired by the river in Cleveland catching fire. Forty years later, the day before Earth Day this year, the Gulf is on fire. Coincidence? Jury's still out. The regime is on the case, soon to tell us what happened.

RUSH: I want to get back to the timing of the blowing up, the explosion out there in the Gulf of Mexico of this oil rig. Since they're sending SWAT teams down there now this changes the whole perspective of this. Now, lest we forget, ladies and gentlemen, the carbon tax bill, cap and trade that was scheduled to be announced on Earth Day. I remember that. And then it was postponed for a couple of days later after Earth Day, and then of course immigration has now moved in front of it. But this bill, the cap-and-trade bill, was strongly criticized by hardcore environmentalist wackos because it supposedly allowed more offshore drilling and nuclear plants, nuclear plant investment. So, since they're sending SWAT teams down there, folks, since they're sending SWAT teams to inspect the other rigs, what better way to head off more oil drilling, nuclear plants, than by blowing up a rig? I'm just noting the timing here.



From The Hill, about the Senate bill: "Sierra Club chief Michael Brune told The Hill’s E2 Wire: 'We will go to the mat for defending Clean Air Act authority.' Brune also pointed to another potential stumbling block: offshore drilling. 'We will not be able to accept the dramatic giveaway that offshore oil drilling represents,' he said." The five hurdles the climate bill must clear, and one of them is offshore drilling. That's in TheHill.com.

RUSH: Our official climatologist, Dr. Roy Spencer has just sent me something. I've been wondering about this. He must have been reading my mind. We've got 5,000 barrels a day being spilled from the rig, and Dr. Spencer looked into it. You know, we've talked of this before. There's natural seepage into oceans all over the world from the ocean floor of oil -- and the ocean's pretty tough, it just eats it up. Dr. Spencer looked into this. You know the seepage from the floor of the Gulf is exactly 5,000 barrels a day, throughout the whole Gulf of Mexico now. It doesn't seep out all in one giant blob like this thing has, but the bottom line here is: Even places that have been devastated by oil slicks like... What was that place up in Alaska where the guy was drunk, ran a boat aground? (interruption) Prince William Sound. They were wiping off the rocks with Dawn dishwater detergent and paper towels and so forth. The place is pristine now.



You do survive these things. I'm not advocating don't care about it hitting the shore or coast and whatever you can do to keep it out of there is fine and dandy, but the ocean will take care of this on its own if it was left alone and was left out there. It's natural. It's as natural as the ocean water is. (interruption) Well, the turtles may take a hit for a while, but so what? So do we! Hell, remember that story we had at the beginning of the show: The barred owl that flew into the windshield of the Wentzville, Missouri, fire truck, and they got to the fire and the thing was still hanging on out there. It had a broken wing and they took it to some animal veterinary sanctuary or hospital or something. Just give it a pain pill! Why not? That's what they had for us, and we don't even launch ourselves into the windshields of fire trucks.
