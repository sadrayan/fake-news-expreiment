"To put it in perspective, AISD could lower its tax rate by 35 cents if it were not for the $406 million we must pay in recapture this year. For our average homeowner, that would amount to about $1,400 in lower taxes per year. That would make our district a lot more affordable for many who have been forced to move. Without some kind of relief in recapture for our taxpayers, we will continue to face many challenges.”

Number broken down a little further (below).

It may be helpful to summarize the info simply with rounded numbers and then add the more specific breakdown (e.g.):

The owner of a home with an average taxable value of $330,000 is expected to pay about $3,550 in school taxes ( M&O rate ). The portion of school taxes paid for recapture is expected to be about $1,360 .

The Math: Broken Down

Total Budgeted Property Taxes = $1.061 Billion

Total Budgeted Recapture = $406 Million

Ratio of Recapture to Taxes = 38.2%

M&O Taxes on Average Value of Residence of $328,844

$328,844 / 100 * 1.079 (M&O Rate) = $3,548.22

Portion of taxes on average residence that goes to recapture

38.2% * $3,548.22 = $1,355.42

Here’s a one-sheeter for our recapture payment over the past ten years, and next year projected.

Per Ms. Conley:

The values will change if using the median I am sure because it is lower.

For Truth & Taxation purposes, school districts use averages. You can verify on the comptroller website and tax code (see below)

School districts file one notice that includes, among other items:

comparison of property tax rates;

comparison of the proposed budget and last year's budget;

comparison between last year and current year property taxes on an average residence; and

unencumbered fund balances.

The notice includes information about the total appraised and taxable value for all property and all new property for last year and this year and a section listing the school's total outstanding and unpaid bonded indebtedness.

We receive the Average taxable value figure directly from the Travis Central Appraisal District. Attached you will find where that figure was published in the Austin American-Statesman June 9, 2016 paper as a notice to taxpayers of a public meeting to discuss our budget and tax rate. Since this is the number that was published, it is the number we are consistent with using till the next preliminary appraisal values come out for FY2017-18.

A moment ago, I obtained more up-to-date information from the Travis Central Appraisal District.

Marya Crigler, chief appraiser of the Travis Central Appraisal District, initially provided us a slightly lower average home value for the Austin district ($328,253 as of Aug. 8, 2016).

Crigler told me too that the appraisal district … uses the median value home in its calculations because that number is exactly the half point of all home appraisals; the average, Crigler said, can be skewed by values at the very top and very low ends.

Next, we took the median value of homes in the Austin district as of Aug. 8--$261,487--and ran that through the district’s equation for determining how much an average homeowner pays toward its recapture total. Result: The median-value homeowner will be expected to pay $2,821 in M&O school taxes, of which $1,078 would be the homeowner’s share of the district’s total recapture payment.

Make sense?

That does make sense, and I would say is a correct calculation given just one change in variable (median instead of average).

Of course, as Senator Watson’s statement was “the average homeowner” then that could be taken either way depending which variable was used, and when talking about the district, I think it’s fair to use the variable that we do.

I hope we helped you get what you needed and let us know if you need anything further.

Thanks, and I’ll look for the article when it’s published.
