Members of Congress Received $238K in Farm Subsidies
WASHINGTON --- Environmental Working Group¹s 2013 update of its Farm Subsidy Database shows that 15 members of Congress or their spouses benefitted from a total of $237,921 in taxpayer-funded farm subsidy payments last year.

EWG¹s compilation of farm subsidies has been searched nearly 440 million times since 2004 and is widely credited for advancing efforts to reform farm subsidies.

The farm subsidy database tracks $256 billion in farm income support through commodity, crop insurance, and disaster programs and $39 billion in conservation support paid to farmers and landowners from 1995 through 2012. However, EWG is prohibited by federal law from reporting crop insurance subsidies, which now comprise two-thirds of the farm safety net.

"EWG and the taxpayers footing the bill cannot know which farmers, including which members of Congress, receive subsidies to buy crop insurance," said Craig Cox, EWG¹s Senior Vice President for Agriculture and Natural Resources. "We do know that in 2011, 26 policyholders received more than $1 million apiece in crop insurance premium support in 2011, and that more than 10,000 policyholders received more than $100,000 each. U.S. Department of Agriculture has refused to provide us with the same information for 2012."

Sens. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) have filed an amendment to the Senate farm bill to allow the USDA to disclose which farmers receive crop insurance subsidies. Traditional farm and conservation programs limit the amount of money an individual or business can receive from the government. There are no such limits on crop insurance subsidies.

According to EWG's analysis of data derived from USDA records, members of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate who received farm subsidies in 2012 were:

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Rep. Robert Aderholt's (R-Ala.) wife, Caroline Aderholt, is a 6.3 percent owner of McDonald Farms according to 2008 ownership records. McDonald Farms received $66,891 in direct payment farm subsidies in 2012. She also personally received a $345 direct payment in 2012. EWG’s estimate of 2012 farm subsidies to Caroline Aderholt, using the percentage share information received from USDA, comes to $4,559. Caroline Aderholt’s total estimated amount of subsidies – directly and through McDonald Farms – is $207,426 from 1995-2012.

Rep. Kristi Noem (R- S.D.) received $1,400 in direct payments in 2012. Through 2008, USDA listed Rep. Noem as a 16.9% partner in Racota Valley Ranch. The estimated amount of subsidies attributed to Rep. Noem from 1995-2012 is $503,751.

Triple V Dairy received $22,453 in payments in 2012 for direct payments and MILC. The most recent ownership information from 2011, does not list Terra but also does not list the ownership percentages. Assuming the wife's ownership percentage was added to David's – the EWG estimate of the amount of subsidies to Rep Valadao from Triple V Dairy in 2012 is $7,484. Valadao Dairy received $82,373 in payments in 2012 for direct payments and MILC. The ownership information EWG received for Valadao Dairy is from 2011 and ownership percentage information is not available. However, there are 4 owners of Valadao Dairy and assuming equal shares, the EWG estimate of the benefit to David Valadao is $20,593. The total EWG estimate of subsidy benefits in 2012 to Rep. Valadao is $28,077. The estimated subsidy amount attributed to Rep. Valadao from Triple V Dairy and Valadao Dairy from 2005-2012 is $185,724
