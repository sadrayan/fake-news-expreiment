Dems new weapon against GOP candidates? Rick Scott
This photo of Gov. Rick Scott looking, shall we say, not exactly at his most manly state, seems to be a emerging as a favorite of Democratic attack mailers against Republican candidates. We've seen the state Democratic party use it against Bill Gunter in the special election for House District 36 in Pasco County, and this time it shows up in flier from a group called Fact Check Florida bashing St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster.

Scott, by the way, had nothing to do with the fire service fees this flier references.
