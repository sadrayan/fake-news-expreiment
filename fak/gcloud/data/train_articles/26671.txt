Senate Extends Term of F.B.I. Director
The Senate on Wednesday voted unanimously to extend the tenure of Robert S. Mueller III as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for two more years. Mr. Mueller, first appointed by President George W. Bush, was to step down on Aug. 2 because of a 10-year term limit imposed during the post-Watergate era. But President Obama asked Congress to allow Mr. Mueller to stay on, arguing that his national security team needed continuity because the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency were getting new leaders.
