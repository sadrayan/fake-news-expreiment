Only 3 students scored college-ready in Camden
The new school superintendent in Camden says it was a "kick-in-the-stomach moment" when he learned that only three district high school students who took the SAT this year scored as college-ready.

Paymon Rouhanifard on Tuesday told the school board and the community what he learned on a "listening tour" after he was named to the post in August.

He told the city's Board of Education that low college readiness shows the district must do better.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that the superintendent also says he also heard about safety problems in the district. He says one action he's taking immediately is waiving the $75 background check fee for parents who want to volunteer in the schools.

In June, the state assumed control of the schools in the poverty-stricken city of 80,000.
