Rep. Price Statement on Irresponsible “National Emergency” Declaration
Washington, DC (February 14, 2019) – Congressman David Price (D-NC) released the following statement on the news that President Trump will declare a national emergency on the border:

"Since neither Mexico nor Congress will pay for his ridiculous 2,000-mile border wall campaign promise, President Trump has set a dangerous precedent by declaring a phony “national emergency” that circumvents the will of Congress and the American people. Not only is there no national emergency at the border: crossings remain at historically low levels. This extraordinary move underscores how President Trump still fails to comprehend the powers and responsibilities entrusted to him under our laws and the Constitution. His reckless action will be swiftly challenged in the legislature and the courts."
