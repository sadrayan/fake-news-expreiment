Krauthammer Response
Statement from Dr. Charles Krauthammer

about his American Experiment Annual Dinner Remarks

A number of people have asked about the availability of an audio recording or transcript of Charles Krauthammer’s brilliant remarks at American Experiment’s 2009 Annual Dinner on June 1. We’re sorry, but Dr. Krauthammer has informed us that he does not disseminate comments made at private events. He also has advised us that a summary of his speech on the Internet is “neither accurate nor authoritative.” His full statement follows. The Center regrets any disappointment or confusion.

This account is neither accurate nor authoritative. My views on Obama are well known. I’ve explained them in a series of five columns. (See below.)

This email is somebody putting his own ideological stamp and spin on my views.

One giveaway of the superimposition of someone else's views on mine is the rather amusing use of phrases that I never use. To take just a few examples randomly: "God forbid," "far left secular progressive," “this is the first president ever who has chastised our allies and appeased our enemies!” “no country had ever spent themselves into prosperity,” and, the real doozy,"states rights.”

My views are clearly spelled out in that series of columns and subsequent writings. Anyone who wants to know my views should consult those and not this email.
