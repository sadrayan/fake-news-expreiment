Unfortunate incident but No, family was not forcibly stripped. They stripped as a protest since Police was not writing FIR. This incident happened two years back i.e Oct 2015

IndiaToday reported –

The whole episode flared up after a video of a naked Dalit family protesting against alleged inaction of the Uttar Pradesh Police in Gautam Budh Nagar district went viral in social media on Thursday. A National Commission for Scheduled Castes team on Friday visited the Dankaur area in Uttar Pradesh’s Gautam Budh Nagar and met the Dalits, who were arrested on charges of public obscenity. Five people, including three women, were arrested on Thursday after they allegedly stripped in a market in Dankaur in Gautam Budh Nagar, to protest the police’s alleged refusal to register a complaint of robbery.
