...please see the AP article below (which drew the same conclusion as we did as you can see in their headline) and O’Rourkes quote. Ted Cruz doesn’t think legalizing narcotics should be ‘on the table.’ Beto O’Rourke does.

Why would he want to have a national conversation about legalizing all narcotics, if he didn't support legalizing all narcotics? Texans deserve to know why, and he should explain why.

El Paso wants feds to consider legalizing drugs

Concerns about the the bloody drug war being fought just across the Mexican border have El Paso leaders asking the federal government to consider legalizing drugs.

Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso city councilman, pushed a resolution Tuesday that asks the U.S. government to start an "open, honest, national dialogue on ending the prohibition of narcotics."

"We think it should at least be on the table and so far it hasn't," O'Rourke said.

The council, which oversees a city of more than 600,000 people that is considered one of the safest U.S. cities of its size, unanimously approved the request.

The nonbinding resolution suggests that legalizing drugs in the United States could help curb a volatile and bloody drug war that claimed nearly 1,600 lives in Ciudad Juarez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso, in 2008. Thousands more were killed across Mexico.

But the request may be a tough sell to a newly minted Congress facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and two wars.

A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, a former U.S. Border Patrol agent, said he has not seen the resolution and was not available for comment Tuesday.
