Africa Check funding since 2012
Diversity & transparency of funding

As a leading supporter of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and its Code of Principles , Africa Check is committed to transparency about our funding and organisation.

Africa Check is a non-profit organisation, headquartered in South Africa as a non-profit Trust, registration number IT000728/2015(C). It is registered as Africa Check Foundation in Kenya and operates in Nigeria and Senegal through representative offices. Founded in London in 2012 as a Community Interest Company, control of the organisation passed to the SA-registered Trust at the start of 2019. Information on 2012-2017 accounts is available on this link at UK Companies House . 2018 accounts will be added once audited. 2019 accounts will be published in South Africa.

Our commitment since we were launched in 2012 with just one funder – the Vienna-based International Press Institute – has been to increase and diversify the number of our financial supporters, to ensure that no donor has a controlling influence. In 2014, a small group of foundations and trusts provided 100% of our income. In 2018, that group has grown and diversified and earned income and corporate sponsors account for 17% of income. As verified by the IFCN’s independent assessment of our work each year, we ensure that funders have no influence over the conclusions we reach in our reports.

Africa Check’s mission and work is supported by TRI Facts (PTY) Ltd, our training and research business unit, registered in South Africa as (Registration number (2018/623180/07)

Putting Africa Check on track for the future
