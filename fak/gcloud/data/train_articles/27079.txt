BREAKING: Colin Kaepernick Immediately Loses Nike Endorsement After Anti-White Rant
As you’ve probably heard, anti-American NFL washout Colin Kaepernick was recently named the face of Nike’s 30th anniversary “Just Do It” campaign. Kaepernick, who is currently suing NFL owners for “collusion” against him after he was deemed unfit to play in the NFL, became famous with liberals when he disrespected our flag and country by kneeling during the National Anthem to protest law enforcement.

The contact is a “wide endorsement”that was to include shoes, shirts, jerseys and more branded in Kaepernick’s name. But there’s a problem — Kaepernick lost the endorsement almost as soon as he got it when his anti-white attacks got him in trouble with Nike leadership.

“Those crackers won’t know what hit them,” Kaepernick told a friend at a party celebrating his new deal. “The rednecks at Fox News and all those other honkeys will have to deal with the fact that I’m rolling in dough.”

Kaepernick was “almost immediately” dropped from Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign when Nike officials listened to the recording. A representative for Kaepernick said that they had “no comment” when we contacted them.

Unfortunately, someone recorded the conversation and sent it to Nike president Charles Bartowski, Breitbart reports:

This is yet another blow to Kaepernick’s fragile ego — and a victory for Americans who are sick of him and others like him disrespecting their country.
