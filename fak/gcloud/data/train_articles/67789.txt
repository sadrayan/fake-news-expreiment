Donald Trump Says He Would Break NAFTA
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Sunday that he would renegotiate or break the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

“We will either renegotiate it or we will break it,” Trump said during an interview on 60 Minutes, following a question about how to keep American jobs from moving to Mexico. “Because, you know, every agreement has an end.”

NAFTA, which has been in effect since the mid-1990s, allows free trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico.

“We need fair trade. Not free trade,” he said. “It’s got to be fair.”

Trump is not the only GOP candidate to suggest that the U.S. can and should break its international agreements in some circumstances. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina all have said they would renege on the Iran nuclear deal the Obama Administration struck earlier this year.
