Valor awards for John Sidney McCain , III
Legion of Merit

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit with Combat "V" to Commander John Sidney McCain, III (NSN: 0-624787), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States while interned as a Prisoner of War in North Vietnam from October 1967 to March 1973. Under the most adverse of conditions, he resisted all attempts by the North Vietnamese to use him in causes detrimental to the United States, never wavering in his devotion and loyalty to the United States. In an outstanding and tireless fashion, he served as Chaplain wherein he provided spiritual guidance, instilled constructive rehabilitative thinking and conducted religious services for the benefit of the other prisoners during their long internment. In addition, he served as an educator to provide diversion and constructive rehabilitative thinking to his fellow prisoners. Despite the lack of material aids, he devoted long hours toward improving their morale and well-being. His extraordinary skill, resourcefulness, and dedication to duty throughout this lengthy confinement reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Naval Service and the United States Armed Forces. (Commander McCain is authorized to wear the Combat "V".)
