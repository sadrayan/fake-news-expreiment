Clown Hunters
Breaks into my house? That would assume I lock my doors at night. Canadian, remember? I guess up here in Canada we don't have insane people that break into houses wearing clown costumes.



I guess you could make up endless scenarios where it would be r

ight to use a gun to defend yourself and your families, if this wasn't a hoax status, and everyone taking it serious are looked at like "Average Stupid Americans" that eat whatever is on their newsfeed.



If only you stupid Americans could figure out the fact that I didn't say you couldn't legally arm yourselves, or say you can't legally defend your families, or really lol, ANY of that! (But you're stupid Americans, what can I expect from people who are voting Trump into office)



Oh and, all of these clown sightings and recent stories are all a hoax. If any of you fucktarded Americas had any brains you'd research shit before you open your fat mouth's.



The one real killing was in the UK, not even the US! There is no stories of clowns breaking into houses and killing people either. So all of you with that stupid argument are wrong, as it doesn't exst.



Next, there actually has been people rallying to get together and hunt clowns. Example A: THIS FUCKING FACEBOOK PAGE.



I mean, are you all this fucking stupid? Stop typing while you eat McDonalds please.



Did none of you read what the OP said or just skip that and read the retard that said "WE HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTECT OUR FAMILIES IF THEY BREAK IN" ?!



Original Poster: "WE WON'T SIT INSIDE, WE WILL PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOODS FROM THE CLOWNS!"...... <- That would imply, unless your neighborhood is inside of your house, that the OP did not mean "Stay inside and protect his family".



So in conclusion



I'm right. (Shocker, Canadian is right)



You're all wrong. (Again real surprise here)
