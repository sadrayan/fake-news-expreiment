STOP OBAMA AND CARTER
Sadly, Chicago-style politics have come to Georgia. Atlanta liberal Jason Carter has hired Barack Obama’s trusted campaign team.

Now, Carter and his Chicago liberals are attacking Governor Nathan Deal’s personal character. Liberals know they can’t hit Gov. Deal on jobs, the economy, or education. So they’ve resorted to attacking Gov. Deal’s character.

Typical liberals.

Tell Jason Carter and Barack Obama's campaign team, we don’t need Chicago-liberals running around Georgia attacking our conservative values.
