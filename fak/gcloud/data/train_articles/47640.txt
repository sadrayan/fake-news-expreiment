Trump Holds Rally in Pennsylvania to Help a Congressional Candidate, and Himself
MONTOURSVILLE, Pa. — President Trump’s presence in a district in north central Pennsylvania was not really needed to help the Republican congressional candidate who is heavily favored in a special election on Tuesday.

The rally the president held on Monday night in Montoursville, and in a week that he is also headed to Japan, was really about his own political fate — and how vital Pennsylvania, and the central part of the state in particular, is to his chances for winning a second term.

It is an area replete with culturally conservative, white, working-class voters whose energy in 2016 delivered the state’s 20 electoral votes by less than one percentage point to Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton.

That kind of victory will not be easy to replicate.

“Everybody who voted for him in 2016 will vote for him again,” said Val DiGiorgio, the chairman of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania, who spoke at the rally before Mr. Trump. “The question is, where do you pick up more votes and what is the intensity going to be for both sides?”
