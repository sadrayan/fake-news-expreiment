It's Okay To Be Different: Todd Parr: 8601400302347: Amazon.com: Books
My daughter is 6, she has grown up with one of her closest friends having Down syndrome. But when she made her way to public school in first grade there were difference in religion, clothing, appearances, and language that she was being faced with. And as all children do, she started to ask questions about why her new friends weren't like her old friends. So we bought this book after seeing it in a store, and she loved it!!!!



As a mommy, I loved it because t blended serious differences with silly ones, that helped keep her attention. The drawings assist in keeping her attention and created a visual representation of what the book was talking about.



Weeks after purchasing and reading the book, she brings it up and talks about it when we are out and about and see things that make every person different. It really helped me explain mental illnesses, religion, and other things that make people different, but not visually different. It also helped her to defend a friend at school that was getting picked on for not celebrating Halloween, she explained to the kids about all of the ways that people can be different. One proud mommy!!!! And a grateful mommy for a book that helped simplify a difficult conversation.
