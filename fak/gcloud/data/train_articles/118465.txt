SPOTTED: Fried Chicken Oreos
With new flavors popping up all the time like Limeade and Peanut Butter Cup, it's not that hard to believe there could be a fried chicken flavor of Oreos somewhere out there. While we're gonna keep an eye on these to verify their validity, Fried Chicken Oreos are officially on the radar. If these are real, I'm going to make it a personal goal of mine to find and eat them with a bucket of KFC.
