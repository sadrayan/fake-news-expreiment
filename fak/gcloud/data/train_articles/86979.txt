OECD Better Life Index
Personal security is a core element for the well-being of individuals, and includes the risks of people being physically assaulted or falling victim to other types of crime. Crime may lead to loss of life and property, as well as physical pain, post-traumatic stress and anxiety. One of the biggest impacts of crime on people’s well-being appears to be through the feeling of vulnerability that it causes.

Feeling safe walking alone at night

According to recent data, about 68% of people in OECD countries say they feel safe walking alone at night. There are major differences, however, between countries. While 85% or more of people in Finland, Norway, Slovenia, Iceland and Switzerland say they feel safe, the level in Chile is just below 50%, and below 40% in Brazil and South Africa. Latvia is closer to the OECD average with 62%.

Homicide rate

Homicide rates (the number of murders per 100 000 inhabitants) only represent the most extreme form of contact crime and thus do not provide information about more typical safety conditions. They are however a more reliable measure of a country’s safety level because, unlike other crimes, murders are usually always reported to the police. According to the latest OECD data, the average homicide rate in the OECD is 3.7 murders per 100 000 inhabitants.
