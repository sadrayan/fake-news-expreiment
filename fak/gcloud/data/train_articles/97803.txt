LIS Cross-National Data Center in Luxembourg
LIS is a cross-national data center located in Luxembourg which serves a global community of researchers, educators, and policy makers.

LIS acquires datasets with income, wealth, employment, and demographic data from many high- and middle-income countries, harmonises them to enable cross-national comparisons, and makes them publicly available in two databases, the Luxembourg Income Study Database (LIS) and the Luxembourg Wealth Study Database (LWS).

LIS is an internationally respected venue for cross-national research in the social sciences, serving as a host of international conferences, visiting scholars, and pre-and postdocs and a virtual host for scholarly exchange.

Our mission is to enable, facilitate, promote, and conduct cross-national comparative research on socio-economic outcomes and on the institutional factors that shape those outcomes.
