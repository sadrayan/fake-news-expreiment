UEFA has charged Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg with fan racism in a Europa League game.

Zenit fans have been accused of racist behavior and throwing objects during last week's game against Leipzig, which saw the Russian team eliminated 3-2 on aggregate.

The case will be heard on May 31, about two weeks before Russia hosts the World Cup.

UEFA hasn't provided any details of the incident. However, the anti-discrimination FARE Network has said there were chants mocking an injured black player.

It is Zenit's second racism case of the season. They were also fined back in December when their fans displayed a giant banner honouring Bosnian Serb war criminal Ratko Mladic.
