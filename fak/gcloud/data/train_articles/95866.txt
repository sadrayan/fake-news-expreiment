UltraViolet is a powerful and rapidly growing community of people who work to expand women’s rights. UltraViolet puts the voices of all women, especially women of color and LGBTQ women, front and center.

Equality at a higher frequency--that's what we're all about. Here are just a few examples of our recent successful efforts, using tech-based tools to engage and educate the public:

UltraViolet showed that 55 cases of abuse went unanswered for at the NFL under Commissioner Goodell’s watch. Through petitions, phone calls and more, we pushed for a policy change at the NFL. UltraViolet highlighted 36 colleges with our new website endcampusrape.com, which includes stories from survivors, videos on consent, and infographics.

Over the summer of 2014 UltraViolet launched “Board of Tourism” ads in ten states calling out the pay gap, lack of paid leave and restrictions to reproductive care. Paid sick days ballot initiatives passed in Massachusetts and New Jersey after awareness campaign that included Board of Tourism billboards and airport mobile ads.

On the national scene, President Obama signed executive orders to help women in the workplace, including raising the minimum wage for federal contractors, requiring gender data on pay equity, and protecting women from retaliation when speaking out about unequal compensation, which followed UltraViolet working with Lilly Ledbetter to successfully petition the President.

Later that spring, the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault announced plans that included recommendations from the over 10,000 UltraViolet members, many of them survivors, who submitted proposals to address the epidemic of campus rape. And in the private sector, after AOL's CEO cut benefits and blamed pregnant workers for them, nearly 50,000 UltraViolet members pushed Armstrong to rescind the benefit cuts and issue a public apology for his offensive comments.

In late 2013, UltraViolet members asked the Senate to confirm Professor Nina Pillard, a strong advocate for women's rights, to the DC Circuit Court. When Pillard was blocked, UltraViolet members successfully pushed for the Senate filibuster rules to be reformed, and Pillard was officially confirmed to the bench. Continued pressure in Steubenville, Ohio also resulted in four school administrators being indicted for covering up the now-infamous rape. In the fall, UltraViolet members called for justice for Renisha McBride, and won when the county prosecutor charged her shooter with second-degree murder and manslaughter.

In spring 2013, the Reebok-sponsored rapper Rick Ross released a single in which he bragged about drugging and raping a woman. After nearly 100,000 UltraViolet members spoke out, including 526 rape survivors, and generated more than 500 news articles, Reebok dropped their sponsorship of the rapper. UltraViolet partnered with NARAL Pro-Choice America to successfully petition Yahoo to take down deceptive advertisements run by crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs).

When congressional conservatives blocked reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, UltraViolet Action members--including over 2000 survivors of domestic violence--generated hundreds of calls and 100,000 petition signatures to Congress, and donated to fund a television ad, ultimately helping push Congress to pass an expanded and improved VAWA.

In spring 2012, Rush Limbaugh called a Georgetown grad student a “slut” dozens of times on national radio after she testified in favor of insurance coverage for birth control. UltraViolet members called for accountability, and ultimately got 140 of Rush’s advertisers to pull their ads from his radio program.
