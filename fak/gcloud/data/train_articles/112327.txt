About Us

The Southern Daily South Africa (Previously In South Africa Today) is a Zimbabwe owned but South African operated internet portal for casual news, friendly satire, and some dose of cool updates.

South Africa is the cradle of mankind, and a key figure in the regional dynamics of the continent. We serve to entertain, engage, and inform our readers.
