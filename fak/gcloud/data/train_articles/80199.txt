Forced labour is the antithesis of decent work. Almost 21 million people are victims of forced labour globally – trapped in jobs which they were coerced or deceived into and which they cannot leave. The least protected persons, including women and youth, indigenous peoples and migrant workers, are particularly vulnerable.The majority of bonded labourers are in Asia and Latin America. They pledge their labour against a loan or a wage advance. An accident or sickness can oblige workers to borrow more money, which plunges them into a vicious cycle of indebtedness,Children of the Tamang ethnic group working in a stone quarry in Nepal.
