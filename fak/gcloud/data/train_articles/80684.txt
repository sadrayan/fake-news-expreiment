GIULIANI IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE

“The Phenomenal Decline Under Mr. Giuliani Of Larger Crimes Such As Murder, Robbery And Rape Was Matched By A Reduction In Quality-Of-Life Offenses – Which In Turn Contributed To The Drop In Major Crime …” (Editorial, “Return Of The Squeegee?” New York Observer, 1/7/02)

Giuliani’s “Zero Tolerance” Strategy Cleared New York City Of “Beggars And Drug Addicts.” “‘The streets in Manhattan were clean, with no beggars or drug addicts, and there were police everywhere – my wife and I never felt threatened,’ said [Ed] Elliott. ‘The contrast with London couldn’t be greater. Where I live now people get mugged, the streets stink of litter and there is graffiti and prostitutes’ cards everywhere.’ … New York, he says, has benefited from Mayor Rudolf [sic] Giuliani’s ‘zero tolerance’ campaign …” (Colin Freeman, “West End Now As Bad As New York At Its Worst,” The Evening Standard, 8/10/01)

Giuliani Cracked Down On Squeegee Men. “Rudy Giuliani adopted the broken-window approach to policing when he became mayor of New York City in 1994. Even though New York was besieged with gang violence, muggings and murder, Giuliani turned the city police’s attention to small, quality-of-life concerns, and with astonishing success. … When police cracked down on the infamous squeegee men who harassed commuters by city bridges, they sent the message that the laws – all of them – were to be taken seriously.” (Editorial, “Fixing Broken Windows,” The Daily News Of Los Angeles, 1/11/02)

Giuliani Cleaned Up Times Square. “‘It’s great to have him moving in here. It’s very symbolic,’ said Ellen Goldstein, director of community management for the Times Square Business Improvement District. ‘He’s the guy who chased out the porn, the three-card monte guys, the squeegee men from Times Square. Nobody would be building offices in Times Square if Rudy Giuliani hadn’t been mayor.’” (“Giuliani to Take Office In Heart of Times Square,” Newsday, 1/3/02)

Giuliani Brought Together A Public-Private Partnership To Clean Up Times Square. “About four years ago, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani harnessed a private-public team of developers to start cleaning up Times Square, bringing in shiny, neon-lighted hotels, theme stores and restaurants that are the core of the area’s renaissance.” (Verena Dobnik, “At Almost $30 Million, 42nd Street Studios Serve Nonprofit Artists,” The Associated Press, 6/20/00)

Giuliani Removed Pornography From City And Times Square. “‘It’s great to have him moving in here. It’s very symbolic,’ said Ellen Goldstein, director of community management for the Times Square Business Improvement District. ‘He’s the guy who chased out the porn, the three-card monte guys, the squeegee men from Times Square. Nobody would be building offices in Times Square if Rudy Giuliani hadn’t been mayor.’” (“Giuliani to Take Office In Heart of Times Square,” Newsday, 1/3/02)
