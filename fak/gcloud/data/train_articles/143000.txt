ICANN WHOIS
NOTICE, DISCLAIMERS AND TERMS OF USE:

On 17 May 2018 the ICANN Board adopted a Temporary Specification for gTLD Registration Data. This page is under review and will be updated to address the Temporary Specification.

All results shown are captured from registries and/or registrars and are framed in real-time. ICANN does not generate, collect, retain or store the results shown other than for the transitory duration necessary to show these results in response to real-time queries.* These results are shown for the sole purpose of assisting you in obtaining information about domain name registration records and for no other purpose. You agree to use this data only for lawful purposes and further agree not to use this data (i) to allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission by email, telephone, or facsimile of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising, or (ii) to enable high volume, automated, electronic processes to collect or compile this data for any purpose, including without limitation mining this data for your own personal or commercial purposes. ICANN reserves the right to restrict or terminate your access to the data if you fail to abide by these terms of use. ICANN reserves the right to modify these terms at any time. By submitting a query, you agree to abide by these terms.

* There is one exception: ICANN acts as the registry operator for the .int TLD, and in that capacity it does collect, generate, retain and store information regarding registrations in the .int TLD.
