Obama's Tapping Of Trump's Phones Is "Soviet-Dictator Level Wrongdoing"
Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer, Senior Fellow at London Policy Center, joined Rusty Humphries of "Trending Today USA with Rusty Humphries" to talk about the allegations made by President Donald Trump on Twitter that former President Barack Obama ordered wiretaps of his phones during the election.



Shaffer says that this could be the first time that we see a former president indicted for felony, and that this is "soviet-dictator level wrongdoing."
