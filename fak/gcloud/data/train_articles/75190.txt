Thomas Dimassimo reveals he met Donald Trump at beginning of Ohio rally
Thomas Dimassimo, 22, was arrested for disorderly conduct and inducing panic on Saturday

The man who attempted to rush the stage at Donald Trump's campaign event in Ohio on Saturday tweeted that he spat in his hand before he shook Trump's hand at the start of the rally.

Thomas Dimassimo, 22, was arrested for disorderly conduct and inducing panic after he vaulted over the nearly waist-high railings to break through Trump's security staff and get on stage with the GOP presidential candidate.

He reportedly told police he planned to grab the microphone and yell that Trump is a racist but didn't intend to hurt anyone.

DiMassimo, of Fairborn, was released on bail.

As soon as he left the police station he tweeted '@realDonaldTrump I spit in my hand before I shook yours at the beginning of the rally'.

The Dayton Daily News reports that it has obtained a police report that says Dimassimo told officers that he'd given his car keys to his girlfriend at Saturday's rally anticipating that he'd be arrested.

Dimassimo has a history of demonstrating, previously caused an uproar by standing on top of the American flag and is accused of burning the Confederate flag last year.

Dimassimo, who is a former child actor, was quickly swarmed by security officers and Secret Service at the Dayton International Airport, but not before startling the billionaire businessman who stopped his speech.

'I was ready for him, but it's much easier if the cops do it, don't we agree?' Trump said.

Before attending the rally, Dimassimo, who goes by @Younglionking7 on Twitter, wrote about his plans to disrupt the event.

Since being released from jail earlier on Saturday, Dimassimo has retweeted several videos that captured the moment he rushed the stage at Trump's event. He also uploaded a photo of himself with three women and wrote: 'F*** you b**** @realdonaldtrump'

'Currently in line for the rally. Currently never been more scared in my life,' he wrote Saturday on Twitter at 3.23am.

'If I can get good thoughts and prayers from my TL (time line) it would be much appreciated,' Dimassimo wrote Saturday at 7.37am.

'I'm at this you know what rally bout to you know what.'

On Friday the Wright State University acting major tweeted: 'I've had about all I can take from the violent trump ralliers (sic) Saturday im (sic) going to check my people and spit on their false king,' appearing to refer to Trump.

He also retweeted a story link about a Trump event in St Louis that turned violent and wrote: 'Donal (sic) will answer for this and more tomorrow'.

It appears as though Dimassimo is an avid supporter of Vermont Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on social media, as well as being active with the Black Lives Matter movement.

According to the Dayton Daily News, Dimassimo helped lead an anti-racism protest in April 2015 while he was a junior at Wright State University.

The protest included students standing on American flags and holding signs saying, 'Not my flag.'

'I thought it would ruffle some feathers, but I did not anticipate how tense the backlash would become,' Dimassimo told the Dayton Daily news at the time.

'If anything, all that has shown is that people in this area and people on the Internet care more about a symbolic piece of cloth, than they do a black person's life … or, even beyond that, our Constitutional rights.'

While at the protest, Dimassimo, who is originally from Powder Springs, Georgia, was recorded on camera dragging the American flag, before he put it on the ground to stand on top of it.

The video from that protest appears to have been used in a hoax ISIS video, which was uploaded to YouTube.

It's unclear if the video was in fact created by ISIS or if Dimassimo actually is a supporter of the terrorist organization.

But Trump accused him of being affiliated with the group on Twitter after several of his supporters shared it on social media.

The GOP front-runner uploaded the video to his Twitter account and wrote: 'USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! ?ssr=true'.

Last summer, Dimassimo participated in a counter-protest during a Confederate flag rally at Stone Mountain in Georgia alongside Black Lives Matter activists.

During this protest, it was reported that he stomped on a Confederate flag and tore it up in front of flag supporters in addition to burning it.

'To all my white friends observing my actions, and responding with love and support I thank you,' he wrote on Facebook after the rally.

'But I feel you may be missing something essential. The POC who stood with me are the true heroes.

'As a white man I can choose to insert myself into danger when I feel the need to.That's privilege.

'The black women who stood with me are face that same danger when they drive down the street. ‪… I'm here to use my privilege to increase visibility for these type of issues.

'That doesn't make me a hero. It makes me a decent human being.'

Since being released from jail earlier on Saturday, Dimassimo has retweeted several videos that captured the moment he rushed the stage at Trump's event.

He also uploaded a photo of himself with three women and wrote: 'F*** you b**** @realdonaldtrump'.

Dimassimo is currently a fourth-year acting major at Wright State University and has played several small roles as a child actor. Above he is pictured from a scene on 'Reno 911!' in 2004

In response to a Twitter user who said that he would 'go to hell' for his actions earlier, Dimassimo wrote: 'What will come will come and God will guide me'.

Another Twitter user who accused him of trying to kill Trump with a knife, Dimassimo wrote: 'Go watch the video you can see both of my hands grab the stage try again. There were metal detectors smh.'

Dimassimo is a fourth-year acting major at Wright State and has played several small roles on the TV shows 'Yes, Dear', 'Reno 911!', and 'House of Payne' as a child actor.

Tom Dimassimo, his father, is a teacher, while his mother, Faye, is a public official and was appointed last November to oversee the 'Renew Atlanta' infrastructure project.

Ohio was Donald's first official address since Friday night's Chicago rally, which went into a melt down after bloody brawls and loud demonstrations broke out amid racial tensions.

Trump went on to defend his 'nice' supporters and blamed Obama for 'dividing the country'.

The billionaire businessman denounced Obama's leadership for 'dividing America', despite the obvious division seen between the 10,000 protesters and Trump supporters seen in Chicago on Friday night.

He referred to a border that is like a piece of 'Swiss cheese' as one of the factors that has 'divided the country, black versus white, income groups and congress'.

He then pointed to the back of the room: 'And if there's a group over there, let's just throw them out', amid cheers from the crowd. Several people were escorted out during Trump's address.

Secret Service rushed the stage to protect Trump. Speaking in Ohio he addressed his rivals, who were quick to denounce Friday's scenes as a result of the 'toxic environment' that he has created

Trump also addressed his rivals, who were quick to denounce Friday's scenes as a result of the 'toxic environment' that he has created.

He said: 'I watched little Marco and Liar Ted... They said: 'At our rallies we would never have anything like that'

But they don't have any people at their rallies ! No one cares! Their rallies are called Town hall meetings because about four people show up.'

The Chicago Police Department said late Saturday night in a statement that four people were charged in the city. The charges range from aggravated battery to resisting arrest.

While Trump was in Kansas City, Missouri Saturday evening, people outside of the venue were pepper sprayed twice by police who also arrested two people.

Trump's remarks were interrupted about a dozen times by protesters who managed to get into the theater, and they were escorted out.

The billionaire businessman urged police to arrest protesters, stating that he would start pressing charges against those individuals who interrupted his speeches.
