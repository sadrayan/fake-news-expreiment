Beto openly answered this question about his arrest during the first Senate debate and stands by what he said Friday night in Dallas.

His arrest is something he has long addressed. Additionally, I'm including what he said to the Houston Chronicle when they recently reported on the full police report:

"I drove drunk and was arrested for a DWI in 1998. As I've publicly discussed over the last 20 years, I made a serious mistake for which there is no excuse."

The police report shows he was arrested for a DWI, not for leaving or attempting to leave the scene.

Thanks,

Chris
