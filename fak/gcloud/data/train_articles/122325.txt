South Africa Income Dynamics
NIDS is a panel study that has been following the lives of the same 28 000 South Africans and those they live with since 2008. An initiative of the Department of Monitoring, Planning and Evaluation in the South African government, the study is implemented by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit based at the University of Cape Town's School of Economics. Approximately every two years, highly trained fieldworkers attempt to re-interview the same people to find out what – if anything – has changed for them since they were last interviewed.
