Majority of Democrats want Obama for a third term
After everything that the POS has done, a strong majority of Democrats are so happy with him that they want Obama for a third term as president — something that, fortunately, is barred by the U.S. Constitution.

Jonathan Easley reports for The Hill, Jun 30, 2016, that according to data from the conservative polling outlet WPA Research, 67% of Democrats would rather have a third term of Obama as presidency, instead of a potential Hillary Clinton administration. Only 28% said they’re ready to move on from the Obama White House, while 6% are undecided.

The WPA survey of 384 registered Democrats was conducted between June 22 and 27 and has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.

Another poll — a Washington Post-ABC News survey released this week — similarly found that Obama is very popular among Democrats, with a net approval rating approaching 80%. To compare, Bill Clinton was at about 60% positive within his own party at this point in 2000, while George W. Bush was under 40% with Republicans.

Hillary’s approval rating among Democrats is falling. A Gallup survey from April found that her net approval rating among Democrats fell from 63% last November to 36% in April. A memo from WPA said: “The results should give pause to the Hillary Clinton campaign as Democratic respondents clearly prefer the status quo to a Clinton presidency.”

But there is some good news for Hillary. The same Washington Post survey also found that, despite many vowing that they would never support Hillary, Bernie Sanders supporters are moving quickly behind Clinton over Trump.

There really are two Americas.

One America is populated by creatures called Democrats that Conservatives cannot even begin to comprehend.

The two Americas are irreconcilable.
