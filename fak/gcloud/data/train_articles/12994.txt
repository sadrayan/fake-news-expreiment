AFP-FL state director Chris Hudson explains, “Patrick Murphy is more concerned with standing behind President Obama’s job-killing, rate-hiking energy mandates than acknowledging the tough realities Florida families are facing every day trying to make ends meet. Murphy’s ‘pay-more’ energy agenda could cost Florida thousands of energy jobs and force hardworking families to pay another $500 per year on their utilities.”

AFP-FL volunteers are out in force across neighborhoods and over the phone to educate Floridians about Murphy’s “pay-more” agenda. To date, AFP-FL has made over 610,000 contacts to show Florida families how Murphy’s agenda will increase their cost of living.
