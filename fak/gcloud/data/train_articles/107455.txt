Andrew Lincoln Explains How He Got The Part On The Walking Dead
Andrew Lincoln wasn't your typical household name or face prior to transforming himself into The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes.

The actor has appeared in a few major productions, so his auditioning skills were certainly there, but when it comes to landing the leading role in the zombie apocalypse, Lincoln sailed into the perfect storm.

“I hadn’t slept for three days, and I was shell shocked," Lincoln says. "I had this apocalyptic chic that probably fitted the bill. I looked like I’d survived a zombie apocalypse.”

In addition, Lincoln also fit the mold of off-screen actor the at-the-time showrunner Frank Darabont was looking for.

"Frank wanted the Gary Cooper of High Noon, a classical leading man, very moral, almost gentle and quiet," Lincoln says. "But he also wanted a family man, so the perfect storm of meeting someone who had just had his second child was really appealing to him.”

It's hard to imagine anyone else playing the role of Rick Grimes at this point. Ethan Embry, who played the one-episode role of Carter in the season six premiere, says he auditioned for another role years ago. While he wouldn't reveal which it was, I can only assume it was Rick. Imagine if the roles were swapped?

The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 PM ET on AMC.
