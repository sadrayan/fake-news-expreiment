Heck Votes to Ensure Back Pay for Federal Workers
WASHINGTON - Congressman Joe Heck (NV-03) today released the following statement after voting in favor of H.R. 3223 which would ensure back pay for furloughed federal workers.



"Our hard-working civil servants did not ask for this partial shutdown," Rep. Heck said. "No one would wish the difficulties they are facing during this uncertain time upon anyone, especially not on those men and women who serve our country as federal employees. This bill will allow furloughed workers to receive their back pay once a compromise can be reached on our spending and debt issues and they return to work. I remain committed to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to resolve this matter and end the current impasse."
