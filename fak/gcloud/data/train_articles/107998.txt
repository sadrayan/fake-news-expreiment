Text messages converted to picture messages
Many smartphones today allow you to bring your messages to life with pictures, animations and many more features. When you send messages containing such features to other phones, they are sent as picture messages (or MMS).



iPhone and Samsung are devices that will convert text messages to picture messages.



Picture messages are not included in your standard tariff plan but if you send a lot of these types of messages you may want to buy add-ons which give you an allowance every month to send picture messages at reduced rates. If you don’t have an allowance, every time you send a picture message you will be charged a fixed fee for each message you send to each recipient and these charges will appear on your bill in the picture messages section.

More information on the charges for picture messages can be found within our pay as you go and pay monthly price guides.

Some phones also automatically convert some text messages, especially emojis, to picture messages. So if you’ve been charged for sending a picture message when you didn't intend to send one, this might be because your device has automatically converted a text message (SMS) to a multi-media message (MMS).

When do devices convert text messages to picture messages?

This can happen when:

you’re using iPhone Messages and sending features and effects to a non-iPhone user, or when iMessage is unavailable

your text includes a non-standard smiley or symbol such as an emoticon, emoji, or iPhone X's Animojis

your text is sent to an email address instead of to a phone number

you're sending a group text message



your text exceeds the character limit (on some phones this is 160 characters, on others it can be higher)

your message has a subject line

Sending an MMS instead of an SMS is down to the phone you’re using, the messaging platform, and the person you’re sending to. It is not because of the EE network.
