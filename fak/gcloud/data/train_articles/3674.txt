Robert Warren served as a demographer for 34 years with the United States Census Bureau and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Mr. Warren served as Director of the INS’s Statistics Division from 1986 to 1995. One of his accomplishments at INS was to project accurate ranges of the number of unauthorized immigrants that would apply in each state under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). During his service, he also worked for three years with the staff of the Panel on Immigration Statistics of the National Academy of Sciences, which published the report, “Immigration Statistics: A Story of Neglect” co-edited with Daniel B. Levine and Kenneth Hill (National Academy Press, 1985). Mr. Warren retired from INS in January 2002.

Mr. Warren released “Unauthorized Immigration to the United States: Annual Estimates and Components of Change, by State, 1990 to 2010,” with John Robert Warren in the International Migration Review, Vol. 47, No. 2, Summer 2013. His other signature publications include: “Annual Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States, by State: 1990 to 2000,” (Department of Homeland Security, 2003); “Estimates of the Undocumented Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: October 1996,” (INS, 1997); “Determinants of Unauthorized Migration to the United States,” with Linda S. Peterson (Center for International Research (CIR), US Bureau of the Census, 1990); and “A Count of the Uncountable: Estimates of Undocumented Aliens Counted in the 1980 United States Census,” with Jeffrey S.
