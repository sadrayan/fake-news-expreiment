Here is the source of the information:

One study, conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky’s College of Medicine, found that the incidence of complications from vasectomies can be as high as 15 percent, and those complications can include infection or hemorrhaging.

The incidence of complications from abortion is fewer than 1 percent, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

Thank you,

Andrea
