Crouzon Syndrome

Present at birth, Crouzon syndrome results from an early closing (fusion) of several of the skull’s sutures—always including the side (coronal) sutures. Closely related to Apert syndrome, Crouzon patients do not share all the physical anomalies associated with Apert syndrome. Crouzon syndrome occurs with a frequency of one in 60,000 live births.

Individuals with this syndrome are typically characterized by the following differences:

-wide head across the front

-short head from front-to-back

-flat-looking face due to underdeveloped cheekbones, eye sockets and lower jaw

-shallowly-placed, protruding eyes that may be crossed or wide-set

-small nose with an upwardly-tilted beak shape

-low-set ears, sometimes accompanied by hearing loss and narrow ear canals

Additional characteristics that may be present include:

-cleft palate

-dark, rough folds of skin in the armpits, groin, etc. (in 5-10 percent of cases)

Treatment may include surgical release of any fused skull sutures, mid-face advancement, eye surgery, staged orthodontics, and possibly palatal closure and speech therapy.

Initially called craniofacial dysostosis, Crouzon syndrome was named for French physician, Octave Crouzon (1874-1938), the first to describe it in 1912.
