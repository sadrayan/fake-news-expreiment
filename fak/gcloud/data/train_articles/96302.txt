Grothman: I'll be 'constructive conservative'
Video Transcript

TODAY ON "UPFRONT," THE U.S. IMMIGRATION SHOWDOWN -- THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS AT ODDS OVER EXECUTIVE ACTION. HOW SHOULD CONGRESS REACT? MY QUESTION TODAY FOR REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, GLENN REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, GLENN GROTHMAN. THEN, THE STATE LEGISLATURE WILL COME BACK MORE REPUBLICAN, AND MORE CONSERVATIVE, NEXT YEAR. TODAY, TWO RETIRING MODERATES ON WHETHER THEY SEE THE END OF AN ERA IN MADISON. [CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WISN-TV] COVERING THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO WISCONSIN. THIS IS "UPFRONT WITH MIKE GOUSHA." HELLO AGAIN, EVERYBODY, AND WELCOME TO "UPFRONT." IT'S BEEN 10 DAYS NOW AND REPUBLICANS REMAIN OUTRAGED OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER, SHIELDING AS MANY AS FIVE MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM DEPORTATION. REPUBLICANS HAVE THREATENED A LAWSUIT, AND THERE'S EVEN BEEN TALK OF ANOTHER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER VOWED LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO COUNTER THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN, BUT SO FAR, HAS NOT OFFERED DETAILS. REPUBLICANS SAY THEY PREFER A STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH TO IMMIGRATION REFORM. WISCONSIN REPUBLICAN SENATOR RON JOHNSON WAS ON THIS PROGRAM TWO WEEKS AGO AND HE PROMISED A STRONG BORDER SECURITY BILL AND GUEST WORKER PROGRAM. TODAY, WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD TO WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITH IMMIGRATION REFORM IN THE NEW, MORE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS. WE'RE JOINED BY CONGRESSMAN-ELECT GLENN GROTHMAN, THE REPUBLICAN FROM CAMPELLSPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. GLAD TO BE ON THE SHOW. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR TRIP INTO WASHINGTON BEFORE WE GET INTO IMMIGRATION. HOW'D YOU SEE THE ROLE? YOU HAVE HEARD THE MEDIA REPORTS, YOU WILL BE A BOMB THROWER, A PROBLEM FOR JOHN BOEHNER. THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. LOOK AT THE PAST. WHEN I WAS IN MADISON, I WAS THE ASSISTANT SENATE MAJORITY LEADER . IRAQ CONFLICT A LOT IN A LOT OF FIELDS. I WAS VERY BIG ON -- I'LL COP PUSHED A LOT IN A LOT OF FIELDS. I WAS BIG ON BUSINESS STUFF. TOWARD REFORM. I EXPECT TO DO THE SAME THING IN WASHINGTON, HELPED MY COLLEAGUES AND THEIR ELECTIONS IN THE FUTURE. THAT IS ONE WAY TO GET TO KNOW MORE PEOPLE. ALREADY I SPENT TIME WITH THE 40 OR 45 OTHER REPUBLICAN FRESHMAN, GETTING THEM -- GETTING TO KNOW THEM AND BE EFFECTIVE THAT WAY. I AM ONE OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNMENT SPENDING, CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO WELFARE, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND NOT SOMEONE WHO VOTES NO FOR THE THRILL OF VOTING NO. I EXPECT TO GET A LOT DONE. WHAT ABOUT COMPROMISE? SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO HOLD, SOMETIMES HALF A HOLD. THERE WERE THINGS I AM PROUD OF, AND SOMETIMES YOU ONLY GET HALF OF WHAT YOU CAN GET. YOU TAKE WHAT YOU CAN GET. THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER AND REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IS NOT HAPPY. WHAT YOU DIG REPUBLICANS SHOULD DO -- SEVERAL OPTIONS, WOULD YOU THINK THE CONGRESS SHOULD BE DOING? WE DO NOT HAVE A GOOD JOB BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT HAD -- AND FORCED THE BORDER FOR A LONG TIME. BARACK OBAMA HAS NOT BEEN A GOOD JOB AND FRANKLY GEORGE BUSH DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB BEFORE THAT. YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING LEGALLY TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY FROM MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES AND MEANWHILE WE LET PEOPLE IN THAT ARE CIRCUMVENTING THE LAW. FIRST YOU HAVE TO SECURE THE BORDER. I WOULD NOT TRUST ANY PRESIDENT UNTIL THEY SECURE THE BORDER AND THAT IS SOMETHING BARACK OBAMA COULD DO TODAY. IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE IMMIGRATION LAWS MEAN ANYTHING, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE DONE. I HOPE IT PUBLIC AND DO SOMETHING WITH FUNDING LAWS RIGHT AWAY TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT BARACK OBAMA WANTS TO SECURE THE BORDER. RIGHT NOW, WHILE MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING HERE ARE COMING OR FOR THE RIGHT REASONS TO WORK HARD, SOME ARE COMING FOR THE WRONG REASONS. THE NEXT THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE WELFARE BENEFITS, AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS BEING ENFORCED, THAT PEOPLE COMING HERE ILLEGALLY ARE NOT GETTING THOSE BENEFITS. WE KNOW RIGHT NOW SOMETIMES THOSE RULES ARE NOT BEING ENFORCED, AND PEOPLE ARE COMING FOR THE WRONG REASONS, AND PEOPLE SOUTH OF THE BORDER ARE BEING MADE AWARE OF THE GENEROUS BENEFITS. ONCE THOSE THINGS ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF, WE CAN LOOK AT THE PEOPLE HERE TODAY. FOR NOW, SHOULD REPUBLICANS SUE, CONSIDER WITHHOLDING FUNDS, SHUTTING DOWN GOVERNMENT QUESTION MARK WHAT SHOULD THEY DO? ABSOLUTELY -- GOVERNMENT? WHAT SHOULD THEY DO NOT? ABSOLUTE, THEY SHOULD SUE IF THEY HAVE TO. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S OWN APPOINTEES HAVE STRUCK DOWN ACTIONS. THE PRESIDENT HAS SHOWN HE IS NOT CONSTRAINED BY THE CONSTITUTION, DOING THINGS IN THE ATTITUDE OF I WILL WAIT TO LET THE SUPREME COURT TOMMY. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT A SHUTDOWN OF THE GOVERNMENT OR DOING WHAT TED CRUZ HAS SUGGESTED, NOT VOTING ON CERTAIN NOMINEES IN AN EFFORT TO GET THE PRESIDENT'S ATTENTION. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WE HAVE TO PLAY HARDBALL. I AM NOT SURE I LIKE THE IDEA OF SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET BILLS, THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A SHOWDOWN ON IMMIGRATION AND OTHER ISSUES AS WELL WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAUSE I ASSUME HE WILL WANT TO SPEND A LOT MORE ON A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE. WE ARE BORROWING 20% OF OUR BUDGET. THAT SHOWS THERE WILL BE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND US ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING. YOU MENTION REFORM AS ONE OF YOUR PRIORITIES. WHAT CAN YOU HOPE TO DO AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO ADDRESS THAT? FIRST YOU HAVE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE, AND ALREADY I STARTED THAT PROCESS WHEN I WAS UP THERE THE PAST WEEK. YOUR VIEWERS ARE AWARE A SINGLE PARENT WITH A COUPLE OF KIDS COULD EASILY GET $35,000 A YEAR IN TOTAL BENEFITS BETWEEN HEALTH CARE, THE EARNED INCOME CREDIT, THE FOOD CHAIR, LOW INCOME HOUSING, AND WHAT HAVE YOU. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT -- HOW MANY PEOPLE MAKE $35,000 A YEAR AFTER TAXES? MOST PEOPLE DO NOT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT MONEY, WHICH IS AN ESSENCE OF BRIDE NOT TO WORK THAT HARD OR MARRY SOMEONE WITH A FULL-TIME JOB, PEOPLE REALIZE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE GENEROSITY OF THE BENEFITS. BRIDE IS A STRONG WORD -- BRIBE IS A STRONG WORD, DON'T YOU THINK? IF YOU TELL SOMEONE YOU WILL GET $35,000 IF YOU DO NOT GET MARRIED AND YOU WILL NOT GET ANYTHING IF YOU MARRY SOMEONE MAKING $50,000 A YEAR, IT IS A STRONG INCENTIVE NOT TO RAISE CHILDREN IN WEDLOCK. YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE A DENT? ABSOLUTELY. THEY BE ONLY A LITTLE BIT WITH BARACK OBAMA, BUT IF WE GET A BETTER PRESIDENT, WE WILL MAKE A BIG CHANGE. YOU WILL BE STEPPING DOWN FROM THE LEGISLATURE SOON. YOU MENTIONED YOUR RECORD IN THE LEGISLATURE. YOU WERE A POWERBROKER OF SORTS. WHAT KIND OF TRANSITION WILL THAT BE FOR YOU, FOR SOMEBODY IN MEDICINE WHO, NOW, WITH A CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING THEY WANTED TO DO IN TERMS OF POLICY. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO CONGRESS WHERE YOU ARE MORE -- ONE OF MORE THAN 400. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT? I PUT MYSELF BACK TO WHERE I WAS IN 1993 WHEN I GOT TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY. I DID NOT KNOW THOSE PEOPLE AT ALL. I KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS LIKE, HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO NETWORK, IMPORTANT TO USE THE MEDIA TO GET MY SIDE OF THE STORY OUT AND PUT PRESSURE ON OTHER PEOPLE. IT IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I THINK I PASSED OVER 30 BILLS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND IN CONGRESS A COULD BE THERE FOR 200 YEARS AND NOT PAST 30 BILLS. I DO EXPECT TO HAVE AN INFLUENCE , AND WE CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN WITH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND THAT IS WHY I'M THERE, BUT IT WILL BE AN ADJUSTMENT. SENATOR GLENN GROTHMAN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE PROGRAM. SENATOR GROTHMAN IS GIVING UP HIS STATE SENATE SEAT FOR CONGRESS. IT'S PART OF THE TURNOVER AT THE STATEHOUSE. IS IT IN SOME WAYS ALSO THE END OF AN ERA? WE'LL LOOK AT THE CHANGING TIMES WITH TWO RETIRING STATE SENATORS, PART OF A VANISHING BREED OF MODERATES, WHEN "UPFRONT" CONTINUES.
