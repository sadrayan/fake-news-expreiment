Flyride™
The Zapata Flyride™ is designed to make hydroflight accessible for beginners and offer new thrills for extreme riders. It achieves this by combining the familiar form and controls of a personal watercraft with Zapata’s latest advancements in computer aided flight control and gyro stabilization - the same technology developed for Zapata’s groundbreaking Flyboard Air™ and EZ-Fly™ jet powered craft.

Flyride™ is the flying personal watercraft featuring the all new EZ-Flight Control System™. It represents a unique convergence of recreation, extreme water sports and Zapata’s exclusive hydroflight control technology. This makes Flyride™ the first hydroflyer to integrate the ease and power of electronic stabilization. From easy to extreme, Flyride™ brings the thrill of flight to everyone.
