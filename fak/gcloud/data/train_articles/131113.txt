Antifa group in NYC posting fliers calling white children to be killeâ€¦
It's funny! This has got to be some serious dank trolling. It basically takes Pantifa's premise and expands it out to it's natural conclusion. It's jumping to the end game, where Pantifa has SO DEHUMANIZED people with opposing viewpoints that it has led them to the "final solution". I think it's brilliant.

I used to argue that we should skip to the end of affirmative action presidents. First a black guy. Next a woman. Why waste the time? Why not skip all those years and go for the FIRST DOWNS SYNDROME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! Most of the time our Downs Syndrome president would be such a delight! Popular on all the talk shows! The MSM would never dare question him. And other nations would be scared to DEATH he'd have a bad day and push all the red buttons while shouting, "THIS IS WHAT YOU GET!" Win win win
