Charter-school bill deserves action
Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, who is scouting a run for state auditor or attorney general in two years, has a chance to demonstrate an affinity for defending Ohioans against misspending and fraud by advancing a charter-school accountability bill.

Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, who is scouting a run for state auditor or attorney general in two years, has a chance to demonstrate an affinity for defending Ohioans against misspending and fraud by advancing a charter-school accountability bill.

As it stands, it appears that Faber�s Senate is playing games with Senate Bill 298, a measure to ensure that charter schools are actually educating students. This crucial reform legislation was oddly assigned to the Senate Finance Committee rather than being sent to the Education Committee, where Sen. Peggy Lehner, R-Kettering, had made it clear that she�d fast-track the bill.

Senate Minority Leader Joe Schiavoni, D-Boardman, reasonably suspects his bill is being slotted for inaction. The Finance Committee typically deals with state spending � which S.B. 298 does not.

Schiavoni�s bill deserves to be promptly heard by a committee, revised as necessary and sent to the Senate floor for a vote. It aims to make certain that 39,000 students attending Ohio�s online schools are getting an education in exchange for $275 million in taxpayer subsidies. It is natural to question these payments after a state audit found several e-schools couldn�t document that kids were doing even minimal schoolwork.

S.B. 298 includes provisions such as requiring online schools to keep accurate records that show students are participating in coursework and report that data monthly to the state.

A skeptic might think that Faber is trying to block Schiavioni, an up-and-coming Democrat, from achieving an important reform. This is the second time in six months, Schiavoni said, that one of his bills has been placed in the Finance Committee after Lehner agreed to hold hearings; the earlier bill, to help Youngstown�s troubled school district, has yet to have a hearing.

Faber explained the Finance Committee assignment by saying, �One of the big issues in school funding is how you count kids,� he said.

Yes, that is a big issue, especially for well-heeled GOP donors who own charter schools and who have an interest in stalling reforms. The charters are pushing the state to count only the number of hours offered students � and not those that students actually participate in. Sorry, but good intentions don�t count. Taxpayers expect results.

Faber promises the e-school attendance bill will get some hearings. Faber has an ideal opportunity here to show integrity in protecting children and taxpayers. Lehner, a leader in educational accountability, already has.
