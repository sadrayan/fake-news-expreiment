Advocates defend law that guarantees most immigrant children a hearing
A bipartisan bill proposed last week would strip away the added protections for children arriving from non-contiguous countries, requiring Border Patrol agents to quickly assess the merits in every child's case and make a determination as to whether they should be sent home or given the chance to appear in court. Any resulting immigration proceedings would be accelerated under the bill, with judges required to make a final decision in the children's cases within seven days, much faster than is typical.
