This directory contains estimates of nonfarm wage and salary employment data by major industry classification for New Jersey labor areas for the current year and prior years. These estimates are produced by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Comparable labor force data for the United States can be obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Beginning with the release of 2003 data, the program switched from the Standard Industrial Classification System (SIC) to the 2002 version of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as the basis for the assignment and tabulation of economic data by industry. Please see technical note for further details.
