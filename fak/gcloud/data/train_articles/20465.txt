America’s Most and Least Popular Senators — October 2018
The nation’s most vulnerable senators made up little ground in their approval during the third quarter, a sign that multi-million-dollar efforts by Republicans in their states to maintain control in Senate next month’s midterm elections may be taking a toll.

According to the latest edition of Morning Consult’s Senator Approval Rankings, based on 359,057 surveys with registered voters conducted July 1 through Sept. 25 nationwide, Bill Nelson – the incumbent Florida Democrat who’s running neck-and-neck with Gov. Rick Scott (R) – saw the steepest decline in net approval of any senator, dropping 12 percentage points since the second quarter. (See the methodology here.)

It’s the first quarter that Nelson, with 39 percent of Floridians approving of his job performance and 41 percent disapproving, finds himself underwater with voters since Morning Consult began tracking the job performance of senators in 2015. It’s also the first time that Nelson is less popular among Sunshine State voters than President Donald Trump, who narrowly won Florida in 2016 and posted an even net approval rating during the third quarter.
