As you could imagine my jaw dropped when I open the box and seen the thin headband. The product was package very well, with a futuristic type of feel. I have to admit I didn't even think these things was going to take a charge, let alone work.

I was blown away by the sound these headsets throughout. True to their claim the headset is very lite, almost too lite.

So here are the things I love about the headset. One they talked to you doing pairing mode. Sometimes pairing a new device can be frightening, and it was nice to have a soft voice on the other end guiding you through LOL.
