Jurors late Wednesday afternoon convicted Patricio Medina, 27, on one count of aggravated sexual assault of a child younger than 6, two counts of injury to a child and two counts of endangering a child.

Thursday they decided on an 80-year sentence and $10,000 fine on the aggravated sexual assault of a child count, two 80-year-sentences and $10,000 fines on the injury to a child counts and two 4-year sentences on the child endangerment count.

He must serve the full 80 years of the sentence for aggravated sexual assault of a child.

The charges stem from the March 2014 sexual assault of the infant, who suffered 45 broken bones and other injuries, which a doctor discovered during the girl’s five-week checkup.

A jailhouse informant testified that Medina admitted that he sexually assaulted the baby while high on methamphetamine.

The baby’s mother, Lisa Montoya, also testified.

She pleaded guilty earlier to two counts of endangering a child.

Medina, who was first indicted in November 2015 and then was re-indicted in March, has been held in the McLennan County Jail since April 2017 in lieu of $225,000 bond.

An unrelated family adopted the victim and her two siblings, prosecutor Gabrielle Massey said.

The girl is now 4 and is doing well, she said.
