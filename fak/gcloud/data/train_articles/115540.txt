BVD Men's Collection







"Next to myself, I like BVD best"





BVD, founded in 1876 by three gentlemen, Messrs. Bradley, Voorhees and Day, is one of the most famous and historically innovative brands in America.



Today, the legendary quality of BVD continues with contemporary offerings for both men and boys. Comfortably fashioned from fine combed cotton and cotton-rich fabrics with a lustrous hand, you'll appreciate the supremely soft feel next to your skin.



The BVD collection includes briefs, woven boxers, boxer briefs, T-Shirts, V-Necks, and A-Shirts. You'll discover BVD's "legendary quality since 1876" sewn into every garment-like soft, plush-backed waistbands on our briefs and boxers, generous body dimensions on our T-Shirts for a comfortable fit, and durable stitching that holds up to repeated laundering.



You'll find the BVD men's and boys' collection at JCPenney stores; or, please visit www.jcpenney.com.
