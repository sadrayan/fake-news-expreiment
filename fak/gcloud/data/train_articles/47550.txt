U.S. Reimposes Sanctions on Iran but Undercuts the Pain With Waivers
“Whatever happened to maximum pressure?” United Against Nuclear Iran, an anti-Iran group led by former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, wrote on Twitter in response to the administration’s waivers. “They caved. Big time.”

The sanctions — and dearth of exemptions for European allies — threaten to dangerously deteriorate already-strained trans-Atlantic ties. Most big European companies have left Iran in recent months ahead of the looming penalties, but European diplomats vowed on Friday to continue efforts to protect legitimate trade with Tehran.

“Our collective resolve to complete this work is unwavering,” diplomats from the European Union, Britain, France and Germany said in a statement.

Iran remains a part of the nuclear accord, which it brokered in 2015 along with the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. International inspectors have concluded that Tehran is complying with the agreement by not developing nuclear weapons, and European officials have said that the deal is crucial to their national security.

R. Nicholas Burns, a top diplomat in the administration of President George W. Bush, said imposing sanctions on countries for remaining part of an accord that the United States helped negotiate would be a huge mistake.

“We still need these countries on other vital issues, like containing North Korea and Russia,” Mr. Burns said.

Many initially lifted as part of the nuclear deal, the sanctions will target more than 700 businesses, individuals and other entities involved in Iran’s oil, banking, shipping, shipbuilding and insurance sectors. They go into effect on Monday and were jointly announced on Friday by Mr. Pompeo and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.
