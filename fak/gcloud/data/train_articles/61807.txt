Ep 2: Pattern & Practice
The fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald aggravated longstanding tensions between Chicago police and the cityâ€™s black residents. We look at how a troubled police department spun a narrative of the shooting, how that narrative fell apart, and how the city reacted when it did.



This is the second episode of 16 Shots, a podcast from WBEZ Chicago and the Chicago Tribune about the fatal police shooting of Laquan McDonald, the trial of Officer Jason Van Dyke, and the troubled relationship between African-Americans and the Chicago Police Department.
