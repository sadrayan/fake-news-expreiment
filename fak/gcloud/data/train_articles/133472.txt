America will never be destroyed from the outside, but the outside can be destroyed by America or with America. Why so? America will never be destroyed from the outside, but the outside can be destroyed by America or with America. Why so?

Humanity can destroy the Earth we live on if we are not careful.

Mr. Lincoln simply stated a truism that applies to every country on earth.



In my opinion, the United States is destroying itself through the continual decline of good character in the general population.

They're just following on the footsteps of every empire that ever existed (and then fell into decline).

But worry not, others had the same fate and their people is still around and enjoying life as it is...

It practical terms, he may be right. Conquering America by force would be difficult: friends to the north and south; flanked by the Pacific and Atlantic oceans; Rocky Mountains form a rampart to the west; Appalachians form a rampart to the east; self-sufficiency with respect to raw materials, food, and energy; 25% of the world surface fresh water supply; et cetera.



And, an annual defense budget of over USD $682,000,000,000 is nothing to sniff at. (That's more than the next 11 nations combined: China, Russa, UK, Japan, France, Saudi Arabia, India, Germany, Italy, Brazil, and South Korea.)



All that said, no one can predict the future. Our best defense is world peace, freedom, and global democracy.

Believe it or not, even in those places (some) people enjoy life anyway.

It may be hard over there, but it doesn't seem easy to me to be a homeless person (or a Mayor) in say, Toronto for example.

The fate of your country (empire or not) doesn't necessarily has to affect your way of enjoying life, is all I was trying to say.

Of course when Lincoln gave his speech, we were in a civil war but it is true today because of what Chevegas alluded. Nations, states, counties and cities place Public Safety police, fire, military, courts, etc. as a most revered societal need and possibly profession. What they fail to recognize is that public safety, for the most part, does not contribute to the gross domestic product positively. These professions, although needed at some level, contribute negatively on the GDP. Citizens fail to understand, that we must spend "just" enough on Public Safety and not a penny more. It is a two-way sword, too many expenditures on public safety and you collapse an economy, to little and you have chaos.



The need for Security is second on Maslow's hierarchy of needs and so as humans we see it as critical for life. And, of course there are social benefit beyond simple security, pride, technological advances, the kid that was "turned around" because they joined the military, etc. However, in America, we spend two times what is necessary for "just enough" public safety--on fire stations, military, police and our justice system. In the end, will this cause our downfall from within, or will we see the light before it is too late?

( I wonder why the US deficit/debt is so high and there are many problems, not just economical ones.)

32,223: Troops injured (not including PTSD).

2.8 million: Persons who remain either internally displaced or have fled the country.



$1.7 trillion: Amount in war expenses spent by the U.S. Treasury Department as through Fiscal Year 2013.



$5,000: Amount spent per second.



$350,000: Cost to deploy one American military member.



$490 billion: Amount in war benefits owed to war veterans.



$7 trillion: Projected interest payments due by 2053 (because the war was paid for with borrowed money).



$20 billion: Amount paid to KBR, contractor responsible for equipment and services.



$3 billion: Amount of KBR payments Pentagon auditors considered "questionable."



$60 billion: Amount paid for reconstruction, (which was ruled largely a waste due to corruption and shoddy work.)



$4 billion: Amount owed to the U.S. by Iraq before the invasion.



1.6 million: Gallons of oil used by U.S. forces each day in Iraq (at $127.68 a barrel).

0: Nuclear Weapons of Mass Destruction found (though a bunch of chems were discovered).



Perhaps most importantly, this list doesn't account for the emotional damage caused to service members and their families as well as the destruction to the homes, social fabric, and psyche of the Iraqi people.

Lincoln was half right. Given the 150 or so years since Lincoln’s claim was made, we can improve upon his words. My quick effort to do so yields the following:



America will never be destroyed solely from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be, at least in part, because traitors within our Republic aligned with and agenda to destroy the freedoms of the common person while enshrining a class of “elites” as above the law.

Edited Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865)



A private, international banking cartel used government force to secure control of the nation’s public monetary system and they’ve used it for personal gain ever since.



The mega front corporations they control are Too Big To Fail, but the average citizen’s private business are allowed, if not forced, to fail and are being rolled up under control of the Too Big To Fail & Jail mega corporations.



WHO controls the monetary system? They don’t teach that in school, do they – BUT WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT TO A NATION STATE?



The structure flow for America is as follows:



The Federal Reserve -> Controlled by consortium of mega banks -> Controlled by -> Majority OWNERS of mega banks -> OWNERS MOSTLY FOREIGNERS to America.



Chew on that for a while.



A debt based monetary system is, by definition, a Sun Szu, Art of War Weapon of Mass Impoverishment (in the end, the bubble times are really good on the front end, but temporary… the eventual asset seizure is permanent… juxtapose the Roaring 20s (blow debt bubble) and the Great Depression (pop debt bubble)).



Read Sun Tzu – war is all about deception and the BEST WARRIORS never even have to fight because they’ve duped their prey.



However, this is not just a foreign take over. Plenty of Americans, chasing that Almighty [privately owned debt based] dollar have signed on as well. They’ve sold out America to be on the “winning team” of the Republic eviscerating Debt Money Tyrants.



Machiavelli said the authoritarian had to rule a populace used to being free with people from within their own population. You have read The Prince, right?



Watch They Live to see this concept in action. The movie is cheesy, but it also reveals very real methods employed by the International Banking Cartel to rule over Western Societies.



Also, watch the original 1970s version of Rollerball… The movie isn’t really about Rollerball **if you are awake** and not stuck in a programmed establishment trance.



A reread of Animal Farm (Eric Blair, aka, George Orwell) is in order as well. It is, in large part, a revelation of the method used by the Bankster financed social engineers to control the masses of humanity for personal gain.



Propaganda, a book by the father of “public relations,” is another must read **if** you want to know how the world really works.



https://archive.org/details/Porpaganda



“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.”

― Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda

In conclusion, America has been captured by foreign international monetary / banking interests who have hired traitorous Americans to act as their rhetoricians to deceive the general population.



John Taylor Gatto, former New York State Teacher of the Year, probably put it best when he said, “[t]here was a Second American Revolution fought in [the late 1800s]. It was not won through force of arms, but through force of insight into how to generate public opinion.”



PS – Again and again and again, AMERICA IS **NOT** A DEMOCRACY. We are a REPUBLIC. There is a reason different words are used... the concepts are DIFFERENT. One is right, one is wrong and "democracy" is wrong.* A Republic has base laws that the 51% CAN’T JUST VOTE AWAY. The Debt Money Tyrants who dream of oppressing you and yours don’t like those base laws, so they program you into thinking that we are a “majority rules” democracy.



We are NOT. “I pledge allegiance to the flag AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS.



NOT Democracy. We have to elevate our awareness and stop letting the Bankster financed establishment program a false narrative, via word manipulation (read 1984, this is a strategy… Socrates was obsessed with words as well), into your thought processes.



This IS NOT a put down. It is a kind wake up call based on Veritas level Truth. If you are mad at me for the correction, call me a name, BUT UPDATE YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS SO IT DOESN’T REFELCT A FALLACY THAT ENRICHES BANKING CRIMINALS.



* Democracy is akin to 10 Jeffrey Dahmer types voting to change the law so it allows them to eat the 5 children (67% of "the people" voted to change the law, so it changed).



A Republic defines a law that it is illegal to eat children REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTE TO DO SO.



This is no trivial difference - and if you think it is, put yourself in the shoes of one of those 5 children. We don’t have to predict, as President Lincoln did.

I can really sink my teeth in the well thought out post of Trivium Discipulus. Our greatest threat to our freedom and our republic is Wall Street and the banksters. We have already lost the best part of our Bill of Rights. I can easily envision that we are headed towards a fascist regime with the likes of Sarah Palin and any one of those so called senators and congressman being a puppet rulers. Then what. We oridinary people will be taxed like the Jews during the Roman Empire. In the end it is the poor who pay the bills.

I also appreciate Trivium Discipulus' post. Excellent illustration between a democracy and a republic. But Marguerite, I think you only blame the 1%. No doubt they are rent seeking through the political process. However, as long as the rest of us, the 99%, look to expand government beyond its once-limited role in order to take care of us, we then are also seeking to get more from the government coffers than we put in. We will leave our children debt and a government with no boundaries to power. That's the way we will eat our children. No one means to do evil; we justify our pet expenditure as being for the good. Each of us might be a well-meaning cannibal that didn't want the poor to go hungry.

Wisdom to foresee the future, of which this (mis-attributed) quotation speaks eloquently, comes from the acute perception of the present and a chronic understanding of the past.



Apparently, what was said by Lincoln that comes close was about the need for rule of law, and occasioned by a mob execution, though other forms of passionate discord may have well

been in his sights. Here is what Lincoln said in a speech at 28 years of age: From "The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions: Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois" January 27, 1838.

(In closing, Lincoln said:) **Passion has helped us; but can do so no more. It will in future be our enemy.

Wisdom to foresee the future, of which this () quotation speaks eloquently, comes from the acute perception of the present and a chronic understanding of the past.Apparently, what was said by Lincoln that comes close was about the need for rule of law, and occasioned by a mob execution, though other forms of passionate discord may have wellbeen in his sights. Here is what Lincoln said in a speech at 28 years of age: From "The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions: Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois" January 27, 1838. http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm Quote""At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?

Well done, Verbatim. We can always count on you!



The 'or die by suicide' puts a whole new slant on it. Sounds as if it would be done on purpose if necessary to remain free. But to abide by the law is the main order.
