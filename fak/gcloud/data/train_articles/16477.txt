Emails, Kimberly Willingham, communications director, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, April 17, 2013

The direct quote from the Director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, was in the section of the House Homeland Security report dedicated solely to Islamic groups, including al Qaeda and Hizbollah, establishing a presence specifically in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.

That section includes the FBI Director’s own statements with the appropriate link in the footnote:

“Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller has confirmed in testimony ‘that there are individuals from countries with known al-Qa'ida connections who are changing their Islamic surnames to Hispanic-sounding names and obtaining false Hispanic identities, learning to speak Spanish and pretending to be Hispanic Immigrants [4].’”

This is one source of information of which he was aware. The information is quite clear beginning on page 27, section III, at that footnoted link:

Here are FBI Director Mueller’s comments (pasted below) regarding this subject matter. As far back as 2005, Director Mueller has been on the record stating this information before Congress.

Read page 30 and check the footnotes:

From article:

“The congressional report also revealed that the FBI has confirmed that persons from al-Qaeda-linked nations have been known to disguise themselves as Hispanic immigrants:

Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller has confirmed in testimony "that there are individuals from countries with known al-Qa'ida connections who are changing their Islamic surnames to Hispanic-sounding names and obtaining false Hispanic identities, learning to speak Spanish and pretending to be Hispanic Immigrants [4].”

Will do. What was the basis of his reference to al Qaeda camps with the drug cartels in Mexico?

This lays out further evidence:

“The indictment further substantiates the established relationship between Hezbollah, a proxy for Iran, and Mexican drug cartels, which control secured smuggling routes into the United States” (from page 9of PDF below)
