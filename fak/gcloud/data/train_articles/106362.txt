Father Of Doctor Treating Hillary Clinton For Dementia Mysteriously Dies

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is reporting today that the continuing to grow list of mysterious deaths surrounding US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has increased after the father of the doctor treating her for dementia suddenly died this past weekend—and who is believed to have been behind the leaking of her most secret medical records. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

The SVR first became “alerted/alarmed�? regarding the circumstances of this latest mysterious death associated with Hillary Clinton on 17 July, this report says, when a “known/suspected�? Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) “hit team�? traveled about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from their New York City “base/headquarters�? to a small village named Mount Kisco, both being located in New York State.

Upon arriving in Mount Kisco, this report continues, this CIA “hit team�? broke into a specialized small computer security companies annex office named Right Click Solutions, located at 322 East Main Street, but were “shocked/surprised�? by the unexpected arrival of an off duty employee—who immediately called the local police forces when he noticed the break in—and who were only able to obtain a single laptop computer.

An “electronic interrogation�? of this company and its customers to ascertain the CIA’s interest in it, this report says, revealed an anomaly where this computer security company had installed a “Snowden-like dead man’s switch�? on the personal computer of man named Vincent Fleck. [Note: The “dead man’s switch�? refered to by the SVR in this report relates to a software programme that will automatically distribute information should something happen to the owner.]

In the SVR’s investigation of Vincent Fleck, this report continues, it was discovered that he was the father of Dr. Daniel Fleck—who is the personal physical therapist for Hillary Clinton and whose practice is located in New York City .

While SVR analysts were still investigating this case, this report notes, they received information this past Sunday (7 August) that Vincent Fleck had been reported dead in a mysterious swimming “event�? near his home—and that was followed 24 hours later by the leaking to the public of Hillary Clinton’s secret medical reports from a Twitter account named @HillsMedlRecords—and that was nearly immediately shut down.

Prior to this Twitter account being shut down, however, this report continues, its creator was able to state “I hate to do this, but people need to need to know. Dr. Bardack was not honest about Hillary Clinton's health and I have proof�? and release several damaging medical documents—the most damaging being a diagnosis of Hillary Clinton that says she has “Complex Partial Seizures�? and “Subcortical Vascular Dementia.�?

Still unable to be determined by SVR analysts, this report says, is if this leak was done by Vincent Fleck acting alone, or by his son Dr. Daniel Fleck who was using his father’s computer in the mistaken belief he would not be discovered.

With Hillary Clinton’s health being reported in rapid decline, and her aides having to constantly keep her from falling, this report concludes, the US propaganda mainstream media is now reported to be “strangely silent�? about telling the American people how ill she really is with dementia—leaving everyone to wonder if she’ll even be fit for office should she win the presidency.
