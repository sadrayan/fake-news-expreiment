Gold Price Basics

What is the Gold spot price?

The spot price of Gold is the base price of Gold in unfabricated form without any markup. Because Gold spot prices are taken at different times in different locations around the world, Gold ounce prices vary. Commonly quoted Gold bullion markets, or those who influence the markets, include New York City, Chicago, Handy and Harman, Engelhard, Republic National Bank, London, Zurich, Paris, Frankfurt, and Hong Kong. When buying Gold in the United States, the current price of Gold per ounce will generally be based on the current prices of Gold in New York or Chicago.

How is the current price of Gold per ounce today determined?

Even in ancient times, the value of Gold was high. The pricing today depends on many factors, including production, central bank reserves, the value of the U.S. dollar, worldwide Gold jewelry, and industrial demand, and economic downturns. The central banks in the United States, Germany, Italy, and other places have an effect on the Gold price per ounce today as they diversify their holdings. The price of Gold today goes up as central banks move away from paper money and buy more Gold. Live Gold prices are, in part, typically based inversely on the value of the U.S. dollar – generally the stronger the dollar, the lower the value of Gold. Similarly, Gold value often goes up as economies falter.

That is because many consider Gold a safe-haven investment, as the historical prices of Gold generally are more stable over time than economies and other investments.

Gold prices today are also greatly affected by the demand for Gold in jewelry. Jewelry made up about 46 percent of Gold demand worldwide Q1 2017 – up from Q1 2016. This demand for Gold is due to Gold being seen as an enduring gift for weddings, festivals, and other special events. In Q1 2016, when Gold jewelry demand hit a seven-year low, it was still at 45% of the total Gold demand. In addition, determining what the price of Gold is currently, is affected by industrial demand, like the manufacturing of medical devices such as stents, and electronics, such as GPS units. Finally, the Gold coin price and Gold bar price are affected by how much Gold is available, which was at 186,700 tons of above-ground stock at the end of Q1 2017.

Is the U.S. Gold price the same no matter where I live?

No matter where you are in the world, the spot Gold price now is the same at any given moment. If the price of Gold was not the same, the opportunity for arbitrage would exist. This means you could simultaneously buy and sell Gold in different markets to take advantage of the Gold price or premium differentials. This is the basis for Gold bullion such as Gold American Eagles and Gold American Buffalos, as well as collectible vintage coins that have high numismatic Gold value.

I've heard that Gold trades 24/7. Is that true? Is there a closing price daily?

Gold trading almost never stops. Find the Gold price for today at almost any time, any place in the world. This distinguishes Gold from stocks, which have official trading hours and closing prices. There are no close-of-business Gold prices, although some firms capture a "closing Gold price." These companies typically either use the fixing price of Gold, reflecting the price at which buy and sell orders from the firms' customers are balanced, or they use a data vendor’s closing Gold price, which is often a snapshot of Gold spot prices at a specific time each day. Trading goes from 6 p.m. (ET) to 5:15 p.m. (ET), Sunday to Friday, with markets closing for 45 minutes on weekdays.

What does numismatic value mean when you are looking at the Gold ounce price premium?

When you begin investing in Gold, you must determine if you want Gold only for its raw Gold value or if you want to also collect Gold coins and other products that have numismatic value. Numismatic is just a fancy term for the collectible aspect of coins, paper currency, medals or related bullion objects. Gold coin prices are higher if the coin has a numismatic value. When you look at the Gold prices chart, you will find the spot Gold price, which is the base price. To that spot price for Gold, add costs for fabrication, distribution, a nominal dealer markup, and numismatic value, which combine to give you the premium Gold price you pay.

Back to Table of Contents

Why can't I buy at the Gold spot price? Is the dealer making a lot of money on my purchase?

You can't buy at the spot price of Gold by the ounce because the spot price does not include the costs of fabrication, distribution, a small dealer markup and any numismatic or collector Gold value added for highly sought-after Gold coins. The Gold bar value is typically very easy to determine because it is based on the spot Gold price you will find on a Gold price history chart, plus fabrication, distribution, and small dealer markup.

But Gold coin values are harder to estimate because they rely on where the coins were minted, the number of coins minted, the current coin condition, the desirability of the coins and more. As a result for dealers, the premium for Gold coin prices, that is, the price on top of the Gold spot price is also more than premium prices for Gold bars, and Gold coin values can be significantly higher for highly sought-after Gold coins.

How do I compare the current price of Gold?

When you compare the price of Gold, make sure you are comparing troy ounces to troy ounces. Gold is typically sold in troy ounces (which weigh about one-tenth more than regular ounces), but sometimes you will see the Gold price per gram or other Gold price measurements. Make sure you know the rate you are looking at is the Gold price in troy ounces. In addition, the current Gold price for a coin can be higher than the current price of Gold bullion, including:

That is because the price you pay for a Gold item takes into consideration more than the raw value of Gold. In addition to the 1 oz Gold coin value, there is often a numismatic value, or collectibility premium, for a higher current price of Gold per ounce for coins and higher historical Gold prices for collectible Gold coins.

What is the Gold price quoting exactly?

What determines the price of Gold per ounce?

When determining what is the price of Gold, markets take into account the bedrock of capitalism: supply and demand. Relative to other metals like aluminum or iron, Gold is rarer to find, which means Gold prices today are higher than those easier-to-find metals. In contrast, about 150 years ago, aluminum prices were higher than Gold prices because it was so hard to extract aluminum from raw source materials. While it is rarer, Gold is also in high demand for jewelry, industrial uses, like the manufacture of medical devices, and electronics such as GPS units. These personal, commercial and economic uses all increase Gold prices per ounce.

How is the Gold spot price determined?

While Gold is traded as a commodity on many exchanges around the globe, the COMEX (Commodity Exchange, Inc.) is the most important exchange that sets the spot price of Gold. To calculate the spot Gold price, the data from the front-month futures contract traded on the COMEX is used. Only when there is little to no volume on the front-month contract, the next delivery month with the most volume is used to calculate the spot Gold price.

Why are Silver and Gold prices so different?

Silver and Gold prices are so different in large part due to perception and demand. It is less about their rarity though there is some debate about whether Silver is now rarer than Gold. Part of the reason for the difference may be that Gold is harder to mine because Gold is often alloyed with other metals, requiring a purification process. The Gold price and Silver price also is reliant on demand, which has no signs of waning, especially for Gold bullion such as:

Gold is also used in a multitude of industrial products, including space-age equipment. In addition, Gold-Silver prices reflect that both central banks and individual investors buy more Gold. In many ways, the demand is all about perception, as well as history. Gold and Silver prices throughout time have been at odds. As early as 6,000 years ago, Gold was used as decoration and was introduced in ancient times as coins. Thus, we perceive Gold as valuable because civilizations before us also saw Gold's value. These are just some of the reasons Silver and Gold price is so different.why-should-i-invest-in-gold-today

How do I safely buy Gold for retirement?

No investment is completely safe. With today's Gold price, many think Gold can be a good addition to your portfolio, depending on your goals. Typically investors consider Gold prices in historical terms when they hold an asset like physical Gold for 3-5 years or more. These investors know Gold prices typically go up as other investments like stocks and bonds, and even U.S. currency, falter. That is why many see Gold as a typically stable investment during economic downturns when the Gold price per oz can skyrocket. Many investors who look at the price of Gold per ounce over time use dollar cost averaging, dividing the total sum to be invested into equal amounts invested at regular intervals. This conservative method of buying Gold allows flexibility as the market shifts.

When do I invest in Gold coins and when do I invest in Gold bars?

There is a big difference in the current Gold price for some of these. What type of Gold you invest in depends on your end-game. Some people love the simplicity of the bar of Gold value with minimal markup from the spot Gold price, making it ideal for investing. Others look at Gold coin prices, which can be much higher Gold prices because of the collectibility factor, and think the price is worth it. Why? Because the Gold coin price represents more than just monetary value. Gold coin prices reflect the currencies as historical and design masterpieces to hold in your hands and proudly display. In contrast, the Gold bar price reflects its utilitarian mission as an investment tool, although some Gold bars display beautiful designs, upping their numismatic value. Many people also like to collect both for a mix of coin and bar of Gold value. In addition, you can also collect Gold jewelry, made with bars and coins like the Gold American Eagles or South African Gold Krugerrands, or you can collect Gold rounds, which have no face value but often have gorgeous designs and numismatic value.

Gold bullion comes in several different forms, with prices based on live Gold prices. You can safely buy Gold coins, rounds and bars. Gold coins are only produced by government mints and go beyond what is the current price for Gold because they have numismatic or collectible value. Gold bar price quotes, on the other hand, typically have the least markup so they make great investments for someone not interested in the historical and artistic values of the mint coins. Gold rounds are in the same class as Gold bars and are similar to Gold bar price value. Both Gold rounds and bars, which come in a large variety of sizes and designs, are manufactured by private mints.

What is a Gold Share or Gold Trust?

What is the spot price of Gold and Silver ratio?

When determining what is the spot price of Gold or Silver, why would people care about the ratio? Gold-Silver prices are often looked at together to analyze the relative value of the two Precious Metals. If the ratio swings one way or the other, one of the Precious Metals is usually considered overpriced and the other underpriced when compared with the historical price of Gold and Silver. One of the reasons for a shift in the ratio of the price of Gold and Silver could be that demand is up for one and not the other. The Gold-Silver prices ratio could also be off because the supply for one has become scarcer due to mining issues or production.
