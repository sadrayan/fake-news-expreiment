The Guinness Book of Records
The Superflag, measuring 255 ft. x 505 ft. (78m x 154m) was displayed over Hoover Dam to commemorate the 1996 Olympic Torch Relay. The event was recorded by the Guinness Book of World Records, giving Superflag the record for the World’s Largest Flag.

The Superflag is 3,000 lbs and each star is 17 ft high. It took the efforts of over 200 people and several hours to maneuver the flag across the dam. Officials from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation were on hand to secure the flag’s 30 inch steel grommets to the heavy steel cables that were attached to the dam.

Superflag was hoisted over the Hoover Dam long enough to secure the Guinness Record but soon after the required time period had passed the strong winds had caused a grommet to snap and the flag was taken down.

Unfortunately, Superflag no longer holds the record for the world’s largest flag, however, it still remains the largest American flag in the world and continues to travel the country inspiring people young and old.
