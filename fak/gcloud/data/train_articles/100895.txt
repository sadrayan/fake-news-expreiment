On the Autobahn A 29 northwest of Ahlhorn, an emergency landing field with concrete middle strip and three parking areas was built during the Cold War. Shortly before the commissioning of this section of the motorway, an exercise took place here in 1984. After the reunification, the highway strip was abandoned.

There are three parkings: two at the southern end, one at the northern end (on the eastern side).
