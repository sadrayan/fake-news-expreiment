Newsmakers 7/31/2014: GOP congressional candidates Cormick Lynch, Stan Tran
EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) – This week on Newsmakers: Republican candidates for U.S House of Representatives in Rhode Island’s 1st District, Cormick Lynch and Stan Tran.

With the governor’s race and now Providence mayoral campaigns overshadowing the 2014 ballot, few may realize two Republicans are looking to unseat Congressman David Cicilline. The two candidates talk about where they stand on the issues from immigration to education, healthcare and campaign finances, and introduce themselves to the voters of Rhode Island.

Both men will face off in the September 9th primary.
