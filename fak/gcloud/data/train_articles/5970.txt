Megyn Kelly Calls Out Pelosi's 'Sexist' Comments Against Supreme Court Justices
There’s more outrage from the left over the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision, which upheld the religious rights of companies to decline to cover some birth control.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said today, “That court decision was a frightening one – that five men should get down to specifics of whether a woman should use a diaphragm. […] It’s not her boss’s business.”

Megyn Kelly offered her legal analysis of Pelosi’s attempt to “stoke resentment” tonight on The Kelly File. She pointed out that Roe v. Wade was decided by a majority of men.

“Does Ms. Pelosi think those justices were ill-equipped to fairly decide that case? Or is it only when a judge disagrees with Ms. Pelosi that his gender is an issue. If Speaker John Boehner made a similar comment about the female Supreme Court justices, Nancy Pelosi would be crying sexism – and that’s what she is guilty of here.”

Calling Pelosi’s claim a “gross misrepresentation,” Megyn clarified that the court did not determine which methods of birth control are legal.

“News flash: all birth control that was legal before this decision remains legal today. The high court simply found that a religious freedom law which was co-sponsored by none other than wait for it – Nancy Pelosi, sometimes protects corporations from being forced to violate their religious beliefs,” Megyn said.

Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, agreed with Megyn’s assessment.

“Everything Nancy Pelosi said was a flat-out, unambiguous, deliberate lie,” he said.
