Deborah Ross' first TV ad attacks Sen. Richard Burr in North Carolina campaign
Deborah Ross is out with her first TV commercial in her campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Richard Burr.

The theme of Democrat Ross’ ad is that the incumbent represents business as usual in Washington, D.C., working for special interests instead of North Carolinians.

In the ad, Ross tells an actor playing Burr that he went to Washington and “cashed in.”

Ross’ campaign says that the ad campaign will be a “significant” six-figure buy and will air in key markets and digitally.

“The fact that Deborah Ross' first TV ad is an attack on Senator Burr comes as no surprise given her indefensible record with the ACLU where she fought against the creation of the North Carolina Sex Offender Registry, defended the burning of the American flag, and referred to American intelligence agencies as ‘dangerous’ after the September 11th terrorist attacks,” Burr campaign spokesman Jesse Hunt.
