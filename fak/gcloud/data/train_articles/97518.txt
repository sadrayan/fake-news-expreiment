A legendary fixture of Edmontonâ€™s theatre community was remembered on Saturday with a funeral service that included a eulogy from Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Frank Glenfield, one of the founders of Edmonton's Walterdale Playhouse, died at the age of 87. (Western Catholic Reporter) Frank Glenfield died earlier this week at the age of 87.

He was one of the founders of Edmonton's Walterdale Playhouse and also worked with the University of Alberta's Studio Theatre.

Colin MacLean, a former CBC reporter who knew Glenfield for decades, said the mourners were surprised when the Prime Minister suddenly took the podium at St. George's Anglican Church.

Harper spoke about working at an oil company with Glenfield as a teenager.

"He gave one of the best speeches I have ever seen him give. He was very powerful. And very sincere. Obviously Frank Glenfield meant an awful lot to him in his life. He was anecdotal. He was very funny," MacLean said.

Harper's presence at the funeral wasn't announced until the eulogy, MacLean said.

The Prime Minister stayed after the service to share more stories about Glenfield with the funeral attendees.

Glenfield made a mark in the lives of many actors, MacLean recalled.

"He would mentor people ... And he could speak to anyone. He was very accessible, there was nothing grandiose or overtly theatrical about him. He was a warm human being," said MacLean.

Glenfield's last play was as director of "Emily and Victoria, Growing Up Together" at the 2011 Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival.

"The Walterdale family will miss Frank, his knowledge, and his entirely genuine and so generously shared love for all things 'theatre,'" the company said in a written release.

Glenfield's family has requested that in lieu of flowers, people go see a play.
