Elizabeth Warren: Women Need to Be Raped by Muslims to Prove Tolerance- Fiction!

Summary of eRumor:

Senator Elizabeth Warren supposedly said, “If women need to be raped by Muslims to prove our tolerance, so be it. Then thank goodness for Planned Parenthood.”

The Truth:

We couldn’t find any instances of Elizabeth Warren saying anything close to, “If women need to be raped by Muslims to prove our tolerance, so be it.”

The original source of this hoax Elizabeth Warren rape quote isn’t clear, but it surfaced on social media in January 2017 in the form of a meme. The meme doesn’t provide a source for the quote, but many social media users took it at face value and believed that Warren actually said if women need to be raped by Muslims to prove their tolerance, “so be it.”

Again, there’s no record of Elizabeth Warren saying anything about Muslims raping women, and the meme appears to be an intentional effort to smear Warren with misinformation.

In the past, Elizabeth Warren has spoken in defense of Planned Parenthood and the resettlement of Syrian refugees — and the false quote that has been attributed to her undermines her position and erodes her credibility on both positions.

As a best practice, it’s best to assume that quotes and statistics that appear in these types of memes are fiction unless a source is cited and can be used to confirmed the claims. .
