Woman pregnant in mouth with baby squid
A 63-year-old woman has become 'pregnant' with 12 baby squid after eating calamari.

The South Korean woman was eating a whole cooked squid when she felt a sharp pain in her mouth, according to a scientific paper in the US state of Maryland (via the Daily Mail).

When the lady was examined, doctors found 'baby cephalopods' attached to her mouth - small pods covered in a sticky material.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information said: "She did not swallow the portion, but spat it out immediately. She complained of a pricking and foreign-body sensation in the oral cavity.

"Twelve small, white spindle-shaped, bug-like organisms stuck in the mucous membrane of the tongue, cheek, and gingiva [gums] were completely removed, along with the affected mucosa.

"On the basis of their morphology and the presence of the sperm bag, the foreign bodies were identified as squid spermatophores."

A spermatophore is thought to be around the same size as a cup of human semen.
