There were several unresolved corruption scandals in the energy sector during Mr. Obasanjo’s tenure as president.

Despite the corruption prevalent in the energy sector while he was President, and Nigeria’s inability to maximise its energy potentials, former President Olusegun Obasanjo is set to play a leading role in the ongoing African Energy Summit in Dubai.

This was disclosed by Harold Oh, the Chairman of the World Energy Forum on the official Website of the 2012 World Energy Forum taking place in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Mr. Oh said the Summit was an integral part of the World Energy Forum, adding that Mr. Obasanjo had been admitted as a new member of the Board of Directors of the global body.

“President Obasanjo will play a leading role in the African Energy Summit which is an integral part of World Energy Forum 2012,” he said.

Over 80 participants including Presidents, Prime Ministers and their representatives from different parts of the globe, as well as the management of the Nigeria National Petroleum Commission, NNPC, are attending the three-day event.

The three-day event is being held outside UN headquarters, New York, for the first time.

The summit is expected to come up with a universally cheap access to energy and sustainable development as well as re-define progressive energy infrastructure for all. It is expected to consider a variety of other energy sources through the use of innovative technology and find solutions.

Some of the corruptions scandals in the energy sector include the $180 million Halliburton bribery scandals, which Mr. Obasanjo is believed to have benefitted from and for which one of his aides is being prosecuted; and the mismanagement of about $16 billion power funds meant to help Nigeria achieve stable electricity.
