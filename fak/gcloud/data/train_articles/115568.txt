CAIR-MI Offers Cultural Awareness Training to Home Depot Employees
The Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations yesterday provided cultural awareness training to employees at a Home Depot store in Dearborn, Mich.

CAIR-MI Executive Director Dawud Walid and CAIR-MI Safe Spaces Coordinator Warda Kalim discussed issues relating to customer interactions and modesty in Islam and highlighted religious accommodations concerns of Muslim employees.

CAIR-MI has provided similar trainings in the past to other Home Depot locations in Southeastern Michigan.

"We welcome such opportunities to engage Home Depot and other business establishments to better serve their Muslim customers and accommodate the cultural competency of their Muslim employees," said CAIR-MI Executive Director Dawud Walid.

CAIR has helped resolve a number of similar cases involving prayer in the workplace and offers a booklet, called "An Employer's Guide to Islamic Religious Practices," to help corporate managers gain a better understanding of Islam and Muslims.
