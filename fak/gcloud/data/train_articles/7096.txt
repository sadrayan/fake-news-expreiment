HOPE Scholars Pick Up Increasing Share of College Costs
Students from low- or moderate-income families must clear ever-higher financial hurdles to complete a postsecondary program in Georgia. The HOPE Scholarship will cover 59 percent of tuition and mandatory fees at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the next school year and 62 percent at the University of Georgia. This is well below what it covered in 2011, when the HOPE Scholarship covered all tuition and mandatory fees and provided a book allowance at these schools and all others in the university system. HOPE will cover between 62 and 66 percent of tuition and mandatory fees next fall at most other schools in the university system. Download the fact sheet.
