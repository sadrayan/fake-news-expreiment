Reconsideration of Commission Orders ``46. WMATA shall have the right to petition the Commission for reconsideration of an order based on rules and procedures developed by the Commission. ``47. Consistent with section 16, the filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not act as a stay upon the execution of a Commission order, or any part of it, unless the Commission orders otherwise. WMATA may appeal any adverse action on a petition for reconsideration as set forth in section 48. ``G. Judicial Matters ``48. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Southern Division, and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have exclusive and original jurisdiction of all actions brought by or against the Commission and to enforce subpoenas under this MSC Compact. ``49.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect such person from [[Page 131 STAT. 1102]] suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person. ``51. <<NOTE: Contracts.>> The Commission shall be liable for its contracts and for its torts and those of its Members, Alternate Members, officers, agents, employees, and representatives committed in the conduct of any proprietary function, in accordance with the law of the applicable Signatory (including, without limitation, rules on conflict of laws) but shall not be liable for any torts occurring in the performance of a governmental function. The exclusive remedy for such breach of contract or tort for which the Commission shall be liable, as herein provided, shall be by suit against the Commission. Nothing contained in this MSC Compact shall be construed as a waiver by the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, or the State of Maryland of any immunity from suit. ``I. Commitment of Parties ``52. Each of the Signatories pledges to each other faithful cooperation in providing safety oversight for the WMATA Rail System, and, to affect such purposes, agrees to consider in good faith and request any necessary legislation to achieve the objectives of this MSC Compact. ``J.

When one Signatory adopts an amendment or supplement to an existing section of this MSC Compact, that amendment or supplement shall not be immediately effective, and the previously enacted provision or provisions shall remain in effect in each jurisdiction until the amendment or supplement is approved by the other Signatories and is consented to by Congress. ``K. Withdrawal and Termination ``54. Any Signatory may withdraw from this MSC Compact, which action shall constitute a termination of this MSC Compact. ``55. <<NOTE: Time period. Notice.>> Withdrawal from this MSC Compact shall be by a Signatory's repeal of this MSC Compact from its laws, but such repeal shall not take effect until 2 years after the effective date of the repealed statute and written notice of the withdrawal being given by the withdrawing Signatory to the governors or mayor, as appropriate, of the other Signatories. ``56. <<NOTE: Plans.>> Prior to termination of this MSC Compact, the Commission shall provide each Signatory: ``(a) A mechanism for concluding the operations of the Commission; ``(b) <<NOTE: Proposal.>> A proposal to maintain state safety oversight of the WMATA Rail System in compliance with applicable federal law; ``(c) A plan to hold surplus funds in a trust for a successor regulatory entity for 4 years after the termination of this MSC Compact; and ``(d) A plan to return any surplus funds that remain 4 years after the creation of the trust. ``L. Construction and Severability ``57. This MSC Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes for which it is created. ``58.
