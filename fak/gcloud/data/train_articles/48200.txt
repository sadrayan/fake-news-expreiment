2018 Outside Spending, by Race
Not all races are created equal when it comes to money fueling political messages that flood airwaves and attempt to influence voters' actions. Furthermore, some waves of spending come during the primary phase, and others don't hit until the general election. Wealthy individuals, corporations, unions and other entities can use any of a range of vehicles -- including super PACs and tax-exempt nonprofits -- to invest in independent expenditures, electioneering communications and communication costs to try to sway the outcome of an election. While such groups aren't supposed to coordinate with the candidates they're supporting, they can coordinate with each other, and often do so in choosing which races to target with their funds.

Why don't the numbers add up?

Based on data released by the FEC on Tuesday, March 26, 2019

Only races with at least $1,000 in outside spending are included.

You cannot add up all the race totals on this page to obtain an overall cycle total spent because double counting would occur. This is because CRP uses the full amount for each candidate for filings that do not break down per candidate expenses.
