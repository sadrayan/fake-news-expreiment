Ads target Adam Putnam, John Mica over Sotomayor
As Sonia Sotomayor hearings begin in Washington, an advocoacy group called Presente Action is launching Hispanic radio ads in Tampa Bay (WYUU) and Orlando (WRUM) targeting Republican U.S. Reps Adam Putnam and John Mica and calling for support for Sotomayor. The Putnam version of the script:

In Spanish: Sonia Sotomayor is set to be the first Latina, and the first Puerto Rican, to serve on the US Supreme Court. It is a proud moment for our community. Yet Republican leaders insist on attacking her:

In English: "She doesn't have any intellectual depth. She's got a -- she's an angry woman, she's a bigot. She's a racist."

In Spanish: That's Republican leader Rush Limbaugh calling Judge Sotomayor a racist and

a bigot. It's insulting to all Latinos and Americans. We asked Republican Congressman Adam Putnam if he would denounce Limbaugh's words. He refused to reply. Let's put a stop to the hate. Call Congressman Putnam today at 863-534-353 and tell him to condemn this language.
