NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2015!
WORLDWIDE – NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness, and will happen from the dates Wednesday the 16 – Tuesday the 22 of December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.

The head of NASA, Charles Bolden, made the announcement and asked everyone to remain calm. The darkness will be the product of a solar storm, the largest in the last 250 years for a period of 216 hours total. Reporters interviewed a few people to hear what they had to say about the situation, with Michael Hearns responding “We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam”.

Despite the six days of darkness soon to come, officials say that the earth will not experience any major problems, since six days of darkness is nowhere near enough to cause major damage to anything. “We will solely rely on artificial light for the six days, which is not a problem at all”, says NASA scientist Earl Godoy.
