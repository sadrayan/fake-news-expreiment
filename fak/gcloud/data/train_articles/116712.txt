The Competition Commission of South Africa
Our Mandate

The mandate of the Commission is to promote and maintain competition in South Africa in order to:

• Promote the efficiency, adaptability and development of the economy;

• Provide consumers with competitive prices and product choices;

• Promote employment and advance the social and economic welfare of South Africans;

• Expand opportunities for South African participation in world markets and recognise the role of foreign competition in the Republic;

• Ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the economy; and

• Promote a greater spread of ownership, in particular to increase the ownership stakes of historically disadvantaged persons.

Our Core Functions

To achieve its purpose, the Commission’s core functions, set out in section 21 of the Act, are to:

• Investigate and prosecute restrictive horizontal and vertical practices;

• Investigate and prosecute abuse of dominant positions;

• Decide on mergers and acquisitions applications;

• Conduct formal inquiries in respect of the general state of competition in a particular market;

• Grant or refuse applications for exemption from the application of the Act;

• Conduct legislative reviews; and

• Develop and communicate advocacy positions on specific competition issues.

In addition, the Commission promotes voluntary compliance with the Act by providing education and advice on the application of the Act. The Commission can negotiate agreements with any regulatory authority to coordinate and harmonise the exercise of jurisdiction over competition matters within the relevant industry or sector, and ensure the consistent application of the principles of the Act. The Commission can also participate in the proceedings of any regulatory authority and advise (or receive advice) therefrom.
