2014 Policy Brief Insisting that Colleges Align with the Common Core

In July 2014, the New America Foundation released a policy brief recommending that, rather than primary and secondary school education aiming to prepare students for post-secondary education, higher education providers should change their teaching methods in order to accommodate Common Core State Standards. The report, titled "Common Core Goes to College: Building Better Connections Between High School and Higher Education," suggests that "the widespread adoption of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and assessments presents a new opportunity to bridge the gap between high school and higher education."[3] The report argues "that states' new college- and career-ready assessments should, at the very least, provide an additional avenue for students to meet minimum college eligibility requirements, qualify for state financial aid, and place into the assortment of first-year credit-bearing coursework offered by institutions."[3]

The report concludes by providing recommendations to higher education institutions in order to align teaching methods, teacher preparation, financial aid dissemination, and course placement decisions with Common Core standards. Recommendations include that:[3]

Institutions with minimum standards for admission should amend those standards to include college- and career-ready assessment cut scores.

Institutions offering developmental coursework should base this instruction upon their state's college- and career-ready standards, and determine the success of those programs using the state's high school assessments

For those states which continue to award financial aid on the basis of demonstrated academic merit, amend any criteria relating to assessment scores to include those from the state's high school college- and career-ready assessments.

The report was funded by grants from:[3]
