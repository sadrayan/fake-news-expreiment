Help Us Turn the Tide in Washington and Stop These Irresponsible Bailouts
Yesterday President Obama signed a spending bill drafted by Congress full of pork and special interest handouts totaling nearly $800 billion. The Democrats think this bill will change our country's financial fortunes, but you and I know better. This latest bailout brings our federal government's commitments to more than $9.7 trillion, which according to Bloomberg is enough money to pay the home mortgages of more than 90% of Americans.

In an op-ed in this morning's Washington Times, I elaborate on how the unparalleled growth in government we see today belies an unspoken belief that Americans are not smart enough to govern their own lives, strong enough to take some risk, or compassionate enough to help their neighbors in need. At the core of conservativism, on the other hand, is belief in the individual.

This is a message I've been articulating for quite some time now. Last year, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed I co-authored with South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, we made the case that this "bailout mentality" is destroying the American ideal of personal responsibility. This administration is saddling future generations with an increasingly unbearable debt, and we are already hearing that more bailouts are just around the corner.

To send Washington a message, please visit NoGovernmentBailouts.com today and sign our petition. Join our fight and add your voice to a growing list of several thousand Americans who are fed up with this irresponsible spending that threatens our future. Once you've signed the petition, use the tools on the site to tell your friends about our cause. The more people we can get to join our chorus, the greater our chance of making a difference.
