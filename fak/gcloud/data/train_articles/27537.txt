Freight Rail Traffic Data
Each week, the major North American railroads report their traffic for the previous week to AAR. This data is published in AAR's Weekly Railroad Traffic report each Wednesday. Carload traffic is classified into 20 major commodity categories such as coal, chemicals, grain, and primary metal products. Rail intermodal traffic (shipping containers and truck trailers moved on rail cars) is reported separately.

The interactive chart above shows weekly rail traffic trends for the past few years. More detail is available in AARâ€™s Weekly Railroad Traffic. Click here to download a sample copy. AAR also posts a rail traffic press release every Thursday morning.
