NoWar Minerals Inc
Nowar Minerals was founded by Michael Hering in 2011. The purpose of this company is to provide the customer the most affordable and beautiful natural creations available. Nowar Minerals specializes in Uruguayan amethyst, both cut base and druze. We also deal with Brazilian cathedrals from small to large. In addition to amethyst, we carry Brazilian Quartz clusters weighing up to 40 pounds. We also have vibrant, full of color Arizona petrified wood. We also carry polished petrified wood, free-forms and slabs from Indonesia. Full of wonder and beauty, these items are a mere sampling of Nowar Minerals full stock of rocks, fossils and minerals.
