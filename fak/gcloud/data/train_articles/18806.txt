Free North Carolina: Supreme Court grants black man “40 acres of land and a mule”
I really enjoy and am somewhat addictive to these little fragments of your recollections of your time in Nam. They are really interesting and insightful of the old and nostalgic South Vietnam. I just want to express my heartfelt appreciation for sharing your thoughts with us. (I got to know you through my Facebook pal Khai Co Vu). Thank you!

Mr. Townsend: Many thanks for your excellent blog and all the work you do on behalf of our nation! Thank you especially for the movies, pics and articles on Vietnam. I was there in 1969 and you bring back many memories. Thanks once again! --SFC Johnny - US Army Retired

I would just like you to know how so very glad I am that I found your blog. I have learned more history from you and the many links that you post than I have from reading all my history books. I can never thank you enough for the education you are freely giving me. It is priceless. And eye opening.

Many times I will not comment, but that does not mean I am not reading and learning.

You sir, are an educator. Thank you.

Good morning Mr. Townsend,

Just to let you know I have finally finished that massive tome on General Lee. I never knew 1/10th of what a great man he was. No wonder the South is so proud of him! So sad that we have few men of his caliber today. We need them desperately. I have learned more history through you and your blog than I thought I could ever learn. I am very grateful to you. Thank you so much for taking time to answer my e-mail. And thank you for your blog and for opening my eyes.

==============================

I have also learned from Brock Townsend and two nurses lately, that appreciation expressed by someone for whom you have great respect overwhelms the lack of appreciation by some from whom you expect it. I believe that we cannot really know which small bit of help makes the life-saving difference. ﻿ I may have learned more real American history on Brock's blog than in 20 years of government schooling.

==============================

It is an honor to be linked by one of the best liberty/Southron blogs. Your blog is a multi-daily must read.



==============================

I really must say, I like thousands of others have said, your blog is the best out there and with all of your history and experience, you should run for

. I look forward to reading your blog every day and every day I learn from you. Thank you for the time you put into this effort .

Sincerely,

Hi Brock,





Ever since I picked up on your blog I "Knew" you were a "Gentleman of the South!" You lack the "Crassness" that is so prevalent in today's Sociopolitical arena but speak with the Firmness in Truth and Conviction of Right like the words of our Late Great President Jefferson Davis! That is Honorable.



I have been thinking about this for a while now. At first it was a very subtle notice, then it became larger as I saw more. Then it bloomed to me to be what it is. In your writings, in your Blog, Brock, "You" have written, posted and done more to eradicate the "Revisionist History" forced on us by the "Northern Aggressors,"BAR NONE!!!" The "Stars and Bars" fly High and Proud today even more thanks to your efforts!



Reading your post on 03 JUNE about the birthday of President Jefferson Davis and the "quotes" of his was the galvanizing statement! The first words of "His" you posted say so much, are timeless and can never be "Destroyed!" by any man! .......and those words were........





"Truth crushed to the earth is still truth still and like a seed will rise again."

--Jefferson Davis (1808-1889)





In so many ways you and your efforts to keep and carry on the "Truth of the South" are the water and light of the Sun that nourish "That Seed" that Jefferson Davis speaks of! That "Seed" of "Southern Truth!" That cannot be vanquished because of efforts like Men as yourself!





Thanks for your selfless effort,





The "Stars and Bars" FLY!

Dear Mr. Townsend,





I wanted to write to thank you for the pleasure and education I have received from reading your blog "Free North Carolina". I can honestly say that FNC is one of the first sites I visit daily.





I am a northerner by birth yet I consider the vilification of all things "South" a true and tragic disgrace. Your work has enabled me to become more familiar with a culture that I admire, yet have never really been familiar with.





Keep up the outstanding work!

My good sir,



I have been reading your blog for years, filling-in the woeful gaps in my knowledge thanks to your efforts, and have been truly impressed with not merely the depth and breadth of the topics you broach, but the frank and honest way you deal with them.



I salute you.



You cannot imagine my immense delight at just reading the "Witting, intentionally, and willfully..." posted on your site, that you linked to Theo Spark's blog.



I'm the guy that wrote it and sent it to Theo a few days ago.



On both our behalves, thank you for posting it on your fine blog.



With warmest personal regards,



Rico

Dear Mr Townsend,



Thanks for taking the time to assemble and distribute your daily emails. You've been instrumental in helping me stay aware (and react to) the ongoing assaults of freedom in the US. I'm more than ever galvanized to fight for my country, call out my enemies and ignore unjust and illegal restrictions on my freedoms
