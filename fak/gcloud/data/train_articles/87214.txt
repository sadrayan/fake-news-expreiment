Workers comp insurance costs to stay flat for first time since 2003
Oregon employers on average will see no change in workers' compensation insurance costs next year -- the first time costs haven't dropped since 2003, state officials said today.



The Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services said costs on Jan. 1 will average $1.48 per $100 of payroll, same as the current year, under its proposed rate. Costs last stayed flat between 2003 and 2004.



The largest portion of workers comp insurance costs -- called the pure premium -- will drop 1.8 percent to $1.27. But a smaller portion, the premium assessment, will increase 39 percent to 10 cents per $100. The tax on payrolls covers the cost of state administrative staff and workplace safety inspectors.



A third portion -- a tax paying for worker benefit programs -- remains unchanged at 11 cents per $100.



The premium assessment increase is needed to protect worker safety in a weak economy, state officials said. Revenue from the payroll tax has dropped from $54.8 million in fiscal 2007 to $34.7 million this year, said Cory Streisinger, the department's director.



Streisinger said the workers' compensation division has reduced staff by 20 percent, imposed pay freezes and furloughs and made other cost-cutting moves.



"We've probably had more layoffs than anywhere else in state government," Streisinger said.



Individual employer rates will vary based on injury rates and industry. Manufacturers are more likely to see rates decline slightly while heath providers, on average, will see rates increase by at least 1 percent.



A public hearing on the proposed rates is scheduled at 2 p.m. Sept. 21 in the Labor and Industries Building in Salem.
