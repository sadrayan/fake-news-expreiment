Attorney General Pam Bondi Joins Multi-State Lawsuit Alleging Health and Human Services Mandate Violates Religious Liberty

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.—Attorney General Pam Bondi today joined six other attorneys general to defend Americans’ religious freedom in a lawsuit filed against a federal government mandate that requires religious employers to offer health insurance coverage that includes contraceptives, abortifacients, sterilization, and related services, in contravention of their religious beliefs. The suit alleges a violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution and of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

"Government has no business forcing religious institutions and individuals to violate their sincerely held beliefs. This lawsuit is about protecting religious liberty and the rights of conscience, our most basic freedoms as Americans," stated Attorney General Pam Bondi.

The other states joining the lawsuit are: Nebraska, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas.

The lawsuit also includes several private plaintiffs who would be harmed by the mandate: Pius X Catholic High School, Catholic Social Services, The Catholic Mutual Relief Society of America and private citizens Stacy Molai and Sister Mary Catherine, CK.
