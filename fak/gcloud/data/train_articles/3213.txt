Donald Trump would slash U.S. education department, reverse worker overtime rules
EPA? 'Cut that down to shreds'



Trump identified another federal agency resented by conservatives, the Environmental Protection Agency, for big cuts as well. "If you look at education and the EPA there is so much waste in that whole group that we can cut that down into shreds," he said.



During a nationally televised speech Monday at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump offered a broad-brush economic plan that included aggressive tax cuts and reduction of federal regulations. On Thursday, he drilled down into specifics on how he would carry out the vision.
