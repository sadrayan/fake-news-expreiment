Statistics Explained
A person is economically inactive, according to the International Labour Organisation definition, if he or she is not part of the labour force. So inactive people are neither employed nor unemployed. The inactive population can include pre-school children, school children, students, pensioners and housewives or -men, for example, provided that they are not working at all and not available or looking for work either; some of these may be of working-age.

The inactivity rate is the proportion of inactive persons in the total population of the same age group.
