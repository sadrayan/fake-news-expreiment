Dinosaurs, Genesis and the Gospel
Since moving to America in 1987, Australian Ken Ham-president and founder of Answers in Genesis and the highly acclaimed Creation Museum-has become one of the most in-demand Christian conference speakers and talk show guests.

Each year, Ken gives numerous faith-building talks to tens of thousands of people with the purpose of upholding the authority of the Bible from the very first verse. Ken's emphasis is on the relevance and authority of the book of Genesis to the life of the average Christian, and how compromise on Genesis has opened a dangerous door regarding how the culture and church view biblical authority.
