NHGOP Statement On Obama’s Supreme Court Nominee

For Immediate Release: March 16th, 2016



CONCORD – New Hampshire State Republican Party Chairman Jennifer Horn released the following statement on President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee:

“Republicans have repeatedly stated that the American people deserve a voice in the process of selecting the next Supreme Court Justice, and I wholeheartedly agree. For more than eighty years, there has not been a nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice in a presidential election year. This is simply not the time to break with decades of bipartisan practice. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Maggie Hassan, and their Democrat colleagues are doing a disservice to the American people by standing with President Obama and his liberal appointment to the highest court in the land. Voters in New Hampshire and across the country should have a voice in this critical process at the ballot box this November.”
