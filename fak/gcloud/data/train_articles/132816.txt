Detroit News: Upton, Dingell lead panel on school shootings
Michigan U.S. Reps. Fred Upton and Debbie Dingell will co-chair a bipartisan congressional working group in response to the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 students and school staff.

They were named co-chairs by the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. The caucus is composed of 24 members each from the Republican and Democratic parties who work together on key issues.

Upton, a Republican from St. Joseph, said he and Dingell are committed to finding common ground in the “heated” gun debate.

“We all share in the heartbreak from the senseless tragedy in Florida,” Upton said in a statement. “As co-chairs of this new working group we will spend the coming days and weeks continuing our productive work. We owe it to our constituents to try.”

“We all have a responsibility to ensure our students feel safe at school. We cannot afford to go to our corners and have the same politically charged conversation that gets us nowhere,” said Dingell, a Dearborn Democrat.
