Sinister ‘fire fairy’ craze tells kids to switch on their stoves and burn themselves
A disturbing new social media craze is endangering the lives of girls in Russia.

The post urges children to secretly turn on the rings on their kitchen hobs, promising that they’ll become ‘fire fairies’ if they do.

It’s designed to look like a prank from the popular kids’ show ‘Winx Club: School of Witches’ – and since it’s gone viral, children have been left seriously injured with severe burns.

Sofia Ezhova, five, suffered severe burns all over her body after she switched on a gas oven to play the ‘game’.

The post says: ‘At midnight, when everyone is asleep, get out of your bed and go around the room three times. Then say the magic words: ‘Alfey kingdom, sweet little fairies, give me the power, I’m asking you’.

‘Then go to the kitchen silently, so no one notices you or the magic of the words will disappear. Switch on the gas stove – all four burners – but do not light it. You don’t want to get burns, do you? Then go to sleep.

‘The magic gas will come to you, you will breathe it while sleeping and in the morning, when you wake up, say “Thank you Alfeya, I’ve become a fairy”. And you will become a real fairy of fire.’
