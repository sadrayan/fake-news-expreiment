Wolf, Casey Oppose White House CHIP, Health Care Cuts

May 08, 2018

Harrisburg, PA – Governor Tom Wolf and Senator Bob Casey today spoke out against the White House’s plan to cut billions of dollars from the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

“CHIP provides high-quality health insurance for over 180,000 children across the commonwealth and it is absolutely appalling that Republicans in Washington would put families at risk,” Governor Wolf said. “Instead of cutting health care funding to appease special interests and extremists, we need the White House and congressional leaders to work towards better health care for our kids and families. Thousands of families rely on CHIP and we shouldn’t be diverting one dollar from this important program.”

“This proposal is a shameful betrayal of children,” Senator Casey said. “This Administration and congressional Republicans passed a massive tax giveaway to their donors and big corporations and now they want vulnerable children to pay for it. This is absolutely unacceptable. I will continue to fight for CHIP funding and I hope Republicans will join me.”
