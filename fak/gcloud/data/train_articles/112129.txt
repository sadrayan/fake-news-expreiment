Mylan CEO Heather Bresch was hospitalized earlier today after being attacked by a swarm of bees.

Bresch was walking through a park during her lunch hour when the bee attack occurred. A large crowd of people formed to watch as she tried to run from the swarm.

“She must have gotten stung like 100 times, mostly on her face,” said one shocked onlooker, who asked to remain anonymous. “Her face was puffed up all huge, she kinda looked like a muppet.”

Bresch, who is apparently allergic to bee stings, immediately suffered a severe anaphylactic reaction. However, none of the bystanders had an EpiPen on hand to inject Bresch with relief.

“Didn’t she raise the price to 600 bucks? Nobody got money for that,” said one Robert Selvidge, a bystander on the scene. “She kept pointing at her bag for some reason, who knows why? Was there something in there she needed? Maybe she had an Epipen in there. Whatever. If you ask me she got what she deserves.”

In previous years, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch raised the price of the life saving EpiPen by over 400% to $600. She also gave herself a pay increase of 600%. She is due to be paid $18.9 million in 2016.

Bresch is currently listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Mercy Hospital. Shares of Mylan were up more than 7 percent in trading Friday as news of Bresch’s troubles spread.
