Who We Are
Vision: Our vision is a world in which strong democratic institutions empower citizens to have a voice in the way they are governed.

Mission: The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) supports citizens’ right to participate in free and fair elections. Our independent expertise strengthens electoral systems and builds local capacity to deliver sustainable solutions.

As the global leader in democracy promotion, we advance good governance and democratic rights by:

Providing technical assistance to election officials

Empowering the underrepresented to participate in the political process

Applying field-based research to improve the electoral cycle

Since 1987, IFES has worked in over 145 countries – from developing democracies, to mature democracies.
