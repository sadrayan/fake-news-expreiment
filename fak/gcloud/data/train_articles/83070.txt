Michelle Fields Speaks Out About Alleged Assault: Trump Should ‘Put Himself in My Shoes’
Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields appeared on ABC World News Tonight earlier tonight for her first interview since Donald Trump‘s campaign manager allegedly assaulted her.

Fields displayed her bruised arm and said, “Honestly, it’s been really hurtful, because obviously no one wants to be touched and violated like that.”

When asked if she could talk to Trump himself, Fields implored him to “put himself in my shoes and imagine if I was his daughter.”

Trump’s campaign has given no indication anyone plans on apologizing, least of all Corey Lewandowski himself, who has resorted to attacking Fields’ credibility.

It’s also worth highlighting the fact Fields gave this interview to ABC News, when she has appeared on Fox News for years and has been a regular panelist on the Fox weekend program Cashin’ In.
