The Citizens Mandate
Common senses ! How did a lot of these kids afford to go to Washington ? Especially the ones in Chicago? They can't even afford to buy lunches at school . Also who paid for them once they got there food and lodging ? Don't think all those parents could

fund their way . And when asked why they are there most of them didn't have any answer and some said I don't know I was paid to come so who paid them ? They wouldn't share that information . Why? How did 17 year olds get voters ID while there? All planned and used by cruel and corrupt people and you know who you are . So shameful teaching our youth to cheat and steal and lie. How can you live with yourself . If you really don't care and want to live that way fine but leave our future Americans alone . One day you all will have to answer to higher up and HE knows everything . Can't lie to him ! His name is Jesus . If Jesus truly lived in your heart and home you would not even think about doing all these wrong ways of life . Praying for you all to help our young lead them down right path no matter where you stand politically.
