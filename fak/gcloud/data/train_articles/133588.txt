Principal Excludes Non Blacks From School Event
THE DIRTY ARMY: Nik, first time I’ve ever posted on here but this one really has me upset and needs to gain more attention. Oak Park River Forest High School, a school just outside of Chicago, held a black lives matter function at the school where they excluded anyone who wasn’t black from attending. Actually turned away a few white students and didn’t allow them in the room. The principal who put on this event is Nathaniel Rouse, and he of course is black so he doesn’t see what the problem is. Pretty sure this principal needs to be fired and the school should be sued for discrimination.

Can’t we all just get along?- nik
