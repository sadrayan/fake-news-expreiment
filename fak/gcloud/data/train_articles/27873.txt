Stacey Abrams easily won Fulton. But how did every neighborhood lean?
Brian Kemp is the presumptive victor in the Georgia governor’s race, but had it been up to counties like Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett, that would not be the case.

Fulton County overwhelmingly supported Democrat Stacey Abrams in the Nov. 6 election, with more than 72 percent of voters casting ballots in her favor. This slightly eclipses the amount of Fulton voters who chose Hillary Clinton in 2016, at 71 percent.



Still, many precincts in Fulton voted for Kemp, who took more than 26 percent of the county’s vote. Libertarian Ted Metz snagged about 1 percent of the vote.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has created an interactive map — the full version of which can be seen and used here — that shows how each precinct in Fulton County as a whole voted in Tuesday's presidential election. Here’s one for metro Atlanta.

Disclaimer: As of Wednesday, about 3,700 provisional Fulton ballots and about 1,000 overseas ballots were outstanding. To be counted, they must arrive by 5 p.m. Friday. Fulton County plans to review and certify its ballots on Tuesday.
