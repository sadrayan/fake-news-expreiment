Obama: ‘We Bring a Gun’
Senator Barack Obama was fund-raising Friday night in Philadelphia. But he was talking about “the Chicago way.”

Channeling the mob drama, “The Untouchables,” Mr. Obama said in reference to the general election rumble with the Republicans: “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.”

“Why is Barack Obama so negative?” said Alex Conant, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, calling the line a “hyperbolic attack.”
