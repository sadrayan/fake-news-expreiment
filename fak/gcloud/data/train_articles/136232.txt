Late-night hosts take on Trumpâ€™s singing of national anthem
Late night comedians on Tuesday mocked how President Trump sang the national anthem at the college football national championship game, taking swipes after footage revealed that he mouthed along to some of the words and not others.

"You would think that a man who ran on a platform of pure patriotism and who spent months lecturing athletes on respecting the national anthem would, at the very least, know the words to the anthem," comedian Seth Meyers joked on NBC's "Late Night."

Meyers aired a clip that showed Trump repeatedly pausing and then resuming singing the words at the game in Alabama.

"Oh, my god, Trump sings the national anthem the way the rest of us sing 'Despacito,'" he quipped, referring to a popular song by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi.

"The Late Show" host Stephen Colbert also made jabs at the president's selective lyric singing by airing an "exclusive" clip of Trump's "isolated vocals."

The video has a Trump-sounding voice, that is dubbed over the video, singing lyrics that mostly related to his remarks on Twitter.

"How much does that 'Sloppy Steve' Bannon weigh?" the voice sings, referring the name Trump gave White House former chief strategist Stephen Bannon after their public fallout earlier this month.

"And I have, like, big brains," the voice says at the end, playing off of one of Trump's recent tweets where he said he is a "very stable genius" after a new book questioned his mental fitness for office.

"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah" also took on the matter, joking that it is like people trying to sing Rihanna's song "Work."
