Timeline of Hillary Clinton's email scandal
2008

2009

January 13, 2009 -- The domain clintonemail.com is registered in the name of longtime adviser to former President Bill Clinton, Justin Cooper. Hillary Clinton's email is set up as hdr22@clintonemail.com

2012

November 2012 -- Clinton's private email server was redesigned to use Google as the backup server.

December 13, 2012 -- Congressional investigators ask Clinton if she uses a personal email.

2013

March 20, 2013 -- Gawker reports that based on emails retrieved by a Romanian hacker called "Guccifer," Clinton used the "clintonemail.com" domain name in emails to advisers and friends. Because her original address is revealed in the article, Clinton changes her email address.

July 2013 -- Clinton's email server is changed once again to be backed up by a McAfee-owned company.

September 2013 -- National Archives and Records Administration clarifies that personal email can only be used in "emergency situations" and that emails from personal accounts should be captured and managed in accordance with agency record-keeping practices.

2014

2014 -- The State Department requests that all former secretaries of state "submit any records in their possession for proper preservation."

Also in 2014, at the request of the State Department, Clinton hands over 55,000 pages â€” approximately 30,000 emails. Left out were emails deemed by her and her staff to be "personal."

December 1, 2014 -- President Barack Obama signs an update to the Federal Records Act that clarified how private emails are allowed to be used. According to the National Archives and Records Administration, this update prohibits "the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they copy or forward any such emails into their government account within 20 days."

2015

March 3, 2015 -- Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill says:

"... like secretaries of state before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any department officials."

"For government business, she emailed them on their department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained. When the department asked former secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes."

"Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved."

March 3, 2015 -- State Department spokeswoman Maria Harf says: "[There's] no indication that Secretary Clinton used her personal email account for anything but unclassified purposes ... While Secretary Clinton did not have a classified email system, she did have multiple other ways of communicating in a classified manner, including assistants printing documents for her, secure phone calls and secure video conferences."

March 4, 2015 -- After 48 hours of silence, Clinton tweets : "I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."

The same day , the House committee investigating the 2012 attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, issues a subpoena for Clinton's Libya-related emails.

March 5, 2015 -- It is revealed that Clinton isn't publicly registered as the owner of the domain and server used to operate her personal email. This makes it more difficult to trace the account back to her. Accounts were registered in her aides' names, and she used a proxy company to shield her involvement.

March 6, 2015 -- The State Department begins reviewing emails to determine what can be publicly released, not whether Clinton did anything wrong.

"At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes ..."

"I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two."

"Looking back, it would have been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue."

Clinton wouldn't disclose how her emails were encrypted, "given what people with ill intentions can do with such information in this day and age, there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices."

"I trust the American people to make their decisions about political and public matters, and I feel like I've taken unprecedented steps for these emails to be in the public domain. I went above and beyond what I was requested to do."

March 12, 2015 -- State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki tells reporters the State Department would remove any emails "deemed not to be agency records."

March 27, 2015 -- Rep. Trey Gowdy makes the statement, "Secretary Clinton unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server."

Clinton's lawyer responds in a letter that she "has maintained and preserved copies" of work-related or potentially work-related emails that were turned over to the State Department late in 2014. The lawyer, David Kendall, also stated that federal law governing record retention requires that each federal employee individually decide what emails must be preserved.

March 31, 2015 -- It is revealed that Clinton used both an iPad and a Blackberry for email, allegedly contradicting the statement she made on March 10 about not wanting to carry multiple devices.

April 15, 2015 -- It is discovered that Clinton ignored questions from Congress in 2012 about her email.

May 19, 2015 -- The State Department says it will need until January 2016 to release all the emails. They propose the date of January 15, 2016. A US district court judge suggests rolling releases.

July 7, 2015 -- CNN's Brianna Keilar has an exclusive interview with Clinton.

Clinton also says she was never subpoenaed by the House.

July 17, 2015 -- In a letter, the State Department inspector general Steve A. Linick says his office is reviewing "the use of personal communications hardware and software by five secretaries of state and their immediate staffs."

August 9, 2015 -- Clinton tells a federal judge that she has turned over all work-related emails to the State Department. In a signed declaration: "While I do not know what information may be 'responsive' for purposes of this lawsuit, I have directed that all my emails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or potentially were federal records be provided to the Department of State, and on information and belief, this has been done."

August 11, 2015 -- Clinton agrees to turn over her private email server and a thumb-drive backup to authorities.

August 15, 2015 -- Clinton makes comments about the scandal at the Iowa State Fair.

She also says this is never brought up when she holds town halls on the campaign trail.

August 17, 2015 -- Intelligence officials reviewing emails from the server have recommended that 305 documents be sent to other agencies for consultation.

August 18, 2015 -- Clinton tells reporters that "nobody talks to me about it other than you guys" in response to questions about her email. She states, as she has before, that she handed over anything that was thought to be work-related.

"Under the law, that decision is made by the official. I was the official. I made those decisions," Clinton says. "And as I just said, over 1,200 of those emails have been deemed not work-related."

August 26, 2015 -- At an event in Iowa, Clinton says, "My use of personal email was allowed by the State Department. It clearly wasn't the best choice. I should have used two emails -- one personal, one for work -- and I take responsibility for that decision." She also adds: "Well, I know people have raised questions about my email use as secretary of state, and I understand why. I get it." This is a change from her previous responses to questions about her email use.

September 1, 2015 -- Clinton's team responds to the latest batch of released emails in a memo saying, "This latest batch of emails backs up what we've said all along -- that the emails simply provide an interesting window into the day-to-day life and work of the secretary of state. ... This group of emails include 125 that have had portions classified after the fact, but as confirmed again by the State Department, nothing she sent or received was marked classified."

September 8, 2015 -- Hillary Clinton releases an apology and statement on her Facebook page about the email scandal:

"I wanted you to hear this directly from me:

"Yes, I should have used two email addresses, one for personal matters and one for my work at the State Department. Not doing so was a mistake. I'm sorry about it, and I take full responsibility ..."

September 9, 2015 -- During an interview on ABC News' "World News Tonight with David Muir," Clinton says she should have used separate emails for her work and her personal business, and she apologizes for her use of a private email server. She says, "I take responsibility, and I am trying to be as transparent as I possibly can."

September 25, 2015 -- An email chain between Clinton and David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is discovered. This causes speculation about whether some emails on Clinton's server were mistakenly considered personal. The emails did not contain classified information.

September 27, 2015 -- In an interview with "Meet the Press," Clinton states that she did not participate in her attorneys' review of her private server to determine which emails needed to be handed over to the State Department.

September 30, 2015 -- The State Department releases the latest batch of Clinton's emails. This batch contains 3,849 documents from mostly 2010 and 2011.

The new emails also show that there was worry about the use of private email inviting hackers.

October 8, 2015 -- It is revealed that Sen. Ron Johnson asked Datto Inc., the makers of Clinton's backup system, for information concerning the security and preservation of her email server. Backup services were provided through the Datto SIRIS S2000 device that was purchased by Platte River Networks when the server moved from her private residence to a New Jersey-based data center in 2013.

January 14, 2016 -- In a letter to congressional intelligence committees, Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III writes that emails on Clinton's private server have been flagged for classified information, some of which is considered the highest "top secret" level of classification.

January 20, 2016 -- During a segment on National Public Radio, Clinton says the letter from the inspector general was nothing more than a ruse to damage her campaign for the presidency. Clinton's spokesman, Brian Fallon, also tells Bloomberg that they believed McCullough and Republican senators were working together to make the letter public.

January 22, 2016 -- Due to inclement weather, the State Department asks for a one-month extension to release Clinton's remaining emails. January 29 is the original deadline set by the courts for releasing all of the emails on Clinton's private server.

June 1, 2016 -- In a newly released filing, State Department lawyers argue that it would take 75 years to release all of the 450,000 pages of records for former Clinton aides Mills and Jacob Sullivan and top State Department official Patrick Kennedy.

"Given the Department's current FOIA workload and the complexity of these documents, it can process about 500 pages a month, meaning it would take approximately 16-and-2/3 years to complete the review of the Mills documents, 33-and-1/3 years to finish the review of the Sullivan documents, and 25 years to wrap up the review of the Kennedy documents -- or 75 years in total," the State Department argued in the filing.

"State objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it never possessed or controlled clintonemail.com, does not now possess or control clintonemail.com, and thus has no method of identifying which State Department officials and employees had and/or used an account on clintonemail.com to conduct official government business."

June 19, 2016 -- Attorney General Loretta Lynch says the Justice Department probe into Clinton's emails is being conducted the same as similar investigations.

The Washington Post Fact Checkers give her their lowest rating, four Pinocchios, for this statement.

August 5, 2016 -- Clinton attempts to clarify her comments during a "Fox News Sunday" interview.

And there are no excuses. I want people to know that the decision to have a single email account was mine. I take responsibility for it. I apologize for it. I would certainly do differently if I could." She adds, "I believe the public will be and is considering my full record and experience as they consider their choice for president."
