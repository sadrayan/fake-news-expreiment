Good afternoon. As you might recall, PolitiFact previously looked into claims the campaign’s Make America Great Again caps were made in China; that wasn’t so.

I write today because this morning a Democratic legislator, state Rep. Celia Israel of Austin, said at an Austin press conference that Trump’s Make America Great Again caps are made in China; see that comment about the 26:10 mark of the video of the press conference posted on the PF Texas FB page.

Thanks.
