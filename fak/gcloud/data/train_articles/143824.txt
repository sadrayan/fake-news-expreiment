Aldi has launched a range of five new hot cross bun flavours just in time for Easter.

The supermarket giant is selling a sweet treat if you don't fancy the normal offerings.

Instead of regular flavouring, the supermarket giant is selling a rhubarb and custard flavour.

The budget supermarket launched its first UK supermarket right here in Birmingham way back in the 1990s.

And, to this day, the chain remains a firm favourite with Birmingham shoppers.

The retailer is flogging the treats at just 85p for a pack of six.

Aldi has also launched blueberry and 'very berry' flavours.

They are on the shelves for 99p.

Apple and cinnamon, meanwhile, costs 85p.

Rhubarb and custard will set you back £1.09.

And there's a £1.09 salted caramel and Belgian chocolate hot cross bun too.

The exciting new offerings from the supermarket giant are from Aldi's luxury Specially Selected range.

They come in packs of four.

The apple and cinnamon buns are part of the Village Bakery range.

All the hot cross buns are sold in stores only and aren't available to order online.

The Rhubarb & Custard flavour was spotted in store and posted on Extreme Couponing & Bargains UK.

"I'm not even joking.. I need these in my life," one fan wrote.

Another said: "I NEED these."

But not everybody was impressed.

"Hot cross buns should only come in hot cross bun flavour" one fumed.
