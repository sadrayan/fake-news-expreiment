Trump has called the probe a "witch hunt" and has repeatedly denied any improper coordination or contact with Russian officials.

It's not yet known if Trump will raise the issue of Russia's meddling during the meeting.

Indeed it's not clear what the two men will discuss when they meet later this week, though the ongoing civil war in Syria is almost certain to come up. Russia backs the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad in that conflict, while the U.S. supports rebel groups.
