The House Science Committee staff informed me that you may have some questions regarding the legislative vehicle that was used for the FY14 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. Feel free to use the following on the record, from me.

This bill was a product of both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, and was sponsored by Chairman Hal Rogers in the House.

Because of House rules and procedures, including the Constitutional requirement that tax and revenue bills start in the House and not the Senate, House Leadership used a separate piece of legislation as the vehicle for the Omnibus bill. This allowed the bill to be considered and passed in an expedited fashion, in order to avoid a government shut-down or a lapse in funding for critical programs and services. At the time, only one bill – originally sponsored by Chairman Smith – met the procedural requirements to be used in this fashion. It was used purely as a vehicle, and in no way reflected the original content of Chairman’s Smith’s underlying legislation.
