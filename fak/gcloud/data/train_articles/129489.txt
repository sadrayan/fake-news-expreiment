Food Lion Coupon Basics

Food Lion does not double coupons.

They have no limits on number of total number of coupons they will take, unless specified in the ad. You may only use a maximum of 10 (ten) coupons for the same item per customer. This includes coupons that are downloaded onto your personal MVP Card.

BOGO items ring up at half price so if you only buy 1, it rings at half price. You can use a coupon on each BOGO sale item.

You cannot use Food Lion store coupons and manufacturer's coupons on the same item. "Stacking" coupons like that is not allowed per the Food Lion coupon policy.

You can see their entire coupon policy on their website HERE.

The ad indicates that prices are valid for stores in these cities: Apex, Bunn, Cary, Clayton, Franklinton, Fuquay-Varina, Garner, Holly Springs, Knightdale, Louisburg, Morrisville, Raleigh, Rolesville, Wake Forest, Wendell, Youngsville, Zebulon. If you do not live in one of these cities, your ad may be different and you can check for any differences on FoodLion.com.

E-Coupons: You can now load RedPlum.com manufacturer’s coupons to your Food Lion MVP card and when they scan your card at the register and you buy the qualifying items, the discount will come off automatically. I spoke with corporate and they confirmed that these are manufacturer’s coupons and not to be combined with paper manufacturer’s from the newspaper and other sources. She said their policy is only 1 coupon per product. No e-coupons will double. Click HERE for more information.

Quality Guarantee: Food Lion offers a double money back quality guarantee on all Food Lion store brands.
