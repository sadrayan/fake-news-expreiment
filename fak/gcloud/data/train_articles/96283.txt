VISIT NCICAP.ORG] MIKE: TODAY ON "UPFRONT," THE DEMOCRATS’ WIDE OPEN RACE FOR GOVERNOR. AND THE CANDIDATE WHO SAYS HE’S THE CLEAR FRONTRUNNER. NEXT, TONY EVERS ON HIS CAMPAIGN, FOXCONN, AND THE STATE TAX CREDIT HE’D TRY TO GET RID OF. PLUS, THE FORMER ARMY GREEN BERET SEEKING THE SEAT IN WISCONSIN’S FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. AND, IS WISCONSIN’S CONSERVATION LEGACY AT RISK? HOW A GROUP OF RETIRED NATURAL RESOURCES EXPERTS SAY THEY’RE TRYING TO KEEP IT ALIVE. ♪ ANNOUNCER: COVERING THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO WISCONSIN, THIS IS "UPFRONT WITH MIKE GOUSHA." MIKE: HELLO AGAIN, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO "UPFRONT." WE BEGIN TODAY WITH THE DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR GOVERNOR, AND A CLAIM THAT IT’S REALLY TWO-PERSON RACE NOW. AS YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS HAVE A LARGE FIELD OF CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR THIS YEAR, ALL HOPING TO RIDE A WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM AND DEFEAT REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. BUT FIRST, THEY HAVE TO GET THROUGH THE AUGUST PRIMARY. LAST WEEK, MADISON MAYOR PAUL SOGLIN TOLD OUR EDITORIA PARTNER, WISPOLITICS.COM, THAT A POLL DONE FOR HIS CAMPAIGN SHO A HORSE RACE BETWEEN HIM AND STATE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT TONY EVERS. THE POLL DONE BY DEMOCRATIC FIRM FM THREE RESEARCH SHOWS EVERS LEADING WITH 30% AND SOGLIN AT 17%. BUT, WHEN RESPONDENTS WERE READ DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CANDIDATES, DESCRIPTIONS THAT WEREN’T RELEASED TO THE MEDIA, MEDIA--SUPPORT CHANGED TO 25% FOR EVERS. AND 23% FOR SOGLIN. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE OF THE RACE TODAY WITH CANDIDATE TONY EVERS. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE POLL TH? TONY CERTAINLY THE 30% IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER POLLS. WE SHOWED A 10 POINT OR MORE LEAD IN EVERY SINGLE POLL. THE SECOND PART OF IT WHERE IT BECOMES A HORSE RACE, ALL OF THE DATA WAS RELEASED THAT THERE’S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY DESCRIPTION AND HIS DESCRIPTION. I THINK IT IS A ONE-PERSON RACE. WHEN YOU HAVE A 10 POINT LEAD -- LAST TIME, I WON 72 COUNTIES. I THINK IT IS A ONE-PERSON RACE. MIKE: THAT IS A PRETTY BOLD STATEMENT. TONY: 10 POINTS IS 10 POINTS. WE ARE CRISSCROSSING THE STATE. WE ARE WORKING HARD, RAISING MONEY. I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO WIN. MIKE: YOU ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT PAUL SOGLIN? TONY: THEY ARE ALL GREAT PEOPLE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU LOOK AT OUR DIFFERENCES ON DIFFERENT ISSUES, IT’S NOT MUCH. IT’S WHO CAN BEAT SCOTT WALKER. I’M THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS WON THREE STATEWIDE RACES. MIKE: THE ISSUES -- INSTEAD OF FORUMS WITH NINE PEOPLE. TONY: WHEN PEOPLE ARE ADDED TO THE MIX, IT BRINGS OUT NEW IDEAS. IT IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION. FOR THE CONSUMER, VOTERS OF THE STATE, IT MAKES IT MORE COMPLEX TO HAVE THAT MANY. LET’S HAVE AT IT. I WILL CONTINUE FOCUSING MY EFFORTS TO BEAT SCOTT WALKER. MIKE: AT THE EVENT LAST WEEK, PAUL SOGLIN TALKED ABOUT RAISING INCOME TAXES TO PAY FOR IT EDUCATION, A GAS TAX INCREASE, INDEXING THE GAS TAX. YOU’VE TALKED ABOUT MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION. ARE YOU WILLING TO LOOK AT TAX INCREASES? TONY: POSSIBLY. I WOULD FIRST LOOK AT THE TAX CREDITS IN MANUFACTURING AND AGRICULTURE. THAT’S A LOT OF MONEY THAT WENT INTO THAT. IT DIRECTS MONEY OUT OF THE COFFERS OF THE STATE. A LOT OF CORPORATE LEADERS GOT LOTS OF MONEY. TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS HAS NEVER WORKED. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING, WHETHER IT’S TAX CREDITS OR INCREASING THE GAS TAX. WE CAN’T BE LAST IN THE COUNTRY ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND THINK WE DON’T NEED TO FIX IT. MIKE: THE REPUBLICANS WERE ALREADY BANGING AWAY AT PAUL SOGLIN SAYING HERE WE GO, WE WILL START TAXING PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN. IF YOU LOOK AT ADDITIONAL REVENUE, WILL YOU GET HIT WITH THAT PRETTY HARD? TONY: ABSOLUTELY. LAST TIME AFTER SCOTT WALKER PLAYED SANTA CLAUS, WE’VE GONE TO REFERENDUM -- ALMOST 85% PASSED THIS LAST ELECTION TO RAISE THEIR OWN TAXES. IF WE DO HAVE TO RAISE THE REVENUE IN SOME FASHION, I WOULD PREFER LOOKING FOR OTHER WAYS TO DO IT FIRST. PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR CERTAIN THINGS. EDUCATION IS A TOP PRIORITY. WE WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THE OPTIONS, NOT JUST SAYING WE WILL RAISE TAXES. MIKE: BRING ME UP-TO-DATE ON FOXCONN. YOU SAID THIS IS A HAIL MARY. YOUR POSITION ISN’T THAT YOU’RE GOING TO TRY TO END THE DEAL. TONY: I DON’T THINK WE CAN, LEGALLY. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN B. IT WAS A BAD DEAL. WE SPENT WAY TOO MUCH MONEY. IF THEY DO BREAK GROUND, THERE’S LOTS OF PEOPLE IN MILWAUKEE THAT NEED GOOD JOBS THAT ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS ALREADY. THAT $5 BILLION FOR FOXCONN, WHY CAN’T THAT BE PUT TOWARDS TRANSPORTATION? WHAT KIND OF LIVING WAGE ARE YOU GOING TO PAY? THEY COULD PUT SOLAR PANELS ON THEIR ROOF AND GENERATE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO SERVICE 33,000 HOMES IN SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN. IF IT’S GOING TO HAPPEN, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE THE BEST CORPORATE CITIZENS. MIKE: DO YOU THINK TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL COULD JEOPARDIZE THE DEAL? TONY: IT’S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO UNDO THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, I’M NOT SURE THEY EVER CARED ABOUT THAT. WE CAN MAKE SOME HEADWAY IN MAKING SURE THEY’RE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. IF YOU DIG DEEP INTO THEIR DOCUMENTS ONLINE, THEY ARE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE. WHAT AN IRONY WE HAVE HERE. PEOPLE WHO DON’T LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE ARE GIVING $5 BILLION TO PEOPLE WHO THINK THERE IS CLIMATE CHANGE. MIKE: THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN’S DECISION NOT TO RUN FOR REELECTION HAS SCRAMBLED THE RACE IN THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. COMING UP NEXT, THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE WHO WAS IN, WITH OR WITHOUT RYAN. AND LATER, AN EARTH DAY LOOK AT WISCONSIN’S CONSERVATION TRADITION. IS IT CHANGING?
