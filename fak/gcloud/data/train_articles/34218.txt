Exempts from the loss recognition provisions of this title any straddle consisting entirely of offsetting positions which are regulated futures contracts. Defines a "regulated futures contract" as a contract: (1) which requires delivery of personal property; (2) with respect to which amounts deposited and withdrawn depend on a system of marking to market; and (3) which is traded on or subject to the rules of certain boards of trade.

Limits the three-year carryback of losses from regulated futures contracts to an amount which: (1) does not exceed the lesser of the capital gain net income from regulated futures contracts or all of the capital gain net income; and (2) does not increase or produce a net operating loss.

Provides that obligations of the United States, a State or local government, or U.S. possession issued on a discount basis and payable without interest in less than one year shall be treated as capital assets in determining tax consequences of gain or loss with respect to such obligations.
