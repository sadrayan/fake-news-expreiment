Segment 2, beginning at 23:59: Documentary tells the story of immigration and the acceptance of diversity in Garden City, Kansas.

Filmmaker Stephen Lerner's latest work is "Strangers in Town." Lerner explained how thousands of migrant workers arrived in Garden City, Kansas in 1980 looking for a better opportunity with employement at the world's largest beef-packing plant. His film shows how the influx of immigrants changed the town dramatically as both locals and foreign-born residents adjusted.
