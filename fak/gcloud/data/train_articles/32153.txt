City Colleges plan to lay off 225
City Colleges of Chicago will lay off 225 people as it consolidates administrative services for the seven campuses, officials said Thursday.

Teachers and other instructional positions will be spared, City Colleges Chancellor Cheryl Hyman said at a news conference with Mayor Richard Daley to unveil the community college system's proposed $457.5 million budget for next year.

Sixty people will be fired at the district office and 165 more will be laid off at the individual colleges. An additional 86 vacant administrative positions will be eliminated, Hyman said.

No layoffs have happened yet, but Hyman said they are part of her plan to hold down costs in the next year. They will likely take place over the next three months, according to City Colleges Vice Chancellor Ken Gotsch.

Gery Chico, chairman of the City Colleges board of trustees, said school officials have also reined in "lax" credit card spending policies and cut travel expenses by 40 percent to further trim spending.

Despite the layoffs, the proposed budget is about $40 million bigger than this year's version. Officials attributed the increase to a 9 percent enrollment increase in the past year. That has led to $19 million more in federal aid, a $10 million increase in state funding for adult education and $11 million in additional tuition.

City Colleges would lower its property tax levy by $3 million under the plan, to $123 million.
