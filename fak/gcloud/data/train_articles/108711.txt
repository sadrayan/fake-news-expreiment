Hunting Age Requirements for Each State
Some states have no hunting age requirements for big game hunting, but most states have a minimum hunting age requirement for young hunters. Be sure to research the big hunting game laws in your state for any and all requirements for getting young hunters in the field.

Most states require some sort of hunter education course and firearms safety instruction is a must. Every youth hunter should be familiar with the firearm and it’s safety before venturing out to hunt.
