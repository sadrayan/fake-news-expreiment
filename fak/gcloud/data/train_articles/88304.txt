Romney's car elevator cost $55,000
From the Department of Unhelpful News Items comes this local TV report on Mitt Romney's La Jolla home and the car elevator he's building:

"The nice thing about this is that at the grade level it looks like a regular garage floor," said Cheryl Nauman, an employee at American Custom Lifts. "When you hit a button, another comes up."

Brad Davies created the sophisticated car elevator. His shop, American Custom Lifts, is located in downtown Escondido, but he has installed the lifts in homes around the world."

We just recently installed one in London," Davies said. "We have one in New Zealand [and] Norway. We have quite a few in Canada."

Clients include actor Harrison Ford and singer Britney Spears. Now, presidential hopeful Mitt Romney wants to install a Phantom Park in his La Jolla home. First, Romney will bulldoze the current 3,000-square-foot home and build one that is 11,000 square feet. The basement alone will be 3,600 square feet and is planned to have a Phantom Park in it to store his cars.

"For the cost of the lift, delivery and installedâ€¦ it's about $55,000," Davies said.
