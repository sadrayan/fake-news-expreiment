Donald Trump Floats New Campaign Strategy: Murder
Nothing can stop Donald Trump, according to Donald Trump—not even cold-blooded murder.

In an effort to demonstrate how dedicated his supporters are, Trump said at a rally at Dordt College in Iowa on Friday that even if he were to shoot someone, his voters would still support him:

“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, okay, and I wouldn’t lose any voters, okay? It’s, like, incredible.”

Trump’s metaphor has much in common with the way that lemmings will follow one another off cliffs. Here is that moment again, complete with finger-gun movement:

"I could stand in the middle of 5th Ave and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters." #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/BMf7VHq2LB — Eric Hoteham (@erichoteham) January 23, 2016

Interestingly, murder has not always been a key tenet of the Trump campaign. Just last December, Trump said that he would not, against his best instincts, murder journalists who did their jobs well. What a difference a month makes!
