Howdy from Austin, Texas. I write because I’m interested in your November 2012 post speaking to “wrinkly” has beens. Did you originate this language? This has come up because we’re checking on if a Texas member of Congress used similar words or not. Any guidance there?

Thank you for a quick reply.

I remember coming up with the term, "wrinkly has-been" for that article. I'm a descriptive writer who also happens to be seeing a few wrinkles in my own mirror.

Let me know if I can be of further help.

Thanks!
