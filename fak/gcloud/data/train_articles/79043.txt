FRPP Summary Report Library

The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) Summary Report Library provides copies of all FRPP and Worldwide Inventory Summary Reports and datasets GSA has published since 1997. Prior to 2005, GSA published the Worldwide Inventory, a database in which agencies voluntarily submitted their real property inventories.

These reports summarize the data agencies submit about the federal governmentâ€™s inventory of land, building, and structure assets, as of September 30th of each year.
