Bennet Statement on Official End to War in Iraq
Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet today released the following statement on the official end of the Iraq War:

"After nine long years, $1 trillion spent and 1 million service members deployed, Americans and Coloradans welcome the responsible end to the war in Iraq. Our troops have performed bravely and effectively in Iraq and accomplished everything that was asked of them: securing communities and creating the space for democratic change to take root. Our gratitude for their service and the service of hundreds of thousands of civilians, and the sacrifice of all their families, cannot be overstated.

"As we welcome the formal end of this war, we must also remember our obligation to provide returning troops with benefits and support they have earned and deserve. And we must never forget to properly honor the sacrifice of the brave men and women who unfortunately never made it home.

"While America must always remain a committed partner to a stable and secure Iraq, it is now time for the Iraqi people to assume responsibility for the future of their country and their democracy."
