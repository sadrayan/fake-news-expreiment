UAE approves appeal process for terror list disputes
Decree is issued to allow organisations to appeal against inclusion on UAE's list of terrorist groups

The UAE has issued a decree to allow organisations to appeal against inclusion on its list of terrorist groups which was set up last year to help combat terror-related crimes.

The UAE's Cabinet has approved plans to allow groups to submit appeals to the Ministry of Justice, according to a list of set procedures.

The Ministry will then refer the request to the Supreme National Security Council for further consideration, news agency WAM reported.

The Ministry of Justice will then inform the group of the cabinetâ€™s final decision.

The move comes after the largest US-based Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation met recently with US government officials in a bid to overturn a ruling by the UAE to add it to a list of terrorist groups.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said in December that its representatives met with US government officials about the recent move to add CAIR and the Muslim American Society (MAS) to the blacklist.

On Friday it was reported that CAIR civil rights litigation director Jenifer Wicks has submitted documents this week seeking to appeal the designation.

The Emirates included CAIR on a list of 83 groups it considers terrorist organisations made public on November 15 which also includes high profile names such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda, the Nusra Front and ISIL.
