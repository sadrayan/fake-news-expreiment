12 April 2017 S/2017/315 France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America Russia Russian deputy envoy to the Security Council, Vladimir Safronkov: The primary problem was the fact that the draft resolution by the troika designated the guilty party prior to an independent and objective investigation.[2]

8 October 2016 S/2016/846 Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America Russia Russian Foreign Ministry: The text of the document, which was obviously drawn up with Washington's encouragement directly after the United States refused to observe the Russian-US agreements on the Syrian settlement, flagrantly misrepresented the actual state of affairs and had a politically-charged and unbalanced character. The French-proposed document indiscriminately laid the blame for the escalation of tensions in the Syrian Arab Republic solely on the country's authorities and plainly attempted, through a ban on military flights over the city of Aleppo, to afford protection to Jabhat al-Nusra terrorists and the militants that have merged with it, despite the UN member states' obligation to fight the terrorist threat with all available means. The draft resolution completely obscured the fact that the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo was provoked deliberately, when in August and September the militants refused to provide access to humanitarian convoys, threatening to open fire on them. At the same time, the document ignored the need to promptly initiate an intra-Syrian political process, which is being sabotaged by the same Syrian opposition members who are supported and covered by the West in every possible way.[3]

22 May 2014 S/2014/348 Reaffirms its strong condemnation of the widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities and pro-government militias, as well as the human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law by non-State armed groups.

Refer the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic described in paragraph 1 above since March 2011 to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Albania, Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Bulgaria, Canada, Central African Republic, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Ivory Coast, Japan, Jordan, Latvia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Samoa, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Seychelles, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UAE, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States China, Russia Wang Min (Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of China to the UN):

Any action seeking referral to the International Criminal Court should be based on the premise of respect for the judicial sovereignty of States and the principle of complementarity. Historically, China had always held reservations about referring situations to the Court. Although current efforts to seek a political solution were experiencing difficulties, the international community must remain patient. [4]

Any action seeking referral to the International Criminal Court should be based on the premise of respect for the judicial sovereignty of States and the principle of complementarity. Historically, China had always held reservations about referring situations to the Court. Although current efforts to seek a political solution were experiencing difficulties, the international community must remain patient. Vitaly Churkin (Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN):

although the motivations of delegations supporting the draft resolution and their emotions are understandable, it was difficult to understand France's motivation since that delegation had been fully aware of the end result of tabling the text draft. "P5" unity had been demonstrated through concrete positive results like resolutions 2118 on the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, or resolution 2139 on humanitarian issues. "Why deal a blow to the P5 in this case?"[4]

19 July 2012 S/2012/538 Commend the United Nation's Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) personnel for their continued efforts in a dangerous and volatile environment.

Cease troop movements towards population centres, and all use of heavy weapons in such centres.

Decide that, if the Syrian authorities have not fully complied with paragraph above within ten days, then it shall impose immediately measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter (complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations[5]). France, Germany, Portugal, United Kingdom, United States China, Russia Li Baodong (Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China to the UN):

The draft resolution, however, was counter-productive, as it had uneven content that put pressure on only one party, which would only derail the issue from the track of political settlement and undermine regional peace and stability.[6] Vitaly Churkin (Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN):

Instead of levelling insinuations against the Russian Federation, which throughout the conflict had provided key support for the Annan mission, those members had today made "unacceptable statements". They could have done something to promote dialogue with their Syrian counterparts, rather than fan the flames of conflict, including of Syrian terrorist groups, as they furthered their own "geopolitical designs".[6]

4 February 2012 S/2012/77 Supports the Plan of Action of the League of Arab States of 2 November 2011 and its decision of 22 January 2012.

Requests the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of this resolution, in consultation with the League of Arab States, within 21 days after its adoption.

Reviews implementation of this resolution within 21 days and, in the event of non-compliance, to consider further measures. Bahrain, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States China, Russia Li Baodong (Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China to the UN)):

The country's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity must be respected and he asked for the respect of the Syrian people for a reform process that was in their own interest.[7] Vitaly Churkin (Permanent Representative of Russia to the UN):

The draft resolution voted down today sought to send an "unbalanced" message to Syria, and it did not accurately reflect the situation there. No proposal had been made to end attacks by armed groups, or their association with extremists.[7]
