Yeti Coolers Ends Relationship with NRA
FLORIDA — Another company has cut ties with the NRA—Outdoor sportsmen company YETI has officially ended its relationship with the gun advocacy group.

The NRA released a statement announcing the decision (via WJXT).

“Suddenly, without prior notice, YETI has declined to do business with The NRA Foundation saying they no longer wish to be an NRA vendor, and refused to say why. They will only say they will no longer sell products to The NRA Foundation. That certainly isn’t sportsmanlike. In fact, YETI should be ashamed. They have declined to continue helping America’s young people enjoy outdoor recreational activities. These activities enable them to appreciate America and enjoy our natural resources with wholesome and healthy

outdoor recreational and educational programs.”

The organization has been the focus of intense criticism in the aftermath of high-profile shootings, such as the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.

YETI has not released an official statement.
