Campaign to make tax fair
Show all pages in section Hide

You’ve heard about tax dodging companies like Starbucks1 and Amazon2 in the UK. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Every year, unfair international tax rules let companies dodge billions of pounds of tax in developing countries – tax that could pay for essential services like schools and hospitals.

Ending tax dodging

Together with the countries most affected, we’ve been campaigning to end tax dodging so that poorer countries can stop losing out on these vital funds. With fairer tax rules, the citizens of these countries could finally have the decent access to healthcare and education that is everyone’s right.

A fair tax system means everyone pays their fair share – big companies included. It’s time to make tax fair. Everywhere.
