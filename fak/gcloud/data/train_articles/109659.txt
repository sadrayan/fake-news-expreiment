Abu Nidal

Arabic: 'abū nidal

Real name: Sabri al-Banna













(1937-2002) Palestinian politician and guerilla leader.

Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, has for the last 25 years been one of the figures in the Middle East who most often changed sides. He has cooperated with the leaders of Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Libya. He has always been a controversial figure, and since his forces have proven valuable (if dangerous) for many leaders, his career has been dominated by both expulsions and invitations.

Abu Nidal has also been responsible for terrorist attacks outside the Middle East. In recent years Abu Nidal has been far less active, primarily because he has not had the willing employers he had before. History
