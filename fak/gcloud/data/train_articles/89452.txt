The 2014 election is less than 11 months away, and in Rhode Island all eyes will be on the hotly contested race to succeed Lincoln Chafee as governor. Understandably, that contest will drive the news cycle and will be what the political pundits and experts are dissecting throughout the year. This will ultimately render the election for federal offices an afterthought in most voters� minds, especially considering that no serious challengers have yet to emerge to take on Sen. Jack Reed or Representatives James Langevin and David Cicilline.

That is unfortunate. Assuming that the federal delegation remains intact after the 2014 elections, Rhode Island could well find itself with a complete loss of influence at the federal level. With President Obama�s approval ratings plummeting and Obamacare turning out to be an albatross on Democratic candidates throughout most of the country, Republicans are almost guaranteed to maintain and add to their House majority and primed to gain the necessary six seats in the Senate to take over that chamber.

If this happens as many predict, it would be the first time since the 83rd Congress of 1953-55 that Rhode Island would have an all-Democratic delegation in a Senate and House of Representatives controlled by Republicans.

To make matters even worse, the Democrat-led Senate recently weakened the filibuster rules in that chamber. While this greatly reduces the power of the Republican minority in the Senate for now, the shoe may well be on the other foot if the Democrats find themselves in the minority after November. Thus, Senator Reed would find that his voice held far less sway than it did the last time he was in the minority in the Senate.

For the smallest state in the nation with one of the highest unemployment rates, the last thing Rhode Island can afford is to have what will amount to phantom representation in Washington.

To see what a lack of influence looks like, one need look no further than Representative Cicilline�s record in Congress. Of the 20 bills Cicilline has sponsored in his three years in office, not a single one has advanced past the embryonic committee stage. This is a testament to the lack of effectiveness a backbencher in the minority party has in Congress.

If the Senate does indeed become Republican, Senators Reed and Whitehouse would find themselves in much the same unenviable position as Rhode Island�s minority-party congressmen.

This is exactly why Rhode Island�s recent trend of electing only Democrats to its federal delegation poses such significant risk. Where the national mood does not match up with Rhode Island�s mood, there exists the very real possibility that Rhode Island will find itself in the minority and without an effective voice in Washington advocating for its interests.

While the platform of effective influence in Washington may not be the most inspiring of campaign slogans, the practical fact is that Rhode Island voters must consider the dangers of continuing to vote for an all-Democrat federal delegation in the face of the real possibility that it will result in influence lost for a state that needs effective representation in the federal government.
