What Matthew McConaughey is Saying About Mormons
Actor Matthew McConaughey’s comments about the Mormon religion is one of the top stories today with the actor defending Mormons against an interviewer who made disparaging comments about them.

The interview took place on a podcast earlier today when the subject of religion came up. The interviewer, who is an atheist, was making fun of religion in general but when he began to disparage Mormons in particular, McConaughey stepped in:

“I don’t know, Ben, I don’t think I’ve ever had a reason to say anything negative about Mormons. I mean, I know you’re just having some fun here but – from my experience – Mormons are some of the most decent people I’ve ever come across.

Some of my neighbors, growing up, were Mormon and they were ideal neighbors, ya know? Their kids were like really, really nice and well-behaved and all of that. Honestly, I don’t know how you could say anything negative about them?

And every Mormon I’ve ever met since that time has been just like that. I’m not even saying anything about their religion. I’m just saying that they’re obviously doing some right, ok!” McConaughey said laughing.

He added later, “If all of my neighbors were Mormon now I would sleep very comfortably at night.”
