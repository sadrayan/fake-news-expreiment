Mayweather beats McGregor - as it happened
What a night / morning it has been.

On the undercard, Nathan Cleverly lost his WBA light-heavyweight title, but Savannah Marshall made a winning start to her professional career, before Gervonta Davis won, although he he had lost his IBF super-featherweight title the day before when he failed to make the weight.

And the main event did not disappoint. Many gave Conor McGregor no chance, but he made a bright start, before Floyd Mayweather's experience and skill proved crucial as he stamped his authority on the fight before forcing a stoppage in the 10th round.
