Hillary's Cash Cows And Other Sweet Deals
THE TAX RETURNS RELEASED last week by the White House contain no smoking gun. But according to Marvin A. Chirelstein of Columbia University Law School, they do contain clear evidence that Hillary Clinton made a financial killing in a sweetheart deal in cattle futures. The deal in itself was legal-but Chirelstein says Mrs. Clinton never put up any money of her own. Because it was arranged by a lawyer for Tyson Foods, a major player in Arkansas, it smacks of political favoritism. "It's one of those things somebody gets put into a good thing," Chirelstein said. "It's harmless, but it doesn't look wonderful, does it?"

Chirelstein is one of four outside experts chosen by the White House to brief reporters on the Clintons' 1977, 1978 and 1979 tax returns. The Clintons made $98,977-$26,541 in 1978 and $72,436 in 1979-by trading in commodity futures. The trades were made at the step-by-step direction of James Blair, a Clinton friend and an outside counsel for Tyson Foods. Chirelstein says that the Clintons piggybacked on Blair's brokerage account.

Blair and the Clintons' lawyer, David Kendall, have told The New York Times that Mrs. Clinton had her own brokerage account and that she assumed real financial risk in the deal. Chirelstein says he saw no evidence of hard risk. "There weren't any checks," he says. "This fellow Blair seems to have said, 'You can have a fractional interest in my trading in these cattle futures. If I make money, you get a share. If I lose, you have to take your share of the loss'."

Chirelstein said he knows of no contract that required Mrs. Clinton to repay such a loss, which means her "investment" could be considered by some to be a gift. Republicans are bound to wonder whether Blair. whose business interests were dependent on state government, would ever have demanded that a loss be covered.

Chirelstein also said that James McDougal, chairman of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and the Clintons' partner in Whitewater Development Corp., assumed the Clintons' share of Whitewater interest payments three years after they went in business together. As a result. the Clintons essentially paid no part of Whitewater costs from 1981 to 1990. Although documents released by the White House indicate the Clintons paid $7,826 in Whitewater interest and taxes between 1981 and 1990, Chirelstein says these payments covered the costs of a model home built on the Whitewater tract-a house the Clintons sold at a small profit.

The bottom line, in Chirelstein's tally, is that Clinton is still overstating his Whitewater investment. Clinton has revised the figure downward, from $68,880 to $46,636. Chirelstein says the real total is no more than $38,809-and if he's right, the Clintons had two sweetheart deals back to back.

Bill and Hillary Clinton's tax returns for 1977,1978 and 1979 contain some clues about why they have been reluctant to make them available to the public. The returns show that the Clintons' adjusted income rose sharply-from $41,731 to $158,495-during those years, and that much of it came from trading in cattle futures. Interest payments on Whitewater, a deduction, helped reduce their tax bill. Selected details:
