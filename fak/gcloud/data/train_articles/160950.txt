After Memorial Day shoppers complained about PacSun's upside-down flag T-shirt, the retailer decided to pull the controversial item.

In a statement shared on Facebook, PacSun said it's immediately removing the shirt from its stores and website "out of respect for those who have put their lives on the line for our country." Here's the excerpt:

As a retailer grounded in youth culture, PacSun values artistic and creative expression through the brands that we sell in our stores. Out of respect for those who have put their lives on the line for our country, we have decided to stop selling the licensed flag t-shirt and are removing it from our stores and website immediately. We thank the men and women in uniform for their extraordinary service.

The link to purchase the shirt, which was apparently designed in a collaboration with rapper A$AP Rocky, now redirects to the PacSun homepage.

Many customers took to social media over the holiday weekend to complain about how the graphic on the shirt is "disrespectful," "disgusting" and "insulting," because an upside-down flag is an unofficial signal of distress. As members of the military know, flags are only meant to be flown this way "in instances of extreme danger to life or property," according to the U.S. Flag Code.
