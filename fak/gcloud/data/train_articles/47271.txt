4 Takeaways From The Times’s Interview With Paul Ryan
WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan participated in a TimesTalks conversation in Washington on Thursday. He discussed the coming tax overhaul effort, immigration, this week’s surprise debt limit deal and what it’s like to work with President Trump.

Here are the takeaways.

Disagreeing without being disagreeable.

From dealing with the debt ceiling to cutting corporate taxes, it was clear on Thursday that Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump disagree on a wide variety of issues. It was also evident that their fortunes are tied and that Mr. Ryan will continue to do his best to cast their differences in a positive light.

A day after calling Democrats’ debt ceiling proposal “ridiculous,” Mr. Ryan empathized with Mr. Trump, saying he was seeking a bipartisan moment in the face of crises.

Mr. Ryan struck a similar tone on taxes as he called Mr. Trump’s hope for a 15 percent corporate tax rate unrealistic. Rather than focus on their differences, Mr. Ryan emphasized that Mr. Trump wants to get the rate as low as possible.
