Las Vegas mogul Sheldon Adelson is the latest big name contributor to anti-pot effort
An ABC15 analysis of state campaign finance data shows that millions of dollars continue to pour into Proposition 205, which would legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona.

Among those contributors -- Las Vegas mogul Sheldon Adelson. The CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which includes properties such as The Venetian and The Palazzo, contributed $500,000 against the initiative on Oct. 20.

Adelson could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

Overall, more than $8.5 million has been spent both for and against Prop. 205 so far.

The charts below show how much each side of Prop. 205 has received so far. NOTE -- contributions smaller than $10,000 from September 20 to today have not yet been published, likely making both totals higher.
