Old Slave Mart Museum

This 'Slave Mart', now a museum, sits near what was the wharf area over 100 years ago .. a convenient location from which to traffic in slavery. The cobblestone streets are said to be made of stones from Belgium that were carried as ballast in the ships. The beemer was an unfortunate obstacle in this particular photo.
