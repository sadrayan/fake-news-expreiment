Man killed his wife after she refused to have sex with him for 52 years
Fellsmere, FL | A 76-year-old Florida man killed his wife in their home and subsequently called 911 admitting to the crime he had just committed.

Albert Fiddler, 76, called 911 and coldly admitted to shooting his wife 52 times with a Remington 870 shotgun for “every year she wouldn’t give me any sex,” he told the operator.

The Indian River County Police Department received a call at approximately 8:14 a.m. from the man, who said he shot the victim because she refused to have sex with him since 1966.

Albert Fiddler, 76, and Emma W. Fiddler, 70, were about to celebrate their 52 years of marriage this week before the gruesome murder occurred.

“I’m not surprised at all this happened. No sex for 52 years? I can’t really blame the old man” one neighbor told reporters.

“His wife often ridiculed him about it in public, saying that castration was the only way to ‘keep your dog on a leash’ ” another neighbor reported.

Police responded to the house and found the body of the 70-year-old woman with multiple gunshot wounds to her chest and genitals.

Police determined the victim to be the wife of the alleged killer.

The man was arrested at the scene and the case is under investigation.
