Swedish Man Diagnosed With Heavy Metal Addiction
In news that gives new meaning to the title of Quiet Riot 's classic Metal Health LP, NME reports that Swedish doctors have diagnosed what seems to be the world's first official case of heavy metal addiction.

Headbanging medical marvel Roger Tullgren shared his long struggle with reporters, saying, "I have been trying for 10 years to get this classified as a handicap. I spoke to three psychologists and they finally agreed that I needed this to avoid being discriminated against."

Tullgren's diagnosis means he will now be eligible for disability benefits, as well as special clearance to indulge his metal side at work. "I signed a form saying: 'Roger feels compelled to show his heavy metal style. This puts him in a difficult situation on the labor market. Therefore he needs extra financial help,'" he said. "So now I can turn up at a job interview dressed in my normal clothes and just hand the interviewers this piece of paper."

It might sound funny, but some researchers have suggested that music addiction is actually a real thing , and triggered by the same dopamine dependency that underlies other addictions â€” which may add a layer of irony to the use of music therapy in addiction recovery.

NME adds that Tullgren, who claims to have attended roughly 300 concerts in 2014 on a part-time dishwasher's salary, will be permitted to wear what he wants to work, take time off for shows and play music on the job. Meanwhile, we're sure some screenwriter is already adapting Tullgren's tale into the script for a new Jack Black comedy.
