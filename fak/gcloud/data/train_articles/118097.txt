Disciples of the New Dawn, threaten to burn Pagans
You may remember a violent hate page on Facebook back in August of 2013 that was threatening Pagans (articles about them can be found here and here), well there is a new page doing the exact same thing and being just as blunt about it. They are called the Disciples of the New Dawn. To be honest, when you first read some of their memes it is hard to believe that what they are saying is real to them and that this isn’t some sort of joke page. The sad fact of the matter is that they are very really and their followers actually believe what is being said on their site.

The Disciples of the New Dawn claim to have been established in 1956 and is run by Father Patrick Oliver Embry. Although it is not clear where Father Patrick Oliver Embry or the Disciples of the New Dawn but what is clear is that they are violent and actually suggest killing Pagans by burning them. On one of their memes that they have created about the Burning Times it reads “GOD's law is absolute, his commandments are not to be disputed. It may seem harsh but the reality is that witches ruin lives. They summon demons and cast visitations and curses upon innocent Christians, especially little children. We must purge our society of such wicked people by any and all means necessary, we ignore GOD's Word at our own peril.” and they have added a comment to it saying “Let's bring it back and enforce God's law.” This is a clear threat, yet Facebook allows the Disciples of the New Dawn page to remain, at least for the time being.

In the video that is included with this article you will the memes that they have posted up to today and screen shots of the page itself depicting its hate an violence, not to mention their clear lack of knowledge about what Paganism is and what it is that they are actually against. Repeatedly on the page they say things like Pagans are Devil worshipers and that you should keep an eye on your children this time of the year because Pagans are going to kidnap them and sacrifice them for Yule. It is disturbing, at best, that there are people in this world that are so set on destruction and hate that they would follow a man like Father Patrick Oliver Embry or anything posted by Disciples of the New Dawn.

As you might expect, Pagans across the world are commenting on this page and reporting it for the violence that it suggests. It is up to you what you choose to do with this information. Here are links to their pages:
