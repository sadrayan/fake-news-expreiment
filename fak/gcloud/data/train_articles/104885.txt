America's Last Line Of Defense
Here is the real kicker. All the Outback and Texas Road House are going Vegan. To offset the lackluster sale of soybeans to Europe and China, both steak joints have joined together to make “Soy Steaks”. They are uniform in size and shape. No more steak

knives saving trees and petroleum it takes to make handles. Starting January 1, 2019, patrons will need to bring their own utensils. This will cut back on dishwashing. In 2020, the “Bring your own plates” will be instituted. Once this has been done, they can lay off 22,000 workers from the rancher, to the dishwasher. It’s gonna be just great.

If Bernard Sanders and Alicia-Bordaga-, Alabama-Havana- Cortez are elected in 2020, everything will be free. The country will be called VENEZ-USA-LA-Venezusala.

It’s gonna be just great. Oh and due to the amount of bovine wandering around, open season to hunt them will be Labor Day thru that day people once ate Turkeys. (No longer a holiday, it’s a Christian thing)

That’s it. Can’t wait for a spork full of soysteak!
