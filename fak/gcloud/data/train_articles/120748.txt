Protesters with Black Lives Matter shut down 405 Freeway in Inglewood
The demonstration was one of several across the country this weekend that focused on the fatal police shootings of two black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. Gatherings also paid tribute to the five Dallas police officers shot to death Thursday in an ambush. The gunman, Micah Johnson, said he wanted to kill white people and particularly police officers, according to Dallas authorities.
