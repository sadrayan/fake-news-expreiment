About 30 percent of registered voters participated in either the Republican or Democrat Primary on March 1. There was 19.89 percent in the Republican Primary and 10.07 percent in the Democratic primary. This was very close to, but not quite as high as 2008 when about 33 percent of registered voters participated in the primary. This time 22.54 percent of registered voters cast a ballot in the Democrat primary and 10.68 percent did so in the Republican primary.

To get a percentage number higher than 2008 based on the number of registered voters, you have to go back to 1980. 1992 came close with 29 percent of voters.
