How The Republican Field Dwindled From 17 To Donald Trump
On March 23, 2015, Ted Cruz officially kicked off the Republican presidential primary by entering the race. “I believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of America,” Cruz told students in a speech at Liberty University.

On May 3, 2016, Cruz dropped out of the race, after getting the support of millions of voters — many of them conservative — but not enough to win it. The next day, John Kasich dropped out, too, leaving just one candidate in the GOP field: presumptive nominee Donald Trump, who entered the race on June 16, 2015.

Thank you to the entire Republican field for a hard fought race. The Party is better for your efforts. — GOP (@GOP) May 4, 2016

In between Cruz’s speech and Kasich’s departure, 14 other candidates entered and exited the GOP race. Each time (with a few exceptions; sorry, Jim Gilmore) we marked the occasion with a profile of the candidate’s campaign. At each campaign’s start, we assessed its chances; when it ended, we looked back at what went wrong. Let’s rewind the wild 13-and-a-half months of the Republican presidential race:
