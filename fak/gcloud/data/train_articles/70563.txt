TV's Made in the USA Directory

Element

is an American Company. While we have many International Trade Partners and

Retail Customers, it has been a high-priority of ours to produce products in America! After 2

years of hard work and planning, we are proud to announce that Element will begin to

produce some of its large screen size TV's in the Detroit, Michigan Area – effective January

2012! To our knowledge, Element will be the only brand of TV's assembled in America. We

hope you will look and ask for these products if you are shopping for TV because America

Matters





Seura

Televisions strive to elevate luxury technologies to fine-art status, creating products that

bridge the gap between technology and décor. With innovation at the heart of the business,

Séura continues to drive its products to new and unexplored territories. Every product is

engineered and hand-crafted in Séura’s facility in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Incorporating the

latest technology into your home doesn’t mean compromising your décor. Séura’s vanishing

mirror TV provides a crisp television image and, when turned off, a fashionable mirror

remains without a hint of its technological applications. The Enhanced series and Deco Series

bathroom TV’s function as mirrors as well. The Lumination Collection lighted mirrors add a

brilliant sculptural element with impeccable style. The Storm outdoor TV is the perfect year-

round weatherproof TV Solution.

Although Element TV's are not completely Made in the USA we feel they are making a large step in bringing

back American Made TV sets and we wish to recognise them for their efforts. When buying a TV please try and

look at their products and maybe buy one assembled by a fellow American.
