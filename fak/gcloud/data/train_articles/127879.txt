George Zimmerman Sells Trayvon Martin Painting for $30,000
George Zimmerman: “Everyone has been asking what I have been doing with myself. I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences.”

George Zimmerman just can’t seem to keep himself out of the headlines. Though controversy continues to surround his name, he has once again thrust himself into the spotlight.

The 30-year-old, oft troubled man, who was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin, decided it was a good idea to paint a portrait of the teen with the words “Justice For All” transcribed in the background. It would seem that for many, “Justice For All” is exactly what Trayvon Martin did not receive.

To further muddy the waters, Zimmerman was able to garner a $30,000 bid for the painting at an online auction. The gentleman who purchased the painting released a statement to the media which read, “Zimmerman is now a part of history and I wanted to grab my piece of that. He is a very talented artist and a misunderstood, but humble man. I stand by him and hope I can purchase another one of his masterpiece’s down the road.”

The $30,000 is still a far cry from the $100,000 he received for his first painting. That painting was also the subject of controversy, as it mocked the prosecutor in his murder trial.

In a statement posted by CNN, George Zimmerman spoke about the painting, saying:

“Everyone has been asking what I have been doing with myself. I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences,” the item description for that painting read. “My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors.”

Zimmerman recently found himself in the headlines again after agreeing to a celebrity boxing match with New York rapper DMX. The event was quickly cancelled after the public began to voice their disapproval.
