Dad's super PAC injects $400,000 into new ads for son's 2nd District congressional campaign
The political action committee operated by the father of Topeka congressional candidate Steve Watkins moved to alter the complexion of the crowded Republican primary contest with a new $400,000 advertising barrage on behalf of his son, federal reports said Wednesday.

In the final weeks of the campaign ending Aug. 7, voters in the 2nd District will see much more of Watkins on television screens. The military veteran is among seven candidates seeking the GOP nomination for the U.S. House seat left open by the retirement of Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a Republican.

"This could be a huge factor in this race. There are a lot of undecided voters looking for information," said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka. "Looking at this race with seven candidates — six of them officeholders — what we haven't seen is a huge media blitz."

Kansans Can Do Anything PAC was formed in April by Steven Watkins, who is the candidate's father and a Topeka physician. The super PAC, which isn't limited by campaign contribution limits, has reported to the Federal Election Commission total contributions of $587,000 and expenditures of $469,000.

FEC records show the super PAC spent $64,000 in June on ads for the younger Watkins. Other FEC documents referenced the super PAC's investment of $174,000 for ads on July 13 and another $174,000 for an ad buy on July 19. Both went through Ax Media, of Kansas City, Mo.

On Monday, the super PAC reported to the FEC a separate ad buy of $43,000 with Ax Media and expenditure of $13,000 in ad expenses to Lamar, a company in Baton Rouge, La.

Victoria Snitsar, spokeswoman for Watkins' campaign, didn't directly address the late-campaign influence of $405,000 in aid from a single-candidate super PAC, but repeated a belief that Watkins was the most qualified candidate in the 2nd District. Watkins is the only Republican in the race who hasn't served in elective office.

"As Steve has said before, he's proud to have the support of anyone who shares his commitment to electing an outsider, not a career politician," Snitsar said.

Steven Watkins, the father, is making use of the 2010 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that provided an opening for wealthy individuals to contribute vast amounts of money in support of candidates.

Before that ruling by the nation's highest court, Watkins' father could have donated maximums of $5,000 to a PAC and $2,700 to his son's campaign.

Other candidates in the 2nd District GOP primary are Sen. Caryn Tyson, of Parker; former Rep. Doug Mays, of Topeka; Sen. Steve Fitzgerald, of Leavenworth; Rep. Kevin Jones, of Wellsville; Sen. Dennis Pyle, of Hiawatha; and Vernon Fields, a member of the Basehor City Council.

Former Rep. Paul Davis, of Lawrence, is the lone candidate for the Democratic Party's nomination in the district.
