-Megan "I just got this shirt and I just want to say that it's really great. The picture on here doesn't do it justice at all. The fabric is super comfortable and soft and the shirt looks fantastic. It's great way to spread the support of vegetarianism, too! I totally recommend this shirt."



-niki "soooo comfortable!! i have to agree with Megan though..the picture is a little confusing..doesn't quite get the point across. other than that..absolutely love it! great way to voice your opinion!!"



-Melissa Anne "...while I will agree with Megan and niki's review...I just wish I COULD NOT SEE THROUGH IT, i am a female...i just wish it was on a thicker t-shirt..."



-Megan "It would be nice if it was a little thicker"



-Gaurav Rajput "Excellent Quality and can not believe how light and soft it is. Feels Like I am not wearing one. Cheers PETA"



-Emma Lyree "Can't wait for my birthday... love animals and paul:)"



-Mckenzie "Yep just got this shirt love the quality and Paul McCartney:)"



-Lexy C. "Soo soft ! I love the picture and font on it as well, just the right size :) It is a wee bit see through, but that problem can easily be solved by wearing a light tank top under it."



-Roz "I have had this shirt for a few years and it still looks great!! It is incredibly soft and washes well (gentle cycle). I am 5'6+ and weigh 128 pounds, ordered a small and it fit perfectly. I love the looks I get whenever I wear this shirt! I will be seeing Sir Paul in concert this July and plan to wear this shirt! I also plan to order the "eat no turkey". Thought there was a "eat no pig" shirt but I no longer see it. "



-Leigh "Great shirt to promote the message. found the shirt to run a little large very comfy! "
