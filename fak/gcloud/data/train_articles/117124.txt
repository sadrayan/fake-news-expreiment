No more cookies: Kroger’s offering free piece of fruit for kids
Kroger is promoting healthy living through a new initiative that gives kids free fruit to munch on while their parents do the grocery shopping.

The Cincinnati-based grocery retailer piloted its “Free Fruit for Kids” program in several stores starting last year. Parents can grab a piece of fruit for their children to eat from the produce section.
