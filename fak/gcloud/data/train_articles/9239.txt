Welcome to the Miami-Dade County Webcast Guide!

Our webcasting system makes it possible for you to tune in to live meetings of the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners, its committees and subcommittees from your personal computer anywhere you are. To watch, you only need an Internet connection (best viewed on a high-speed connection) and Adobe Flash Player and you can follow the political process at home, at the office or even from out of town.
