(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)

Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Obama plans historic trip.

President Obama will become the first sitting U.S. president to go to Hiroshima, Japan, the White House announced today.

The trip to the site where the U.S. used an atomic bomb at the end of World War II carries symbolism for Mr. Obama, who won’t revisit the decision to attack that city and Nagasaki.

• The quiet campaign trail.

The Republicans hold primaries today in Nebraska and West Virginia, and it’s worth watching to see whether there’s any significant protest vote against Donald J. Trump. Bernie Sanders is seen as having the upper hand in West Virginia’s Democratic contest.
