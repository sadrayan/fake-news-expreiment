Average Net Price over Time for Full-Time Students, by Sector
NOTES: Estimates of net price exclude military/veterans aid, which awards relatively large amounts to a small number of students. Because information on grant aid and education tax benefits for 2018-19 is not yet available, the net price for 2018-19 is estimated based on 2017-18 financial aid data. Room and board expense in this sector refers to housing and food costs for commuter students since few community colleges provide on-campus housing.
