Crist hopes to repeal health care legislation

TAMPA - Miles from the healthcare vote, Gov. Charlie Crist still has his opinion on tonight's debate at the U.S. Capitol.

He was disappointed as it looked it would pass, he said.

The three main reasons he opposes this healthcare reform bill is that it raises taxes, raises premiums and cuts significantly into Medicare, he said.

Crist, a Republican who was in Tampa tonight attending the closing ceremony for the Gasparilla International Film Festival, said he hopes to get elected senator in November to help repeal the bill and bring a commonsense approach to healthcare reform.

"What people really want when it comes to health care, in my view, is they want greater access and less cost," Crist said.

"We just need to get it right and do it right," Crist said. "Do it right for the people."
