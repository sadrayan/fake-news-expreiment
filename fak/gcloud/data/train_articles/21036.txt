Nikki Haley’s condo at the UN is saving you money
UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has the easiest commute in town.

She’s currently renting a condo at 50 United Nations Plaza, which is also apparently saving the US government money.

“The US Mission [to the UN] leases Ambassador Haley’s residence at a considerable costs savings from our prior residence at the Waldorf-Astoria,” says a Mission spokesperson.

Her sprawling residence has also been used to host official functions.

50 UN Plaza developers Zeckendorf Development and Global Holdings just slashed the price of its trophy duplex penthouse to $56 million — down from its original $70 million asking price in 2015.

The penthouse comes with a private pool, stunning views and its own elevator.
