Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been fined $14,500 by the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) for accepting illegal in-kind contributions during his 2016 campaign.

Sanders’ campaign used Australian nationals funded by the Australian Labor Party (ALP), Daily Caller reports:

“While volunteering with the Sanders campaign, the Australians engaged in political activities ‘including encouraging voter attendance at campaign events, recruiting volunteers, canvassing with volunteers, and planning events,; according to the FEC.” “The Sanders campaign ‘treated the ALP delegates no differently from any other campaign out-of-town volunteers and was aware that they were receiving a stipend from the ALP,’ the FEC added.”

According to the Conciliation Agreement between the FEC and the senator, Sanders agrees to pay the $14,500 civil penalty, stop contesting the charges and refrain from repeating the violation:
