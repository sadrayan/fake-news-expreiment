FACT CHECK: Is the Owner of Jimmy John's a Big-Game Hunter?
On 10 June 2011, the web site Smile Politely uncovered photos purportedly showing Jimmy John Liautaud, the founder of Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches, posing with various dead “trophy” animals.

Two of the photos include an elephant and a leopard:

The man pictured in these photographs (which are no longer available on the Johan Calitz Safaris’ Facebook Page) certainly bears a striking resemblance to Mr. Liautaud, and according to Sporting Classics Daily the pictures date from a 2010 safari:

The founder and CEO of Jimmy John’s, a restaurant chain famous for the quick delivery of its products, is under fire for a 2010 African safari he participated in.

That anger has waxed and waned over the years as the photos have sporadically resurfaced, but the hunter began receiving consistent flak in the fall of 2015 after “Cecil” the lion’s death earlier that year.

The Hunting Report, a magazine that has been covering “high-quality big game hunting in North America and Africa” since the 1980s, has recorded several of Liautaud’s hunts for animals such as wolf, Rhinoceros, deer, and Lynx.

Johan Calitz Safaris, for instance, writes on their Facebook page that their safaris benefit local communities:
