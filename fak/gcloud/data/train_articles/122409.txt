Prince dies, New Orleans mourns: Superdome to be lit purple Thursday night
Prince, known as the Purple One because he loved the royal color, will be honored Thursday night as the Mercedez-Benz Superdome will be illuminated in purple lighting.

Prince died Thursday in his suburban residence outside of his hometown of Minneapolis at the age of 57.

The Superdome was aglow with hues of violet in 2014, when Prince performed as a headliner for the 20th Annual Essence Festival, in front of a crowd of thousands who obeyed his wishes and donned every shade of purple imaginable.
