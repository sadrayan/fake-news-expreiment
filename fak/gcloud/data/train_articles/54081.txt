The adverse health effects of chronic cannabis use

Wayne Halla,b* and Louisa Degenhardtc,d

This paper summarizes the most probable of the adverse health effects of regular cannabis use sustained over years, as

indicated by epidemiological studies that have established an association between cannabis use and adverse outcomes; ruled

out reverse causation; and controlled for plausible alternative explanations. We have also focused on adverse outcomes for

which there is good evidence of biological plausibility. The focus is on those adverse health effects of greatest potential public

health signiﬁcance – those that are most likely to occur and to affect a substantial proportion of regular cannabis users. These

most probable adverse effects of regular use include a dependence syndrome, impaired respiratory function, cardiovascular

disease, adverse effects on adolescent psychosocial development and mental health, and residual cognitive impairment.

Keywords: cannabis; health effects; chronic use

Introduction

Cannabis has probably been used for medical and quasi-medical

reasons by humans for several thousand years[1] but societal concerns about the possible adverse health effects of cannabis use has

been driven by the more recent emergence of recreational cannabis

use among young people.[2] In developed countries over the past

half century, psychoactive preparations of cannabis have been

increasingly used by adolescents and young adults in social settings

to enhance sociability and produce euphoria and relaxation. Since

cannabis use was ﬁrst reported over 40 years ago by US college

students, its use has spread globally, ﬁrst to other developed countries, and more recently, to low- and middle-income countries.[3,4]

This paper summarizes what is known about the adverse

effects of chronic use of cannabis beginning in adolescence

and continuing into adulthood. We focus on the adverse effects

that are of greatest potential public health signiﬁcance, speciﬁcally, those health outcomes that are most likely to affect a

substantial proportion of regular cannabis users. There is good

evidence that cannabis use increases risks of car crashes in cannabis-impaired drivers and evidence from laboratory studies that

psychomotor impairment persists for some weeks after cessation

in regular cannabis users.[5,6] This topic is not discussed further

here because it is dealt with in another paper in this special issue.

Deﬁning chronic cannabis use

We lack reliable information on the doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids (e.g. cannabidiol) that

are commonly used by regular cannabis users.[7] As a consequence, epidemiological studies have usually deﬁned ‘heavy’ or

‘regular’ cannabis use as daily or near daily use.[2] This pattern

of use continued over years most clearly predicts increased risks

of adverse health effects.[2]

Assessing the adverse health effects of cannabis

As in our earlier paper,[8] we looked for evidence: (1) of an association between cannabis use and the outcome in case–control and

prospective studies; (2) that reverse causation was an implausible

explanation of the association (evidence from prospective studies

that cannabis use preceded the outcome); (3) from prospective

studies that controlled for potential confounding variables (such

as other drug use and characteristics on which cannabis users

differed from non-users); and (4) from clinical and experimental

research that a causal relationship was biologically plausible.[2]

The health effects of chronic cannabis use

Epidemiological studies have reported associations between

chronic cannabis use – deﬁned as near daily use over a period

of years during adolescence – and various adverse health

outcomes in young adulthood. These associations are typically

quantiﬁed as an odds ratio (ratio of the odds of the disorder

In Australia. cannabis dependence is the most commonly treated type of drug dependence after alcohol and tobacco.[2.[9] Cannabis dependence Cannabis dependence is characterized by impaired control over cannabis use and difﬁculty in ceasing use despite harms caused by it.34] A case-crossover study by Mittleman et al.

The major challenge in interpreting studies reporting association between regular cannabis use and adverse outcomes has been in ruling out alternative explanations of these associations because regular cannabis users are more likely to use alcohol. increased cannabis use among young adults has been accompanied by increasing numbers of persons seeking help in the USA.[13] Cannabis users who seek help to quit commonly report withdrawal symptoms that include anxiety. A US case–control study found a simple association between cannabis smoking and head and neck and lung cancers but these associations were no longer significant after controlling for tobacco use.

Detailed analyses pointed to persistent cannabis use being the most plausible explanation for the decline.

There was no IQ decline in cannabis users who started in young adulthood and had not used for a year or more before follow-up.[2] There is support for the ﬁrst two hypotheses. Brain-imaging studies on larger samples of long-term cannabis users are needed to see if cognitive impairments in long-term users are correlated with structural changes in brain areas implicated in memory and emotion.[48] reported reduced hippocampal and amygdala volumes in 15 long-term users who had smoked 5 or more joints a day for 10 or more years. and cerebellum in chronic cannabis users. the more likely they are to do so.[44] reported recovery after 28 days’ abstinence. The psychosocial consequences of adolescent cannabis use Cannabis use and mental health Educational outcomes Psychosis and schizophrenia Regular cannabis use and poor educational attainment are associated[50] but it is uncertain whether such use: (1) is a contributory cause of poor school performance. Second. The second hypothesis has also been tested in longitudinal studies by assessing whether cannabis users are more likely to report heroin and cocaine use after statistically controlling for confounders.[49] In the United States.[40] Structural changes have been reported in the hippocampus. the decline in IQ was largest in those who began using cannabis in adolescence and used regularly throughout adulthood. increased afﬁliation by regular cannabis users with peers who reject school. young people with poor educational attainment.[42] It is also unclear whether cognitive function completely recovers after cessation of cannabis use.[53] Three explanations have been offered for these patterns of drug use: (1) cannabis users have more opportunities to use other illicit drugs because these are supplied by the same black market as cannabis.[40] have found cognitive impairments in frequent and/or long-term cannabis users. but recovery was limited in participants who started smoking cannabis in adolescence and had stopped using for a year or less. and the decline persisted after statistically controlling for educational level attained.[50] Other illicit drug use Regular cannabis use produces a down-regulation of cannabinoid receptors that can be detected by positron emission tomography (PET) and persist for up to a month after abstinence has been achieved. Young people in the USA who have used cannabis report more opportunities to use cocaine at an earlier age.41] found partial recovery after two years’ abstinence but brain event-related potentials still showed a correlation between impaired information processing and years of cannabis use. These reductions increased with the duration of use. Ltd. or (3) implies that cannabis use and poor educational attainment are caused by common factors. This effect persisted after adjustment for confounders.[57] Adjustment for confounders (including unmeasured ﬁxed ones using ﬁxed effects regression)[58] weakened but did not eliminate the relationship between regular cannabis use and the use of other illicit drugs.[55] A simulation study[56] indicates that the second hypothesis may explain the relationships observed between cannabis and other illicit drug use. A recent New Zealand longitudinal study assessed changes in IQ between age 13 (before cannabis use) and at age 38 in 1037 New Zealanders born in Dunedin in 1972 or 1973. frequency of use.[59] Studies of twins discordant for cannabis use have tested the hypothesis that the association is explained by a shared genetic vulnerability to use cannabis and other illicit drugs. the same effects were observed in cannabis users who ﬁnished high school. Longitudinal studies have typically found a relationship between cannabis use before the age of 15 and early school leaving that has persisted after adjustment for confounders. and cumulative dose of THC.

A recent analysis of the data from this cohort[85] using sophisticated econometric methods found that more than weekly cannabis use increased the likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation in males. it will be difﬁcult to reduce incidence by preventing cannabis uptake: among men aged 20 to 24.[61] A 15-year follow-up of 50 465 Swedish male conscripts found that those who had tried cannabis by age 18 were 2.[65] Germany.4 [95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 1.[76] In a follow-up of the Swedish cohort.4 times more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia than those who had not. the availability of psychiatric services for psychosis.

Patton et al. These results were recently conﬁrmed in a 35-year follow-up of the Swedish cohort. The common cause hypothesis was harder to exclude because the association between cannabis use and psychosis was attenuated after statistical adjustment for potential confounders and no study assessed all confounders.

The risk of developing a psychosis roughly doubles from around 7 in 1000 in non-users[74] to 14 in 1000 for regular cannabis users. A meta-analysis[69] found that these studies were too heterogeneous to quantify risk.[61] It will be difﬁcult to discern whether cannabis use has had any effects on incidence because cannabis use produces a modest increase in risk (assuming that the relationship is causal) and the interpretation of data on the incidence of psychoses have been complicated by changes in diagnosis. 49 [95% CI: 1. Similar conclusions were drawn from a combined analysis of data from four Australasian birth cohorts.5 times) in those who reported the heaviest cannabis use at age 18.

Zammit et al. depression and alcohol dependence substantially reduced but did not eliminate the association (odds ratio of 2). An Australian study did not ﬁnd clear evidence of increased psychosis incidence after steep increases in cannabis use during the 1980s and 1990s.
