Blue Cross Blue Shield to restore canceled Kansas policies
The largest health insurance company in Kansas says it will offer another year of coverage under plans that it had expected to cancel because of the federal health care overhaul.



Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas announced Tuesday that it would notify about 10,000 policy holders that they can continue with their old, individual coverage. The company had sent the policyholders cancellation notices, leaving them to find new health plans.



The change came after President Barack Obama announced he would allow companies to continue existing plans for at least another year even if the coverage didn't meet mandates in the 2010 health care law.



Blue Cross spokeswoman Mary Beth Chambers said the company believes its policyholders would prefer to keep their old plans.
