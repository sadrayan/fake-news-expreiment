State Passes Historic Bill To Keep Trump Off The 2020 Ballot – Trump Prepares To Sue
Donald Trump promised America that he would release his tax returns if he won the presidency. We’re still waiting to see them. He’s lied to this country again and again about releasing his returns, and one state has taken an unprecedented step that could force him to do what he’s promised all of us…if he wants to be on their ballot in 2020, that is. Rhode Island’s state senate just passed a bill that would require presidential candidates to release five years of their tax returns if they want to be on the state’s ballot.

The Providence Journal reported today that Sen. Gayle Goldin (D), who sponsored the bill, said,

‘Tax returns provide essential information about candidates’ conflicts of interest. Tax returns are vital information a voter needs to know about a candidate at the ballot box.’

She also said that every presidential candidate since Nixon had released their tax returns voluntarily until Donald Trump came along. The rest of America thanks her for her effort to fix a problem that could cut out a lot of corruption in Washington D.C. Her bill passed the state senate 34-3 and now goes to the Rhode Island State House.

If it passes it’s going to cause Trump a lot of problems in 2020. Of course he’ll probably sue over the bill, but if we get lucky and he loses in court, he’ll either have to release his returns, or he won’t be allowed on Rhode Island’s ballot. Either way the people of America win. We’ll either get a look into what’s sure to be massive corruption on his part, or he’ll lose all the votes in one state.

That would almost insure that he loses his next election. The way things are going for him now, it’s very likely that he wouldn’t win anyway. He’s quickly becoming the most hated man in the world, and eventually his believers will realize that he’s made a fool of them.
