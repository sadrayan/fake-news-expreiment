Historians on the Confederate Monument Debate
"History is what the present chooses to remember about the past." ~ Carl Becker (AHA President, 1931)

In the wake of the Charlottesville tragedy, historians across the country provided important historical context and insight to the public. The AHA compiled statements that our members, fellow historical societies, AHA Council members, and staff have made in op-eds, interviews, and other media conversations about the importance of historical thinking and knowledge within the current debate. The AHA has also released a statement on how these issues relate to the discipline of history.

This is by no means a full and comprehensive list. Please email Elyse Martin, associate editor for web content and social media, at emartin@historians.org if you have an article, op-ed, interview, etc. that you think should be included in this list.
