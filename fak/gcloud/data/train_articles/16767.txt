I’d be interested in what you make of the approach taken for the poll released this month as described in the two tweets starting here. We are fact-checking a Republican Party of Texas claim that a poll places Beto O’Rourke 2 points behind Ted Cruz.

We continue to rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories. I also hope to complete our review of this today.

Here’s a web post on the firm’s founding.

These guys are legit. Their trend lines make sense; they may be on top of a trend. They have a good track record. I would only add my disclaimers about online panel polling. First, regardless of how careful they are about matching their sample demographics to the real world, all of their respondents have one trait – they have opted in to on-line surveys. Just as traditional telephone polling excluded those without phones, online surveys exclude those who don’t opt in. I would expect that group (the opt-in’s) to be somewhat more attuned to politics than the electorate at large. Second (again, as with traditional polling), the target demographic profile incorporates assumptions about turnout. If they use the all registered voters profile, for example, they are assuming that Hispanics will turn out in the same proportions as others. That said, I don’t see any reason not to use them as a credible polling source.

Hope that helps.
