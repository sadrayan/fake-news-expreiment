Virgin Mary: Time for my Son to deliver His Gift of Divine Mercy Wednesday, November 2nd, 2011 @ 10:40 My child, the time for my Son to deliver His Gift of Divine Mercy is drawing close. As such, you must concentrate on your Mission to save souls. You must not allow distractions, which take your eye off the most important task of spreading conversion. The Heavens rejoice, as this divine Gift will soon be presented with the pure Love that my Son holds in His Heart for all souls. My child, as this work escalates in its intensity, the evil one will continue to torment you through different people at every opportunity. You have been instructed to keep silent and focus only on my Son. You, my child, are the appointed one to convey in great detail the desire of my Son to speak with mankind in these times. Be brave and courageous, for this Holy Mission will succeed. It has been foretold so very long ago and you have been accorded every kind of direction from the Heavens. The saints all guide you, for they have been gathered in full force to ensure that this Mission will not fail. Nor can it. You must stop worrying when things seem hopeless, for that is the deceit you will be confronted with through the work of the deceiver. I, your beloved Mother, work with you all the time. It was through me that you were prepared to come before my Precious Son. The graces granted were to enable your soul to be purified, so that you were fit to work for the Saviour of mankind. It was through my precious Son that you have been brought before the Blessed Trinity. This is one of the most important Missions since my Son was sent to redeem the world from sin. Never allow yourself to deviate from this Mission. Nor must you give in to the temptation to walk away. Pray to me, your Mother, at all times, for protection. Your beloved Mother Queen of Heaven Mother of Mercy ././././ï»¿
