Subject: RE: Fact check

... it looks to me like the Austin debt rate is higher than such rates in half a dozen smaller area districts, specifically those serving children in Johnson City, Florence, Bartlett, McDade, Granger and Coupland (which appears to have a zero debt rate). Do you have any thoughts/analysis of this?

those cities you listed are not considered Central Texas. Central Texas districts include Roundrock, Pflugerville, Travis, etc.

I will forward the second questions to finance, as well.

Regards y gracias!

I wanted to explain the reason why we don't compare to smaller districts like Johnston City, Bartlett, and Granger. Our comparisons with surrounding districts are based on proximity and boundaries. Historically, we have not been compared to the smaller districts you mentioned, even though "geographically speaking" they may be in the central area of the state.

Regards y gracias!
