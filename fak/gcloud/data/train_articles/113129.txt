Dear Dr. Lemesch: Thank you for your letter of June 24, requesting comments on the NGB Safety Alert regarding a safety hazard related to the use of contact lenses. Attached for you information are press releases form the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, the American Optometric Association, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology on the two cases of "blindness" referenced in your letter. As you can see, all of these press releases, dispel the rumors which have circulated about contact lenses. Therefore, it is our opinion that the incidents described in the Safety Alert attached to your letter are not accurate. If you need further assistance regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us. Sincerely,







Edward J. Baier

Director
