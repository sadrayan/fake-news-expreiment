Rep. Earl Blumenauer Proposed a New Law, “H.R. 420”, Which Would Regulate Cannabis Like Alcohol
"While the bill number may be a bit tongue-in-cheek, the issue is very serious," says Blumenauer, who is co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus. "Our federal marijuana laws are outdated, out of touch and have negatively impacted countless lives. Congress cannot continue to be out of touch with a movement that a growing majority of Americans support. It's time to end this senseless prohibition."
