Which body fluids transmit HIV?
En Espa≈Üol

These body fluids have been shown to contain high concentrations of HIV:

blood

semen

vaginal fluid

breast milk

other body fluids containing blood

The following are additional body fluids that may transmit the virus that health care workers may come into contact with:

fluid surrounding the brain and the spinal cord

fluid surrounding bone joints

fluid surrounding an unborn baby

HIV has been found in the saliva and tears of some persons living with HIV, but in very low quantities. It is important to understand that finding a small amount of HIV in a body fluid does not necessarily mean that HIV can be transmitted by that body fluid. HIV has not been recovered from the sweat of HIV-infected persons. Contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of HIV.
