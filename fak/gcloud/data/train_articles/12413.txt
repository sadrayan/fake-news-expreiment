American Way Ad - Airline Ambassadors
We are grateful to American Airlines our # 1 Sponsor, for providing a full page ad in American Way in flight magazine to be seen by millions of passengers this October. American Airlines signed the ECPAT Code of Conduct last year making public their determination to combat Modern Day Slavery.

We applaud their commitment. (See below a sneak peak at the ad)

Thanks for support with ad design to Stuart Itkin and Kaarina Mackenzie of Athena Global Advisors.
