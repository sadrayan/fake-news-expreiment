Donald Trump Clearly Doesn't Understand How Dogs Work
Billionaire real estate mogul and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has never been known for his way with words. In campaign speeches, he often describes things as "bad,""so bad," or, if he's feeling especially adventurous, "very bad." And he promises to fix bad with good by "winning," "totally succeeding" and by being "great" again.

For Trump, the lack of oratorical creativity hasn't just led him to speak with a fourth-grade vocabulary. It has tainted his speech like a dog.

I know what you're thinking. Like a dog? That simile makes no sense in that context. Dogs don't really taint things. Wouldn't "like toxic waste" make more sense? Or "like a turd floating in a pool?" Pretty much anything is better than saying "like a dog."

"Like a dog" is a stupid thing to say. But it's also one of Donald Trump's favorite insulting comparisons, and like much of his shit-talking game, it's stupid.

While people typically use "like a dog" with phrases like "shot down," "treated" (poorly), "worked" or maybe even "walked," Trump uses the expression to describe behavior that simply doesn't apply to dogs. It's unclear if he's just lazy, or if he's truly unfamiliar with canine behavior.

Who fires their dog?
