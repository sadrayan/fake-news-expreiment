The estimate does not include the Commercial Building Plan Review fee. That fee is based on project valuation (labor & materials). Those fees are listed on the top page of this document .

The building permit fees are correct. (“Building SF” through “Plumbing Surcharge”)

The Fees for the garage would be reduced if it does not have heating or AC or plumbing fixtures:

-Garage without heating A/C would reduce fees by $1,682

-Garage without plumbing fixtures would reduce fees by $4,372

The correct Parkland Dedication Fee would be $1075.25. The City can require dedication of parkland or fee in lieu of . Click here for more information on Parkland Dedication

To accurately assess the Austin Water and Wastewater Fees, additional information is needed:

Is the 4-inch meter a compound meter or turbine meter? (It makes a big difference in terms of the amount of the fee)

What was the plat date of the land? (It makes a big difference in terms of the amount of the fee)

Are the fees solely capital recovery fees (impact fees) or does it also include the cost of the meter or the inspection of the meter installation?

Let me know if you have any further questions.
