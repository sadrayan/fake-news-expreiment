Annual Report

For close to a century, the Ohio Department of Taxation (and its predecessor, the Ohio Tax Commission), has published an annual report documenting the agency's efforts.

Brief Summary

Since 1975, the department has published a Brief Summary of Major State & Local Taxes in Ohio, designed to be a quick overview of all of the state's significant state and local taxes.

Tax Expenditure Report

Every two years, the department's Tax Analysis Division compiles a report on Ohio's "tax expenditures" in compliance with Ohio Revised Code sections 107.03(F) and 5703.48. The final reports become an appendix of the governor's executive budget proposal to the Ohio General Assembly.
