To our readers: A Donald Trump presidency threatens to empower dangerous elements of the Radical Right that have, until recently, been relegated to the fringes of America. Never has the work of Right Wing Watch, a project of the People For the American Way dedicated to exposing the Far-Right's extreme and intolerant agenda, been more important. As a non-profit, our main source of support is readers like you. If you use Right Wing Watch, please consider making a contribution to support our work at this critical time.
