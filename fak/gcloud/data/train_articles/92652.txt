Should Florida schools require uniforms?
When the Florida House K-12 committee first started talking about student uniforms as a safety measure, the issue appeared low on the priority list for counterparts in the Florida Senate. Senators were focusing on testing and technology.

As the legislative session nears the point where committees stop considering new bills, though, the two chambers remain far apart on testing proposals. And suddenly Senate Education chairman John Legg has amended his bill on school district improvement plans to include a whole section on student uniforms that's pretty close to the bill the House unanimously passed.

Legg's amendment doesn't include the $10-per-student piece that the House held out as an incentive. But it does the same thing otherwise, of allowing districts to create uniform standard attire "to provide a safe environment that fosters learning and improves school safety and discipline."

House sponsor, Rep. Janet Adkins, said on her Facebook account that she was proud to offer this legislation as a parent. We heard from many school administrators, teachers, parents where school uniforms were in place and it is clear that these policies help reduce conditions that lead to acts of bullying. The law makes this optional so that parents who choose can opt out and provides school districts money to help implement."

Legg couldn't be reached for comment. He presents his proposal during his committee meeting at 1:30 p.m.
