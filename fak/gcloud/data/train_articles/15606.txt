Good afternoon.

I write on behalf of the American-Statesman’s PolitiFact Texas fact-checking project to seek elaboration and factual backup from you for the portion of the letter posted on your website, signed by women, that quotes a SAFE Alliance forensic nurse saying: “I have taken care of about a thousand people in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault . . . I am now seeing a pattern of rape reports that all involve ridesharing and it is of extreme concern to me.”

The letter further says SAFE describes “seeing too many sexual assault survivors that report being attacked by their ridesharing drivers, at a rate of one per month in our offices.”

I would be happy to field your backup information and contact information for the appropriate SAFE representatives by email or phone Wednesday.

Thanks.

The letter you reference was one that was written and sent out by the ladies who have attached their name. It was not a letter produced by the Our City PAC we just forwarded the letter to our list.

I did find on the safe website a link to the quote contained in the letter though: http://www.safeaustin.org/2016/01/28/safe-supports-thumbs-up/

Hope this helps,
