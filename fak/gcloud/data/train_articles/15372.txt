Shana:

Good afternoon.

I am trying to fact-check the claim in the second sentence of the Pete Gallego press release pasted below. True? Gallego’s campaign has pointed out this Hurd letter entered in the Congressional Record.

For our story, I would be happy to do a phone interview with Hurd about his decision.

I am in my office now.

Subject: WILL HURD: PLENTY O' TIME FOR PERSONAL FUNDRAISING, NO TIME FOR TX SMALL BIZ

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE WILL HURD: PLENTY O' TIME FOR FUNDRAISING, NO TIME FOR TEXAS' SMALL BIZ (San Antonio) Moments ago, Congressman Will Hurd (R - TX23) announced that he had raised over $500k for his campaign. Just two weeks ago, Congressman Hurd quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve. Following is a statement from Gallego for Congress spokesperson Anthony Gutierrez: "Congressman Hurd abandoned Texas' small businesses because he was unable to find the time for them yet was able to make plenty of time to raise money for himself. It's clear that Congressman Hurd cares a great deal about himself and his campaign war chest and not at all about Texas' small businesses. For the record - Pete Gallego grew up working in the family restaurant and has a long record of supporting the small businesses that are the backbone of our economy." ## Media Contact: Anthony Gutierrez 210.275.2628 anthony@cadremedia.com @antgutierrez Paid for by Texans for Pete

Josh said you needed the quotes we offered to a previous journalist when asked about this. If you need anything else, please let me know.

Thanks!

Chairman Lamar Smith, member of the Steering Committee-

"This was a small administrative matter that has now been corrected.”

Al Arreola, President of the Southside San Antonio Chamber of Commerce-

“As an entrepreneur, Congressman Hurd understands firsthand the burdens small businesses face due to government red tape and tax increases. I appreciate his wherewithal to work beyond the bureaucracy of government to help us find meaningful solutions that affect South Texas businesses.”

Steve Chabot, Chairman of the Small Business Committee-

“I’ve been impressed with Rep. Hurd’s energy and enthusiasm since I first met him. Any committee is lucky to have him, and even though a procedural glitch means it is necessary to change his committee assignments, I know he’ll be a dedicated voice for working Americans across his district.”

They were provided to our office from their offices when we asked for them. I think the date was March 18.

Got it. Did any of the individuals below say as much in emails or letters or speeches or other documentation?

How many members were affected by the procedural glitch described by Chabot? That is, were there other members erroneously appointed to the panel? Who? Did each one resign? Why did this happen?

In answer to your first question, not that I’m aware of. We received one inquiry from a DC based reporter with the Express News about this, so we provided these quotes to him. I guess he decided this wasn’t a story because he never wrote about it, and that’s been several weeks. No other reporter had inquired about it, so there was no reason to send the quotes to anyone else.

I don’t know the answer to your other questions. Procedural errors aren't considered news up here, so I haven’t seen anything else regarding a similar situation for any other member. Mr. Chabot may be able to answer some of those questions, but someone from the steering committee would have to explain how a mistake like this happens.

OK.

I spotted this information about the steering committee. Is there a clear-cut presentation showing the committee makes committee assignments?

Why did Hurd wait until March to resign?

Not that I’m aware of.

We actually began the process of removal after we received the press release. It simply took this long for it to become official.

Can you send documentation of asking to be relieved of the committee assignment at or around the time it was announced?

1:26 p.m.

Those conversations were on the phone.
