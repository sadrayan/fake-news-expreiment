The Steve Biko Centre
On November 30, 2012 the Steve Biko Foundation officially opened the Steve Biko Centre. Located in the Ginsberg Township of King Williamâ€™s Town in the Eastern Cape, the Centre focuses on translating global interest in the legacy of anti-apartheid activist Bantu Stephen Biko into a developmental resource for the region. Often, when articulating the developmental agenda, housing, electricity and water are at the fore of discourse; less emphasis is placed on the intangible, yet equally important aspects of heritage, culture and history. The Steve Biko Centre contributes to both facets of development, serving as an intellectual resource, while providing an economic opportunity for the region.
