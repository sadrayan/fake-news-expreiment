Las Vegas Strip Thanks Sen. Reid for Passing the Travel Promotion Act

The recently signed into law Travel Promotion Act is going to greatly benefit Nevada because we have so many wonderful tourist attractions. Senator Reid fought so hard to pass this bill because he knew that it would mean thousands of jobs for Nevada as foreign tourists flock to Las Vegas, Reno, and Lake Tahoe.

Yesterday a number of hotels on the Las Vegas Strip showed Senator Reid their appreciation for his efforts on behalf of Nevada by thanking him in their marquees. Check out the picture and say thanks to Senator Reid by volunteering HERE.
