Welcome to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program (SAVE)

The SAVE Program provides a fast, secure and efficient verification service for federal, state and local benefit-granting agencies to verify a benefit applicant’s immigration status or naturalized/derived citizenship.

SAVE is administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a component of the Department of Homeland Security, and is dedicated to providing program support to participating agencies.

Throughout this website you will find useful information about the SAVE Program and how it works.
