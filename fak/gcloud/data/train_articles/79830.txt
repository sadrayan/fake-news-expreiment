43 Times Donald Trump Has Attacked The Media As A Presidential Candidate
NEW YORK -- Donald Trump swears he's not thin-skinned.

"I don't mind a bad story," he told CBS News anchor Scott Pelley on Sunday night. "If you did a bad story on me for '60 Minutes,' if it were a fair story I wouldn't be thin-skinned at all."

"You know, some of the media is among the worst people I've ever met," Trump continued. "I mean a pretty good percentage is really a terrible group of people. They write lies, they write false stories. They know they're false. It makes no difference. And frankly I don't call it thin-skinned, I'm angry."

Republican primaries are always a good time for a little media bashing. Candidates have nothing to lose by snapping at a New York Times reporter or telling a gathering of the conservative faithful how they've stopped reading the paper.

But Trump's presidential campaign has doubled as a seemingly endless attack on the media, with a steady stream of gripes and grievances uttered in TV interviews, on the campaign trail and on social media. And Trump hasn't only swatted at the so-called "liberal media" -- an easy applause line for conservative audience -- but has criticized some of the right's most influential columnists (Charles Krauthammer, George Will), its most venerable magazine (National Review) and its most powerful media outlet (Fox News). He's also strayed from past candidates by not merely calling out perceived partisan bias, but getting downright personal when it comes to the "dopey" "losers" in the media.

Trump's four-and-a-half-month-long critique has come even as he's received more media attention than any 2016 candidate, Sunday shows and cable networks make every effort to accommodate him, and editors line up to get him on the cover.

"I'm on a lot of covers," Trump said in the "60 Minutes" interview. "I think maybe more than almost any supermodel. I think more than any supermodel. But in a way that is a sign of respect, people are respecting what you are doing."

Still, Trump rarely has gone a few days without taking shots at the press, sometimes critiquing several outlets or journalists in a single morning or afternoon, as The Huffington Post found when revisiting the the real estate developer's greatest hits since announcing his run for president on June 16. Here are 43 times he's gone on the offensive as a presidential candidate:

June 17: The Daily News

Only a fool would buy the @NYDailyNews. Loses fortune & has zero gravitas. Let it die! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 17, 2015

June 17: Charles Krauthammer and George Will

"When I watch a George Will or a Charles Krauthammer, you know, I've watched them for years, they're losers. They're just losers. They sit there, they haven't done anything," Trump added.

June 21: Martha Raddatz

.@MarthaRaddatz was so unprofessional and biased when discussing me on This Week. @GStephanopoulos should not allow this conduct! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2015

June 21: "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace

The great Mike Wallace covered me in a much more professional manner than his son, Chris Wallace of @FoxNews. Mike was a total pro! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2015

June 24: "Today" and "Morning Joe" co-host Willie Geist

Uncomfortable looking NBC reporter Willie Geist calls me to ask for favors and then mockingly smiles when he is told of my high poll numbers — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2015

June 25: MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell

I hear that dopey political pundit, Lawrence O'Donnell, one of the dumber people on television, is about to lose his show-no ratings?Too bad — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2015

June 25: Univision

"They don't want me saying that Mexico is killing the United States in trade and killing the United States at the border," Trump told The Associated Press on Thursday. "Univision is totally laying down for the Mexican government. ... They want to silence Donald Trump. And Donald Trump can't be silenced. ... I have great respect for Mexico and I love the Mexican people, but my loyalty is to the United States."

June 26: (continued)

Anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2015

.@Univision cares far more about Mexico than it does about the U.S. Are they controlled by the Mexican government? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2015

June 28: The Daily News

.@NYDailyNews, the dying tabloid owned by dopey clown Mort Zuckerman, puts me on the cover daily because I sell. My honor, but it is dead! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2015

July 7 : Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart:

"As per Mr. Trump's request, please see the attached note. Thank you." Reacting to this --> http://t.co/315Wb3JlkK pic.twitter.com/aoIWeDSNv1 — Jonathan Capehart (@CapehartJ) July 7, 2015

July 8: NBC News correspondent Katy Tur

"Don't be naive. You're a very naive person," he said. When Tur stumbled while referencing some statistics to bolster her point, Trump mocked her inability to get the question out. "Try getting it out. Try getting it out. I mean, I don't know if you're going to put this on television. But you don't even know what you're talking about. Try getting it out, go ahead," he said.

July 12: NBC “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd

Sleep eyes @ChuckTodd is killing Meet The Press. Isn't he pathetic? Love watching him fail! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2015

July 17: The Huffington Post (after moving coverage of him from Politics to Entertainment section)

"The only clown show in this scenario is the Huffington Post pretending to be a legitimate news source."

July 18: (continued)

The liberal clown @ariannahuff told her minions at the money losing @HuffingtonPost to cover me as enterainment. I am #1 in Huff Post Poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 18, 2015

July 18: CNN

Ratings starved @CNN and @CNNPolitics does not cover me accurately. Why can't they get it right - it's really not that hard! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 18, 2015

July 20: Wall Street Journal

The ever dwindling @WSJ which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for, is always hitting me politically. Who cares! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 20, 2015

July 21: Des Moines Register

On the campaign trail in Iowa, a state whose people I have truly gotten to know and love, I have been treated very badly by the Des Moines Register. They were uneven and inconsistent, but far more importantly, very dishonest. They would rarely write the facts or report what really took place."

July 22: CNN "AC360" guest and Bloomberg View publisher Tim O'Brien

.@AC360 Has the absolutely worst anti-Trump talking heads on his show. Dopey writer O'brian knows nothing about me or my wealth. A waste! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2015

July 23: (continued)

What a waste of time being interviewed by @andersoncooper when he puts on really stupid talking heads likeTim O'Brien-dumb guy with no clue! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2015

“That’s a typical case of the press with misinterpretation. They take a half a sentence, they take a half a sentence, by they way, then they take quarter of a sentence and put it all together. It’s a typical thing. And you're with Telemundo and Telemundo should be ashamed.

July 25: Des Moines Register, again

The ultra liberal and seriously failing Des Moines Register is BEGGING my team for press credentials to my event in Iowa today-but they lie! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2015

July 29: The Daily Beast

Thank you @Morning_Joe for throwing the pathetic reporter from the failing and money losing Daily Beast off the air. Really cool! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2015

Incompetent @RichLowry lost it tonight on @FoxNews. He should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2015

"I don't think anybody reads [National Review], Joe, I think it has no power whatsoever. And he's not a respected guy."

Sept 24: Associated Press

"The photographer is a f***ing thief,' an exasperated Trump boomed in a telephone interview, referring to the Associated Press photojournalist who shot the initial picture. "Tell them they're a fraud, whoever took it. I just got killed on that thing, and it was just really unfair. It's godd**n unfair."

"The CNN reporter, absolutely horrible reporter, she starts off saying, 'Oh look, the room was half empty.' The room wasn't half empty. Everybody was standing right next to me in the front of the room. I want to tell you, you can tell [CNN president] Jeff Zucker, I think it was terrible, disgusting reporting."

.@politico, which is not read or respected by many, may be the most dishonest of the media outlets--- and that is saying something. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2015

Though Trump didn't personally criticize the "60 Minutes" broadcast, he retweeted the following to his 4.3 million followers:
