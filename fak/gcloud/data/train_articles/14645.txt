Property Tax Survey Data and Reports
The Tax Code requires the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to administer several surveys and issue reports summarizing the data reported through those surveys. The Comptroller's office compiles information submitted by property owners, their representatives, appraisal districts and taxing units, and publishes it electronically on this website.

The Comptroller's office is not responsible for the accuracy of the data reported to it, but only for accurately compiling and publishing the data received. The Comptroller's office is not advocating for any group reporting data through its surveys and is not authorized to offer legal advice about any matter reported herein.
