Weatherford elementary teacher dies from flu complications, district says
The Weatherford district has been taking precautions to prevent the spread of the illness.

"Our campus custodians have been deep-cleaning our schools since December, and the campus where the teacher worked underwent another deep cleaning on Friday, Feb. 2," a written statement from the district said. "We continue to remind students and parents of healthy habits during the cold and flu season."

Another Parker County school district, Perrin-Whitt CISD, was closed Monday to disinfect classrooms and buildings because of a high number of student and teacher absences, the Weatherford Democrat reported.

Weatherford ISD will provide counselors at Ikard Elementary throughout the week to offer emotional support.

"Today is a difficult day at that campus, and we are working our processes to care for students, parents and staff," the district's statement said.

Holland started to feel sick about a week ago and went to a doctor Wednesday, her husband told NBC5. She had begun taking TamiFlu, but after her illness worsened she was admitted to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest Fort Worth late Friday.

Holland, the mother of a 10-year-old girl and 7-year-old boy, died after she went into septic shock, said her husband, Frank Holland.

The 2017-18 flu season continues to take a toll, and officials say it's too soon to know whether the worst is over. Dallas County has reported 54 flu deaths. In the state, more than 2,900 flu and pneumonia deaths have been documented.
