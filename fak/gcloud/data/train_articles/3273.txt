Oscar moved to Atteridgeville correctional centre
Murder convict Oscar Pistorius has been moved from the Kgosi Mampuru II prison to the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre, the Department of Correctional Services confirmed on Monday.

Spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said the centre, which is under Kgosi Mampuru II management area, accommodates offenders sentenced to less than six years.

The move will enable Pistorius to engage in departmental rehabilitation programmes, which are not offered at his former centre, the Remand Detention Centre, as it was strictly designed for awaiting trial detainees.

He said Pistorius was initially placed at the Remand Detention Centre as it was for offenders who needed full-time hospitalisation or healthcare.

“This was done in order to accommodate his disability needs.”

The Atteridgeville Correctional Centre was upgraded in May to accommodate disabled offenders, including installations of a bathtub.

“These upgrades were not strictly made for Mr Pistorius, but to accommodate disabled offenders under Kgosi Mampuru II Management Area. Furthermore, the upgrades were done long before the management considered moving Mr Pistorius to Atteridgeville.”

Pistorius was serving six years for murder after he shot dead his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February 2013.

He was initially sentenced to five years for culpable homicide but the conviction was overturned to murder by the Supreme Court of Appeal last year.

“It was after a very careful consideration of all important factors that the management decided that Atteridgeville Correctional Centre was the best place to accommodate Pistorius. Mr Pistorius’ transfer was purely due to his application, which was lawfully and procedurally considered and approved.”
