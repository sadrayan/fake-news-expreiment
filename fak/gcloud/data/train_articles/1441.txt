Smuggling Of Immigrants `Major' Problem, Chiles Says
MIAMI â€” Gov. Lawton Chiles raised the profile of immigrant smuggling on Thursday by urging greater cooperation between state and federal agencies to ``put these traffickers out of business.''

About an hour after Chiles' announcement, 15 undocumented Cubans washed ashore in Plantation Key in a small boat. U.S. Border Patrol agents said they may have been smuggled into the state.

While immigrant smuggling has not dramatically increased this year, South Florida is seeing more small boats arrive with undocumented people from Haiti, Cuba and other countries.

``Unfortunately, there are traffickers who prey upon people who would pay any price for illegal passage to Florida,'' said Chiles, after meeting with 20 federal and state representatives at the U.S. Southern Command.

``Sometimes people give their life savings to these traffickers. But they often pay a much higher price than they bargained for.''

Chiles called immigrant smuggling a ``major'' problem for Florida, but he could not say how much it is costing the state.

The brainstorming session on Thursday included officials from the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Coast Guard. Representatives from the Broward Sheriff's Office, the Miami Police Department and the State Attorney's Office in Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties also participated.

Authorities say smugglers are becoming more sophisticated, using fast boats and global positioning devices. They command higher fees and can move more people.
