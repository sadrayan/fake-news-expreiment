WisPolitics Election Blog: Emily's List goes up with new TV ad targeting Walker on abortion
9:44 AM





The group said the women featured in the spot are from Wisconsin, though they are not identified. One opens the spot by saying she had “no idea what Scott Walker was doing.”





A narrator then says Walker ants to make all abortions illegal, “even for victims of rape and incest.”





Another woman says Walker shouldn’t be “putting himself in between a woman and her doctor” before a third says, “It’s wrong that Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal.”





The narrator says Walker is “forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion” before one of the women says “That is so invasive” and another asks, “Who does Scott Walker think he is?”





The narrator encourages women to go to the Wisconsin Women Vote! website before one of the women closes the spot by saying, “Women really need to know what Scott Walker is doing.”
