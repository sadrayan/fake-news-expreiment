Ladies, Drake Is Looking For A Writer Kind Of Love
Drake may like his women BBW, but he’s now adding another criteria to his checklist: a writer. That’s right, ladies, your favorite rapper is looking for a woman to write herself into his heart. Or his bed, whichever comes first. Or, at the very least, he wants to be the writer of your dreams. The “6 God” rapper reposted a phrase from Canadian singer Mustafa the Poet, which reads, “If a writer falls in love with you, you can never die.” Mustafa captioned the picture with, “So I asked her if she wanted to live forever.” Seems like Drake is getting more in touch with his feelings (if that’s even possible).

They’re complicated, record everything in written form and can sometimes break hearts with a few clicks on our keyboards. But who are we to stop a Brown Sugar type of love? Let’s hope that whatever poetic relationship Drizzy enters inspires his highly anticipated album Views From The 6, set to drop sometime this year. Photo Credit: Instagram
