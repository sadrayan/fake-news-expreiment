The United States and Russia govt has been a blessing to Biafra struggle. According to US political expert, Michael Kerry, he said that one of the reason why Biafra was defeated in 1967 civil war, is because they refused to use what they have to get what they want.

He said that if Emeka Odumegwe Ojukwu had agree with Russia govt, Biafra would have won, Biafrans should learn from Ojukwu mistake.

According Biafra newspaper today, Now the door still open, US and Russia govt is ready to help Biafra to go, if they can release their oil to them for five years.
