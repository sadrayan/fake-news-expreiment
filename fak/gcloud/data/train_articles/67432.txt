Muslim Man Snapped Laughing In Paris Just 3 Months Before Notre Dame Fire
A MUSLIM man was captured by an Irish tourist laughing maniacally in Paris only 3 months before the Notre Dame fire yesterday evening which totally destroyed the Cathedral and wiped out Christianity in France for good, TheLibel.ie can report.

Ciara Warlock said she was astounded at the time when she seen the man laughing for no apparent reason, but it all made sense today when she reviewed the picture on her iPhone Xs which she won in a competition on TheLibel.ie just two weeks before.

“I knew he was up to something so I ran up to him and took the picture,” Ciara recalls the incident, which was not reported by the mainstream media despite her best efforts in sending the photograph to so-called ‘newspapers’, who are just left wing fronts for elite billionaires with the soul intention of fueling mass migration and lies.

“It was a kind of evil laugh, like one you would do if you were about to torch a well known Christian landmark,” the gorgeous but demure Ciara added, “come to think of it now he smelled like a campfire – he was probably practicing before I caught him and began laughing at the evil thoughts running through his radicalised mind”.

Despite the evidence, not one police investigator would heed the witness’ warning, thus allowing yesterday’s attack on Christianity to happen while the distracted world watched on in despair at this Islamic man probably laughed himself to sleep planning his next attack.
