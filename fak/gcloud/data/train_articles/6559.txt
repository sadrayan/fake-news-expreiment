Mrs. Clinton Had Complementary Strengths to Mr. Sanders Voters under age 30 were the fuel behind Mr. Sanders’s campaign. He won more than 70% of them—a bigger share than Barack Obama claimed in 2008. Moreover, voters age 18-29 were more important this year than in 2008; their share of the electorate grew by three points. Still, seniors remained the larger group, and Mrs. Clinton won more than 70% of them. Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Sanders among all income and education levels, but she was particularly strong among those with the highest incomes and college attainment.

Mrs. Clinton Won Metropolitan Areas Mrs. Clinton’s coalition of upscale and minority voters gave her a far different footprint than in 2008. She won more big-city counties and the suburbs around them than in her first presidential campaign, and she won dramatically more Southern counties with large African-American populations. That could help her in the general election: Cities and urban suburbs tend to be battleground areas, and Mrs. Clinton needs to maintain high levels of minority support.

However, Mrs. Clinton Lost Ground, Too Compared with 2008, Mrs. Clinton won far fewer rural counties with lots of white, non-Hispanic residents. She also won fewer college towns. Those results, along with her struggle to beat Mr. Sanders among white voters overall, could suggest a weakness in the general election. Republicans tend to win white voters, and presumed GOP nominee Donald Trump is particularly strong among lower-income white voters.
