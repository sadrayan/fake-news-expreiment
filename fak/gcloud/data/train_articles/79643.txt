President Obama To Oprah: I Give Myself A Solid B+ (VIDEO)
On Sunday night, Oprah's Christmas at the White House special aired; during her one-on-one conversation with the president, Oprah asked Obama what grade he would give himself for his first year in office.

"A good solid B-plus," Obama answered, and went on to explain how he arrived at this mark. "I think we have inherited the biggest set of challenges of any president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. We stabilized the economy... We are on our way out of Iraq. I think we've got the best possible plan for Afghanistan. We have reset our image around the world."

"And" Obama concluded, "I think that we're going to pass the most significant piece of social legislation since social security, and that's health insurance for every America."

So, Oprah pressed, why only B-plus?

"B-plus because of the things that are undone. Health care is not yet signed." The president smiled, "if I get health care passed we tip into A minus."
