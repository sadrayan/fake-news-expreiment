Russia

Since 1997 the EU's political and economic relations with Russia have been based on a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA). The Agreement aims to promote trade and investment and develop harmonious economic relations between the EU and Russia.

Since 2012, when Russia joined the WTO, EU-Russia trade relations have also been framed by WTO rules.

EU and Russia

The European Union and Russia have strong trade relations, though trade has dropped since Russia acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2012.

In 2008 the EU and Russia began negotiating a new agreement aiming at providing a comprehensive framework for bilateral trade and investment relations. In March 2014 the European Council suspended the negotiations due to the situation in Ukraine.

In 2010 Russia created a Customs Union with Kazakhstan and Belarus. This Customs Union has become the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) in 2015. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan joined the EEU the same year.

Russia and membership of the World Trade Organization

Russia joined the World Trade Organization in 2012. At that time there were high expectations that trade with Russia would be liberalised. Trade flows between the EU and Russia have steadily decreased since 2012, though – a trend observed with all Russia's main trade partners.

Five years after its accession to the World Trade Organization, Russia is still not meeting all its commitments. Russia's import substitution policy launched in 2014 puts in question its willingness to comply with World Trade Organization rules. The EU will continue to use all the available bilateral and multilateral policy instruments, as appropriate, to make sure World Trade Organization rules are respected. Respect for them is a key element for improving trade and investment relations with Russia in the long term.

The EU has filed four disputes in the World Trade Organization against Russia since it joined in August 2012:

2014 on Russia's excessive import duties . The World Trade Organization confirmed that Russia's import duties violated its rules. Since May 2017, Russia has lowered its import duties on the tariff lines challenged in line with its World Trade Organization commitments.
