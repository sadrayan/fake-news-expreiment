Governor Cuomo Raises Minimum Wage for State Workers to $15 Per Hour - Making New York First in Nation to Enact $15 State Public Sector Minimum Wage
Approximately 10,000 state employees will be benefited by the Governor’s action, including those in all Executive Agencies, the Legislature, the Judiciary, and the independently elected agencies of the Department of Law and the Office of State Comptroller. Approximately 9,000 employees are outside of New York City, and 1,000 within New York City.



This change will be reflected in the State’s Budget Policy and Reporting Manual. When fully phased in on July 1, 2021, this wage increase has an annual projected cost of roughly $20.6 million, including the anticipated effect of fringe benefits.



This increase, which was announced by the Governor at a rally for low-wage workers in New York City, will be implemented on the same phased-in schedule currently underway for fast food workers. That schedule is as follows:

New York City Statewide (excluding NYC) Min. Wage Effective Date Min. Wage Effective Date $10.50 12/31/2015 $9.75 12/31/2015 $12.00 12/31/2016 $10.75 12/31/2016 $13.50 12/31/2017 $11.75 12/31/2017 $15.00 12/31/2018 $12.75 12/31/2018 $13.75 12/31/2019 $14.50 12/31/2020 $15.00 7/1/2021

Governor Cuomo has consistently fought to increase the minimum wage in New York State. In 2013, the Governor signed legislation that raised the minimum wage from $7.25 to its current level of $8.75. That legislation included another incremental increase to $9.00 that will take effect by the end of 2015. Additionally, the State Department of Labor empaneled a wage board last July focusing on tipped workers. The Governor’s administration ultimately accepted that wage board’s recommendations, setting the stage for an increase in wages for tipped workers from $4.90, $5.00 and $5.65 to $7.50 per hour on December 31, 2015.
