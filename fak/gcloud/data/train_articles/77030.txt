Marijuana Research with Human Subjects
Conducting clinical research using marijuana involves interactions with several federal agencies. This includes: obtaining the marijuana for research from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) within the National Institutes of Health or another Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)-registered source; review of an investigational new drug (IND) application and the research protocol by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and an investigator registration and site licensure by the DEA. Specifically:

Typical Process for Conducting Research with Marijuana

Step 1: Sponsor obtains pre-IND number from FDA.

Step 2: Sponsor contacts NIDA or another DEA-registered source of marijuana to obtain information on the specific strains of marijuana available, so that all necessary chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information can be included in the IND application.

Step 3: Sponsor contacts DEA for registration application and Schedule 1 license.

Step 4: If applicable, Sponsor obtains from NIDA as Letter of Authorization (LOA) to reference CMC information in NIDAâ€™s Drug Master File (DMF) on file with FDA.

Step 5: Sponsor sends copy of IND/protocol, including a LOA to reference CMC information in a Drug Master File (if applicable), to FDA and DEA.

Step 6: FDA reviews the IND.

Step 7: Sponsor contacts NIDA or another DEA-registered source to obtain the marijuana after the FDA completes its review of the IND, and the DEA registration is received.
