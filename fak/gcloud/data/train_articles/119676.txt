Building a semi human powered flying device
Last couple of weeks were insane. After the last video was posted on Youtube, loads of people got interested in the Human Birdwings project. I noticed that many people started to explore the story behind the wings on my blog, Youtube channel, Facebook and Twitter. Itâ€™s good to see that the discussions on the wings are still going and that many people got inspired by the concept.

For me this project was all about an ancient dream, the seamingly impossible and pushing the limits of human capabilities and technical applications. I am happy that a lot of people wanted to dismiss scientific boundaries for a moment and allowed themselves to share the dream with me.

Thanks for all your input and interest last months, let us never stop dreaming!
