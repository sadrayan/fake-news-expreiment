Blog Archive Jets restructuring Cromartie’s contract «
The Jets are restructuring the remaining year on CB Antonio Cromartie‘s contract to provide him some upfront money, according to a league source.

Cromartie, whom the Jets acquired in a trade with the Chargers on Thursday, has one year left on his current contract and has been dealing with some off-the-field and financial issues, including owing back payments to a former agent.

The Jets are converting part of Cromartie’s $1.7 million salary for 2010 into a bonus (roughly $500,000), which he would receive now, rather than waiting until September, when players begin to receive their game checks.

The Jets haven’t made a move to extend Cromartie’s contract to this point, and they don’t intend to do so before 2010.
