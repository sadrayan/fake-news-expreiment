...we prepared a comprehensive research report on Sen. Cruz and his record on LGBT issues. Sen Cruz has made his opposition to marriage equality clear on numerous occasions (noted in the document) but that quote in the meme is also not in our backgrounder. You can find that backgrounder here: http://www.hrc.org/2016RepublicanFacts/ted-cruz

Feel free to let me know if you think you found something contrary.

Best,

Brandon
