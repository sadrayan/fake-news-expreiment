McDonald's Hoax
It's Not Our Email!

An email message that makes negative remarks about the McDonald's restaurant chain has been in wide circulation for several years now. We want anyone receiving such an email to know that Texas Cattle Feeders Association is not associated with it in any way. The email makes a false claim when it identifies Texas Cattle Feeders Association as the original source of the message. No such message has ever been put out by our organization. Unfortunately, we do not know the identity or motive of the person or persons making this improper use of our name.
