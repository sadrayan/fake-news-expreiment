2017-2022 OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program
As required by the OCS Lands Act, a new Program—to cover the years 2017-2022—has been developed and approved.

The first step in the development process, a Request for Information (RFI), was published in the Federal Register on June 16, 2014, with a 45-day comment period that was extended by 15 days and closed on August 15, 2014.

The Draft Proposed Program (DPP), was the first proposal in the staged preparation process of the new Program. The DPP was published on January 29, 2015, with a 60-day comment period that closed on March 30, 2015.

On March 15, 2016, the second proposal, the Proposed Program (PP), was published with a 90-day comment period that closed on June 1, 2016.

On November 18, 2016, the final proposal, the Proposed Final Program (PFP), was published. The PFP schedules 11 potential lease sales in two program areas in all or parts of 4 OCS planning areas: 10 sales in the combined Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Program Area, and one sale in the Cook Inlet Program Area offshore Alaska (See Lease Sale Schedule). No lease sales are scheduled for the Pacific or Atlantic OCS.

Sixty days after the transmittal of the Proposed Final Program to the President and Congress, the Secretary approved the 2017-2022 Program.
