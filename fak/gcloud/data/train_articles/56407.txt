Vice President Joe Biden's roaming right hand captured in White House reporter's Facebook photo
It appears Vice President Joe Biden wasn’t paying much attention to all the negative press his boss got last week for taking selfies with Denmark Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt during a ceremony honoring Nelson Mandela.

A photo that The Hill's White House correspondent Amie Parnes posted to her Facebook page of a Christmas party appears to show Biden with his right hand perilously close to an off-limits area of the reporter’s body -- and her hands tensely holding the border.

Although Parnes has a smile on her face, she seems to be blocking Biden's hands from moving any farther.

This isn’t the first time Biden’s busy hands have gotten him in trouble.

During a September 2012 campaign stop in Ohio, Biden embraced an aging female biker for an amount of time that her male companions found to be inappropriate.

“I told him he was so handsome, so good-looking, that I was not going to let go of him," Jan Queen said afterward.

“Will you write a note to my wife and tell her that?” Biden quipped.
