Claire Flip-Flops on Sanctuary Cities
Yesterday, Claire McCaskill flip-flopped on her position regarding federal funding for sanctuary cities. When she wasn’t up for re-election, McCaskill voted with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic establishment to protect sanctuary cities.

THEN: In July 2016 and October 2015, McCaskill voted against bringing a bill to the Senate floor that would make sanctuary cities ineligible for certain federal law enforcement grants.

NOW: But in an election year, Claire voted to limit federal funding to sanctuary cities.

The Hill: “Democratic Sens. Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) — who are each up for reelection in states won by Trump — supported the measure.”

Claire – “The Pretender” – is back in action.

“Claire McCaskill’s latest flip-flop shows how nervous she is about facing Missouri voters this fall. The truth is that on issues ranging from illegal immigration to tax cuts to the Supreme Court, Claire’s liberal record is fundamentally out of step with Missouri, and voters will see through these election-year games and send her packing this November,” said Brian Rogers, Executive Director, Missouri Rising Action.
