petition: Demand Donald Trump be banned from entering Canada for promoting hate propaganda, Canada
We, the undersigned concerned Canadians, demand that Donald Trump be prevented from entering into Canada due to his widespread and well-documented hate propaganda against a number of minorities in Canada in direct violation of Canadian Criminal code section 319.



Public incitement of hatred



319. (1) Every one who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace is guilty of



(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or



(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.



Willful promotion of hatred



(2) Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of:



(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or



(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.



Under no circumstances should a proponent of hate with such a large following and access to massive financial assets be allowed to enter into our nation where he could possibly influence or found hate groups through funding or endorsement. Please sign the petition to keep Donald Trump out of Canada!
