For Our Daughters Coalition Renews Call for Elected Officials to Stand Strong on WPRO AM Radio Boycott

We are calling on elected officials, candidates, and other state leaders to stand strong on their WPRO AM advertising and talk radio show boycott while John DePetro remains on the air. We will be launching an education campaign to remove John DePetro from the airwaves, with the focus being on WPROâ€™s advertisers.

For Our Daughters Coalition releases campaign video detailing John Depetro's "History of Hate"

This campaign began because WPRO talk show host John Depetro called a group of nurses and classroom teachers 'whores.' But it goes beyond that. This was not a one time incident. Depetro has a long history of degrading not just women, but also minorities and gay people. Watch our latest video detailing John Depetro's "History of Hate."
