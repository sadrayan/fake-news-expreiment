Keeping Families Connected
Southwest Airlines has always put People first. The Purpose of our Airline is to connect People to what is important in their lives, and there is nothing more important to us than family. While we do not have evidence that tickets purchased for Southwest flights have been utilized to transport detained children, we do not wish to have involvement in the process of separating children from their parents. Therefore, we appeal to anyone making those types of travel decisions not to utilize Southwest Airlines. We are a Company founded on love, and we want to connect People to what is important in their lives, not disconnect them.
