How do I get a free state ID card?
YOU CAN GET A WISCONSIN STATE ID CARD FOR FREE.

To get a free ID card, you will need to take a few documents to your Division of Motor Vehicles office.

There's a long list of documents you can use below, but most people will be fine with a certified birth certificate, a Social Security card and a utility bill or cell phone bill. You'll notice that some records, like a certified birth certificate, satisfy more than one category.

Just be sure to bring originals — photocopies don’t work — and check the box that says “ID for Free” on your application. Once it’s complete, you’ll get a receipt that you can use at the polls until your state ID arrives by mail.

If you do not have a birth certificate or other documents, you can still obtain a document for voting that is valid for 180 days after one visit to the DMV using its petition process, known as IDPP. Download a one-page palm card explaining IDPP.
