Health-Care Reform: What You Should Know
Anti-choice lawmakers used health-care reform to attack a woman's right to choose.

In November, Reps. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) and Joe Pitts (R-Penn.) introduced an anti-choice amendment to the health-care reform bill that makes it virtually impossible for private insurance companies that participate in the new system to offer abortion coverage to women. The amendment passed by a vote of 240-194.

Pro-choice Americans were outraged. More than 97,000 people signed a petition imploring Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to keep the Stupak-Pitts language out of the Senate health-reform bill. Our voices were heard, and the bill that was introduced did not contain the Stupak-Pitts abortion-coverage ban.

However, anti-choice senators did not let up. Although the Senate voted by a 54-45 margin to table a similar abortion-ban amendment, essentially defeating it, Sen. Ben Nelson's dangerous provision that would jeopardize women's abortion coverage was passed in the final bill.

The House passed health-reform legislation that included Sen. Nelson's dangerous provision on March 21. In a statement, Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said the organization "determined that, because of the egregious abortion-coverage restrictions, we could not endorse this bill. But, because the measure has other very positive provisions for reproductive health, we couldn't in good conscience call for the bill's outright defeat and thus deny millions of American women and men the promise of better—although imperfect—access to health-care services that are important to our pro-choice values."
