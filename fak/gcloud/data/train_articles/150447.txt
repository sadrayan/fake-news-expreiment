Gluteofemoral body fat as a determinant of metabolic health
Adipose tissue is known to secrete several hormones termed adipokines. The term ‘adipokines’ accounts for the common source of these hormones57 but does not take into consideration that they are in fact secreted by different cell types within the tissue. Thus, while adipokines such as adiponectin and leptin are produced by adipocytes, interleukins are secreted mainly by resident macrophages. Wherever they come from, adipokines are part of a signalling cascade that is only partly understood, allowing for the communication between adipose tissue and other organs, primarily brain and liver. The existence of such a communication network is not surprising given the tissue's central role in fat storage and release and the need for coordination and control of appetite, hunger and satiety, which are subject to central regulation. The question that arises is whether the protective properties of lower-body fat are associated with a beneficial profile in its adipokine metabolism.

Differences in expression of adipokine genes and in secretion in vitro are well established when comparing subcutaneous and visceral fat.11, 58 However, little is known regarding differences between upper- and lower-body fat.

Leptin

One of the first adipokines discovered was leptin, a 16-kDa protein that is mainly secreted by adipocytes as a product of the LEP gene.59, 60 Leptin is thought to be pivotal in energy metabolism by regulating appetite and energy intake as a function of fat mass.61 Leptin levels are associated with the subcutaneous rather than the visceral fat depot and leptin mRNA is more abundant in subcutaneous adipocytes.6, 58, 62 Leptin secretion in vitro is higher in subcutaneous adipocytes compared with visceral adipocytes and this secretion rate correlates well with serum leptin levels.63 There are no studies that have compared regional leptin mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue; however, there are indirect suggestions that basal expression does not differ between abdominal and gluteofemoral fat.64, 65 Serum leptin increases in parallel with BMI and, interestingly, is higher in women.66, 67, 68, 69, 70 The sexual dimorphism in circulating leptin levels is apparent already in childhood71, 72 and has been attributed to differences in subcutaneous fat mass and adipocyte cell size.73, 74 But could gender differences in body fat distribution be indicative of a differential leptin production between depots? Leptin levels correlate with leg fat mass and hip circumference75, 76, 77 and, in obesity, are negatively correlated to waist-to-hip ratio.66, 78, 79 In men, interstitial leptin concentrations, as measured by microdialysis, are higher in subcutaneous femoral than abdominal fat.80 This is further supported by the finding that the leg is a net leptin producer, when measured directly.81 When comparing android to gynoid obesity, differences can be found in circadian serum leptin levels, with higher amplitude of secretion in lower-body obesity.82, 83 However, despite these associations a direct differential involvement of either depot remains to be proven. Given leptin's role as a feedback signal with regards to body fat mass and a modulator of metabolic processes,84 it remains speculative whether there is any special association with the lower-body fat depot. This is an area that needs further investigation.

Adiponectin

A beneficial association has also been shown for another adipokine—adiponectin. Adiponectin is exclusively secreted by adipocytes and is negatively correlated to body fat mass, that is, its serum levels are decreased in obesity.85, 86, 87 Interestingly, higher adiponectin levels are related to better glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity, a more favorable lipid profile and reduced inflammation in healthy individuals88, 89 and diabetic patients.90 Thus, it is believed that adiponectin provides a link between obesity and the development of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.91 Accordingly, regarding the influence of gluteofemoral body fat, adiponectin levels are positively associated with leg fat mass.92 Moreover, higher gluteofemoral fat mass results in higher adiponectin levels and increased insulin sensitivity.16, 93 There is a negative association between adiponectin and waist-to-hip ratio, central fat mass accumulation and visceral fat mass.6, 88, 94, 95, 96, 97 Further, in vitro studies have shown that adiponectin protein content and mRNA expression are lower in visceral adipocytes98 and that with increasing visceral fat mass adiponectin secretion from those cells is decreased, whereas secretion rates from subcutaneous adipocytes remain unaffected.99 There is also a differential expression pattern of adiponectin receptor 1 with high levels of expression in subcutaneous fat. Although there are no data regarding differences in adiponectin receptor expression levels between the upper- and lower-body fat depot, it is of interest that subcutaneous receptor expression is reduced in obesity and can be restored by weight loss.100 In summary, a favorable adiponectin profile could be facilitated by an increased lower-body fat depot.

Inflammatory cytokines

Alongside the ‘classic’ adipokines leptin and adiponectin, several so-called inflammatory cytokines have been identified to be secreted by adipose tissue. This is recognized as one of the links between obesity and the development of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and diabetes, because inflammatory processes are part of the pathophysiology of these diseases. The most widely analyzed cytokines are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).

TNF-α is secreted by many different cell types, including adipocytes, as a 17-kDa protein, which is derived by cleavage from an initially synthesized 26-kDa transmembrane monomeric protein.101, 102 Although adipocytes are capable of secreting TNF-α, it is now recognized that the main proportion of TNF-α secreted by adipose tissue originates from adipose tissue-resident macrophages and other cells of the stromavascular fraction.103 TNF-α is a strong inducer of lipolysis104 and data from rodents and humans support a role in the development of insulin resistance.105, 106, 107 The latter, however, has been challenged by others108 and although TNF-α levels are increased in obesity,109, 110 there is little direct release from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue in vivo.111 Interestingly, in a similar set of studies it was found that abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue releases the soluble TNF receptor type 1 and that its levels correlate with BMI.112 Given that there is no association between body fat distribution and serum levels of TNF-α,113, 114 one could hypothesize that it is the secreted levels of soluble TNF receptor type 1, which determine the adverse properties of TNF-α in abdominal obesity.115 However, because there are no data regarding TNF-α secretion by lower-body fat depots, this remains to be further analyzed.

IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that, similarly to TNF-α, is secreted by a variety of cells and tissues,116 including adipose tissue. There, it is secreted both from adipocytes and stromavascular fraction cells and secretion levels correlate positively with obesity.117, 118 Systemic plasma levels of IL-6 correlate with visceral fat mass and there is a weak negative association with increasing thigh fat area.119 There are no studies comparing regional IL-6 production between upper- and lower-body fat, but direct regional in vivo measurement of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor concentrations showed abdominal tissue to release IL-6 but not its receptor.111, 112 Although insulin-resistance and cardiovascular disease are viewed as partly low-grade chronic inflammatory processes, the IL-6 role in the development of insulin-resistance remains controversial.120 There is a current lack of data on regional IL-6 release and this is an area of future research.

Other adipokines

Currently, there are several other adipokines known and some of them show interesting correlations between systemic levels and body fat distribution parameters. For instance, plasma levels of retinol-binding protein 4, a protein released from adipocytes and associated with insulin resistance,121 correlate with trunk fat mass.122, 123 Further, serum vaspin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, shows an interesting sexual dimorphism with levels higher in women.124 For these, and for other emerging adipokines, little is known regarding the specific role of regional adipose tissue in their production, secretion and function in human metabolism.
