Canada's Free Trade Agreements
An FTA enables you to compete on a more even playing field with local firms in the FTA partner country. Under an FTA, a range of Canadian goods and services benefit from the reduction or elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, such as quotas or technical barriers. It is important to note that each FTA covers different industry sectors and contains different provisions, depending on the FTA partner. For example, some of Canada’s more recent FTAs go beyond “traditional” trade barriers to cover business practices in labour mobility, intellectual property and investment.
