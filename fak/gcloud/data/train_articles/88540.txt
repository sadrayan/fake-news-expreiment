Conservatives link IRS mess to Obamacare - Ginger Gibson
Conservative lawmakers and tea party advocates Thursday sought to link the IRS scandal to efforts to repeal Obamacare, even acknowledging the potential of impeachment.

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) made the leap from Benghazi to the IRS scandal to Obamacare, a progression she said was all related. At a packed press conference, she argued that the IRS will now be able to access individuals' health records because they are tasked with overseeing compliance with the new law.

reset Obama on IRS: 'Inexcusable'

“Could there potentially be political implications regarding health care? Access to health care? Denial of health care? Will that happen based upon a person’s political beliefs or a person’s religiously held beliefs?” Bachmann said, later adding that the IRS could “blackmail” people.

Bachmann stopped short of saying that Obama should be impeached, but when asked, said that option shouldn’t be dismissed.

“As I have been home in my district, the 6th District of Minnesota, there isn’t a weekend that hasn’t gone by that someone says to me, ‘Michele, what in the world are you all waiting for in Congress? Why aren’t you impeaching the president? He’s been making unconstitutional actions since he came into office,’” Bachmann said.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also used the IRS scandal to shed doubt on implementation of the health care law.

“I’m a physician. I’m quite worried about the privacy of medical records,” he said. “I’m quite worried that your medical records now will be evaluated by the IRS.”

The House will vote again Thursday to repeal Obamacare, the 37th time the chamber has taken up a repeal or replacement bill.
