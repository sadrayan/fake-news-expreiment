Origins: On 18 November 2014, the web site Satira Tribune published an article titled “Ronda Rousey Beats Up 5 Muggers In LA Parking Lot”; Top Rated Viral republished the story on 1 December 2015. The original claimed:

After a night out in Downtown Los Angeles, UFC fighter Ronda Rousey was confronted by a group of five muggers in a parking lot. She proceeded to put two of them in the hospital, and all five were arrested and charged with attempted robbery and assault with deadly force.

Rousey, coming off her first UFC loss that cost her the woman’s championship belt to Holly Holm, was leaving Perch restaurant at 11 pm and walking to her car when five men surrounded her in a dark parking lot and attempted to rob her of her purse and car.

“They yelled to hand over my purse and keys or they’d kill and rape me. That’s when I got super pissed off and instantly went into my fighting stance,” Rousey told the Los Angeles Times. “I was already in a bad mood and they had no idea what type of badass chick they were dealing with.”
