To those who accused us that we are anti-vaccination, and we're fake news: Get your facts and decide after considering all sides of the issue.



We're not against vaccination, but the question is if we're over-vaccinating our children. There has been a

414% increase In vaccines given to U.S. Children: In 1950, your child would have received 7 vaccines by the age of 6. Letâ€™s fast forward to 2013.



If you follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) endorsed annual childhood vaccine schedule, your child will receive over 36 vaccines by the time they are 6 years of age!



Are we over-vaccinating our children?



Before you see the dramatic increase in the vaccines given to children, please take a look at how many vaccines are given to children in the United States compared with other countries around the world.



Just think about it!



Yes! With every vaccine and every medication, your body receives some unwanted chemicals. There's no exception. If the value of what you're getting is more than the side effects, then go for it. If you're a high risk person, the benefit of a vaccine may be more than its disadvantages. It's a case-by-case issue! But don't push everyone to follow your opinion.
