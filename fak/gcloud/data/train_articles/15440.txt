November 4 is marked with demonstrations and speeches, although former President Khatami (1997-2005) limited those events while he was in office. I have never heard it referred to as "Death to America" day. Nor, as far as I am aware, does it have the status of "national holiday" during which presumably offices and schools would be closed.
