We have information on twelve states that in some way regulate voter registration in high schools- California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The only one with a law that is like the Texas law is North Carolina. The North Carolina statute (N.C.G.S.A. § 163-82.23) requires that “Every public high school shall make available to its students and others who are eligible to register to vote the application forms… and shall keep a sufficient supply of the forms so that they are always available.”

Colorado has a law that is somewhat similar – High school principals or other school officials may (not shall as in the Texas statute) serve as deputy registrars, and “A high school deputy registrar may have available an official application form for voter registration for each student who is eighteen years of age or who will be eighteen years of age at the time of the next election.”

Georgia and Rhode Island also have laws which address voter registration drives in high schools. The Rhode Island law mandates that “It shall be the duty of local boards to annually conduct a voter registration drive at each high school within the city or town in cooperation with the administration of the schools.” General Laws 1956

Gen.Laws 1956, § 17-9.1-4.1

The Georgia statute mandates that school officials provide “provide reasonable and convenient procedures to enable such persons who are qualified applicants to register” but does not prima facie require school officials to make registration forms available to students.
