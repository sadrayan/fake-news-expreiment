Michele Bachmann swipes at Michelle Obama - Amie Parnes
Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann ripped Michelle Obama on Tuesday, speculating that the first lady might one day run for office, and accusing her of trying to implement a “nanny state” based on her newest push to get mothers to breastfeed their children in order to help combat childhood obesity.

Appearing on “The Laura Ingraham Show” on Tuesday, Bachmann, a Republican, said the first lady’s agenda is “very consistent with where the hard left is coming from.”

“For them, government is the answer to every problem,” Bachmann said. “And so government got us in this problem, and so they think government is going to get us out of the problem. Clearly they’re wrong.”

Bachmann, a mother of five, said she nursed all her children. But, “to think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies? You wanna talk about the nanny state, I think you just got a new definition,” she said.

Ingraham asked whether Bachmann believed the first lady might be considering a future Senate bid, following in the footsteps of Hillary Clinton.

“She might,” Bachmann said. “Can you imagine if Laura Bush was doing that, out trying to pass her legislation? I think the media would have been after her.

But Bachmann said the mainstream media, which she called “press secretaries” are still “standing by” President Obama.

“Breastfeeding is a very personal choice for every woman,” Kristina Schake, Michelle Obama’s communications chief, told POLITICO. “We are trying to make it easier for those who choose to do it.”

Last week, the first lady told reporters that as part of her Let’s Move! campaign to combat childhood obesity, she wants to “focus on the important touch points in a child’s life.”

Among those touch points is breastfeeding. “Kids who are breastfed longer have a lower tendency to be obese,” Obama said.
