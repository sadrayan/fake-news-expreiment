Kid Rock Confirms Run for U.S. Senate
After teasing his candidacy by selling yard signs, Kid Rock has confirmed that he will be running for U.S. Senate. In a new note posted on his website, he said that he still has 15 days to file paperwork with the FEC and make his run official. “It's not a hoax, it's a strategy and marketing 101,” he writes. He also called out Michigan Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow—the incumbent who he’s challenging in next year’s election. “Senator Stabenow and I do share a love of music, although probably not the same kind,” he writes. “I concede she is better at playing politics than I am so I'll keep doing what I do best, which is being a voice for tax paying, hardworking AMERICANS and letting politicians like her know that We the People are sick and tired of their bullshit!”

Kid Rock also says that he’s planning to release new music during his campaign. “Like politicians write books during their campaigns, I'm planning on putting out music during mine and IT ALL STARTS TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT,” he writes. He later shared a 12-minute single called “Greatest Show on Earth.” Kid Rock recently shared a new website that sells merchandise with the slogan “Kid Rock for U.S. Senate.” He previously backed Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and performed at last year’s Republican National Convention. He currently sells offensive Trump-themed shirts.
