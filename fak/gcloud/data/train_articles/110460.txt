Texas to Permit Medicinal and Recreational Marijuana Use!
Austin, TX- On September 29, 2014, Texas Governor Rick Perry will be signing a new bill into law, legalizing medicinal and recreational use of marijuana for adults ages 21 or older. Bill HB 2412 will go into effect January 1, 2015. Texas is the first southern state to legalize any recreational drug. The state of Texas is expected to profit $50 million in tax revenue from marijuana sales. A state tax of 11% will be implemented on sales. In addition to the profit in tax revenue, with the legalization of the drug Texas is expected add more than 5,000 job openings ranging from farmers to dispensary agents.

The legalization of marijuana will also free up space in county jails. People will no longer go to jail if caught with marijuana. The bill states that a person must not consume the drug in public places except for places that allow the use of marijuana such as lounges, bars, cafes, and night clubs. Also certain sporting events, concerts and other outdoor facilities may permit the use of the drug at their discretion. The drug is not to be consumed while operating any type of motor vehicle. If purchasing the drug for medicinal purposes, a prescription is required if using health insurance.

Bill HB 2412 is slated to boost Texasâ€™ economy and lower criminal activity.
