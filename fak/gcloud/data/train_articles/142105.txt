Our Mission – Vibrant Body Company
Most bras, to this day, are designed as they were by men decades ago: with a wire to cinch, with breasts pushed forward.



After years of research and development, a team of top bra designers in the world, lead by women, tested over 70 prototypes to change the very architecture of how a bra supports. The final design is so innovative, it’s patented. No wires, comfortable, naturally flattering, sensual to wear, and manufactured to the highest global standards for materials, processing and social/environmental impact.



Our mission is actually awareness, with a solution that brings no harm to the wearer, the environment or the workers who manufacture. We hope to make everyone understand that what you put next to your body for hours at a time, and how you constrict any part of your body, matters to your overall health and well being. We have had many opportunities through the years to sell our technology or manufacture more cheaply with substandard materials, or in factories that pay their workers below a living wage. We’d rather stay true to our mission, to do whatever it takes to do it right.
