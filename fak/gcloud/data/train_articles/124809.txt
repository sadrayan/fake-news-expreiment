Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa
The Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa (SERI) is a non-profit human rights organisation. We work with communities, social movements, individuals and other non-profit organisations in South Africa and beyond to develop and implement strategies to challenge inequality and realise socio-economic rights.

SERIâ€™s conviction is that it is the people who are on the receiving end of poverty and inequality who are best placed to devise and implement strategies to challenge them. We provide legal advice and representation, research services and advocacy support to our clients and partners. We act to protect and expand the political spaces in which individuals and communities organise and press for social change.
