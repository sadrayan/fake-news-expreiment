Virginia elected its first openly transgender state lawmaker on Tuesday, voting Democrat Danica Roem into the state’s House of Delegates. She unseated Virginia Del. Bob Marshall, the Republican who introduced the “bathroom bill” that would have prohibited transgender students from using the bathroom of their choice.

“No matter what you look like, where you come from, how you worship, who you love, how you identify or any other inherent identifier that you have, you should be celebrated because of who you are, not despite it,” Roem said on MSNBC’s “The Last Word.”

New Jersey elected Sheila Oliver as its first female African-American lieutenant governor. Oliver is no stranger to breaking records: She became the first African-American woman to be elected as Assembly speaker in New Jersey and only the second black female speaker in U.S. history. “This may not be the first glass ceiling I have broken, but it is certainly the highest,” Oliver said during Democrat Phil Murphy’s victory party. “And I hope somewhere in this great state of New Jersey, a young girl of color is watching tonight and realizing that she does not have a limit to how high she can go.” Vi Lyles

Wilmot Collins For Mayor

Wilmot Collins arrived in Helena, Montana, 23 years ago as a refugee from Liberia.

Collins, a 54-year-old Naval reservist and child protection specialist with the Montana Department of Health and Human Services, will become the second black mayor in both Montana and Helena’s history. (The city elected its first black mayor, Edward Johnson, in 1873, the Montana Historical Society told the New York Times.)

Although Helena’s elections are nonpartisan, Collins leans Democratic and is pleased to have sent a message of defiance to President Donald Trump.

“The country is still not what Mr. Trump wants it to be,” Collins told HuffPost. “The citizens of this state and this city where I have lived for the past 23 years have spoken and they are saying we want the best candidate. They’re not looking at color, at background and creed.”

Medicaid expansion in Maine

Maine residents approved a ballot initiative Tuesday to expand Medicaid coverage under Obamacare to about 70,000 more people across the state. It’s the first time Americans voted on the issue through a referendum. It also represents a setback to Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed several previous legislative attempts at an expansion.

The Maine Democratic Party called the referendum “a tremendous victory.”

“The people of Maine have once again sent a clear message of support for affordable, accessible health care,” MDP Chair Phil Barlett said in a statement.

Maine joins 31 states, plus the District of Columbia, in passing Medicaid expansions. Efforts are also underway in Idaho and Utah to put similar measures on 2018 ballots.

The people of Maine have spoken loudly and clearly in support of more affordable health care — not less. #mepolitics pic.twitter.com/ygQThc2wl0 — Maine Democrats (@MaineDems) November 8, 2017
