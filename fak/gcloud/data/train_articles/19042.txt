Hardy votes to fund Homeland Security
WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Cresent Hardy (NV-4) today voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security through the end of fiscal year 2015.

Following passage of H.R. 240, the congressman issued the following statement:

“The president’s executive overreach on immigration is an unacceptable, unconstitutional and temporary fix to something Congress should permanently resolve. While we expect the courts’ affirmation that the president has indeed overstepped his bounds, today’s vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security ensures the men and women who defend our nation don’t find their paychecks victim to a largely political stalemate.”
