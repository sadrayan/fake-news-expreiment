Reservists are hired to a position within a cadre based on their skills and experience. View cadres and learn more about becoming a reservist.

You can apply to be a reservist by emailing your resume to fema-careers@fema.dhs.gov and include "reservist" of interest in the subject line.

Frequently Asked Questions

Are the FEMA disaster response and recovery positions paid?

Yes. These are paid positions that are being filled within our temporary Local Hire and Reservist programs.

If a position type was not listed, such as medical support, does that mean the FEMA doesnâ€™t need help in those areas?

No. If you have a specific skill that is not listed and you know will be valuable in response and recovery, please highlight on your resume and submit. You may also highlight any additional skills, such as bilingual capability.

How long are the deployments?

Deployments are 30 days at minimum can be up to 120 days depending on the job and circumstances.

Are the Hurricane Workforce positions permanent employment?

No. These are temporary positions only.

Once I submit my resume, how long will it be before I hear back?

The process time varies on position type and depends on how complete the applications are, how many applications are received and other critical needs. Applicants may hear back as early as 2-3 weeks.

How long do background checks take?

The duration of a background check is dependent on the type of security clearance required for the position being considered (i.e. public trust, secret). We have Security staff facilitating the background review process as expeditiously as possible.

Is my travel reimbursed?

Yes, for approved travel expenses. Once you are hired, you attend orientation, receive travel training and a travel credit card to use for your approved travel expenses. A written or electronic authorization is required prior to incurring any travel expense.

Will my current job salary and benefits be paid by FEMA while I am deployed?

No. If you are hired by FEMA, you will receive compensation as outlined in the tentative job offer. FEMA will not backfill, compensate or provide any assurance that your current position is held while you are deployed. These arrangements are made between you and your employer directly.

If I have a criminal record, can I still apply for a FEMA position?

A felony or criminal record does not immediately preclude you from getting hired. All employees will undergo a background check and some positions may have restrictions. Read more about ex-offender eligibility.

Where do I find out about opportunities to volunteer?

For volunteer opportunities, explore the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (NVOAD) website and read more about how to help survivors in Texas.
