Aronberg is Crist's 'rockstar'
Sen. Dave Aronberg, a Greenacres Democrat, has a fan in Gov. Charlie Crist:

"To be honest, about anything Sen. Aronberg does is important to me," Crist said when asked about Aronberg's proposal to revise state sex offender residency rules. "The guy is brilliant. He's a rockstar, and I have such great respect for him. And he's just a good, decent man. And almost everything I can think of that he's ever promoted or pushed has been something I'm able to support gladly."
