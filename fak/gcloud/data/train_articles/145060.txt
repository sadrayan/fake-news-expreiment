Racists Meltdown After Newly Elected Congresswoman Swears Oath On Thomas Jefferson's Copy Of Koran
Rashida Tliaib

Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib asked to be sworn into the House of Representatives using a Koran once owned by Thomas Jefferson in lieu of a Bible and the proverbial s*it hit the fan. To add a comic spin to the proceeding, none other than evangelical wingnut Vice President Mike Pence conducted the swearing in where this (undoubtedly to his mind) heretical request was made.

x ItÃ¢ÂÂs the book of Satan and should not be allowed in the United States they all should be gathered up and burned — R Roebuck (@RDRoebuck2) January 3, 2019

x This is a disgrace of epic proportions. It is also unlawful. I am disgusted for every soldier who ever gave their life to protect our Constitution!!! I feel sick. — Martin (@RogueLazarus) January 3, 2019

x There should be a law that you swear on a Christian Bible or not serve at all. You live in America, and our Constitution rules our Republic. Giving security clearances to non believers of our Republic lowers our Security from hostile nations!! — Fed Up AMERICAN (@FedUpAMERICAN14) January 3, 2019

These people don’t have a long memory, apparently. Twelve years ago, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) used the same Koran for his swearing in ceremony as Congress’ first Muslim member. People were freaking out then as well, arguing that only the Bible was suitable. People also don’t seem to remember that virtually every ethnic group immigrating to the United States has been the victim of prejudice at one time or other, Jews, Italians, Poles, you name it. My ancestors used to see signs in the windows “No Irish Need Apply.”

We live in interesting times, to say the very least.
