Animal welfare is very important to us. We have over 27 years experience in working with birds of prey and we have specialists on our team with knowledge on drone technology.

In nature, birds of prey often overpower large and dangerous prey. Their talons have scales, which protect them, naturally, from their victims’ bites. The Dutch National Police has asked the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) to research the possible impact on the birds’ claws. The results are not yet known. Of course, we are continuously investigating any extra possible protective measures we can take in order to protect our birds.

We are working closely with the Dutch National Police on the development of our services.
