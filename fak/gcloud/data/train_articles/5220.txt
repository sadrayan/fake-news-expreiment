End Citizens United Hires Research Director, Press Secretary
Expands Research and Communications Team Ahead of 2018 Cycle



WASHINGTON, DC — End Citizens United (ECU) today announced the hiring of Dorothy Scheeline as research director and Anne Feldman as press secretary.

Dorothy comes to ECU with an extensive background in political research as well as nonpartisan advocacy. Prior to joining ECU, Dorothy served as a senior research associate at the DSCC during the 2016 election cycle. She began her career in the nonprofit sector, including at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, an organization dedicated to advancing women’s representation in politics.

Anne joins ECU from Jason Kander’s 2016 Senate campaign where she served as press secretary. Anne was the primary spokeswoman dealing directly with all local and national media. Prior to the 2016 cycle, she worked at Derris, a brand strategy and communications agency in New York, in their strategic communications practice.

“We’re thrilled to bring Dorothy and Anne aboard. Both come to the team having worked in challenging political environments, and will play a vital role in aggressively pushing ECU’s mission to elect campaign finance reform champions and end the corrosive influence of big money in politics,” said Executive Director of End Citizens United, Tiffany Muller.

Since June 2016, ECU’s staff has more than doubled in size, as the grassroots PAC continues to make campaign finance reform a national priority. During the 2016 election cycle, ECU was one of the most significant groups in the country. It raised nearly $25 million in small-dollar donations with a $14 average contribution to help elect reform champions to Congress and was the 4th largest progressive spender in competitive Senate races.

End Citizens United was founded in March 2015 to counter the disastrous effects of theCitizens United decision and to work towards the reform of our campaign finance system.
