Department issues clarification

The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) has learned a copy of Iowa's "Facility Quarantine Order" template is being circulated on the Internet. It is not known who accessed this document. To ensure there is no confusion on this issue, IDPH wants to make it clear that Iowa has not issued any isolation and quarantine orders for novel influenza A (H1N1), and has no plans to issue any this fall.

In preparation for public health emergencies, these types of templates are often prepared in case they are needed, but isolation and quarantine orders are only very rarely used in very specific situations.

If you have any questions concerning this issue, please call the Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology, Iowa Department of Public Health at 800-362-2736.
