Donald Trump wins Florida Republican primary

Donald Trump has won the Florida Republican primary, according to three television networks.

The Manhattan real-estate mogul has effectively dealt a death blow to the campaign of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who had all but guaranteed a victory in his home state, where he had trailed by as much as 23 percentage points in recent polling.

Trump, who has made a point of mentioning that he makes Florida his second home at his Mar-a-Lago estate, cut into Rubioâ€™s home-state advantage with a barrage of attacks and negative campaign ads over the last several weeks.

Trump received a boost on Monday, his second-to-last day campaigning in the state, with the endorsement of Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Florida awards its 99 Republican delegates on a winner-take-all basis.
