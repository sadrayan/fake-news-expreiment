Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida was named Tuesday as the new chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, with President Obama selecting her to lead the party‚Äôs fund-raising and organizational efforts heading into the 2012 election cycle.

Ms. Wasserman Schultz, 44, accepted the position during an afternoon call with the president. She succeeds Tim Kaine, who served as the party‚Äôs national chairman for the last two years but announced earlier Tuesday that he is running for a Senate seat in Virginia.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. disclosed the decision to members of the Democratic National Committee, asking them to ‚Äúwelcome her as President Obama‚Äôs choice.‚ÄĚ The president, who is locked in a budget showdown with Republicans, did not publicly announce the news.

‚ÄúIn selecting Debbie to lead our party, President Obama noted her tenacity, her strength, her fighting spirit and her ability to overcome adversity,‚ÄĚ Mr. Biden said. ‚ÄúPresident Obama expressed great admiration for her as a leader, and he was honored that she accepted this important challenge on behalf of the Democratic Party.‚ÄĚ

Ms. Wasserman Schultz is known inside the party for her strong fund-raising abilities, and she represents South Florida, which will be a critical battleground in the 2012 presidential race. She also would become one of the few high-profile women to speak on television on behalf of the president and the party.

She first gained national attention during the Florida recount in the 2000 presidential campaign when she was a state legislator. She has been a rising figure in the party since being elected to Congress in 2004. She becomes one of the first women to lead the Democratic National Committee in a presidential election cycle. In recent party history, only two women have served temporary stints as party leader.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs part of the next generation of Democrats,‚ÄĚ said Jenny Backus, a longtime party strategist and former official at the Democratic National Committee.

Mr. Kaine, a former governor of Virginia, had planned to remain in his position as the Democratic national chairman. But he decided to run for the Senate after Senator Jim Webb announced his plans to not seek another term.

The party vacancy attracted several potential candidates, including former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio. He was among the finalists for the position, officials said, but heading into the 2012 presidential election year, when women voters will be among the key constituencies, the president was encouraged by advisers to select Ms. Wasserman Schultz.

Four years ago, Ms. Wasserman Schultz supported Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary fight, but she quickly switched her loyalties to Mr. Obama when he became the presumptive nominee. She campaigned aggressively on his behalf for the rest of the 2008 campaign.
