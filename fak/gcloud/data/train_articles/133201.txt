Mexican Social Security Institute
The Mexican Social Security Institute (Spanish: Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, IMSS) is a governmental organization that assists public health, pensions and social security in Mexico operating under Secretaría de Salud (Secretariat of Health).

History [ edit ]

The IMSS was founded by President Manuel Ávila Camacho on January 19, 1943, in order to satisfy the legal precepts established in the Article 123 of the Constitution. It is constituted by representations of the Workers, Employers and the Federal government.

It is the largest social institution in Latin America.[citation needed]

For some time, however, there have been festering signs of trouble in IMSS, not the least being serious financial problems that came to a head in early November 2010.

Mexican Social Security Law [ edit ]

The Mexican Social Security law currently in effect, published in the Official Journal of the Federation (21 December 1995), is the legislative domain under which the IMSS carries out its operations.

Currently the law indicates that Social Security has the following purposes:

Medical assistance

Protection of basic necessities of subsistence

Social services necessary for individual and collective well-being

Giving out a pension which, depending on the completion of the legal prerequisites, will be guaranteed by the State

The law contemplates two domains, an "obligatory" one (funded by individual, employer and state contributions), and a "voluntary" one (aimed at workers in household industries and self-employed professionals).

The following items are excluded from the base quoted salary:

Tools of trade such as tools and clothing

Savings deposits, when they are made up of a weekly, biweekly or monthly deposit equally from the worker and the employer

Additional voluntary contributions

Contributions to INFONAVIT

Food and lodging when they are given in an onerous manner

Payments in coin or cash

Rewards for attendance and punctuality

Overtime, within limits established by law
