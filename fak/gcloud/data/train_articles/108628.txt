Update!

...is where I went for a while recently.In fact, I was South of aof borders...inThe first place I stayed was the Hotel Santo Tomas in San José, which is the capital city:This had been a huge mansion at one time, but has since been converted into a hotel. It was undergoing a lot of renovation when I stayed there, but my room was fine. There was a nice little restaurant in the hotel, too.Within easy walking distance of the hotel were numerous points of interest, as one might expect in the capital of a country.The first spot I checked out was a national park:It wasn't a National Park along the lines of a Yellowstone or Yosemite, for example, but they do have (and I) a number of those as well. More on that later.After visiting the park, I meandered around an old part of the city:It's actually a nice and quaint kind of place.Eventually, I went to the national zoo:That was also within easy walking distance of the hotel.Thepasses through town, and runs along the zoo:It's really a pretty little municipality.Other than in the zoo, there's some cool wildlife:Those guys are pretty mellow, unless you get too close.(In which case they tend to scramble away)OK, as previously mentioned, Arenal National Park:I found it rather amusing that they had several signs stating that it was a "high volcanic risk" area, considering the fact that the most recent lava flow there was in 1992. I realize that's a very brief span in geological terms, but generally speaking I'd have to consider it quite safe. There is some genuine volcanic activity going on at the Poas Volcano, but I only saw that venting steam from my flight back out of the country.Anotheris Marino Las Baulas There's a(big beach) there:This is a popular nesting area for sea turtles, in fact.After the hotel stay came the resort.Here's a view from there, looking out over the Pacific:They had beach access a short walk from my condo.The lastI went to was Monteverde It's called, which means "cloudy forest" inIt truly is a cloudy forest, most of the time:I think that's a pretty decent photograph, myself.Last, but not least, I visited my "hometown":Well, not really, but the name isclose...More pictures posted
