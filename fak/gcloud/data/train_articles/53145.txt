Culinary goes hard after Lee on behalf of Kihuen in CD4 primary
Saying community activist Susie Lee is "part of the wealthy elite" and is "trying to purchase" Cresent Hardy's congressional seat, the Culinary Union has penned a letter to its labor brethren to try to help state Sen. Ruben Kihuen.

The letter, which is below and penned by Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Arguello-Kline in advance of the AFL-CIO convention, says quite simply of Lee, "We can't let her buy this primary."

It is the strongest sign yet of how all in the Culinary is for Kihuen, and how much he (and the union) consider Lee, who has raised by far the most money, as the biggest threat to him. So the goal will be to portray her as one of "them" and him as one of "us."

Game on.
