Iowa Seeks Federal Approval of Health Insurance Stopgap Measure
Proposed Stopgap Measure Ensures 72,000 Iowans Have Access to Health Insurance in 2018

(Des Moines) –Iowa’s Insurance Division has proposed a Stopgap Measure to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure all Iowans have access to health insurance in 2018. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has left Iowa’s individual health insurance market without a participating carrier in 2018. Iowans throughout all 99 counties will likely be left without access to purchase health insurance on the individual market. Iowa needs an individual market that works in all of Iowa’s 99 counties. The proposed Stopgap Measure is the only solution in which a health insurance carrier has committed to sell health insurance in every county of Iowa’s individual market. The proposed measure will provide consumers with age- and income-based tax credits and will utilize a reinsurance mechanism for costly medical claims.

"Iowa’s individual health market has collapsed as result of the Affordable Care Act. The proposed Stopgap Measure is the only proposal ensuring that health insurance will be sold to those utilizing Iowa’s individual market in all of Iowa’s 99 counties in 2018. We are hopeful multiple carriers will participate to offer Iowans choices,” Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen said. “Iowa needs CMS to approve the Proposed Stopgap Measure quickly. We are optimistic CMS will approve Iowa’s Stopgap Measure, but without CMS approval, 72,000 Iowans will be uninsured.”
