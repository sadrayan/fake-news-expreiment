The Harris County Medical Society (HCMS), established in 1903, is the professional society for physicians in Harris County. It is the largest county medical society in the nation, with a membership of more than 11,000 physicians and medical students.

Its mission is to be the leading advocate for its member physicians, their patients and the community, in promoting the best standards of ethical medical practice, access to quality medical care, medical education, research, and community health. Its vision is to be the premier advocate, empowering physicians for leadership service in activities that benefit the community and support the medical profession.

HCMS represents three out of four physicians devoted to active patient care in Harris County and provides legislative and socioeconomic advocacy as well as public health education and services to its members.

In 1915, HCMS incorporated the Houston Academy of Medicine (HAM) to support the greater Houston community and the service, education, scientific, and charitable programs of the Harris County Medical Society. Major health education and community health projects of HCMS and HAM have included:
