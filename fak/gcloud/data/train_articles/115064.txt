Know Your Ingredients: DMDM Hydantoin
What it is

DMDM Hydantoin is a white and crystalline solid substance.

What it does

DMDM Hydantoin is very used in cosmetic and personal care products as a preservative. It kills and prevents the growth of bacteria, yeast and fungi, thus protecting products from going bad. It works by releasing formaldehyde.

Side effects

Although, DMDM Hydantoin releases formaldehyde, which is irritanting and carcinogenic, this preservative is generally considered to be safe. That’s because the amount of formaldehyde DMDM Hydantoin releases is limited to 0.2%, too small to cause any health problems. In addition, in the European Union, DMDM Hydantoin can only be used in concentrations up to 0.6%. However, this preservative can cause irritations in people with sensitive skin.
