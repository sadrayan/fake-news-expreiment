A class action lawsuit has been filed against the four largest commercial air passenger carriers in the United States—American Airlines, Inc., Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., and United Airlines, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”), claiming that Defendants, along with US Airways and Continental Airlines, conspired to increase fares by limiting capacity on domestic flights.

Southwest has agreed to pay $15 million and American has agreed to pay $45 million to settle this nationwide litigation. Southwest and American have also agreed, as part of the Settlements, to provide certain cooperation to Plaintiffs in this litigation. Southwest and American deny that they did anything wrong and have asserted defenses to Plaintiffs’ claims. They have settled to avoid the considerable cost, burden, and distraction of this litigation.

The Settlements are on behalf of persons and entities who purchased air passenger transportation services for flights within the United States and its territories and the District of Columbia from American, Delta, Southwest, United, Continental, or US Airways at any time between July 1, 2011 and December 20, 2017 for the Southwest Settlement and between July 1, 2011 and June 14, 2018 for the American Settlement.

The lawsuits are continuing against Delta and United.
