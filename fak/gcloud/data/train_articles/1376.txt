Selling of Florida may be tougher because of budget cuts

FOR THE RECORD - ********** CORRECTION OR CLARIFICATION PUBLISHED MAY 29, 2008 ********** The continuation of an article about Florida's economic-development marketing on Page C2 of Wednesday's Central Florida Business section may have left unclear the status of the state's Innovation Incentive Fund. The Legislature eliminated all money for the fund in the 2008-09 fiscal year, but the fund itself still exists. *************************************************************************

But some economists and educators question that assertion. A slumping economy has meant less tax revenue to fund mass transit, operate schools and provide incentives to would-be corporate transplants. All of that, they say, will make the job of selling Florida more difficult starting in July.

Florida's principal economic-development agency says a 5 percent cut in its annual operating budget next fiscal year won't hamper its efforts to lure businesses to the state.

Enterprise Florida, a public/private agency, will receive $11.9 million from the state in fiscal 2008-09, or $600,000 less than it currently collects and $3.6 million less than it requested. Stuart Doyle, spokesman for the Orlando-based agency, said the reduction imposed by state lawmakers won't impair operations.

"We think the Legislature really understands our mission, and we are thankful that we came out as we did," Doyle said. "There is an understanding of the role Enterprise Florida plays in the state."

But Doyle acknowledges that, even though most of the agency's operating funds were preserved, its tools for selling Florida have new limits.

Education funding was slashed, forcing schools and universities to cut budgets, reduce enrollments and eliminate staff. Public schools will lose $332 million in the budget sent to Gov. Charlie Crist -- a cut that amounts to $131 for each student. That's on top of two years of reductions that sliced $185 per student.

Educators worry that the cuts will impair efforts to improve education. But they also have an effect on business development; companies are less likely to move to or expand in a state with an education system that's falling in nationwide rankings, which makes it harder to find skilled workers or recruit out-of-state talent.

Other state programs, including funds for Central Florida's long-sought commuter rail project and an allocation to develop the state's film-and-television industry, were also hit as the Legislature grappled with revenue shortfalls, the result of a slowing economy and a battered residential real-estate market.

State officials argue that cutting programs is unavoidable, but critics worry about lasting damage.

"Florida obsesses about being a lower-cost place for doing business," University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith said. "But the business environment depends on other things, like the quality of education, the road system and crime rates."

David Denslow, a University of Florida economist who advises the Legislature on fiscal matters, said budget cuts only add to some of the state's long-standing business-development problems. Among them: Its continuing appeal to increasingly affluent retirees.

"The problem is that retirees will control the political process," Denslow said. "And we don't know how concerned retirees will be about education." Even after the economic downturn eases and the real-estate market stabilizes, fixed-income retirees might not support costly programs that are important to business.

"Our K-through-12 educational system has to be good enough so that managers of the businesses we want to attract will want to send their children to it," Denslow said. "Businesses are also concerned about the quality of the graduates. Retirees might not be so concerned."
