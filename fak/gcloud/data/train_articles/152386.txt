Why the frick is Jane Goodall alive??? : Glitch
I was just reading the news online -this morning- and came across an article of Jane Goodall calling the president a chimp.

I immediately had to call my mom and tell her I got Mandela'd. I explained seeing the article to her and my memories of what happened to Jane Goodall. "She was killed by poachers-"

"In the jungle," my mom finished.

"You remember it, too???"

"Yeah."

She asked me to send her a link to the article.

That's two people right there who remember that Jane Goodall died. I even watched a documentary about her life and death as a kid.

Does anyone else remember this?
