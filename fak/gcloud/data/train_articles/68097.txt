Hayworth: Gay Marriage Could Lead To Men Marrying Horses (AUDIO)
Former Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ), who is challenging Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in the Republican primary, has declared that he supports a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage — because to do otherwise could lead to a man marrying a horse.

“You see, the Massachusetts Supreme Court, when it started this move toward same-sex marriage, actually defined marriage — now get this — it defined marriage as simply, ‘the establishment of intimacy,’” said Hayworth, during an appearance on a Florida radio show on Sunday. “Now how dangerous is that? I mean, I don’t mean to be absurd about it, but I guess I can make the point of absurdity with an absurd point — I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse. It’s just the wrong way to go, and the only way to protect the institution of marriage is with that federal marriage amendment that I support.”

The incumbent McCain has opposed a federal marriage amendment, though he has supported state-level amendments in his home state of Arizona and elsewhere. So this is another issue where Hayworth is running to McCain’s right — McCain opposes gay marriage, while Hayworth really opposes gay marriage.
