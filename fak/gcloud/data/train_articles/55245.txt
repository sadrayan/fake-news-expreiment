Debate time: Bill Nelson, Rick Scott set to face off Oct. 2
U.S. Sen Bill Nelson and Gov. Rick Scott will face each other in an Oct. 2 debate in Miami.

The Nelson campaign announced the date of the first debate of Florida's U.S. Senate race — one of the most closely watched races in the nation this election cycle — and said it will take place in Miami.

The hour-long debate will be broadcast by Telemundo's stations in Miami, Fort Myers, Orlando, Tampa, West Palm and Orlando.

Scott has agreed to debate me on Telemundo Oct. 2. Finally, he's going to have to start answering for the poor job he's done as governor and how he's enriched himself in public office. – BN — Nelson for U.S. Senate (@NelsonForSenate) September 10, 2018

Nelson took to Twitter on Monday evening and said Scott "is going to have to start answering for the poor job he's done as governor and how he's enriched himself in public office."

The debate will be moderated by Telemundo 51's senior political reporter Marilys Llanos and WTVJ-NBC senior news anchor Jackie Nespral.

The Associated Press reported that the Scott campaign has agreed to hold three debates. The Nelson campaign said one of those could be sponsored by CNN and take place in mid-October.
