Bindi Irwin, daughter of the late Steve "Crocodile Hunter" Irwin, told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that an essay she wrote for Hillary Clinton's e-journal was so heavily edited that her message became twisted in the process.

Bindi, 14, said she was asked to write a 1,000-word essay on wildlife conservation and overpopulation. She submitted her work to Clinton's staff, but when the edited version was sent back, Bindi said, she hardly recognized her own words.

Bindi—a worldwide star who has penned a book series aimed at young readers, has starred in movies and TV programs and is a wildlife conservationist—told the Daily Telegraph that she decided to withdraw the essay from publication. "My words were twisted and altered and changed. I was a little bit shocked, to tell you the truth," she said.

(The paper did not mention whether it had tried to reach a staffer at the e-journal for a response.)

Bindi explained that the editing of a part about overpopulation stung the most. In the essay, she compared overpopulation on the planet with a birthday party to which 15 people are invited but 70 show up. "I was really sad, and I think it was more frustration because I'm trying so hard to get the message across and I guess some people don't want to listen," Bindi said.

Bindi's mom said her daughter even wrote a letter to Clinton's organization that said, "What happened to freedom of speech? This is my opinion, and I don't want that edited out."

Bindi, however, said she's still a fan of Clinton. "I would love to see her running for president one day because she's doing a really great job," she said.
