A language school in Croatia launched a marketing campaign featuring Melania Trump, telling potential students, "Just imagine how far you can go with a little bit of English."

The Zagreb-based American Institute, which describes itself as "a center for the promotion of the English language, American culture, and the American higher education system," put up a giant billboard featuring an image of the First Lady, who is from neighboring Slovenia, in front of the Stars and Stripes and its message to Croatians wanting to improve their language skills.

On Facebook, the institute wrote: “We entered the billboard game.”

According to Total Croatia News, the campaign is the work of Ivis Burić, who said the billboard wasn't meant to be offensive: "The message is unambiguously referring to a person who, with a little knowledge of a foreign language, has become one of the most powerful individuals on the planet."

As well as speaking English and Slovenian, Melania Trump speaks French, Serbian and German.
