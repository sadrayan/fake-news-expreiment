U.S. Murders Surged in 2015, F.B.I. Finds
Mr. Comey’s remarks have been disputed by police chiefs and criminologists, who say there is no reliable data that supports his premise.

The F.B.I. report said that about 1.2 million violent crimes occurred in 2015, up from 1.15 million in 2014. In 1996, when cities experienced a wave of violent crime, there were about 1.7 million violent crimes, according to the data.

The number of murders in 2015 was about the same as the 15,399 committed in 2009. Still, the 10.8 percent increase in the murder rate in 2015 is the most since a rise of more than 11 percent from 1967 to 1968, Dr. Rosenfeld said.

By contrast, property crimes fell 2.6 percent in 2015, according to the F.B.I. data.



Chicago, one of the cities responsible for a significant part of the nation’s homicide increase, had 411 murders in 2014 and 478 in 2015, according to the F.B.I. data.

As of late September, more than 500 people had been killed in Chicago so far this year, passing the city’s total for all of 2015, and more than 3,000 people have been shot.

Officials in Chicago have struggled to explain the uptick in killings. The law enforcement authorities point to a rising number of increasingly splintered gangs on the city’s South and West Sides, as well as an abundance of guns and what they view as weak penalties for gun violations.

Community leaders identify more profound roots for the violence, including disinvestment in neighborhoods, poverty and unemployment.
