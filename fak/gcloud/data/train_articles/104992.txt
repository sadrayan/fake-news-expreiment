Overzealous Trump haters are jumping on the bandwagon of those who think that Flynn's plea of guilty will lead to conspiracy with Russians by the President to throw the election. However, this plea means nothing and is not a step to prosecuting Trump. Flynn’s deal is great for him, and Mueller will most likely use him as someone they can go to for answers to questions as they come up in the investigation. In the end, I believe that Flynn got the best deal over Mueller.

Let me ... make this clear, if President Trump did conspire with the Russians to throw the election I will want him prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Nonetheless, we have not seen any evidence of this.

Now we have prosecutors commenting on the Logan Act; this stops private citizens from “contacting agents of foreign governments concerning any disputes or controversies with the United States.” Pres. Trump was elected but not sworn in yet, and he directed his transition team to contact foreign governments regarding specific issues that confronted him after being sworn in. This is supposedly a violation of the law and should not have occurred until he was sworn in. However, every President-elect in the past 20 years has done that, so if they attempt to prosecute President Trump, they must pursue Obama, Bush and Clinton for the same crime, this won’t happen.

In the end, if nothing comes out of this Flynn deal you have to ask yourself what Mueller's goal is? Is it to keep this investigation going until the 2018 elections? If so, this will helps Democrats get elected; then ask yourself is that collusion?
