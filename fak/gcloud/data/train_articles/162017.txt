White House Easter Egg Roll
The White House Easter Egg Roll 2017



Today is the 139th White House Easter Egg Roll! We will be live-streaming from the South Lawn of the White House, so you can follow along with the reading nook, music stage, official egg roll, and other fun events.

The White House Easter Egg Roll is a timeless White House tradition, dating back to 1878 and the presidency of President Rutherford B. Hayes. President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are honored to continue the traditions of the past, while weaving new traditions into the fabric of our Nationâ€™s history.
