Financial documents and forms for district business
Financial statements

Florida law requires that an external audit of the St. Johns River Water Management Districtâ€™s financial statements be performed by an independent certified public accountant firm to ensure that the basic financial statements of the district are fairly presented in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles. The district complies with this requirement each year through publication of the reports listed on this page.

Responsibility for the integrity, objectivity, accuracy, completeness and fairness of presentation of these basic financial statements rests with management. The basic financial statements conform with generally accepted accounting principles for governmental entities. Management is responsible for maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that district assets are protected from loss, theft or misuse.
