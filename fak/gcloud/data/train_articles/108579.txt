Worth1000 Home
Bad news - Worth1000 had a hard drive failure last night. We're really sorry about the downtime. We're working around the clock to move it to a new server and will update here when it's back online. We don't expect it to be up for a while as we transfer the files over. If you want to get in an image editing fix, we suggest trying out our sister site Aviary.com (or chiming in on the forums there).- Jax
