Valentine's Day: Israeli Burger King Offers 'Adults Meal' for One Night Only
Sometimes, the leads are better left unwritten: Burger King in Israel will offer an "Adults Meal" box in honor of Valentine's Day.

"Kid's Meal?' That's for kids," a promotional video astutely noted, before setting the mood by revealing some details about the offering.

The box, only available to those older than 18 after 6 P.M. at the Rabin Square location in Tel Aviv, will contain two Whoppers, two orders of french fries, two beers and "a romantic adult toy."

Burger King, aware that building up suspense fuels passion, did not reveal which "romantic adult toys" would be included, but a promotional video showcases a blindfold, a feather tickler and a head massager.

This isn’t Burger King's first foray into the world of themed dishes: This last Hanukkah, the chain offered a hamburger inside the traditional Hanukkah donut known in Hebrew as sufganiya called the "SufganiKing."

Cute, right?
