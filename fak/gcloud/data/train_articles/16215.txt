We are on the verge of wrapping up—and all I have from you is that the legislator mentioned the same figure in floor debate.

So, it looks to me like it’s not known how the figure was devised. That make sense?

Sorry, we’re in the middle of session, and there are a few things going on here…

I have talked to Rep. Austin.

She tells me that the figure in question is based on discussions she had with officials with the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, the Indiana Restaurant and Hotel Lodging Association, and the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce.

That is what I have…
