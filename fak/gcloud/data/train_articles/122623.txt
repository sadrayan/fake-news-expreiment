NYC officials won�t release Russian ambassador's autopsy results
An iron curtain has fallen on the autopsy results of Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, who died in New York last month, officials said Friday.

The city Medical Examiner announced it will not be releasing the cause of death for Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s combative ambassador to the United Nations, “in order to comply with international law and protocol.”

The order not to disclose came from the New York City Law Department at the behest of the State Department and the United States Mission to the United Nations, Medical Examiner spokeswoman Julie Bolcer said.

Because Churkin had diplomatic immunity, results of his autopsy should not be released, federal officials declared in two letters sent to the Mayor’s office for International Affairs.

“The United States has an obligation to take all appropriate steps to protect his dignity,” James Donovan, Minister Counselor for Host Country Affairs, stated in a letter dated March 1.

The Law Department agreed and issued a gag order, preventing the ME’s office from releasing Churkin’s autopsy results.

“The (Law Department) instructed the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to not publicly disclose the cause and manner of death of Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations,” Bolcer said in a statement. “As outlined in formal requests from the United States Department of State, Ambassador Churkin's diplomatic immunity survives his death.”

Churkin, who had been Russia’s envoy to the United Nations since 2006, died on Feb. 20, apparently of a heart attack.

He died a day before his 65th birthday.

Police arrived at Russia’s UN Mission on E. 67th St. at 9:30 a.m. and found the diplomat in cardiac arrest, sources said. He was declared dead at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell.

No foul play was immediately suspected, police sources said.

Churkin was known as a champion of Moscow who did not hesitate to highlight what he called hypocrisy inherent in U.S. foreign policy.

An initial autopsy was inconclusive, so the city medical examiner had to conduct further tests, officials said.

But now, three weeks later, all calls about the autopsy results will have to go through the United States Department of State, Bolcer said.

The Russian government raised concerns about disclosing the autopsy results after the examination had been concluded, Donovan wrote in his letter.

In a prior letter dated Feb. 24, Donovan said Churkin, “as an accredited Permanent Representative to the United Nations... enjoys complete Personal inviolability,” and that the U.S. has a “legal obligation to treat accredited diplomats with �?due respect’ and �?to take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on his person, freedom or dignity.’”

The decision not to disclose comes amid allegations that the Trump administration has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Putin’s been alleged to have critics poisoned in the past, but there is no evidence that Churkin and Putin were at odds.

Putin was “deeply upset” upon hearing about Churkin’s death.

“The head of state highly valued Churkin's professionalism and diplomatic talent," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time of the ambassador’s death.
