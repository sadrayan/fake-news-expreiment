Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Thursday he would approve a procedural motion to allow the new GOP health care bill to head for a vote next week in the Senate.

But Johnson has not yet committed to voting for the revised bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

Republicans already face an uphill struggle to bring the bill to the floor. Two GOP Senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky, said they would vote against the motion to proceed. One more GOP defection would block the bill, for now.

Johnson said there were some "good aspects" to the new bill but he wanted to wait to see how it is scored by the Congressional Budget Office.

"I want to work with the CBO to actually get better numbers and some breakout numbers as well," Johnson told reporters in Washington, D.C. "I think it informs the public better in terms of what our bill is."
