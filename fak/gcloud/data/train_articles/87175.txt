Securities & Investment
Traditionally, the securities and investment industry's political influence efforts were led by stockbrokers, bond dealers and brokerage houses, but as Wall Street itself has evolved -- and likewise Washington's interest in regulating the new frontiers of finance -- the industry's Washington money game is now dominated by the new breed: hedge funds and private investment firms.

This industry has always been an important one in Washington -- both in terms of the campaign dollars it sends to candidates and the money it spends on K Street -- but since 2012 it has become the single largest source of political contributions. In the 2012 cycle, the industry was responsible for $283 million in contributions, the vast majority coming from individuals who work in the industries, rather than corporate PACs. The emergence of wealthy individuals in this industry is hard to ignore: In 1990, the industry's corporate PACs contributed $4 million to candidates and committees, and individuals $8.5 million. The amount from PACs more than tripled by 2012, but the amount from individuals was nearly 22 times greater ($177.9 million). [Read more Background]
