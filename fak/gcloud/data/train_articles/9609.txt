Where minimum wage is going up in 2016
The once-unthinkable $15 minimum wage became a burgeoning reality in 2015.

Following the examples set by San Francisco and Seattle, 14 cities, counties and state governments approved a hike to $15 in their local minimum hourly pay, according to the National Employment Law Project.

And that momentum is likely to continue in the new year.

Lawmakers in 13 states and cities -- including California, New York and Washington, D.C. -- have proposed legislation and ballot measures calling for a $15 minimum that will get consideration in 2016.

In most places, the increase to $15 is being phased in over a few years to give businesses a little time to adjust.

That's because a $15 minimum often reflects a 50%-plus hike from the local minimum in place today. And it represents a 107% increase over the $7.25 federal minimum wage.

New York made headlines this year when Gov. Andrew Cuomo bypassed the state legislature to put in place a $15 minimum for fast-food workers at large chains. He also mandated it for state workers.

Now Cuomo is suggesting that all businesses in New York pay a $15 minimum, a proposal that lawmakers in Albany are expected to take up early in the new year.

Beyond the "Fight for $15," however, at least 13 states will see their minimum wages go up next year as a result of prior legislation.

Here's a list of many places where low-income workers will see more in their paychecks at some point in 2016.
