Cache of High-Powered Weapons Leads to Arrest of Johnson City Man
What started with a standard shoplifting call from the Gander Mountain in Johnson City led to a record gun bust.

Police say 64-year-old Ramadan Abdullah stole four boxes of ammunition on May 31, and their investigation uncovered a storage locker in the town of Union where they found powerful weapons.

Abdullah is charged with criminal possession of stolen property and five felony counts of criminal weapons possession. Law enforcement recovered 16 guns, more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition and dozens of high-capacity ammunition feeding devices.

"There's no indications there was a plan in place to commit an act of violence. However, it begs the question, what was he doing with all this and what were his intentions down the road?" said New York State Police Maj. Jim Barnes.

They say they are still in the early stages of the investigation -- and they are working to find out how he acquired the guns. Officials are looking at international travel patterns and anything that might shed light on why he would have so many weapons and rounds of ammunition. Federal investigators are aiding in the probe.

Officials say there is no indication Abdullah posed an immediate threat to the area, but they said getting illegal weapons off the streets makes Broome County safer.

Abdullah is being held in the Broome County jail.
