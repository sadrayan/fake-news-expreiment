The 6 craziest CIA plots to kill Fidel Castro
The Trump administration released a ton of previously classified documents Thursday around the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, and somehow a bunch of details around the attempted assassination of another world leader of that era were released too.

Part of the document dump is a memo that outlines the way the Kennedy administration tried to kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Its subject line reads “ORGANIZED CRIME, ASSASSINATIONS, FOREIGN LEADERS,” and it reveals the CIA had some very wacky schemes for taking him out.

Even the CIA itself seemed to acknowledge the plots weren’t great. Indeed, the author of the memo, one of the lawyers for the commission set up by President Gerald Ford to investigate CIA activity in 1975, said the outlandish nature of the ideas indicated the CIA needed more oversight.

“An analysis of the involvement in the CIA in plots to attempt to assassinate Fidel Castro illustrates the development of larger schemes out of smaller schemes, and also illustrates how important it is to have adequate internal and external controls on the agency,” the document reads.
