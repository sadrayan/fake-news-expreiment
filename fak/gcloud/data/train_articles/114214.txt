The National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism also agreed, saying "when alcohol is substituted for carbohydrates, calorie for calorie, subjects tend to lose weight, indicating that they derive less energy from alcohol than food," The Daily Mail reported.

Another study said a glass of red wine every night increased the good cholesterol HDL.

The European Conference on Obesity in Prague said that the glass of wine could help improve type 2 diabetes because it boosted glucose metabolism, The Daily Mail reported.

But remember, moderation is the key. The Daily Mail reported that binge drinkers had larger waistlines. There are also other health risks by drinking too much like a higher risk of breast cancer.
