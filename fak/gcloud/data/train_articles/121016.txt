Buzz Aldrin, selected by NASA as one of the early astronauts, made the historic Apollo XI moon walk with Neil Armstrong in 1969. Recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he lectures and travels throughout the world to pursue and discuss the latest concepts and ideas for exploring the universe. Aldrin founded a rocket design company, Starcraft Boosters Inc., and the Share Space Foundation, a nonprofit organization for pursuing space tourism. His best-selling books, which share his vision for the future of space travel, include "Reaching for the Moon" and his latest children’s book, “Welcome to Mars: Making a Home on the Red Planet” (National Geographic).
