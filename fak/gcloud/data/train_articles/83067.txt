Fox’s Bret Baier: Obama’s SOTU Didn’t Mention ‘al Qaeda’ — First Time Since 2001
In the immediate aftermath of President Barack Obama‘s 2015 State of the Union address, Fox News reporter and anchor Bret Baier noticed a peculiar fact: The president hadn’t mentioned “al Qaeda” at all.

Remarking upon the national security portion of the speech, Baier noted to his colleagues that today marks 13 days after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France, with allegedly direct ties to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and 12 days since British intelligence officials warned of “massive attacks” from al Qaeda in Syria.

And yet, “the words al Qaeda were never used,” Baier remarked. “The first time those words have not been used in the State of the Union address since February 2001.”

However, he added, “The president did talk about going after ISIS terrorists, and asked Congress to officially authorize that military fight against the Islamic state.”
