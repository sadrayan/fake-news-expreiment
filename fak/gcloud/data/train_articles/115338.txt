Ohio State: 7 Shot, Students Urged to 'Run Hide Fight'
Ohio State University reported an active shooter on campus Monday morning and urged students near Watts Hall to “Run Hide Fight.”

Update, 12:28 p.m. ET: Reports on the November 28 attack on Ohio State University are drifting away from an active shooter scenario, moving toward a car and knife attack.

CBS News reports that the attack on Ohio State may not have been firearm-related or at least not simply a firearm attack. They report that sources say “it increasingly looks like at least some people were either hit by a car or stabbed.” CNBC similarly reports: “Officials said it is not clear whether there had actually been a gun attack. A law enforcement official told NBC some students were attacked with a large knife.”

CNBC quotes a witness describing a scenario in which people exited Watts Hall after a fire alarm was pulled, only to be run over by a car that “started hitting those who evacuated” the building.

Update, 11:33 a.m. ET: At least one suspect in the Ohio State active shooter situation has been killed. WSYX 6’s Brooks Jarosz reports that the search for other suspects is “ongoing.”

CBS News reports that at least four of the individuals wounded in the attack have gunshot wounds. There are reports of weapons other than firearms being involved in the attack. In fact, CBS News reports that “someone had run a vehicle into [the chemical engineering building]” and thereafter began “attacking people inside the building with a knife.”

Jarosz reports that trauma surgeons have been requested to be ready for the arrival of the shooting victims:
