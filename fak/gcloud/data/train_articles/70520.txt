The Americanologists Say Farewell
It's time to say goodbye to The Americanologists.

We've loved the last 5 years of discovering beautiful American-made products, meeting dedicated makers and telling fascinating stories.Our hope was to turn this site from a labor of love into a small business we could take into retirement. Though unsuccessful in that goal, we are better for having tried - and we learned so much along the way.Thank you for your support. We offer our best wishes to you until we meet again.The Americanologistsinfo@americanologists.com
