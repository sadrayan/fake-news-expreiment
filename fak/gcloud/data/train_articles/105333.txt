"We heard several shots and we all started running inside the store," she said.

"It lasted about 15 seconds. I yelled, 'Get down! Get inside!' and we all went into hiding," said the woman, who said she is 49 but declined to give her name.

She said the gas station locked its doors. "We have not reopened," she said.

She then that within minutes of the gunfire, emergency personnel had arrived at the scene.

"There were officers that were checking the wounded in here were asking them questions," she said.
