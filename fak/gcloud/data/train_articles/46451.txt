Cuomo’s Tax Overhaul Plan Distresses Some Who See a Windfall for Banks
For one thing, there is considerable uncertainty about which financial institutions are subject to the tax, and which are subject to the state’s more general tax on corporations. New York’s current tax structure was established far before the enactment of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, which eliminated the separation between banks and securities firms.

Mr. Cuomo is proposing to merge the two taxes, so banks and other financial institutions would follow the same rules. The merger was among the suggestions of a panel appointed by the governor to propose ways to simplify the state’s tax code.

The biggest consequence, according to state officials and tax experts, deals with how a company determines the share of its overall income that is subject to taxation in New York. Banks, unlike other corporations, use a formula that takes into account how much of their payroll is in the state; under the governor’s proposal, payroll would no longer be a factor.

Supporters of the change said they hoped it would encourage financial institutions to expand their footprint in New York.

“We want to make it enticing for those corporations to be here,” said Senator Joseph A. Griffo, a Republican from Rome and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Banks.

James W. Wetzler, a former state tax commissioner who served on the governor’s panel, said the change would most likely reduce taxes for large banks that are headquartered in New York, like Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase. But it would probably increase them for those that are based elsewhere, like Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

New York State expects to collect about $69.4 billion in taxes this year; about $8.2 billion is projected to come from business taxes, including $1.2 billion from the tax on banks.
