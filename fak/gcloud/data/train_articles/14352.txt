Trump Maintains a One-In, Five-Out Pace for Rules and Regulations
How many deregulatory actions has the Trump administration taken so far? Along with approving 16 congressional “resolutions of disapproval” of existing Obama-era regulations—another 142. This leaves the 45th president, according to my most recent calculations, with a better-than-promised rate of five deregulatory actions for every new regulation implemented.

In addition to withdrawing or delaying rules and regulations that were in the pipeline from the previous administration, the flow of new federal rules ultimately issued by President Trump is considerably below the pace of his predecessor. We can tell from recent editions of the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations, which detail the rules that are currently in development at the federal level. We can also compare the current rate of regulating going back over the last few decades by reference to the historical tables in the report “Ten Thousand Commandments.”

Rule counts remain in the several thousands, but many of those are routine safety directives from agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration and Coast Guard, not new initiatives. These procedures matter, of course, but they are not generally what people are concerned about when it comes to the growth of the federal bureaucracy.

Many will recall Trump’s promise early in his presidency to eliminate two regulations for every new one added, though even that policy didn’t cover every part of the government. It didn’t apply, for example, to “non-significant” rules or to rules mandated by Congress (as opposed to those agencies came up with on their own). It also didn’t apply to the so-called independent agencies like the Federal Communications Commission or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

With much fanfare, the administration boasted in its first reckoning of exceeding the two-for-one directive in December 2017 with a 22-for-1 ratio, by eliminating 67 rules but adding only three. Recently the Spring 2018 Unified Agenda was released, but without quite the same celebratory atmosphere. Nonetheless, the administration is technically still exceeding the two-for-one directive.

The December announcement had included some rollbacks of guidance documents, which do not generally appear in the Unified Agenda, in addition to formal rules. We need to account for them to get a full picture of what the administration is doing, and I’ve previously noted how regulatory liberalization measures can exceed what we see just in the Unified Agenda. In the future, perhaps via another executive order, we should get roundups of those informal documents too, because without a similar “status report” like we got in December on the two-for-one caps, we miss their impact.

So where are we on two-for-one? Thanks to a “system upgrade” to the regulations database by Trump’s Office of Management and Budget, we can get a better idea. Nowadays, regulators must identify all new rules and regulations as “net regulatory” or “net deregulatory.” The Fall 2017 Unified Agenda elements were detailed in the new 2018 “Ten Thousand Commandments” report; the new Spring 2018 elements are detailed here for the first time, giving us “grand total” for the Trump administration so far.

Rules vs. Deregulatory Rules in the Trump Administration

Unified Agenda Deregulatory Regulatory Ratio

Edition: Entries: Entries: (In/Out):

Fall 2017 62 15 4 to 1

Spring 2018 80 14 Nearly 6 to 1

Grand Total 142 29 Almost 5 to 1 so far

The bottom line? The overall rate of elimination is not 22-to-1, but 5-to-1—still well above the initial 2-for-1 goal. The ratio in just the new Unified Agenda was nearly 6-to-1. So far rules (at least technically speaking) are being adequately offset to comply with Trump’s executive order. Significant actions like the Federal Communication Commission’s repeal of Obama-era net neutrality rules strengthen the case, given that independent agencies are exempt from the 2-for-1 order.

I have noted before that the Trump reforms have not changed the fundamental pro-regulatory nature of the administrative state. Agencies like the Federal Communication Commission, Environmental Protection Agency and Consumer Finance Protection Bureau have shifted gears temporarily under pressure from the current administration, but the increase in deregulatory actions will be transitory unless Congress enacts long-term regulatory reform.

In the Fall, however, a new Unified Agenda will be issued and we can take the temperature again. For more background in the meantime, soo the full version of “Ten Thousand Commandments.”

Below, please find the list of Trump’s 14 completed regulatory actions, and the 80 completed regulatory eliminations or reductions, as I have compiled them from the Spring 2018 Unified Agenda. These are presented without value judgments at this point, however I do put Deregulatory items considered “economically significant” in bold type. The Department of Commerce and the Department of Interior have the most Deregulatory actions, at 10 and 13, respectively.
