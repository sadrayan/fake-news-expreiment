Suozzi committee to examine pay raises
MINEOLA – Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi wants a raise. Not just for himself but also for the county’s tax assessor, clerk and comptroller, most of whom are paid far less than their counterparts in Suffolk and Westchester.

To review the disparity and come up with a proposal, Suozzi has appointed a three-member committee made up of Nassau County District Attorney Denis Dillon, Ruskin Moscou Faltischek Partner Arthur "Jerry" Kremer and Long Island Association President Matthew Crosson.

The committee is expected to produce a written report by the end of January.

Suozzi is paid $109,394, 52 percent less than outgoing Suffolk County Executive Bob Gaffney, who is paid $166,799, and 31 percent less than Westchester County Executive Andrew J. Spano. He pulls in an annual salary of $143,535.

Deputy County Executive Anthony Cancellieri said the "surprisingly large difference in salaries" doesn’t make much sense in a county dubbed as one of the most expensive places to live.

Statistics from Cancellieri’s office showed that the county executive isn’t the only one making less than his peers.

Nassau’s clerk and county assessor are paid $100,000 each, 44 percent less, than the Suffolk clerk who is paid $144,560, and 36 percent less than the Westchester clerk who is paid $136,700.

And Nassau’s comptroller is paid 108,670, 33 percent less than the Suffolk comptroller who is paid $144,560, and 24 percent less than the Westchester county executive who is paid $135,335.

Crosson called the data alarming, but said, "It will be examined carefully and as an objective group we will provide a written report related to the findings."

Any increases in salaries would have to be approved by the Legislature.

Minority Leader Peter Schmitt, R-Massapequa, said he would be open to approving salary increases, but he would have to examine the numbers first. "If there is such a big difference it should be adjusted," he said.

Nassau has not conducted a salary review since 1996.
