Investigators Looking Into Fire That Damaged Neko Case’s Home
Fire investigators are looking for the cause of a fire that heavily damaged Neko Case’s 225-year-old Vermont home.

Barnet firefighters were called to the indie musician’s home at about 9:30 p.m. Monday. The Caledonian Record reports the fire could be seen from miles away.

Case wasn’t at the home at the time of the fire. The caretaker helped get three dogs out of the house. There were no injuries, though a barn was destroyed. It took firefighters two hours to extinguish the blaze.

The musician has been nominated for three Grammy awards as a solo artist, and she’s also a member of the indie rock band the New Pornographers. The home was featured in a 2012 article in Country Living.

The Associated Press left messages with her representatives.
