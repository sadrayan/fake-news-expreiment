McMorris Rodgers Releases Draft VA Reform Legislation
Eastern Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) today released a discussion draft of legislation, the Caring for our Heroes in the 21st Century Act, which would modernize the way veterans receive health care.

“Every day I hear from veterans in Eastern Washington who are struggling to work with the VA,” said McMorris Rodgers. “We have a profound obligation to honor the service of our veterans and ensure that our heroes’ sacrifices shouldn’t continue after their tours of duty end. With the never ending wait times and the VA Secretary doubling down on his comparison to Disney, the time has long passed for the VA to make the necessary changes to ensure that our veterans are treated effectively, seen efficiently, and cared for with respect. Veterans should be freed from a system that offers them little or no choice.

“With this draft legislation, my goal is for veterans to have the ability to choose what health care plan best fits their individual needs. This proposal should serve as the starting point for putting veterans in charge of their health care. I look forward to receiving feedback from veterans and the organizations that represent them, so we can ensure veterans receive the health care they deserve and have earned in a timely manner.”

Note: The Caring for our Heroes in the 21st Act is a draft document which serves as an opportunity to discuss ideas for introduction in the future. Click here to read the discussion draft, which has not yet been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives.
