FLORIDA GOP RAPID RESPONSE
Today, Rick Scott signed into law a rollback of Charlie Crist’s $2.2 billion tax increase on Florida families. What is Charlie Crist’s response? He criticizes the governor saying his tax increases were “never meant to be permanent.“ Setting aside the stunning hypocrisy of criticizing the governor who’s cutting the taxes you raised for not cutting the taxes you raised fast enough, here are some facts.

FACT 1: Charlie Crist’s 2009 budget raised taxes by $2.2 billion.

FACT 2: Charlie Crist’s tax increase contained no phase-out or sunset provision. If Crist’s tax cut was meant to be temporary, why was there no provision to phase them out?

FACT 3: On The Ed Show, Charlie Crist said he would not rule out tax increases in the future.

CONCLUSION: Charlie Crist raised taxes before with no intention of rolling them back, and said he would do it again. Charlie Crist does not understand what it takes to lead a thriving economy that supports middle class Floridians.
