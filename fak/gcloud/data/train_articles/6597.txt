a These three amendments proposed in 1879 are not listed in Swisher, Ohio Constitution Handbook , 597, or in the West Table of Proposed Amendments , but they are included in Patterson, The Constitutions of Ohio , 245-46.

b The West Table of Proposed Amendments and the Swisher, Ohio Constitution Handbook do not include either of these amendments proposed in 1883. But see Patterson, The Ohio Constitutions , 249-50.

c The West Table of Proposed Amendments and the Swisher, Ohio Constitution Handbook list these three amendments proposed in 1885 as a single amendment, but Patterson lists them as a single amendment submitted as three separate propositions. See Patterson, The Ohio Constitutions , 254. The above table lists them separately since each was subject to a separate vote.

d The above table lists the proposed amendments resulting from the 1912 Convention in order of the percentage of votes cast in favor of the amendment at the September 3, 1912, election. The amendment removing double liability for stockholders is listed first as 71% of the electorate voted in favor of its adoption. The amendment on womenâ€™s suffrage is listed last since it received only a 43% favorable vote.

e The voters adopted both of the proposed 1918 amendments to Article XII, section 2, and the table lists both as having been adopted. However, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the amendment proposed by the General Assembly would take effect over the conflicting amendment proposed by initiative petition because, pursuant to Art. II, section 1b, the former received a larger number of affirmative votes. See State ex rel. Greenlund v. Fulton , 99 Ohio St. 168, 124 N.E. 172 (1919).

f The 1992 amendment establishing term limits for U.S. Senators and Representatives from Ohio never went into effect because the U.S. Supreme Court in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton , 514 U.S. 779 (1995), held unconstitutional state limitations on the terms for U.S. Senators and Representatives. This decision, however, did not address term limits for state officials, and term limits for state senators, state representatives, and state executive branch officers remain in effect.
