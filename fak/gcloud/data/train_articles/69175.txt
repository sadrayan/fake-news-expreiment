Sheriff Morgan reelected as Escambia County's Sheriff
Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has been reelected for a third term with 73 percent of the vote.

Sheriff Morgan is looking forward to finding "new and innovative ways" to approach law enforcement.

"We are going to get lean and mean in some areas, and organized in others," said Morgan.

In his third term, he wants to focus on an on-going salary study to provide paid benefits that match the salaries of the rest of the law enforcement in the state.
