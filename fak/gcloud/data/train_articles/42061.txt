Public School Finance
Introduction

Discussions of funding levels are necessary, but not sufficient, for truly understanding the health of our public schools. Researchers generally agree that how the money is spent is far more important than how much money is available to be spent. But no matter how many times researchers find weak empirical relationships between spending and performance, the public will insist that schools are one teacher pay raise away from the educational promised land.

Unfortunately, the American public too often equates the quality of public schooling with the condition of various inputs – per-student spending, educational technology, teacher pay, class size, school buildings, and the like. Presumably, schools will succeed so long as federal, state, and local governments use taxpayer money to furnish high-tech gadgets, pay teachers more, reduce class sizes, and construct magnificent school buildings.

But there is a better way for us to think about education finance – a focus on productivity. Researchers use the term “educational productivity” to describe analyses that compare funding to student performance. To do so, they use quantitative methods to measure the relative return on investment for schools and school districts, while considering differences in cost of living, household income, English language proficiency, and special education services.

All things being equal, there are tremendous variations in productivity within North Carolina’s public school system. Some districts have below-average per-pupil expenditures but above-average test scores. Others have relatively high per-pupil expenditures, but their test scores are disappointingly low.

Whether you call it “return on investment,” “educational productivity,” or “bang for the buck,” an assessment of the relationship between educational inputs and outputs is an essential starting point for good K-12 education policy.
