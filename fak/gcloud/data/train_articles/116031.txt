Rating for The ALS Association, National Office
Did you know that we never charge charities to be rated on our site? This allows us to maintain independence and conduct unbiased evaluations. We're not salespeople. We're coders, data analysts, and information junkies. We need your help. We're a nonprofit that relies on donations averaging $12. If Charity Navigator is useful to you, please take a minute to keep it online and free for another year. Thank you.

Charity Navigator is a nonprofit too. We rely on donations. If everyone reading this donated $5, we could keep it online for another year.
