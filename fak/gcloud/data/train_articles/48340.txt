Hillary Clinton is a former Secretary of State and former Democratic senator for New York. The wife of former President Bill Clinton, she was a 2008 candidate for her partyâ€™s presidential nomination. She lost that race to a relative newcomer on the scene, fellow Sen. Barack Obama, during a contentious primary season -- but went on to lead the State Department for the entirety of his first term.
