“I would rarely leave the White House because there’s so much work to be done,” Trump, 69, tells ITK. "I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.”

“You don’t have time to take time off,” Trump adds.

We caught up with the “Celebrity Apprentice” star at the Tuesday opening of a new championship golf course at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va.

Trump mentioned the links during his presidential announcement, saying he has "the best courses in the world," and inviting President Obama to try them out — hinting he could even retire early to do so.

His name is splashed all over luxury properties around the world, but Trump says he’d be happy to call 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. home.

“Yes, I would live in the White House because it’s the appropriate thing to do,” he says.

“I would work. And I would make the country great again. That’s what you have to do.”
