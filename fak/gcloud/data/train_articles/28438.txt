NOT REAL NEWS: Georgia gubernatorial candidate backed by Muslim Brotherhood
Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and activist Linda Sarsour are not pictured holding a sign that says: “COMMUNIST STACEY ABRAMS GOVERNOR #MuslimBrotherhood.”

A photo circulating on Facebook under the caption “Heads up Georgia. The Muslim Brotherhood is backing Abrams,” has been altered to show Abrams and Sarsour holding the #MuslimBrotherhood sign.

Abrams’ office said that in the original photo, the women are holding a sign that reads “Stacey Abrams Governor” at a 2018 Women’s March anniversary event in Georgia. Abrams tweeted the photo in January, saying that she was “proud to stand” with the Sarsour, an organizer of the march who wears a hijab. The tweet read: “When women speak up, stand up and show up for progress, incredible things happen. Let’s get to work.”

“This photo has been doctored to imply that Stacey Abrams has affiliations she does not have,” Priyanka Mantha, Abrams’ director of communications, told The Associated Press in a statement. “While true that the photo was taken with one of the co-chairs of the Women’s March in 2018, the sign being held up has been altered in a deceitful attempt to mislead voters.”

Mantha said that Abrams has been a strong supporter of Israel and the Jewish community.

Sarsour has been criticized by right-wing groups for her Muslim faith. False reports have circulated about her online suggesting that she supports Islamic State group, which she has denied.
