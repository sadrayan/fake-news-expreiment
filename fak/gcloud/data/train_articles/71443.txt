Getting our money's worth at $428.57 an hour?! Texas taxpayers getting ripped off by Part-Time Perry

HOUSTON -- Career politician Rick Perry seems to think press conferences and photo ops are worth $428.57 an hour to Texas taxpayers.

Schedules from January to May, released yesterday, showed Part-Time Perry averaged a work schedule of just seven hours per week, with time for 29 photo ops and more than a dozen press conferences.

"Career politician Rick Perry's charging taxpayers $10,000 a month for his extravagant rental mansion and $428.57 an hour for his work," said Katy Bacon, campaign spokesperson. "Given that Perry helped create an $18 billion budget hole, he should be doing more than phoning it in from the mansion while enjoying fine dining from his one and a half chefs. Rick Perry shows Texans again and again that he's only in it for himself."

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual salary for Texans is $41,100 and the average work week is 40 hours.
