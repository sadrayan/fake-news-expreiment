Subject: Texas reporter, inquiry for a fact check

Renn:

As discussed, we seek on-the-record attributed factual information for a published fact check as we gauge the accuracy of a recent claim.

The claim we’re reviewing was made by U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, who recently said: “NAFTA allows a lot of trucks from Mexico, for example, to leave there and... drive straight through without even being inspected.”

I would be happy to learn more quickly by email or phone or both. We hope to complete this review today.

THANKS!
