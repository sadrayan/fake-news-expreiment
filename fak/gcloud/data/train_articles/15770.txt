According to our research, this is not true.

Pew’s “Fiscal 50” interactive shows state reserve funds (rainy day funds plus ending balances). As illustrated below, Texas has $10.3 billion in reserve funds, providing enough for the state government to operate for 79.1 days. The only state with more reserve funds currently is Alaska, with $13.3 billion, providing enough for the state to operate for 181.9 days.

In addition to our data, NASBO’s Fall 2014 Fiscal Survey of States finds that Texas reported having a reserve balance of $8,070,000,000 for FY 2015, placing it second behind Alaska’s $11,371,000,000. According to these data, the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana, is greater than Texas’ reserves, providing clear evidence, Alaska withstanding, that Texas’ reserves are not more “than the other 49 states combined.”

I hope this is helpful to you. If you need to quote any of this, please attribute the information to Brenna Erford, who manages Pew’s state budget policy work.

Interesting; thanks.

Patrick was talking about projections, perhaps. Could it be that Texas, whose comptroller projects the rainy day fund to have nearly $8.5 billion at the end of the 2015 fiscal year, will have more than the other 49 states combined?

I think the data still confirms this is not true. Looking again to NASBO’s Fall 2014 Fiscal Survey of States, Texas is projecting a reserve balance of $8,070,000,000 for FY 2015. This still places it behind Alaska’s $11,371,000,000. This is the latest data available to us.
