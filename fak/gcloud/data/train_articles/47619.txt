Maria Ressa, Journalist Critical of Duterte, Is Arrested Again in Philippines
Maria Ressa, a co-founder of an online news start-up critical of President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, has been arrested a second time as the Duterte administration steps up its campaign against a news outlet that has been sharply critical of his government.

The latest charges against Ms. Ressa accuse her and members of her news outlet, Rappler, of violating laws regarding foreign ownership of the company. She was arrested on Friday morning in Manila as she got off a plane from San Francisco.

“What can you say?” Ms. Ressa said as she walked through the glass doors from the baggage claim area at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila.

She was released around noon after posting bail, about five hours after she was arrested.

Her arrest is the latest move in a broader crackdown on the news media by Mr. Duterte, who has accused reporters of being “spies” and “sons of bitches.”
