Rep. Marcia Fudge is Ohio's most liberal Congress member; Rep. Jim Jordan is most conservative
Champaign County GOP Congressman Jim Jordan was the fifth most conservative member of the U.S. House of Representatives last year, and the most conservative member from Ohio, according to congressional vote rankings compiled by National Journal magazine.

Democrat Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights was at the opposite end of the voting spectrum evaluated by the magazine, ranked as Ohio's most liberal House of Representatives member and the 19th most liberal in the chamber.

Former Rep. Steve LaTourette of Bainbridge Township -- who retired from Congress last year after expressing frustration with partisan gridlock -- was closest to the political center of any Ohioan in the House of Representatives, the tally showed. LaTourette was rated the House of Representatives' sixth most liberal Republican.

Democrat Sherrod Brown of Avon was the seventh most liberal member of the U.S. Senate, and Republican Rob Portman of the Cincinnati area was the 33rd most conservative U.S. senator.

Other local members of Congress got the following ratings for their 2012 votes:

Republican Bob Gibbs of Holmes County was 64th most conservative House of Representatives member.



Wadsworth Republican Rep. Jim Renacci was 185th most conservative.



Cleveland Democrat Dennis Kucinich, who lost his primary contest to Toledo's Marcy Kaptur, was 72nd most liberal member of Congress, while Kaptur rated 108th.



Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Niles was the 132nd most liberal member of Congress, while Democrat Betty Sutton of Copley Township - who lost her re-election bid to Renacci -- rated 135th.
