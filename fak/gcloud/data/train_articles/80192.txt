Senate President announces leadership change, harassment awareness training, anticipated inspector hiring
SPRINGFIELD – Illinois Senate President John J. Cullerton announced Wednesday that Senator Ira Silverstein will no longer serve on the Senate Democratic leadership team. Senator Silverstein resigned from the Majority Caucus Chair post effective immediately.

The post carries a $20,649 annual stipend. It will remain vacant for the immediate future.

Cullerton also announced that a professionally led sexual harassment awareness training seminar for senators will be scheduled for next week. The Senate is in session next week.

In addition, Cullerton anticipates an interim legislative inspector general will be named as soon as next week to fill a vacant investigative post. Cullerton said the expected hiring comes after three candidates had turned down the job in the past year. All four legislative leaders must approve the hiring of a legislative inspector general.

“It’s our duty to fill that post. I take responsibility for my role in that lapse, and I apologize for it,” Cullerton said. “These corrective actions are a first step in changing an unacceptable culture that has existed for too long.”
