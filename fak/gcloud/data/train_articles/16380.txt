I might not have been clear with my q.

There seem to be different definitions of gender gap. One, used by the CAWP director, bases the gap on the difference in percentage support of the winning presidential candidate, women v. men. The other, which seems to be cited in this 2006 paper, looks at that difference each election year for the Democratic nominee, regardless of if he’s the victor. The first note at the end of the paper says: “While there are a number of ways to measure the gender gap, the most common measure subtracts the percentage of men who identify with the Democratic Party from the percentage of Democratic women,” and likewise using candidates in presidential elections.

Do I read this right?

If so, what’s the accepted best way to gauge gender gap or is it unsettled or what, do you think?

I think the way in the 2006 paper is probably better than the CAWP list I sent. Mea culpa.

(And by better, I think more commonly used and assumed.)
