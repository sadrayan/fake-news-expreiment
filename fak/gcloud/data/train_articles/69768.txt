FACT SHEET: Clean Power Plan Framework
Make fossil fuel power plants more efficient Improve equipment and processes to get as much electricity as possible from each unit of fuel

Using less fossil fuel to create the same amount of electricity means less carbon pollution. Average heat rate improvement of 6% for coal steam electric generating units (EGUs)

Use low-emitting power sources more Using lower-emitting power plants more frequently to meet demand means less carbon pollution. Dispatch to existing and under-construction natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) units to up to 70% capacity factor

Use more zero- and low-emitting power sources Expand renewable generating capacity, which is consistent with current trends.

Using more renewable sources, including solar and wind, and low-emitting nuclear facilities, means less carbon pollution. Dispatch to new clean generation, including new nuclear generation under construction, moderate deployment of new renewable generation, and continued use of existing nuclear generation
