Joe Berrios’ new radio ad features Jesse White, more attacks on Kaegi Friday, Dec 15, 2017 * Have a listen… * Script… Jesse White: This is Secretary of State Jesse White. Let me tell you about my friend Joe Berrios. Growing up in Cabrini Green, Joe learned early on the importance of hard work, commitment and giving back. That’s exactly what he has done as a public official. As Cook County Assessor he has protected homeowners, made the office more accessible while cutting his staff 25 percent. Please join me, Jesse White, in supporting Joe Berrios for Cook County Assessor. Announcer: While Joe Berrios works to reform a broken system, investment banker Fritz Kaegi profited off of it. Kaegi managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons. Prisons where minority women faced abusive guards and detainees died suspiciously. The company he invested in even pushed for harsher sentencing laws. Fritz Kaegi saw prisons as a way to make money. He is no reformer. * Related… * Eric Zorn: Desperate Berrios and the ‘Republican’ lie: Kaegi’s camp fired back, calling the ad a “malicious lie,” saying the prison investments were made by others after he stepped down and declaring that “there is not a single document listing (a private prison company) as a holding that also lists Fritz as a portfolio manager.” Does the Berrios campaign have such a document? I asked Thursday and didn’t receive a response by my deadline. But even if they did … really? Is Berrios so desperate that he wants to make the campaign about ethical asset management in areas utterly unrelated to the duties of the assessor? And that he thinks branding his opponent as a secret Republican is the key to re-election? - Posted by Rich Miller
