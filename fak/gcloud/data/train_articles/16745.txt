Subject: RE: Statistics on black abortions from Jason Isaac

And the 60 million figure?

I am also not yet spotting a CDC statement that there were any “babies” aborted. Can you point that out?

Thanks again,

I trust you still have my other queries. But there’s no need to speak to the 60 million figure because that’s historical and the claim was about what’s happening now.

Right now, it looks to me like black women in 2014 obtained abortions at a rate of 711 a day. More significantly, the federal government identifies heart disease as the leading cause of death for black Americans and doesn’t list abortion among causes of death.

Anything else to consider?

Gardner, the 60 million figure cited is the annual estimate the National Right to Life Coalition calculates based on CDC and Guttmacher Institute data. You can find it on page 5 here.

You're correct that the CDC identifies heart disease as the #1 cause of death for black Americans; however, were abortion considered a cause of death, it would be the #1 cause by far.

Hope this helps clarify.
