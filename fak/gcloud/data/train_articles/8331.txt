Summary as enacted with Governor's Recommendation:

Health insurance reform. Revises Virginia's laws pertaining to the regulation of health insurance and related products in order to be consistent with relevant requirements of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) that become effective on January 1, 2014. These requirements include addressing premium rate restrictions on health benefit plans providing individual and small group health insurance coverage, prohibiting discrimination based on health status, prohibiting adjustments in the cost of coverage based on genetic information, requiring individual and small group health insurance coverage to include the essential health benefits as required by the PPACA, limiting waiting periods for health plans offering group health insurance coverage to 90 days, providing for participation in clinical trials, and authorizing health carriers to provide for wellness programs. The measure removes provisions relating to the standard and essential health benefits plans because they include coverage for services that may or may not comport with the essential health benefit package, and enforcement of the existing requirement would conflict with the PPACA. Though not specifically required to maintain conformity with federal law, the measure (i) keeps the existing limits for maximum size for a small group at 50 employees until 2016 and (ii) authorizes the State Corporation Commission to establish geographic rating areas. The bill removes the sunsets that were placed in provisions affected by or enacted as a result of the PPACA, including the external review processes. The measure also prohibits the sale through an exchange of a qualified health insurance plan that provides coverage for abortions, other than those performed when the life of the mother is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, or when the pregnancy is the result of an alleged act of rape or incest. The measure is effective January 1, 2014.
