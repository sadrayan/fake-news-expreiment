Due to popular demand: Niantic has begun development on a Harry Potter version of Pokemon Go
The developers behind the smash hit app, Pokemon GO, have started work on a similar game set in the Harry Potter universe.

Instead of capturing Gyms and trading Pokemon, fans will soon be able to establish and manage schools of wizardry scattered throughout the real world, complete quests to acquire new spells, and engage in ‘large scale magical combat’ with rivaling factions.









Niantic’s senior developer Marcus Figueroa announced the new project in an interview with IGN

We have acquired the rights for the app. The demand for this title was absolutely insane, so we figured we’d give it a shot. If we’re lucky we might see a launch by early 2017, but it’s hard to tell this early in the project.

When pressed for details, Figueroa had this to say

We want to do something with schools of witchcraft and wizardry, similar to pokestops in Pokemon GO. As wells a quest system, and possibly large scale completely interactive events, but no promises. That’s all I can say.

Pokémon Go rapidly topped the American iOS App Store’s “Top Grossing” and “Free” charts. The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating Clash Royale, and in its first week became the most downloaded app on the App Store of all time. Within two days of release, it was installed on more than 5% of Android devices in the United States, according to SimilarWeb, According to SensorTower, the game was downloaded more than 10 million times within a week of release, becoming the fastest such app to do so, and reached 15 million global downloads by July 13.
