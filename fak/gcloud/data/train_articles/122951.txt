Bernie Sanders Makes Quick Transition From Brooklyn to Rome
The senator also cast Francis as an inspiring leader and said the pope’s focus on treating people and the planet better should be a model followed by world leaders. “Pope Francis has given the most powerful name to the predicament of modern society,” Mr. Sanders said. “He calls it the globalization of indifference.”

Soon after the speech, Mr. Sanders walked just outside a Vatican gate and shook hands with waiting supporters. As Italian journalists mobbed him and elbowed one another to get closer, he answered a few questions about why he had taken time off from the campaign trail, saying the invitation was one he “could just simply not refuse.”

When asked whether he had taken the trip to shore up support among New York’s Catholic voters, Mr. Sanders quickly said, “No,” threw up his right hand and walked back into the conference.

Mr. Sanders planned to return to New York on Saturday. Though an actual meeting with the pope during his visit was always unlikely, the campaign held out hope until Pope Francis sent a handwritten note to Msgr. Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, a senior papal official and the academy’s chancellor. The pope wrote that while he had wanted to stop by the conference, it conflicted with a planned trip to the Greek island of Lesbos to address the migrant crisis.

“Yesterday I realized that today was going to be very complicated because of my trip to Lesbos,” the pope wrote. “Today I confirm this situation and would like to apologize for not being able to attend. I kindly ask you to greet the speakers and participants, requesting their understanding for this situation. I will keep them all in my prayers and good wishes, and send them my heartfelt thanks for their participation. May the Lord bless you. Fraternally, Franciscus.”
