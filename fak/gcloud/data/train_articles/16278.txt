Dallas ISD has been a leader in working to ensure that all students with the potential to succeed in AP courses are able to access those opportunities.

The National Math and Science Initiative can share information on Governor Abbott’s specific reference to Dallas ISD. I’d recommend you contact Gregg Fleisher there:

Subject: Following up from Texas

Hello again.

I couldn’t tell from your reply if the College Board finds the claim accurate or not.

This is the claim we’re trying to explore: Dallas “African-American and Hispanic students pass AP exams at a higher rate than any other place in America.”

I’m told the data used for comparison purposes by the Dallas-based initiative is confidential to the initiative and the board.

So I am also following up to see if the board double-checked/confirmed the analysis’ conclusions. Was there any other independent look at it? And again, does the board see this statement as accurate or not; why or why not?

As I emailed before, Dallas ISD has been a leader in working to ensure that all students with the potential to succeed in AP courses are able to access those opportunities.

The College Board is able to provide national and state-level AP data. NMSI is a partner and we have no reason to doubt what they have provided.
