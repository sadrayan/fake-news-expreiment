A whale of a tale: No, thereâ€™s no humpback in Farmington
No, no one left a 25-ton whale in a Farmington farmer's field.

But "truth" doesn't necessarily apply to the satirical news site World News Daily Report, which posted such a story on Friday, complete with photos. As their "news report" goes, a dairy farmer named Michael Woodson found the 12-meter-long humpback whale laying lifeless on his property, and figured some neighborhood kids left it there "as a creepy prank."

Naturally, a search of a public records database shows no such Michael Woodson living in Farmington.

"The [Farmington police] rapidly dismissed the possibility however, as no traces of vehicles or machinery large enough to carry it were found anywhere near the animal," the story reads. "The police admits that they are almost clueless at the moment as to how the marine mammal found its way on Mr. Woodson's property."
