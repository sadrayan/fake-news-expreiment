Like school uniforms? A bill encouraging them moves in Florida House
A bill that "encourages" Florida public school districts to adopt student uniforms won enthusiastic, bipartisan support in the Florida House K-12 Committee on Wednesday.

Chairwoman Janet Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, proposed the measure, suggesting it would help increase school security because students who belong on campus would be easily identifiable. She also stressed that it included incentives and would remain an option for districts, rather than being a mandate.

Rep. Joseph Geller, an Aventura Democrat, said his initial inclination was to oppose the bill.

"The facts changed my preconceived notion," Geller said, calling the proposal "great."

He recommended, however, that Adkins consider amending the provisions relating to opting out of the uniforms, if a district were to adopt them. He noted that representatives from "a P district" advised that it avoided lawsuits in its dress code mandates by having a permissive opt-out rule.

The bill currently has a few limited options for declining the uniforms. Adkins said she would look at the idea more closely.

She was not as open to Geller's suggestion that the districts be required to use the financial incentive to buy some uniforms for children who cannot afford them.

"I would not want to prescribe how school districts approach this," Adkins said.

Joy Frank, representing the state superintendents association, praised the bill, suggesting only a few small tweaks.

"I have a feeling most parents will embrace this," Frank said.

The bill does not have a Senate companion.
