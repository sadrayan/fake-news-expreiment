Mobile-based DRC working on Haitian relief, scouting for more business
WASHINGTON -- When a vicious earthquake crumpled much of Haiti last month, DRC Emergency Services LLC had five to 10 employees inside the impoverished Caribbean nation.That number is now closer to 50 full-timers, and the Mobile-based disaster relief firm would like to see it go higher."As this thing grows, we hope to provide jobs for many Haitians ...," Vice President Buddy Persons said in a phone interview from Mobile. "Our goal is to gain work in this recovery effort."The Jan. 12 quake likely killed tens of thousands of people. Already, DRC is providing body recovery and demolition services, as well as sanitation and toilets for various aid organizations, Persons said.It also has furnished humanitarian assistance, such as flying in doctors for free, he added.The firm, founded after Hurricane Hugo struck in 1989, touts a record that has taken it around the world.It has been in Haiti since 2006, when it helped provide housing for workers building a new U.S. embassy and created a local affiliate, Persons said. That connection proved useful in the quake's chaotic aftermath, when the company was able to fly in a half-dozen employees the next day, he said.Its workers have had to endure "somewhat scary" aftershocks while struggling to bring in supplies, he said.In terms of future cleanup work from the Haitian government, it's unclear what will happen next. A Miami Herald newspaper article last week said that DRC and a rival firm, Florida-based Ashbritt, have both enlisted "powerful local allies in Haiti." While Ashbritt is working with an influential local businessman, the Herald said, DRC has partnered with one of Haiti's largest road builders."That's not a concern for us," Persons replied when asked whether politics could help determine who gets the business. "We'll be bidding the projects and trying to achieve the work."
