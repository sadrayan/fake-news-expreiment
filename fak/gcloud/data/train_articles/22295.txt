Kirsten Gillibrand Says Illegal Aliens Should Have Social Security Benefits
Presidential 2020 hopeful New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said that illegal aliens should receive social security benefits, in another move by Democrats pushing to expand the rights of illegal immigrants in the United States.

Gillibrand made the comment during a campaign stop in Davenport, Iowa. saying “first, we need comprehensive immigration reform.”







Moreover, “if you are in this country now you must have the right to pay into Social Security, to pay your taxes, to pay into the local school system and to have a pathway to citizenship. That must happen,” said Gillibrand.
