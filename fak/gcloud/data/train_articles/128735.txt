Ivanka Trump Wore a $158 Dress from Her Own Line at the R.N.C.
On the fourth day of the Republican National Convention, Ivanka Trump wore Ivanka Trump. The blush-toned sheath is “coming soon,” but there’s a similar style available for purchase at Nordstrom. It’s $138. Her white dress from Wednesday night is also available for $158.

Trump’s label, which launched in 2007 and began with “a jewelry line for women buying for themselves” before expanding into clothing, shoes, and more, has been ever-present on her father’s campaign trail. Her business and his campaign are mutually reinforcing marketing materials. She appears on a national stage wearing her designs, while her site, which defines the brand as “a lifestyle concept dedicated to women who work,” includes first-person dispatches from the convention. Updates from the Donald tour are filed under “work.”

The visual reminders of Ivanka Trump’s day job attempt a two-fold gloss. The first is that Trumps do business so, so well. The second is that she’s a woman who works. Phrases like “modern professional woman” and “self-purchasing female” run throughout her Web site. Trump’s convention speech doubled down on her personal and professional brand, insisting that her dad would be a champion of “equal pay for equal work” and of making the American workplace a supportive space for moms. So the innocuous-looking, soft-pink dress is essentially screaming, “HE’S NOT SO BAD ABOUT THE WOMAN THING, PROMISE. Also, BUSINESS.”

As has been pointed out again and again, Trump’s dress and shoes—with a total price tag adding up to just about $300 without jewelry—foils her stepmother Melania's wardrobe of expensive European designers. There’s something for everyone on the stage, but Melania’s Roksanda dress sold out almost immediately. Ivanka’s outfits have not.
