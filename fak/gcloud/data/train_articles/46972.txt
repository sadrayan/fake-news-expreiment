This Time, Colin Kaepernick Takes a Stand by Kneeling
SAN DIEGO — As he was walking off the field at Qualcomm Stadium, Colin Kaepernick’s ears perked up and his head swiveled just before he reached the tunnel leading to the visitor’s locker room. He planted like he was trying to avoid a linebacker, made a hard right turn and raced to the edge of the stands.

For the next 15 minutes, Kaepernick signed jerseys, T-shirts, caps and even a woman’s forearm. He posed for one selfie after another, beaming along with children and grown-ups alike. He also listened to what they had to say — be it a heckler who told him he won’t have football to interfere with his activism much longer or a supporter who encouraged him to keep speaking out.

“You’re the voice for us,” he shouted.

While Kaepernick, at ease and engaged, worked his way among a couple hundred fans, it was clear that he was among his people — and not just because so many were wearing San Francisco 49ers gear. They were mostly Latino, Asian and black.

“A lot of those people are people that I want to give equal opportunities to,” Kaepernick said.

It was not the only hard pivot Kaepernick had hoped to effect Thursday night. He also wanted to redirect the narrative stemming from his recent refusal to stand for the national anthem. What began as a gesture to protest police brutality and social injustice had careened into a national debate on everything but that.
