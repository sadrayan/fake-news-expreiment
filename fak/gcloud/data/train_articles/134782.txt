(c) Four key initiatives are being implemented to improve student performance at individual subject and overall certification levels:

(i) A student attendance policy was introduced in 2014 and implementation was strengthened in 2015 and 2016, where students need to comply with at least an 80% attendance rate to qualify to write the examinations. Notable improvements in student attendance have been recorded, although there are still colleges who struggle to entrench a culture of attendance. The recent student protests have also militated against disciplined attendance.

(ii) Since 2016, all colleges are required to develop and implement annual Teaching and Learning Plans (TLPs) with standards for curriculum delivery across seven key areas:

Enrolment preparation;

Classroom teaching and support;

Student practical application for on-course learning;

Student assessments: On-site and continuous assessments;

Student academic support;

Lecturer support and capacity-building; and

Work placement (students and lecturers).

The TLPs are submitted and analysed by the Department. Officials in the six regional offices provide support to the colleges to improve curriculum delivery and provide qualitative reports on the status of teaching and learning in the colleges. Through this process, colleges are compelled to identify gaps in the delivery of quality teaching and learning, and to commit to addressing these gaps.

(iii) Lecturer capacity building has been identified as a critical area towards improving student performance. The number of unqualified lecturers, i.e. lecturers without a professional and academic/technical qualifications, is below 700 against a potential lecturing workforce of around 10 000. A larger problem exists in that the qualified lecturers’ knowledge and competencies have not kept abreast with the new and revised curricula in the NC(V) qualifications. To address this gap, 36 curriculum specialists will be appointed in 2017 in the poor performing subjects to provide support to lecturers in the delivery of these subjects.

(iv) Students accessing TVET colleges generally have poor learning foundations (literacy and numeracy) and putting them into bridging programmes whilst concurrently enrolled in TVET programmes places unrealistic academic demands on these students. The Department will be introducing a Foundational Learning Programme (FLP) in 2018, for all new TVET enrolees without a National Senior Certificate. Placement in the FLP will be based on a baseline test developed by the Career Development Services unit located within the Department.
