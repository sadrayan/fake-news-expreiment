Former Blue Dogs find lobbying jobs - Aaron Mehta -- iWatchNews.org
Almost a third of the Blue Dog Democrats who retired or were defeated in 2010 have gone to work for organizations that lobby their former colleagues in Congress, according to an iWatch News review.

The Blue Dog ranks were devastated by the 2010 election, falling from a high of 54 to 26. Of those no longer in Congress, eight have moved through the “revolving door” to employment with lobbying entities.

The conservative Blue Dogs formed a key voting bloc for much of the last congressional session, drawing impressive fundraising from the energy, financial and health care industries. Once that legislation was either passed or stalled, industry groups abandoned the pro-business coalition, instead favoring their Republican opponents.

Some have expressed interest in running for their seats in 2012. Others have opted to retire. These are the eight who went on to work for organizations or companies that engaged in federal lobbying during the first quarter of 2011:

• Stephanie Herseth Sandlin of South Dakota, now works for Olsson Frank Weeda Terman Bode Matz.

• Walt Minnick of Idaho is employed by The Majority Group.

• Allen Boyd of Florida works for the Twenty-First Century Group.

• Charles Melancon of Louisiana works for the International Franchise Association.

• Brad Ellsworth of Indiana is employed by Vectren.

• Bart Gordon of Tennessee now works for lobbying giant K&L Gates.

• Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota is employed with Alston & Bird.

• John Tanner of Tennessee is now employed with Prime Policy Group.

Good government advocates raise the alarm about former members of Congress returning to their old stomping grounds in new roles with lobbying firms. “It often appears that members of Congress are using their public service as a stepping-stone to a far more lucrative job,” said Mary Boyle, vice president for communications at Common Cause.

Former Blue Dog Earl Pomeroy disagreed. “I don’t feel like I have lowered my moral standard or that you can’t work as an advocate in Congress but not [when you’re] outside Congress because it’s somehow dishonorable,” he said. “I spent 18 years building a reputation for integrity and I’m not going to squander it.”

Pomeroy, the sole representative from North Dakota from 1993 until January of this year, said he took a job with Washington power lobby firm Alston & Bird because he wanted to continue to have a hand in the health care debate. He pointed out that voting for President Barack Obama’s health care law may well have cost him his seat, and “I darn sure want to make sure it works.”
