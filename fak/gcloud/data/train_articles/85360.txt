BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

James Butler, "Wild Bill," Hickok was born in Troy Grove, Illinois, on May 27, 1837, the son of William Alonzo and Polly Butler Hickok. After receiving an elementary education, Hickok went west in 1855 where he joined General James Lane's Free State Forces in Kansas. In 1858, he was elected constable of Monticello Township in Johnson County, Kansas.

During the next few years, Hickok was employed as a stagecoach and wagon driver for the firm of Russell, Majors, and Wadell along the Oregon and Santa Fe Trails, and in 1861 came to the Rock Creek Stage Station in Jefferson County, Nebraska. It was here that the now-famous Hickok-McCanless affair occurred on July 12, 1861. In this incident, Hickok reportedly killed McCanless and two other men. Although acquitted of murder in Gage County District Court, the affair laid the basis for Hickok's reputation as a gunfighter.

During the Civil War, Hickok served as a scout, spy, and courier with the Union army, and after his discharge in 1866 received an appointment as deputy United States Marshall at Fort Riley, Kansas. While at Fort Riley he also served as a scout in various military expeditions against the Indians on the plains. Between 1869 and 1871, Hickok served as Marshal of Ft. Hays and Abilene, Kansas, and is credited with restoring order to these previously lawless communities.

In 1872-1973, Hickok toured the eastern United States with Buffalo Bill Cody's theatrical productions but soon returned to the West. In the winter of 1876 he renewed his acquaintance with a Mrs. Agnes Lake, the owner of a circus playing in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the couple were married on March 5, 1876. Hickok soon left for the Black Hills in Dakota Territory in the hope of finding gold. While in Deadwood he was murdered by Jack McCall on August 2, 1876, during a card game at a local saloon.
