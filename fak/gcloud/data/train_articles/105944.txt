This is an update to an article This is an update to an article published by Alpha News on Monday which includes details received by email from the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) that weren’t available at the time of original publication.

A representative from the MPD’s 2nd Precinct, which covers the area where the incident occurred, responded that the case was being handled by the University of Minnesota (U of M) police, and said that the U of M police report indicated there were seven juveniles “causing a disturbance” on the light rail platform and that two of the juveniles “had pipes in their hands.” The email stated that two juveniles were arrested and cited for disorderly conduct, fleeing police and false information to police, and they were transported to the Juvenile Detention Center. The email also said that one of the suspects was “known” to officers in Minneapolis’ 1st Precinct, which covers downtown Minneapolis and the Cedar-Riverside area. The email said there was nothing mentioned [in the U of M police report] about injuries or victims. Case number UM 19-140183.

Because the suspects are juveniles, no further information about their identities or cases will be made available.
