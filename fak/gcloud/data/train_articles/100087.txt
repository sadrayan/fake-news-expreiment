Jetafe (sometimes also spelled Getafe) is a port town on the northern coast, 92 kilometers from the capital.

It was only a strip of level land along the coast belonging to the town of Inabanga. The rich fishing grounds in the shallow waters around the neighboring little islands attracted people from Cebu and other nearby places to settle on the strip of level land. The community grew and flourished but during the 18th century marauding muslims used to come to the place so the community transferred to the top of a hill so that they could watch the coming of marauders. The decision of the Spaniards to give them protection made them return to the old site. In 1874, this barrio which was once called Ambacon became a municipality and was named Jetafe.

Corte Paradise Resort is a riverside and beachside resort conveniently situated in Barangay Corte-Baud, Getafe, Bohol. The resort is embraced with the winding brackish river, century old mangrove jungle, sandy shoreline and its romantic tropical gardens. In addition to its tropical gardens and native amenities, the resort also boasts of its spring water swimming pool for being the only pool within the area that gets direct freshwater replenishment from a subterranean spring water basin located at approximately 100 meters above sea level within the slopes of Mt. Corte. For the continued satisfaction of its valued customers, the resort continues to add more nature inspired gardens and amenities that are worth looking forward to. No visit to Getafe would ever be complete without relishing the Corte Nature Garden Resort experience.
