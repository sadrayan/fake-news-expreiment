KANSAS CITY, MO — Continuing its tradition of issuing beautiful and distinctive floral stamps, the U.S. Postal Service issued the Kaleidoscope Flowers 46-cent stamps today.

Available in self-adhesive coils of 3,000 and 10,000, customers may order the stamps now to prepare for the Jan. 27 First-Class letter mail one-cent price change at usps.com/stamps, or by phone at 800-STAMP24 (800-782-6724).

This set of four stamps depicts the same graphic flower design, with each stamp featuring one of four different color combinations. Some of the color combinations create the illusion that patterns recede or move forward. Designed by art director Antonio Alcala´, the Kaleidoscope Flowers stamps feature the work of graphic artists Petra and Nicole Kapitza.
