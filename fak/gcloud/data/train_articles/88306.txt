Romney hits Obama as 'outsourcer-in-chief'
Via Juana Summers in Colorado, Mitt Romney echoed the outsourcing counterattacks on President Barack Obama that national Republicans launched this morning:

Mitt Romney went on the offensive Tuesday, hitting back against the Obama campaign's attacks on his record at Bain Capital, saying that Obama – not he – was the "outsourcer in chief."

It's a pivot on an Obama ad running in swing states that brands Romney as an "outsourcer in chief," saying his companies were "pioneers at shipping U.S. jobs overseas."

Leveling the same charge at Obama, Romney told nearly 1,000 supporters here in Grand Junction that Obama has been "outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself."

"It is interesting that when it comes to outsourcing that this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States," Romney said. "If there's an outsourcer in chief, it's the president of the United States, not the guy that's running to replace him."

Romney's attempt to flip the script after the Obama campaign repeatedly blasted him for outsourcing American jobs comes coupled with a new website out by the Republican National Committee that also looks to paint Obama as the real outsourcer.

The website, Obamanomicsoutsourced.com, charges that Obama has presided over "a record of failure spanning the globe" and that, as president "billions of dollars did go to create jobs that were outsourced or spent overseas."
