Wikileaks Latest: Podesta Emails Show 3 PROMINENT Republicans On Clinton Payroll
New information from Wikileaks is about to shake up the Republican world. Republicans in name only, anyway. An email from John Podesta to Huma Abedin that was released as document number 1078645 is about to turn the speculation that certain prominent Republicans who opposed Donald Trump into the truth that they were, in fact, not just disloyal to Trump and the party but were on Hillary Clinton’s payroll.

The email, sent in July of this year, describes how funds were being diverted from Clinton’s campaign to the Super PACS of Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina and John Kasich. According to the email:

“JB, CF and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign. Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only.”

There were a lot of politicians who were opposed to Donald Trump. These three in particular all share a common bond, however: Trump humiliated them on stage in front of hundreds of millions of people around the world. This is more than just politics or conscientious objecting, this was revenge.

All three have congratulated the President-Elect since the election, probably to save face in case they decide to waste another $300 million running for president in 2024, but this new revelation all but ruins them in the eyes of the voters and assures that they nwill never see any kind of post in the coming administration.

President-Elect Trump has yet to respond. He obviously has better things to do than worry about these three losers.
