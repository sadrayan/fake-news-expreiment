Marijuana Contains "Alien DNA" From Outside Of Our Solar System, NASA Confirms
Welllll, I'm not sure how pleased I was, but I did read the article. I have an interest in Exobiology so was curious as to why this would be discovered first (or sort of first) in pot of all places... but hey, smoking a bit probably made someone think of it. But interesting topic, especially in these polarised times. Before I ever even consider to click an article, I make note of the source. I am all about mainstream sources these days. I may make a snarky comment if it's from a friend. Anyway, I'll keep an eye out for this behaviour.... however, I consider comments sections to be the absolute scum infested bottom dwelling of the web.. Comments are the last place I look to be enlightened. hahah. So please disregard this one
