The provisions of paragraph 1 regarding national treatment shall mean, with respect to a state or province, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment accorded by such state or province to any like, directly competitive or substitutable goods, as the case may be, of the Party of which it forms a part. 3.

Except as provided in Annex 703.2, Section A, paragraph 12, where such a good has been commingled with fungible goods and exported in the same condition, its origin for purposes of this subparagraph, may be determined on the basis of the inventory methods provided for in the Uniform Regulations established under Article 511 (Uniform Regulations); (c) a good imported into the territory of a Party that is deemed to be exported from its territory, or used as a material in the production of another good that is deemed to be exported to the territory of another Party, or is substituted by an identical or similar good used as a material in the production of another good that is deemed to be exported to the territory of another Party, by reason of (i) delivery to a duty-free shop, (ii) delivery for ship's stores or supplies for ships or aircraft, or (iii) delivery for use in joint undertakings of two or more of the Parties and that will subsequently become the property of the Party into whose territory the good was deemed to be imported; (d) a refund of customs duties by a Party on a particular good imported into its territory and subsequently exported to the territory of another Party, where that refund is granted by reason of the failure of such good to conform to sample or specification, or by reason of the shipment of such good without the consent of the consignee; (e) an originating good that is imported into the territory of a Party and is subsequently exported to the territory of another Party, or used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to the territory of another Party, or is substituted by an identical or similar good used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to the territory of another Party; or (f) a good set out in Annex 303.6. 7. Except for paragraph 2(d), this Article shall apply as of the date set out in each Party's Section of Annex 303.7. 8.

If a waiver or a combination of waivers of customs duties granted by a Party with respect to goods for commercial use by a designated person can be shown by another Party to have an adverse impact on the commercial interests of a person of that Party, or of a person owned or controlled by a person of that Party that is located in the territory of the Party granting the waiver, or on the other Party's economy, the Party granting the waiver shall either cease to grant it or make it generally available to any importer. 4.

The Parties shall establish by January 1, 1994, rules for determining whether a good is a good of a Party ("Marking Rules") for purposes of this Annex, Annex 300-B and Annex 302.2, and for such other purposes as the Parties may agree. 2. Each Party may require that a good of another Party, as determined in accordance with the Marking Rules, bear a country of origin marking, when imported into its territory, that indicates to the ultimate purchaser of that good the name of its country of origin. 3. Each Party shall permit the country of origin marking of a good of another Party to be indicated in English, French or Spanish, except that a Party may, as part of its general consumer information measures, require that an imported good be marked with its country of origin in the same manner as prescribed for goods of that Party. 4. Each Party shall, in adopting, maintaining and applying any measure relating to country of origin marking, minimize the difficulties, costs and inconveniences that the measure may cause to the commerce and industry of the other Parties. 5.

Except for a good described in subparagraphs 5(b)(vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x), (xii), (xiii) and (xiv), a Party may provide that, wherever a good is exempted under subparagraph 5(b), its outermost usual container shall be marked so as to indicate the country of origin of the good it contains. 7. Each Party shall provide that: (a) a usual container imported empty, whether or not disposable, shall not be required to be marked with its own country of origin, but the container in which it is imported may be required to be marked with the country of origin of its contents; and (b) a usual container imported filled, whether or not disposable, (i) shall not be required to be marked with its own country of origin, but (ii) may be required to be marked with the country of origin of its contents, unless the contents are marked with their country of origin and the container can be readily opened for inspection of the contents, or the marking of the contents is clearly visible through the container. 8. Each Party shall, wherever administratively practicable, permit an importer to mark a good of a Party subsequent to importation but prior to release of the good from customs control or custody, unless there have been repeated violations of the country of origin marking requirements of the Party by the same importer and that importer has been previously notified in writing that such good is required to be marked prior to importation. 9. Each Party shall provide that, except with respect to importers that have been notified under paragraph 8, no special duty or penalty shall be imposed for failure to comply with country of origin marking requirements of that Party, unless the good is removed from customs custody or control without being properly marked, or a deceptive marking has been used. 10. The Parties shall cooperate and consult on matters related to this Annex, including additional exemptions from a country of origin marking requirement, in accordance with Article 513 (Customs Procedures - Working Group and Customs Subgroup). 11. For purposes of this Annex: conspicuous means capable of being easily seen with normal handling of the good or container; customs value means the value of a good for purposes of levying duties of customs on an imported good; legible means capable of being easily read; sufficiently permanent means capable of remaining in place until the good reaches the ultimate purchaser, unless deliberately removed; the form in which it was imported means the condition of the good before it has undergone one of the changes in tariff classification described in the Marking Rules; ultimate purchaser means the last person in the territory of an importing Party that purchases the good in the form in which it was imported; such purchaser need not be the last person that will use the good; and usual container means the container in which a good will ordinarily reach its ultimate purchaser.
