Origin of casualty

Middle English casuelte chance, accident from Old French from Medieval Latin cāsuālitās from Latin cāsuālis fortuitous ; see

Usage Note: In military usage, a casualty is a serviceperson who has been killed, injured, captured, or in some other way rendered unable to serve. When used in nonmilitary situations, such as newspaper reports about accidents, the word casualty is usually used to mean a person who is either killed or injured. Sometimes, however, people use casualties to refer only to individuals who have died, not to those who have been injured. This usage is often considered an error. In our 2013 survey, 60 percent of the Usage Panel disapproved of a sentence where casualties was used to mean “fatalities” only: Officials have reported 21 casualties from yesterday's earthquake. In addition to those fatalities, 79 people were seriously injured.
