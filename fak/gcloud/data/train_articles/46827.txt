Budget Office Sharply Cuts Health Exchange Estimate
In its report Monday, the budget office said that the federal budget deficit for the current fiscal year would increase in relation to the size of the economy for the first time since 2009. But it predicted solid economic growth in 2016 and 2017.

The budget office predicts a deficit of $544 billion this year, down from $1.4 trillion in 2009, when President Obama took office, in a recession. If the projection is accurate, the deficit this year would be equivalent to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product, down from 9.8 percent in 2009.

The projected 2016 deficit is higher than what the budget office predicted just five months ago, in part because Congress passed legislation that reduced corporate and individual income taxes.

If current laws remain generally unchanged, the budget office said, annual deficits will total $9.4 trillion from 2017 to 2026, and federal debt held by the public — the cumulative total of government borrowing — will climb to $23.8 trillion, up from $14 trillion this year.

In the coming decade, the budget office said, the number of people who are at least 65 years old will increase by 37 percent, and the aging of the population, combined with rising health care costs per person, will fuel an increase in federal spending on guaranteed benefits, or entitlements.

The budget office predicts that the economy will grow more quickly in 2016 and 2017 than it did last year, when the G.D.P., after adjusting for inflation, increased by 2 percent. If current laws on taxes and spending remained in place, the budget office said, the economy would grow by 2.7 percent this year and 2.5 percent next year.

It sees the unemployment rate — an important measure in this election year — dropping to 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, from 5 percent in the last quarter of 2015.
