This Alt-Right Blogger Said Sweden Is Crime-Ridden And Now People Are Trolling Him With Memes
Any journalist claiming Sweden is safe; I will pay for travel costs & accommodation for you to stay in crime ridden migrant suburbs of Malmo

On Monday, high-profile alt-right writer Paul Joseph Watson, the editor of conspiracy website InfoWars, posted this tweet about Malm√∂, Sweden's third-largest city.

Watson, who describes himself as a "Conservative Contrarian", recently made headlines after a Scottish man tricked him into publishing a fake story about Donald Trump.



His offer followed comments made by US president Donald Trump on Saturday in which Trump appeared to allude to an incident in Sweden that didn't actually happen.



Trump later said he was referring to a Fox News segment that aired on Friday night, rather than an actual incident in the country.
