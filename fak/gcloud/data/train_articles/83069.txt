Megyn Kelly Goes Off on Amtrak Reactions: ‘How Exactly Did the Infrastructure Fail?’
Fox’s Megyn Kelly got pretty pissed off tonight over how quickly some have politicized the Amtrak crash last night, making the case for more Amtrak funding.

Kelly didn’t quite understand what infrastructure funding has to do with an engineer that was going at twice the speed limit. Both she and Chris Stirewalt piled on the individuals (namely Democrats) making this an issue. Kelly asked, “Who failed them?… How exactly did the infrastructure fail?”

She also fought with DNC official Robert Zimmerman, who argued with Kelly about how one particular infrastructure issue––a positive train control––has been delayed due to funding issues. Kelly still thought it tasteless to invoke politics when people are dead.

She scolded anyone trying to “exploit a tragedy” and insisted that people need to wait until all the facts come in.
