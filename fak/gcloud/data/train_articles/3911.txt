Covering The Uninsured In 2008: Current Costs, Sources Of Payment, And Incremental Costs

Jack Hadley , John Holahan , Teresa Coughlin and Dawn Miller

People uninsured for any part of 2008 spend about $30 billion out of pocket and receive approximately $56 billion in uncompensated care while uninsured. Government programs finance about 75 percent of uncompensated care. If all uninsured people were fully covered, their medical spending would increase by $122.6 billion. The increase represents 5 percent of current national health spending and 0.8 percent of gross domestic product. However, it is neither the cost of a specific plan nor necessarily the same as the governments costs, which could be higher, depending on plans financing structures and the extent of crowd-out.
