WEBVTT [CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WISN-TV] [CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CAPTION CONTENT AND ACCURACY. VISIT NCICAP.ORG] MIKE: TODAY, ON "UPFRONT," POWER GRAB, OR POWER RESET? >> TOGETHER, IT IS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. >> OUR GOAL IS TO GUARANTEE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE AND DO IT FAIRLY. MIKE: HIGH TENSION IN A BITTER LAME-DUCK SESSION. NEXT, THE WAY FORWARD. CAN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WORK TOGETHER AFTER THIS? I’LL ASK SENATE MAJORITY LEADER SCOTT FITZGERALD, AND DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JON ERPENBACH. PLUS, THE CHANCES NEW LIMITS ON EARLY VOTING WILL END UP BACK IN COURT. ANNOUNCER: COVERING THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO WISCONSIN. THIS IS "UPFRONT" WITH MIKE GOUSHA. MIKE: HELLO AND WELCOME TO " UPFRONT". TO THE VICTOR, GO THE SPOILS. EXCEPT, SOME WOULD ARGUE, IN WISCONSIN WHERE THE INCOMING GOVERNOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL HAVE LESS POWER THAN THE CURRENT GOVERNOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN THREE DAYS LAST WEEK, REPUBLICANS WHO CONTROL THE LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED NEW BILLS CURTAILING THE AUTHORITY OF GOVERNOR-ELECT TONY EVERS, AND ATTORNEY GENERAL ELECT JOSH KAUL. TOP REPUBLICANS INTRODUCED THE BILLS LATE ON A FRIDAY. HELD A PUBLIC HEARING ON MONDAY. AND PASSED THE BILLS EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING AFTER PULLING AN ALL NIGHTER. EVERS, WHO SAID HE WANTED TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS, NOW MIGHT SEE THEM IN COURT. >> WE ARE EXPLORING ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT GET INTO PRACTICE. MIKE: SO, WHAT’S NEXT? WE BEGIN WITH REPUBLICAN SENATOR MAJORITY LEADER SCOTT FITZGERALD OF JUNEAU. IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK. SCOTT: GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. MIKE: YOU HAVE HEARD THE CRITICISM, THE COMPLAINTS. IS THIS GOING TO HAVE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR REPUBLICANS? SCOTT: I DO NOTHING SO. AS WE MAKE OUR CASE OF JUST WHAT WE DID AND HOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT FALL INTO ONE CATEGORY WHICH ARE, WE ARE PROTECTING SOME PUBLIC POLICY THAT HAS BEEN PASSED THROUGH BOTH HOUSES AND SIGNED INTO LAW AND A SECOND GROUP WHICH ARE MORE INNOCUOUS, IN NOKIA’S ITEMS -- INNOCUOUS, IF ANYBODY READ THROUGH THEM, IT LOOKS MORE LIKE HOUSEKEEPING. MIKE: WHEN DID YOU START TALKING ABOUT THIS? SCOTT: IN SEPTEMBER. MIKE: THESE WERE NOT DISCUSSIONS THAT BEGAN AFTER THE ELECTION? SCOTT: NO, WAY BEFORE THAT. THERE WERE CONCERNS WHETHER WE WOULD MAINTAIN CONTROL OF BOTH HOUSES. WE HAD LOST A COUPLE OF SPECIAL ELECTIONS AND WE WERE AT 18 SEATS. WE DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE POLITICAL WIND WAS GOING TO GO. THOSE TO SCOTT -- THOSE STARTED IN A VAGUE WAY. MIKE: YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED SORE LOSERS. THAT IS THE WAY DEMOCRATS ARE FRAMING THIS, YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO NULLIFY THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE? SCOTT: WE WON AND ELECTION TOO. BOTH HOUSES WILL BE UNDER REPUBLICAN CONTROL AND WE ARE STARTING TO REALIZE THIS GOVERNOR, ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, WHEN YOU SEE THE RHETORIC, HE WILL BE THE SEES. IF YOU LOOK AT HIS BACKGROUND, WHO HE IS SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH, I AM CONCERNED. I THINK WISCONSIN SHOULD BE CONCERNED THAT IN MID-FEBRUARY WHEN THIS GOVERNOR ROLLS OUT HIS BUDGET, IT WILL BE THE MOST LIBERAL DOCUMENT. MIKE: THE PEOPLE DID VOTE FOR HIM. SCOTT: THEY VOTED FOR US TOO. THE LEGISLATURE FEELS WE NEED TO MAINTAIN A BALANCE AND PROTECT A STATE THAT IS IN GREAT SHAPE. WHETHER YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY, THE UNEMPLOYMENT, YOU CAN GO ON. WISCONSIN IS GREAT AND WE WANT TO PROTECT THAT. MIKE: ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF TONY EVERS CAMPAIGN WAS HIM SAYING HE WAS GOING TO TAKE THE STATE OUT OF THE LAWSUIT CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT TO SCHNELL THE OF OBAMACARE. YOU MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE -- CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF OBAMACARE. YOU MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO THAT. ARE YOU IGNORING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE? SCOTT: SOME OF HIS RHETORIC IS ALARMING. THAT IS WHAT I’M WORRIED ABOUT. MIKE: THE LAWSUIT? SCOTT: IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE DEBATED NATIONWIDE IN WISCONSIN. IF THERE IS SUCCESS, LEGISLATURES WILL REACT. POSSIBLY WITH SOME TYPE OF RESPONSE. WE HAD A DISCUSSION IN THE SENATE THIS WEEK, I THINK THAT WILL BE A NATIONWIDE QUESTION. I’M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE AGGRESSIVE TONE AND POSTURE HE HAS TAKEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SPECIFIC TO THINGS THAT COULD DERAIL THE ECONOMY IN WISCONSIN. MIKE: IN WHAT SENSE? SCOTT: WE HAVE SO MANY PROJECTS RELATED TO THE WISCONSIN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. HE WANTS TO NOT ONLY DO AWAY WITH IT BUT REPLACE IT WITH THE OLD DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. THAT SHOULD BE ALARMING. ESPECIALLY SOME LOCAL DEVELOPMENT OFFICIALS THAT ARE SAYING WE HAVE A LOT GOING DOWN -- GOING ON AND HE WANTS TO GET RID OF IT. MIKE: I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SPEAKER V OS WAS OPTIMISTIC THERE WOULD BE ACTION ON PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS IN CASE THE LAWSUIT IS SUCCESSFUL. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. WHY DIDN’T IT AND SHOULD WE BE CONTINUING TO PUSH THROUGH THE LAWSUIT IF WE ARE NOT PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR SOME CITIZENS? SCOTT: IT DID NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THE SENATORS AND DEMOCRATS VOTED NO. I HAD A COUPLE OF MEMBERS THAT I WAS NOT SURE HOW THEY WOULD VOTE. EVERY DEMOCRAT IN THE SENATE VOTED AGAINST IT. IT DOES NOT MATCH UP WITH THE RHETORIC THEY HAD DURING THE CAMPAIGN. IT IS DISAPPOINTING WE HAVE TO REGROUP. I HAVE TO SEE WHERE WE ARE AT AND WHAT TO WE DO IN JANUARY, WILL THE DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO VOTE NO? MIKE: SHOULD I BE NERVOUS IF I AM A PERSON WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS? SCOTT: NOT IN THE SHORT TERM. IF THIS IS NOT HANDLED NATIONWIDE AND IF EACH STATE DOES NOT HAVE OPTIONS AVAILABLE, IT IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BE NERVOUS ABOUT. AT SOME POINT, YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS IT. MIKE: ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION APPROVED IS THE LIMIT ON EARLY VOTING TO TWO WEEKS. WHY IS THAT A GOOD IDEA? THE ARGUMENT IS MORE VOTING IS GOOD. WHAT ARE YOU LIMITING VOTING? SCOTT: WE HAVE PASSED THIS. MANY PEOPLE IN RURAL WISCONSIN TURN ON THEIR TELEVISION AND SEE PEOPLE STANDING AT THE POLLS 45 DAYS OUT, VOTING. WHEN THEY GO DOWN, THERE IS NO CLERK THERE. THAT IS INCONSISTENT AND THAT IRRITATES PEOPLE AND IS NOT FAIR. IT IS THE SAME DISCUSSION, THE SAME POINTS WE MADE WHEN WE DEBATED THE BILL LAST SESSION. WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE. IT IS FAIRNESS. I THINK THE FEDERAL JUDGE THE BLOCKED IT BEFORE THIS ELECTION IN NOVEMBER, THE TWEAKS WE MADE TO THAT BILL, THAT HE WILL ALLOW IT TO BECOME LAW IN WISCONSIN. MIKE: ONE OF THE PREMISES WAS TO DEAL WITH KIMBERLY-CLARK. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN? SCOTT: THERE IS GOING TO BE GOOD NEWS COMING OUT ON THAT. WISCONSIN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CONTINUES TO PURSUE AND TALK TO KIMBERLY-CLARK TO COME UP WITH A PACKAGE. IT WILL NOT BE THE SAME PACKAGE. I HAVE GOT MY FINGERS CROSSED THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL KEEP KIMBERLY-CLARK IN WISCONSIN. MIKE: YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOVERNOR EVERS GOING FORWARD. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN GIVEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED? SCOTT: IT WILL BE A BACK-AND-FORTH LIKE WE HAD WITH GOVERNORS IN THE PAST. I GOT ALONG GREAT WITH GOVERNOR DOYLE. I AM HOPING TONY EVERS TILES IT BACK ON HIS LIBERAL AGENDA -- DIALS IT BACK ON HIS LIBERAL AGENDA. I HOPE HE TAKES IT INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE HE ROLLS IT OUT. MIKE: SCOTT FITZGERALD IS THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. COMING UP NEXT, DEMOCRATS OUTRAGED BUT WHAT CAN THEY DO TO FIGHT BACK? AND LATER, NEW LIMITS ON EARLY VOTING. WILL IT BE THE SUBJECT OF A COURT CHALLENGE, AGAIN.
