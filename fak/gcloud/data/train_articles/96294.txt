WEBVTT MIKE: DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS SQUARED OFF THURSDAY NIGHT AT THEIR DEBATE IN MILWAUKEE, IN A RACE THAT APPEARS TO BE INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FOLLOWING SANDERS' BLOWOUT WIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. HOW DID CLINTON DO ON THURSDAY NIGHT, AND WHY IS SHE STRUGGLING TO CONNECT WITH YOUNGER VOTERS, ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT, AND MORE TODAY, WITH A CLINT SUPPORTER -- WISCONSIN DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATOR TAMMY BALDWI I KNOW YOU FELT HILLARY CLINTON HAD A GOOD NIGHT ON THURSDAY NIGHT. DID YOU THINK THERE WAS A KEY MOMENT FOR HER? SENATOR BALDWIN: THERE WERE SEVERAL KEY MOMENTS, BUT THE WANT TO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS A CLOSING. I THOUGHT IT WAS AS STRONG AS I'VE SEEN HER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A REAL CONTRAST ACTUALLY, WAS SHE TALKED ABOUT THINGS THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITHIN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, AS SHE STOOD ON THE STAGE RIGHT IN MILWAUKEE. SHE JUST STOOD OUT AS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS, IT HAS THE PROPOSALS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. I THINK THAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENCE THAT EMERGES OVER THE COURSE OF WHAT WILL BE A HOTLY CONTESTED PRIMARY CAMPAIGN FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. BUT THE FACT THAT SHE IS A PROGRESSIVE WHO WANTS TO GET THINGS DONE, AND HAS THE IDEAS , THE KNOW-HOW, AND THE EXPERIENCE TO DO IT. MIKE: BRIEFLY, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE ISSUE THAT WE SEE IN POLLING, OR EXIT POLLS, OR THE VOTE FOR THAT MATTER. STRUGGLING WITH WOMEN, PARTICULARLY YOUNGER WOMEN. WHAT CAN SHE DO ABOUT IT? SENATOR BALDWIN: TO PARAPHRASE HER IN RECENT DAYS, SHE SAID FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, FOR YOUNG WOMEN IN PARTICULAR -- THEY MAY NOT BE FOR HER YET. BUT SHE IS FOR THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT HER CAREER. AND SHE IS GOING TO EARN THE SUPPORT OF YOUNG PEOPLE, OF WOMEN. AND PARTLY, IT'S A RECORD. SHE HAS BEEN WORKING ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES, THE VOICELESS, SINCE BEFORE SHE WAS IN THE SPOTLIGHT. AS SHE EMERGED AS A YOUNG ATTORNEY WORKING FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. AND EVERYDAY SENSE. I THINK, IN THE END, WE HAVE TWO STATES DOWN, ONE WIN, ONE LOSS FOR HILLARY CLINTON. WE HAVE 48 STATES TO GO. I THINK SHE IS GOING TO WIN EVERYONE OVER. MIKE: I WANT TO SEGUE INTO AN ISSUE YOU A BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT OVER THE LAST YEAR, AND SAY YOU ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN THIS YEAR. YOU HAVE SIGNED ON TO A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THAT, WHETHER IT IS A TUITION FREE COLLEGE FOR TECH COLLEGE OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS, HELPING BORROWERS REFINANCE STUDENT LOANS, ITEMS LIKE THAT. HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO MOVE FORWARD? IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A DEMOCRATIC IDEA RIGHT NOW, BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO EMBRACE IT. HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT? SENATOR BALDWIN: THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS IS BIPARTISAN. THE 40 MILLION AMERICANS WHO CARRY SIGNIFICANT STUDENT DEBT, EITHER WHO ARE CURRENT STUDENTS, RECENT GRADUATES, OR EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE PARENTS HELPING THEIR CHILDREN FINANCE THEIR EDUCATION -- 40 MILLION PEOPLE HOLD AN AGGREGATE OF NEARLY $1.3 TRILLION IN DEBT. THIS IS CRISIS PROPORTION. IF YOU THINK ABOUT A YOUNG PERSON STARTING THEIR LIFE BURDENED BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT. THAT IS NOT A GREAT PLACE TO START YOUR CAREER WITH YOUR FUTURE OUT OF YOU. I THINK THIS WILL REQUIRE A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION. WE ARE NOT GOING TO WAIT AROUND TO START TALKING ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS. THE HASHTAG IN THE RED CAMPAIGN SQUARELY ADDRESSES THIS. IT'S FULLY PAID FOR. MIKE: HAVE YOU PAY FOR IT -- HOW DO YOU PAY F IT? SENATOR BALDWIN: IT'S BY ASKING THE VERY WEALTHIEST WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. PARTICULARLY WITH MY PROPOSAL TO CLOSE THE CARRIED INTEREST LOOPHOLE TO ONE OF SEVERAL MECHANISMS USED TO FUND THIS. YOU MAY KNOW THAT HEDGE FUND MANAGERS AND OTHERS IN PRIVATE EQUITY PAY MUCH LOWER INTEREST RATES ON THEIR INCOME THAN DO TRUCK DRIVERS AND TEACHERS AND NURSES. OUTRAGEOUS. BUT BACK TO THE STUDENT DEBT ISSUE. WE WANT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE DEBT TO BE ABLE TO REFINANCE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES. MIKE: LIKE YOU DO WITH A HOME MORTGAGE. SENATOR BALDWIN: LIKE YOU DO WITH A HOME, AUTO, OR SMALL BUSINESS LOAN. STUDENT DEBT IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T REFINANCE, AND THAT'S RIDICULOUS. SECONDLY, FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF FOLKS WHO ARE HEADING TOWARDS COLLEGE, WE WANT TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE. ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT I HAVE INTRODUCED, THE AMERICANS COLLEGE PROMISE ACT, COVERS K THROUGH FOUR TEAM, NOT K-12. ONE CENTURY AGO, AMERICANS DECIDED THAT A YOUNG PERSON SHOULD HAVE 12 YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PREPARATION FOR GREAT START IN LIFE. A CENTURY AGO, A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE HAVE ADEQUATE WAGE OR SALARY, SUPPORTIVE FAMILY AND GET A GREAT START IN LIFE. WE KNOW THE YOU NEED SOME COLLEGE THESE DAYS FOR HIGH-TECH ECONOMY, OUR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. I THINK WE NEED TO RETHINK THE VISION THAT UNDERGIRDS THE AMERICAN DREAM. MIKE: WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THIS IN THIS PRESIDENT FOR CAMPAIGN. THE SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN, TAMMY BALDWIN. GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK. NEXT, COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AT THE STATE LEVEL. WILL THE STATE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PLANS. I'LL ASK SENATE MAJORITY LEADER
