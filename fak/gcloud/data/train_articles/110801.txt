Trump's political skills praised — by Nixon in 1987
Long before Donald Trump began seeking the presidency this year, some people praised his political skills — including former president Richard Nixon nearly three decades ago.

After Trump appeared on Phil Donahue’s talk show in 1987, Nixon sent him an admiring letter, according to a new biography of Trump set to be published later this month.

“Dear Donald, I did not see the program, but Mrs. Nixon told me you were great,” the former president wrote Trump, The New York Times reported Tuesday based on an excerpt from the book. “As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office, you will be a winner!”

The letter, dated Dec. 21, 1987, is signed “RMN,” according to the book Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success by Michael D’Antonio, which is scheduled for release on Sept. 22.

The note came more than 13 years after Nixon resigned the presidency in 1974 over the Watergate affair.

The New York Times, which received an early copy of the book, reports that it “offers candid and sometimes unflattering assessments” of Trump from friends, enemies, and ex-wives, on items ranging from his youthful experience in military school to his business career.
