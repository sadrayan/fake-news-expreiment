For immediate release - June 18, 2012



Madison Metropolitan Board of Education president James Howard and Vice President Marjorie Passman released the following joint statement tonight regarding passage of the 2012-13 budget.



“We are pleased to work together with our staff and community to pass the 2012-13 budget tonight.



“Public education both in Madison and across this country faces many challenges. In the face of those challenges, we must not only find how to make ends meet each year, but also to look to the future and find ways to continuously and sustainably improve learning for all children.



“Tonight, we passed a budget that we believe puts us on that path. This budget and new programs aimed at closing gaps in student achievement balance the needs of our community and move this district forward.



“This budget:

maintains all current programming;

expands the successful AVID/TOPS program;

makes use of a negotiated agreement with our employees to continue a salary freeze and employee contributions to the Wisconsin Retirement System;

responsibly uses fund equity to lessen the burden on taxpayers; and

invests in strategies to close gaps in student achievement.

“This is a crucial time for our district, and we as a board are committed to moving this district forward, to making gains in our achievement gaps and to improving learning for all.



“We want to thank the administrators and staff for their work on this budget and families and community members for their engagement and input in this process.”



The total budget of $376.2 million increases overall spending by .8% and the levy by $4.95%. The full budget will be posted on this page in the near future.
