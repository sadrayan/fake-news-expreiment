I thought this brooch would be a one-and-done thing, never to be seen after its original "courtesy" appearance - only because it's not really Her Maj's style - so this was a big surprise! This is what I've blandly called the American State Visit Brooch, a gift from President and Mrs. Obama on their state visit in 2011. The petals are moss agate, a unique material in her brooch collection. You can read more about it in our flashback to that state visit here
