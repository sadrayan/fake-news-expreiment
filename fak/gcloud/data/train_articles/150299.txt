Mexico: An unsafe country for thousands of refugees fleeing violence in Central America
US and Mexico must meet its responsibilities towards populations fleeing violence

According to official figures from the United Nations Refugee Agency, 108,500 people from the NTCA applied for asylum in the US in 2017, while only 8,700 chose to carry out this process in Mexico. Staying in Mexico is not a viable alternative for many people who fear the violence of criminal organisations there. The deadlock is particularly brutal for minors, whether travelling alone or accompanied.

"Mexico should be able to guarantee protection, healthcare and safe passage to migrants and refugees,” says Bosch. “The US also needs to fulfil its international responsibilities and recognise the status of asylum-seekers and refugees. The US continues to have an essential role play in addressing this humanitarian crisis.”

In 2017, the scale of the crisis led MSF to publish a report: Forced to flee the Northern Triangle of Central America: A forgotten humanitarian crisis. The situation is now getting worse, causing greater suffering to a population that has been subjected to tremendous violence in their countries of origin and in their transit through Mexico. Now they must also endure an unprecedented level of institutional violence from the US, where they are not only prevented from claiming the protection they need but are facing additional threats. People seeking safety, and their children, are being detained under inhumane conditions and face the risk of deportation, in violation of the principle of non-refoulement.
