Slideshow: Americaâ€™s Safest and Most Dangerous States 2016
Alaska is the most dangerous state in the nation for the second year in a row according to the latest violent crime data from the FBI. Despite a slight decrease in its violent crime rate from 640 per 100,000 in 2013 to 635.8 per 100,000 in 2014--the most recent year for which the FBI provides data--Alaska maintains its number one spot, followed by Nevada (635.6) and Tennessee (608.4). Law Street's third annual slideshow of the Safest and Most Dangerous States ranks all 50 states from most dangerous to safest and details the violent crime statistics for every city in the country with a reported population of 25,000 or more. Each state's qualifying cities are listed from highest to lowest rate of violent crime per 100,000 people. The category of violent crime is comprised of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.
