Medicaid spending is growing at an unsustainable rate
Why do we need to reform Medicaid now? Medicaid spending makes up a tenth of the federal budget and it's an unsustainable trend.

While majority of funding comes from the federal government, Medicaid is also consuming state budgets. It must be reformed to provide better care.

Under the Senate's proposed health care bill, Medicaid expansion stays--but federal funding levels, currently 95%, will fall to meet all other Medicaid categories.
