× Man arrested for DUI laughs in mug shot

It’s a mug shot unlike any other.

Police charged the village manager of west suburb Westmont with driving under the influence.

Clarendon Hills Police arrested Ronald Searl, 54, on July 3. An officer says he saw Searl driving in a center turn lane and smelled alcohol on his breath after he pulled him over. Searl then failed a field sobriety test. His blood-alcohol content was .112, above the legal limit to drive of .08.

Searl is due back in court next month.
