Obama Blames Cameron For Libya Becoming A "Shitshow"
In a recent interview with The Atlantic magazine, US president Barack Obama appears to partly blame David Cameron for what Obama called a "shit show" in Libya.

Obama said that Cameron became "distracted" after the 2011 intervention, and likened the UK, France, and other European allies to "free riders".

International military intervention during the Arab Spring prevented a massacre by forces loyal to Muammar al-Qaddafi, but since then the country has spiralled into civil war, with ISIS establishing a foothold as well.

"When I go back and I ask myself what went wrong, there's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up," Obama said.

Cameron, Obama said, became "distracted by a range of other things", while the US president noted that his French counterpart at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, was voted out of office the following year.

"Sarkozy wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure," Obama said.

Obama, The Atlantic reported, described the present situation in Libya as a "mess".

"We actually executed this plan as well as I could have expected: We got a UN mandate, we built a coalition, it cost us $1 billion â€“ which, when it comes to military operations, is very cheap," he said. "We averted large-scale civilian casualties, we prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict. And despite all that, Libya is a mess."

But privately he is more candid, labelling it a "shitshow".
