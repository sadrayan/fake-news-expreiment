Diamond Valley Lake is Southern California's largest reservoir with a capacity of approximately 810,000 acre-feet (264 billion gallons). Construction began September 1995 and the reservoir was completed in March 2000 and doubled the region's water storage capacity.

DVL covers 4,500 surface acres, is 4.5 miles long and more than two miles wide, with a depth of 150 to 250 feet. The reservoir is located near Hemet in Riverside County approximately 90 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

DVL holds enough water to meet the area's emergency and drought needs for six months and is an important component in Metropolitan's system that provides a reliable supply of water to the 19 million people in Metropolitan's six-county service area.
