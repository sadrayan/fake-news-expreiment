Derailed Amtrak Train Was No Accident After All, Muslim Man Arrested
On Monday, an Amtrak train derailed above Interstate 5 in Dupont, Washington.

This disaster killed several people on the train and injured several others according to Fake News CNN, who note that the deaths are “all contained to the train.”

According to the Washington Department of Transportation and Human Welfare, “something caused it to come off the tracks.”

It is unclear as of yet how many people were killed, but what CNN isn’t mentioning is that we do know what caused this “accident” and it was not an accident.

Breitbart reports that police scanners at the time of the derailment, cops were searching for a “man of Middle Eastern appearance” in the area who was seen walking away from the overpass from which part of the train hung for hours with passengers inside.

Twenty minutes later, Patrol Car 42 announced, “suspect apprehended.” While no official report has been released, chatter on the radio indicates that someone had placed a gold dollar on the track — a trick anyone can learn from children’s television — in an effort to derail the train.

Traditionally a penny would be used, but in 1949 the United Railway Association required changes in trains that would allow them to pass over a penny without derailing. A quarter is not thick enough, but a Sacajawea gold dollar is.
