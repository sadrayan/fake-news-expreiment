Gov. Rick Perry Applauds Efforts to Improve Affordability at Texas Tech University System and University of Houston System

Gov. Rick Perry today applauded both the Texas Tech University System and University of Houston System for approving a four-year fixed tuition rate for incoming freshmen:

"As families gather around their kitchen tables working to budget and make college a reality, the leadership at Texas Tech University System and University of Houston System have now given them the peace of mind of knowing that tuition will remain the same for four years and at the same time encouraging these students to complete their degrees on time."

In order to ensure Texas students who want to pursue a degree have access to an affordable education, Gov. Perry has called for a four-year fixed tuition at the rate a student pays his or her freshman year. The University of Texas System, Texas State University System and the University of North Texas System have already announced plans to offer a four-year fixed tuition option.

Gov. Perry has also proposed outcomes-based funding for institutions, tying 10 percent of an institution's state funding to the number of students it graduates. He has also encouraged institutions to use technology to help improve four-year graduation rates and make tuition more affordable. Additionally, the governor has renewed his challenge for institutions to offer bachelor's degrees for $10,000 or less, including books. So far, 13 institutions have announced or implemented a $10,000 degree.
