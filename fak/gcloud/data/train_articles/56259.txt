Senator Hillary Clinton named “Walking Eagle” by American Indians-Fiction!
Subject: WALKING EAGLE

Senator Hillary Clinton was invited to address a major gathering of the American Indian Nation two weeks ago in upper New York State. She spoke for almost an hour on her future plans for increasing every Native American’s present standard of living, should she one day become the first female President. She referred to her career as a New York Senator, how she had signed “YES” for every Indian issue that came to her desk for approval.

Although the Senator was vague on the details of her plan, she seemed most enthusiastic about her future ideas for helping her “red sisters and brothers.” At the conclusion of her speech, the Tribes presented the Senator with a plaque inscribed with her new Indian name – Walking Eagle. The proud Senator then departed in her motorcade, waving to the crowds.

A news reporter later inquired to the group of chiefs of how they come to select the new name given to the Senator. They explained that Walking Eagle is the name given to a bird so full of shit it is unable to fly.
