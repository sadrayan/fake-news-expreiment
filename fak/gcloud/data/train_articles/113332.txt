Parody State Quarters
Noted state quarter designer Daniel Carr is designing a new series of commemorative statehood CARRter Dollars. But spending these coins is illegal, so don't expect to find one in your pocket change anytime soon. That means that they will be a rare collectible item, obtainable only from coin dealers and collectors, and at much higher prices in the future for sure ! Two versions of each are available - one with a standard nickel-copper composition (like regular quarters) and a very limited edition with a yellow brass composition. prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /

All of the Altered States quarters share a common "heads" side design which shows a dude wearing a t-shirt and sunglasses, along with an interlocked DC designer's logo. Many more are on the way (see below).
