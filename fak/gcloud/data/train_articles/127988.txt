Why Won't Donald Trump Release His Karyogram?

During a TV interview earlier this week, Donald Trump remembered how fortunate he was to avoid service in the Vietnam War: "I actually got lucky because I had a very high draft number. I’ll never forget, that was an amazing period of time in my life."

Yeah, um, except it turns out... he forgot. According to Selective Service records obtained by the Smoking Gun, Trump requested and received a series of student deferments until, following a physical exam in 1968, he first received a medical deferment (classified 1-Y: "only in time of national emergency"), and later a full 4-F disqualification in 1972.

So Trump lied forgot about his draft deferments, a bit of biographical bullshitting that is damning in itself. But over at HA, Darryl notices something awfully curious scribbled on Trump's selective services records.

Prompting Darryl to ask:

Huh? Would that be YXX as in one extra X chromosome? The condition, called Klinefelter syndrome, is not uncommon—it occurs in somewhere from 0.1% to 0.2% of males.

A chromosomal disorder of this type could explain both Trump's bizarre behavior and his faulty memory surrounding his selective service records. But of course the only way voters can know for sure is if he releases his medical records including a complete karyogram of his chromosomal pairs. You'd think Trump of all people wouldn't want there to be any confusion over the circumstances of his birth.
