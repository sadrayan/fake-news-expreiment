Why a mom's Facebook warning about human traffickers hurts sex-trafficked kids
I wish I could say the post nonetheless will help make us all "better safe and vigilant" than sorry. In fact, I find that it so misrepresents the dangers, warning signs and risks associated with sex trafficking that its readers and likers may now try to protect kids by watching for the wrong things in the wrong places. They may miss real sex trafficking as it happens; they may miss the opportunity to extend a lifeline to child who needs their help. What people don't understand about sex trafficking can prove lethal to kids.
