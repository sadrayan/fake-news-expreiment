"Our Nine Elms Embassy Is the Most Advanced We've Ever Built" - The Evening Standard (London, England), January 12, 2018
Byline: Robert Johnson US Ambassador

LONDON is one of the world's greatest capitals. People are drawn to this magnificent city from across the United Kingdom and the rest of the world. London is a modern city offering incredible energy, innovation and opportunity. It is also a city rich in history. For Americans, that is a winning combination.

It is amazing for us to come to London and be surrounded by so much history that is often intertwined with our own. There are hundreds of places that are full of significance to us here: the Rotherhithe port where the Pilgrims embarked on the Mayflower, Benjamin Franklin's house near Trafalgar Square, the memorial to American Second World War airmen in St Paul's Cathedral these are just a few examples.

But it is in Grosvenor Square that you will find the biggest window into America's history in London. John Adams, our first-ever US representative to the UK, began our association with the square back in 1785. In the centuries that followed, the American flag remained a common sight in Grosvenor Square. This was America's home in the UK for most of the 20th century. General Eisenhower even commanded the Allied Forces during the Second World War from there. As the generations have come and gone, the square has become firmly established as London's "Little America". The traces of our history are all around from the statues of former presidents in the square, to the giant eagle over the Embassy building. â€¦
