Do we need specific authorization for demonstrations?

The authorization depends on the country where we will be demonstrating and on the type of event. If you want us to demonstrate at an Airshow, you must apply for authorization at the aviation department of your country. We are used to these requests so we can help you! The only exception is for France, indeed we already applied and can demonstrate in Airshows as long as we take-off and land from an airfield.
