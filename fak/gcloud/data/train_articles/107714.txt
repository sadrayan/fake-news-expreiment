OUCH! Woman Hides Stolen Can of Cookie Dough in Her Vagina Then...BOOM! ⋆ Dc Gazette
Being short on cash will make some people do crazy things, but this takes crazy to a whole new level! A 34-year-old mother of 3 is now under arrest after a shoplifting incident turned tragic. On Sunday, Shatuanee Greene entered the North Carolina Walmart with her three children ages 5, 7, and 8.

CCTV footage shows the woman take a can of pre-made cookie dough to the toy aisle as her children crowded around her. Greene then lifted up her skirt and made the can of cookie dough “disappear.”

When Greene was approached by Walmart security, she told her children to go find their Aunt in the front of the store. “I told her to hand over the cookie dough,” said Timothy Reiner, a security guard at Walmart. “That’s when she turned around to run and I grabbed her by the arm. She put up a good fight, and that’s when I tackled her to the ground. Then I heard a loud pop and the lady started screaming. Gooey cookie dough was running down her leg. All hot and runny… it was so damn gross.”

The EMT who treated Greene on the scene said the Pillsbury cookie dough can exploded in Greene’s vagina during the fall causing her excruciating pain. The contents were removed at the scene and Greene was treated then released into the custody of Greenville police. Greene did not suffer any serious injuries and is being held at the county jail on a $2000 bond. Her children were placed with family members.

I guess that’s the way the cookie crumbles, or in this case EXPLODES!
