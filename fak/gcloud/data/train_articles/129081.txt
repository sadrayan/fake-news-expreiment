People Noticed Something SICK Inside White House as Michelle Obama ‘Decorated’ for Christmas
The Obama family unveiled their final Christmas decorations in the White House today, and Christians are already furious about what they are seeing.

Daily Mail reported that the theme this year is “The Gift of the Holidays,” and it is meant to reflect the joy of giving and receiving. However, Christians immediately noticed that the White House does not have a single depiction of the birth of Jesus Christ, which is what Christmas is really all about.

When looking through the photos of the White House decorations, there is an abundance of trees, gingerbread houses, and snowmen. Nowhere is there any image of Jesus Christ or the Nativity scene.

This is just the latest in a long line of moves that the Obamas have made against Christmas. It’s sickening that they have submitted to political correctness to the point that they have completely censored Jesus Christ out of Christmas.
