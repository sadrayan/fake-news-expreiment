Dear readers, help us fact-check your congressional district town halls
The Washington Post Fact Checker wants to fact-check your Senate and House district town hall — and we need your help.

We want to know what members of Congress are telling their constituents during the April recess. Will you be at a town hall in your district? Send us a URL to video or audio, email us your video or audio clips, or submit the claim using this form. (You can also fill out the form at the end of this column.)

You can tweet us (@myhlee or @glennkesslerWP), find us on Facebook (Fact Checker or myhlee) or email to factchecker@washpost.com.

We’ll take suggestions for any topic that piques your interest, though we’re especially interested in health care, immigration, actions taken by President Trump’s administration, and the federal budget.

We want to focus on districts where lawmakers are up for reelection in 2018, or ones that are otherwise interesting to watch, including:
