Hoarding of Animals Research Consortium
This site brings together the work of HARC as well as credible resources from throughout the US to help you better understand the phenomenon of animal hoarding, its impact on individuals and communities all across the US and internationally, and finally, its sentinel role for elder abuse and neglect, child abuse and neglect, and adult self-neglect. To accomplish this, we also explore to some extent various other aspects of the relationship between people and companion animals, which helps us understand how in some cases, a positive, beneficial, relationship can become very one sided and go terribly wrong, harming people and animals alike.
