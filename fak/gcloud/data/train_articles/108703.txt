Photos: Donald Trump's Sons Awesome At Killing Elephants And Other Wildlife
Animal rights activists are revolted by a series of trophy photos that have emerged showing Eric and Donald Trump Jr. posing with a dead elephant, kudu, civet cat and waterbuck while on a big game safari in Zimbabwe last year. In one photo, Donald Jr. proudly holds a dead elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other. In another, the brothers are seen standing beside a 12'8" crocodile hanging from a noose off a tree. Activists obtained the photos and created this video montage of the Trumps' big hunt:

“Like all animals, elephants, buffalo, and crocodiles deserve better than to be killed and hacked apart for two young millionaires’ grisly photo opportunity,” a spokesperson from PETA told Hollywood Life. ”If the young Trumps are looking for a thrill, perhaps they should consider skydiving, bungee jumping, or even following in their anti-hunting father’s footsteps and taking down competing businesses—not wild animals. If the Trumps want to help villagers, they have plenty of resources at their disposal."

Responding to the criticism on Twitter, Don Jr. blasted the "PETA crazies" and insisted "the meat was used to feed hungry villagers." The big game safari was organized through a company called Hunting Legends. The Daily Mail reports that there are trophy fees for the deer-like animal they shot, called the Kudu. The Trumps reportedly paid at least $2,795.00 and another $1,997.00 for the Waterbuck they were pictured with, but Don Jr. says on Twitter, "the money from hunting fees preserves animals and habitat."
