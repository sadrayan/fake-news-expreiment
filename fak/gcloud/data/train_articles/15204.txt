Wisconsin Foxconn Technology Group development project

On October 4, 2017, Foxconn announced it will be locating its first U.S. manufacturing facility in the village of Mount Pleasant in Racine County. The Foxconn Technology Group (Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd.) is a multinational electronics manufacturing company headquartered in Taiwan. The company is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and the fourth-largest information technology company.

As required by law, prior to construction and operation of the new facility, Foxconn must work with the state on receiving the appropriate permits and follow state and federal standards, including but not limited to applicable air and water quality and solid and hazardous waste regulations. Also, Foxconn is subject to federal wetland permitting requirements and must properly mitigate any impact on wetlands.

The DNR will be working with Foxconn, local government officials and other state and federal agencies to ensure all applicable permit requirements are met, including consideration of any environmental impacts associated with any permits or approvals.

Wisconsin Act 58

In September 2017, the State Legislature passed 2017 Wisconsin Act 58, authorizing the state to create an Electronics and Information Technology Manufacturing (EITM) Zone, within which Foxconn will be operating. The act also directed DNR to "ensure that the conditions of applicable permits, licenses, and approvals under the department's jurisdiction are met for all activities related to the construction, access, or operation of a new manufacturing facility within an electronics and information technology manufacturing zone designated under section 238.396 (1m) of the statutes, including but not limited to permits, licenses, and approvals required under [chapters 23 through 299] of the statutes and any associated rules promulgated by the department of natural resources."
