Twitter user @solikearose shared several photos of her TV with BuzzFeed News, showing the programming information for Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown over the top of what was clearly not a food travel series.

"I initially posted because I wanted to see if anyone else in Boston had been affected," the Twitter user, who asked only to be identified as Rose, told BuzzFeed News.

"I think it was a broadcasting error that affected only my house," Rose said.
