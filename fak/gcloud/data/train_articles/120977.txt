And if you’re like a lot of families, it also means a little cash under your pillow in the morning from the “tooth fairy.”

If you grew up to have kids of your own, you may have even taken on the time-honored role of the tooth fairy and slipped some money under your kids’ pillows to celebrate this new stage in their lives.

But what do you do with the tooth after you swap it out for a dollar? Some people keep them as sentimental keepsakes, but many simply toss them.

After all, what can a shed baby tooth really do for you?

Well, as it turns out, quite a bit.

A study in 2003 showed that baby teeth are a rich source of stem cells, which are like protocells that can be grown into multiple kinds of cells if needed.

That means that if later in life, a child needs replacement tissue for whatever reason, the stem cells from their baby teeth can be used to grow the needed tissue. Pretty amazing!

Potentially, the practice of storing baby teeth could save lives and treat a variety of ailments. Read on to learn more about this amazing process.
