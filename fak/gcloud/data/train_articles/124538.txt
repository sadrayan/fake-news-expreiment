ITS NOT YOUR FAULT!

People from all walks of life can be a victim of sexual abuse. It doesn’t matter your age, race or cultural background, everyone is at risk of becoming a victim.

It must be known that you did not choose for this to happen to you, there is nothing specific about you that makes you more vulnerable to this abuse.

Sexual abuse, like any form of abuse is a criminal offence and is never the fault of the person it happens to. It doesn’t matter whether you were drinking or drugging. It doesn’t matter what you were wearing or saying. It doesn’t matter if you knew the abuser or were having an argument.

You are, Under No Circumstances responsible for being assaulted or sexually abused.

The person who did this to you is the only person responsible for your sexual assault; they are the ones to blame.
