NOT AGAIN: Doctor Who Exposed Clinton Foundation Corruption Found Dead – Miami Post
Dr. Dean Lorich was among America’s leading orthopedic surgeons and a real humanitarian.

He was also one of a growing number of whistleblowers exposing Clinton corruption. And, like so many of the other people, he fulfilled with a savage and premature end.

Lorich was discovered dead by his 11-year-old daughter around the floor of the Upper East Side apartment on Monday.

Lorich had bled out.

Aside from the fact that he had every reason to live, what calls the nature of Lorich’s passing into question is the simple fact that just a few decades ago, he very publicly known as the Clinton Foundation for shady dealings after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti.

Lorich himself was part of the US relief campaign sent to Haiti, and later said he was disgusted by the “black” performance being run there by the Clintons.

The doctor took his concerns directly to Hillary Clinton, but was unsatisfied with her reply, so went public on CNN.

The Clinton Foundation raised billions of dollars in financial help in the wake of the earthquake. However, in accordance with Lorich, a paltry 0.6% really went to funding aid on the floor.

Lorich and his team came in Haiti hoping to have everything they had to save lives, given precisely how much the Clinton Foundation and other organizations had raised.

Instead, the American group found that the suffering Haitians had been left to dry.

The Clinton’s gave nearly 10 percent of their donors’ money to the corrupt government, while nearly 90% was siphoned off someplace.

Dr. Lorich appears to have paid with his life to expose this evil.

Now, what are we going to do with such pricey information?
