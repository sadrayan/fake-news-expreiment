Subject: Inquiry for a Texas fact check

Hello again.

I write because the PGA commissioner, Tim Finchem, said Sunday: “Austin’s the fastest-growing city in the country the last five years.”

From the bureau’s data, what are the best-available figures that would illuminate the accuracy of the claim?

THANKS.

Gardner,

I've attached a table ranking incorporated cities of 50,000 or more population by rate of growth between 2010 and 2014 (our latest estimates). This table shows Austin ranks 23rd. However, if you put a population floor of 250,000 or more on this, then Austin would rank first.

So, there is no 2014-15 estimate by city?

Not yet -- these estimates will be released in late May.

Thanks.

Is there a break-out comparing pop growth for all MSAs and through June 2015? I ask because an Austin Chamber of Commerce says the Austin area would “be the fastest growing among the top 100 metros between 2010 and 2015. But among all metros, Midland, TX, Odessa, TX, and The Villages, FL grew faster.”

RESPONSE:

I've attached a spreadsheet ranking all the metro areas based on rate of growth between 2010 and 2015 (based on the estimates we released last week).

It shows that Austin ranks 3rd, behind The Villages and Midland. Column I represents the rate of change over the period, Column M the ranking based on that rate of change, with Column G representing the total population in 2015. If you limited the ranking to metro areas with a total population of 200,000 or more, Austin would rank #1.
