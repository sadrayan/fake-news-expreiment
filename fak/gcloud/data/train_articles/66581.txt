Bill Clinton Laughs Off Rove’s Wild Speculation About Hillary’s Health
Former President Bill Clinton dismissed speculation about his wife Hillary’s health Wednesday, reminding conservatives like Karl Rove that they accused her of staging a concussion she suffered in 2012.

Moderator Gwen Ifill asked Clinton in a question-and-answer session at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation about Rove’s suggestion that his wife suffered a “traumatic brain injury” when she fell in 2012, leading to her hospitalization for a blood clot.

“I gotta give him credit. That embodies the old saying that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,” Clinton said. “First they said she faked her concussion, now they say she’s auditioning for a part on ‘The Walking Dead.’ Whatever it takes.”

Clinton joked that his wife was in far better shape than he is and said he was “dumbfounded” at the sudden implication that she had a serious medical problem.

“They went through all this trouble to say she staged a concussion that she went through six months of very serious work to get over,” he said, adding that as secretary of state Hillary Clinton never concealed that medical issue from the American people.

Rove later denied that he said Hillary Clinton suffered brain damage but argued her health and age are fair game should she decide to run for president.
