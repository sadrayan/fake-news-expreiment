Mia Khalifa Addresses HIV Rumors

The internet can be a messed up place. Everybody knows that. In an era where fake news runs rampant and any moron can post whatever they want online under the guise of anonymity, this is truer than ever. Today, that dark side of the inernet reared its ugly head against Mia Khalifa.

Long story short, a fake interview with Mia was posted online months ago that contained a fabricated discussion revolving around sexually transmitted diseases in the porn industry. For whatever reason, this morning that phony interview took on a life of its own, going viral (no pun intended) and exploding across the internet, unleashing a “Mia Khalifa is HIV positive” rumor that ended up trending worldwide on Twitter.

Below is her statement addressing the rumor that she is HIV positive.

The site that posted this incredibly fake “interview” with me is less credible than those ads on porn sites for hot girls in your area who are dying to meet you. I’m not sure what they have to gain from this bullshit other than publicity, but they definitely got that. I wasn’t even going to make a statement acknowledging this trash, but because it has gotten so much exposure, it feels necessary. I don’t usually let mean-spirited things about me on the internet get under my skin. That’s a skill I’ve had to develop over time. But I’d be lying if I said this didn’t hurt me. It has gotten to the point where people who are actually close to me started texting and asking if this shit was true – and that’s what hurts the most. I’ve gotten used to being bashed, but a person can only take so much. In case it isn’t clear already: no, I am not HIV positive. I get laid way less often than you’d think. The closest thing to intimacy in my life right now is when my roommate is washing her sheets and sleeps in my bed with me.

There you have it. No HIV for Mia. Sad as it is that even a chick who is constantly accosted by horny dudes online is capable of feeling violated by the rumor mill to the point that she feels obligated to speak out, at least we’ve cleared that up and she has a good sense of humor about it all.

Don’t believe everything you read, kids — especially online. Unless it’s on this website..
