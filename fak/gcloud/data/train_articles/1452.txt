How do you differ from your opponent? "I will shift the focus of leadership in this district back on the homeowners and ratepayers, not on the special interests and the insurance industry. There is a very partisan bend to the issues and the process to the issues that Bogdanoff uses, but that doesn't lead to results."

How will you protect the environment?

"We need to do more to protect the reef off of Port Everglades. We need to do more to live up to our name as the Sunshine State. We need to move forward on the technology to bring about a renewable future. I have a proposal to dramatically increase the number of homes that use solar energy by building a relationship between homeowners and power companies."

How will you cut government waste and ensure accountability?

"More use of online resources for licenses through the cities. We have a great opportunity to cut down on the administrative expenses. I look forward to getting to work and looking at how we are spending money right now."

What are your plans to reform the property tax system?
