Russian embassy in UK tweets fake news - Jul. 03, 2017
It’s not just the general public that’s falling for fakes from social media these days – the Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom seems to have trouble sorting fact from fiction as well.

The embassy’s Twitter account on July 3 tweeted a picture of an anti-Russian poster that it claimed had been put up in Kyiv, with the comment: “Racist posters in Kiev (sic). Russian language equal to infection and bad IQ. Food for thought.”

However, no such poster has been seen on the streets of Kyiv.
