Toyota Announces Development of Plug-In Hybrid; First Manufacturer to Have PHEV Certified for Public Road Use in Japan

25 July 2007

Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) announced that it has developed a plug-in hybrid vehicle and become the first manufacturer to have such a vehicle certified for use on public roads in Japan. (Earlier post.)

The Toyota Plug-in HV—certified for public road-use by Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport—uses a NiMH battery pack and has an all-electric range of 13 kilometers (8 miles) under the 10-15 cycle with a maximum speed of 100 km/h (62 mph).

In its press release, Toyota said that:

Although challenges still exist in the development of pure electric vehicles such as a limited cruising range and issues related to cost, TMC still views plug-in hybrid vehicles as a promising technology for allowing electricity to serve as a viable power source for automobiles and is committed to their continued development as a key environmental technology.

Toyota will conduct public-road tests in Japan with eight units of the Plug-in HV to verify electric-motor-only cruising ranges and optimal battery capacity. While doing so, it plans to provide the government with data for formulating testing methods for emissions and fuel efficiency and to consider TMC’s measures for promoting plug-in hybrids and the use of electricity. Toyota also plans to conduct public-road tests of the Plug-in HV in the United States and in Europe.

Specifications of Toyota Plug-in HV Vehicle Length/Width/Height 4,445/1,725/1,490 mm Weight 1,360 kg Seating capacity 5 persons All-electric performance Cruising range 13 km in 10-15 cycle Max. speed 100 km/h Engine Displacement 1,496cc Max. output 56 kW (75 hp) @ 5,000rpm Max. torque 110 Nm (81 lb-ft) @ 4,000 rpm Motor Type AC synchronous Max. output 50 kW (67 hp) @ 1,200 - 1,540rpm Max. torque 400 Nm (295 lb-ft) @ 0-1,200 rpm Secondary battery Type NiMH Capacity 13 Ah (6.5 Ah x 2) Rated voltage 202V Overall System Maximum Output 100 kW (134 hp) Voltage 202 - 500V Battery charging Power source Household electrical power Charging time 1 - 1.5 hrs (200V); 3 - 4 hrs (100V)
