Gerrymandering
Using data from the 2012, 2014, and 2016 election cycles, Extreme Maps finds that partisan bias resulting largely from the worst gerrymandering abuses in just a few battleground states provides Republicans a durable advantage of 16-17 seats in the current Congress, representing a significant portion of the 24 seats Democrats would need to gain control of the House in 2020.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Every decade, states redraw congressional maps after the decennial census. Redistricting allows districts

to be rebalanced, ensuring in theory that all districts are both equally populated and representative. But

redistricting also provides an enormous opportunity for politicians: the chance to redraw a district map

means the opportunity to gerrymander and to manipulate a map to create a more favorable set of districts

for themselves and for their party.

Congressional maps were last redrawn en masse after the 2010 Census, and accusations of gerrymandering

in states nationwide soon followed. Complaints about redistricting abuses ran the gamut from allegations

that some maps had been drawn to favor incumbents to outrage at the sprawling and unnatural shapes of

districts in others.

This report focuses on one of the most egregious of these abuses: the manipulation of district lines to give

the party drawing the map a share of seats grossly at odds with statewide election results, thus ensuring

that one party is overrepresented and the other underrepresented in a delegation.

To gauge where this type of gerrymandering is taking place and its magnitude, this report used election

results in states with six or more congressional districts to assess the extent and the durability of partisan

bias the degree of systematic advantage one party receives over another in turning votes into seats. For

this analysis, this report used multiple quantitative measures of partisan bias to examine the 2012, 2014,

and 2016 congressional elections. It also looked at the relationship between the body that drew the maps

and the degree of bias observed. It is among the first analyses to use 2016 electoral data to examine maps,

and the first report of its kind to measure maps using multiple measures of bias and to identify the handful

of single-party controlled states that are responsible for nearly all of the bias in this decades maps.

Our key findings include:

This decades congressional maps are consistently biased in favor of Republicans.

In the 26 states that account for 85 percent of congressional districts, Republicans derive a net

benefit of at least 16-17 congressional seats in the current Congress from partisan bias. This

advantage represents a significant portion of the 24 seats Democrats would need to pick up to

regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018.

Just seven states account for almost all of the bias.

Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania consistently have the most extreme levels of

partisan bias. Collectively, the distortion in their maps has accounted for seven to ten extra

Republican seats in each of the three elections since the 2011 redistricting, amounting to one-

third to one-half of the total partisan bias across the states we analyzed.

Florida, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia have less severe partisan bias but jointly account for most of

the remaining net extra Republican seats in the examined states.

EXTREME MAPS | 1

Single-party control of the redistricting process is closely linked with biased maps.

The seven states with high levels of partisan bias are all states where one political party had sole

control of the redistricting process. Court-ordered modifications to maps in Florida, Texas,

and Virginia all originally drawn under sole Republican control have reduced but not

entirely curbed these states partisan bias.

States where Democrats had sole control of redistricting have high partisan bias within state

congressional delegations, but the relatively small number of districts in these states creates a

much smaller effect on partisan bias in the House overall.

By contrast, maps drawn by commissions, courts, and split-control state governments exhibited

much lower levels of partisan bias, and none had high levels of bias persisting across all three

of the elections since the 2011 round of redistricting.

There is strong evidence that the bias in this decades congressional maps is not accidental. With the

exception of Texas, all of the most biased maps are in battleground states. These states routinely have

close statewide elections and a fairly even distribution of partisanship across most of the state two

factors that do not naturally suggest that there should be a large and durable underrepresentation of

one political party.

INTRODUCTIONPartisan gerrymandering has long been a problematic facet of American politics.1 When a political partygains full control of the redistricting process, it can manipulate district boundaries to create maps thatsystematically advantage the party in control and lock in an advantage for the party in future elections.By carefully designing maps to benefit itself, a political party can entrench an unfair majority in a statelegislature or congressional delegation for the entire decade. Political parties thus have a clear incentiveto gerrymander in order to gain more favorable districts and additional seats. Technology and a growingflood of money into the redistricting process are, by broad consensus, only making the situation worse.2

In the face of powerful incentives for partisan map-drawers to manipulate maps, voters often have been

left without a remedy. Voters in some states have been able to use ballot initiatives to impose fairer

rules or processes, but such options are available only in about half the states.3 Courts, likewise, have

been reluctant to wade into the political thicket to police partisan gerrymandering and resolve these

problems, in part because of a perceived difficulty of deciding when a map goes too far.4

New quantitative measures of gerrymandering may offer a path forward. By providing ways to measure

the extent of manipulation, these measures offer courts powerful new diagnostic tools. One promising

approach looks at measuring partisan bias, or the gains one party receives based on the district map.

Under this approach, district and/or statewide vote shares are used to determine whether one party had

a systematic advantage in turning its votes into seats. In other words, partisan bias looks at whether each

party is winning its fair share of seats, or if one party is more easily and unfairly winning extra seats.

This report examines partisan bias in the congressional maps drawn by states with six or more districts

after the 2010 Census, using congressional results from the 2012, 2014, and 2016 elections a

mix of pro-Republican and pro-Democratic cycles to analyze maps under three of the quantitative

measures that have been used by courts or social scientists to gauge partisan bias or skew.5 In addition

to measuring the degree of bias, this report also attempts to gauge the role that this bias plays in the

composition of the current Congress. Lastly, it looks at whether the existence of extreme bias correlates

with other qualitative factors suggesting that the observed bias may, in substantial part, stem from

legislators deliberate choices.

Gerrymandering to Aggressively Maximize Seat Share

The term gerrymandering is often used loosely to refer to a broad range of redistricting abuses

including, but not limited to, the fracturing of communities of interest, the protection of incumbents,

the targeting of political foes, and/or the lack of competition in districts. This report uses the term

gerrymandering narrowly and specifically, considering only the pernicious and increasingly common

type of aggressive gerrymander in which a party draws maps to maximize and lock in a disproportionately

large share of seats. This flavor of gerrymandering is growing with the aid of technology and the

availability of more robust data, and is one that several Justices on the Supreme Court have signaled is

most likely to give rise to constitutional problems.6 With this type of gerrymandering comes an increase

in partisan bias in order to maximize the seats a party receives, that party must create a structural

advantage within the map to help turn votes into seats more easily.

EXTREME MAPS | 3

Measuring Partisan Bias and Gerrymandering

To assess the extent of extreme partisan bias and potential gerrymandering in states maps, we calculated

asymmetry scores for maps for the 2012, 2014, and 2016 elections using three prominent quantitative

tests designed to measure the type of partisan bias associated with aggressive seat maximization:

The efficiency gap looks at the number of wasted votes in a states elections. In any election,

nearly 50 percent of votes are wasted: all votes cast for a losing candidate, and any votes cast for

a winning candidate beyond the threshold needed to win (50 percent of the total + 1 vote). In a

hypothetical map with perfect partisan symmetry, both parties would waste the same number of

votes. A large difference between the parties wasted votes suggests gerrymandering could be at play,

giving one party an advantage by disproportionately wasting the others votes. The efficiency gap was

brought to prominence by Nicholas Stephanopoulos and Eric McGhee in Partisan Gerrymandering

and the Efficiency Gap7 and was subsequently referenced in Whitford v.Gill, where a three-judge panel

ruled that Wisconsins state assembly map was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.8 As of this

writing, Whitford has been appealed to the Supreme Court.

The seats-to-votes curve compares the share of seats won by a party to historical averages based on

that partys statewide vote share. Using results from the past four decades of congressional elections,

the relationship between a partys average share of the statewide vote and its share of seats in a

statewide congressional delegation can be modeled by fitting a curve to the plotted data. Statewide

vote shares from recent elections can then be placed on this curve to find the expected seat share,

and comparing the expected seat share to the actual seat share reveals the degree to which current

maps deviate from historical norms. As with the efficiency gap, large discrepancies between actual

seat share and expected seat share illustrate partisan bias in a plan. Seats-to-votes curves have been

used for decades by prominent political scientists such as Gary King,9 Edward Tufte,10 and recently

by Nicholas Goedert.11

The mean-median district vote share difference compares a partys mean district vote share to its

median vote share. The difference between the mean and median is a common analysis long used

by statisticians in many academic fields to measure skew; here, a states mean and median district

vote shares are used to examine whether states have skewed election results that were unlikely to

have arisen by chance in the absence of gerrymandering. This approach was proposed by Michael D.

McDonald and Robin Best in Unfair Partisan Gerrymanders in Politics and Law: A Diagnostic Applied

to Six Cases12 and further quantified by Sam Wang in Three Tests for Practical Evaluation of Partisan

Gerrymandering.13

We selected these three tests due to their current prominence in social science research, their ability to

detect the type of aggressive seat maximization this report focuses on, and their diversity as quantitative

approaches to measuring partisan bias.

After calculating the asymmetry scores, we grouped states by their respective map-drawing processes to

gauge whether there was a noticeable relationship between partisan control of the redistricting process and

the degree of extreme partisan bias.

We categorized a states map as extremely biased if the state had a large efficiency gap, one party in the state

received both a considerably larger number of congressional seats than expected based on its vote share,

4 | BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE

and that partys wins showed the type of statistically significant skew present in gerrymandered maps;all factors needed to be present and persistent across all three elections this cycle. Subsequent graphsin this report show the average partisan bias for each measure. A few states averages are past the cutoffused for determining extreme partisan bias but are not classified as heavily biased. This is because whiletheir average may be above the cutoff, each elections result this cycle was not; these states may exhibithigh partisan bias for one election, but the bias is not persistent across the entire cycle and thus doesnot meet our standards for extreme bias.

Both the efficiency gap and the seats-to-votes curve analyses produce skews measured in terms of seats

for each state. For these measures, we attempt to gauge the overall net effect that partisan bias has on the

composition of the House. Recognizing that neither measure cleanly produces a certain number of seats

across states, we present this overall net effect as a range rather than a single number. We generate this

range by rounding each states partisan bias to the nearest whole seat; we round states whose fractional

biases are sufficiently far away from a whole seat those between 0.25 and 0.75 both up and down,

yielding an overall range of extra seats. For example, if a state had an efficiency gap of 2.34 seats, we

would round it down to two seats for the lower bound of the range and up to three seats for the upper

bound. We then add these ranges together, first by map-drawing body and then collectively.

Consistent with prior social science research on partisan bias, all states with fewer than six congressional

districts were excluded.14 This leaves 370 seats in the remaining 26 states, or 85 percent of the total seats

in the House of Representatives.

categorization are contained in the methodology section. The appendix contains full tabulated results.

ANALYSIS

A. Efficiency Gap Analysis

Under the efficiency gap analysis, three states had a gap of at least two seats the standard for

presumptive unconstitutionality proposed by Stephanopoulos and McGhee15 in every election

since 2012: Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Republicans had sole control of the

map-drawing processes in all three states, and all of the seat gaps favor Republicans.

By contrast, no states where Democrats had sole control of the redistricting process had persistent

seat gaps of an equal magnitude, though maps in Massachusetts did have a two-seat bias in favor

of Democrats in 2014 (a strongly pro-Republican year both in Massachusetts and nationwide).

States where the parties had joint control over redistricting had gaps of well under one seat in all

three years. States where commissions or courts drew redistricting maps generally also had low seat

gaps; Californias seat gap of 4.32 seats favoring Democrats in the pro-Republican year of 2014 is

a notable exception, but its seat gaps were modest in the other two election cycles.

Maps originally drawn by Republican-controlled legislatures but later modified by courts had gaps

smaller than maps drawn solely by Republicans but worse than their court-drawn counterparts.

Texas, whose map was partially redrawn by a court prior to the 2012 elections, still displayed a

seat gap in favor of Republicans of between two to three seats in 2012 and 2016. Both Florida

and Virginia whose maps were court-modified prior to the 2016 election saw their gaps

drop noticeably in 2016, but both still had sizeable seat gaps of more than one seat in favor of

Republicans.

Stephanopoulos and McGhee measure the efficiency gap for congressional plans in terms of seats

to better understand a states effect on the overall balance of the House of Representatives; one

additional Republican House seat in California has the same impact on partisan balance in the

House as one additional Republican seat in Louisiana does. But congressional plans efficiency

gaps can also be measured as a percentage of the states total seat share. Doing so reduces the bias

against large states measured as percentages, a hypothetical gap of two seats in Californias

fifty-three districts would be much less indicative of a badly drawn map than a gap of two seats

in Louisianas six districts, for example, despite their equal effect on the balance of power in the

House as a whole.

Measuring state efficiency gaps as a percentage yields broadly similar results. North Carolina and

Pennsylvania have the worst skews, with both of North Carolinas maps (the initial legislature-

enacted plan and the redrawn plan in 2016) hovering around 20 percent in favor of Republicans

and Pennsylvanias average just shy of that. Maryland and Massachusetts have notably high

Democratic skews, with average percentages of 12 percent and 17 percent respectively, but their

small number of total districts results in small seat gaps. The ten most extreme percentage skews

occur in states where a single party controlled the redistricting process, underscoring the strong

relationship between skewed maps and single-party control.

The Brennan Centers efficiency gap analysis finds a large skew in favor of Republicans, accounting for

26-37 extra seats in 2012, 4-19 extra seats in 2014, and 17-29 extra seats in 2016, out of the 370 seats

analyzed. Democrats needed 17 more seats in 2012 and 24 more seats in 2016 to gain a majority, both

of which fall within the range of seats won by Republicans in those years due to partisan bias.

Some of this bias is likely the result of political geography and other pertinent structural factors

which the efficiency gap cannot differentiate from intentional gerrymandering but the existence of

large levels of bias in states where Republicans had sole control of the redistricting processes strongly

suggests that a sizeable portion of the pro-Republican bias likely stems from deliberate manipulation

of maps.

8 | BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE

B. Seats-to-Votes Curve Analysis

Comparing states actual seat counts to the expected seat counts from the seats-to-votes curve,

there are again three states with a persistent skew of at least two seats across all three elections:

Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, all favoring Republicans.16

Partisan bias in maps in states where Republicans had sole control of the redistricting process

netted them between 13 and 19 extra seats in the 2016 election. Michigan, North Carolina, and

Pennsylvania were collectively responsible for around half of these extra seats. Pennsylvanias map

was the worst offender, producing a skew of more than four seats in 2012, more than three seats in

2014, and more than three seats in 2016. North Carolinas maps the original map passed by the

legislature in 2011, followed by a remedial map adopted in 2016 after the original map was struck

down by the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina as a racial

gerrymander similarly had a skew just shy of three seats in each year studied, and Michigans

skew landed between two and three seats in each election.

As with the efficiency gap, states where Democrats had sole control of the redistricting process had

much lower seat skews, with the largest skews coming from Massachusetts with skews of around

two seats favoring Democrats.

States where the parties shared control of redistricting had nominal seat skews Missouris skew

just above one seat in favor of Republicans in 2012 was the only skew that was greater than

one. Commission-drawn and court-drawn maps also had small skews. As with the efficiency gap

analysis, California was an exception in 2014 with a nearly four-seat Democratic skew, but it had

a Democratic-leaning skew of less than one seat in 2012 and a Republican-leaning skew of one

seat in 2016. Among court-modified maps, Texas had a pro-Republican skew of two seats in 2016,

while Florida and Virginia continued to have skews of more than one seat under their modified

maps for 2016.

The seats-to-votes analysis, like the efficiency gap, can also be measured as a percentage skew

instead of a seat skew, and doing so again produces roughly the same outcome. North Carolina

and Pennsylvania still have the most extreme skews, with average Republican-leaning skews

greater than 20 percent. Massachusetts and Maryland have notably high Democratic skews, with

respective averages near 20 percent and 14 percent, both of which result in modest seat skews due

to the comparatively small number of districts in both states. The correlation between single-party

controlled redistricting and skewed maps remains strong: the eleven most skewed states all had

map-drawing processes controlled solely by one party.

Similar to the efficiency gap, the seats-to-votes analysis reveals a national skew in favor of Republicans.

This analysis finds partisan bias accounts for 25-36 extra Republican seats in 2012, 4-20 extra Republican

seats in 2014, and 16-29 extra Republican seats in 2016, out of the 370 seats analyzed. The number of

additional seats Democrats would have needed to win to flip the House in 2012 and 2016 17 and

24, respectively is within this range of partisan skew for both years.

Although the seats-to-votes curve better accounts for the historical impact of political geography than

the efficiency gap, the analysis still cannot easily separate the effects of political geography or other

similar factors from intentional gerrymandering. But as with the efficiency gap, the strong seat skew

stemming from states with Republican-controlled redistricting processes suggests gerrymandering is a

strong contributor to the current Republican majority in the House.

EXTREME MAPS | 11

C. Mean-Median Difference Analysis

Unlike the prior two tests, the mean-median difference does not produce a skew in terms of seats but

instead looks at how closely a states district results resemble typical gerrymandering. By definition,

seat-maximizing gerrymanders attempt to skew election results in favor of one party. Mathematically,

this means gerrymanders aim to make the favored partys median vote share significantly higher (and

thus more favorable) than its mean, in order to give the favored party more seats. Gerrymandering

cannot change the mean vote share the statewide mean will be the same regardless of how the

districts are divided but a few extremely skewed districts that have been packed and cracked could

shift the median considerably. By comparison, states that have not been gerrymandered should have

roughly even mean and median district vote shares. The difference between a states mean district

vote share and its median district vote share can thus be used to determine how likely it is that a

states map has been gerrymandered.

This analysis examines a states results and calculates a significance level to gauge whether the difference

between the mean and the median falls into the zone of chance meaning the difference between

the two can reasonably be expected to have resulted by chance under a non-gerrymandered map

or whether the difference is outside of this zone. If the difference falls outside, it is considered to be

statistically significant, meaning there is less than a five percent chance a standard cutoff for similar

statistical analyses17 the states results could have resulted by chance in the absence of gerrymandering.

This extreme result suggests partisan intent was most likely present in the map-drawing process and

districts have been gerrymandered.

The mean-median district vote share difference test highlights similar patterns as the two prior tests

among the analyzed states.

Six states where Republicans had sole control of redistricting have statistically significant skews in all

three elections: Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Three more

states Georgia, Tennessee, and Wisconsin show statistically significant skews in at least one

election.

No Democratic-controlled states, commission-drawn states, or court-drawn states have statistically

significant skews in any election. One split-control state, Missouri, has a statistically significant skewin 2016 only.

All states with court-modified maps (Texas in all three elections, and Florida and Virginia in 2016)

show statistically significant skews. Florida and Virginias results do not show a substantial change

across the three elections, suggesting that court-modified plans have not sufficiently corrected the

partisan imbalance in the original maps.

All states with statistically significant partisan skews favor Republicans. The Republican median district

vote share is higher than the mean Republican vote share in each of these states, giving them a structural

advantage in turning votes into seats.

CONCLUSION

Partisan bias is distorting the composition of the U.S. House, and a handful of states are principally

responsible for driving it. The result in this decades maps has been a persistent and consequential seat

advantage in favor of Republicans that will likely endure for the remainder of the decade.

To be sure, not all of this partisan bias stems from gerrymandering. Other neutral factors could be

contributing to at least some of the measured partisan bias, but we find little evidence supporting the

notion that the most commonly discussed neutral factors, such as the creation of minority districts or

clustering, are driving the extreme partisan bias in this decades seven worst states. By contrast, there is

notable evidence in those states that points strongly at gerrymandering as a major contributor.

Minority Districts. Pro-Republican bias is sometimes attributed to minority districts concentrating

Democratic voters and thus leaving the surrounding districts more conservative. But this thesis doesnot seem to be borne out in the congressional maps of the 2010 cycle and in fact, the maps drawnthis decade provide important counter-evidence. States like Virginia, for example, which saw the court-ordered creation of an additional minority opportunity district, actually saw a decrease rather than anincrease in partisan bias. Similarly, the creation of additional Latino or minority coalition opportunitydistricts in Texas as urged by plaintiffs in litigation there could likely significantly reduce or evenvirtually eliminate partisan bias in the current Texas congressional map. In the other states with highlevels of partisan bias, minority districts do not plausibly seem to be responsible for increased partisanbias in other high bias states, since none of those states saw an increase in minority districts this cycle.

Clustering. Political geography and an increase in clustering of voters are similarly often posited as

causes of a pro-Republican bias the argument being that Democrats live in cities surrounded by

other Democrats, whereas Republicans spread out more evenly and in lower concentrations throughout

more rural areas. This type of residential sorting almost certainly does contribute to partisan bias at

times. New York, for example, has a slight pro-Republican bias at least partially stemming from the

relatively large number of overwhelmingly Democratic districts in New York City, and, in the case of

New York at least, it is nearly impossible to imagine a reasonable alternative map that could completely

curb this effect.

However, this thesis also does not seem to be a plausible explanation for the bias in the seven worst states

of this decade, since none are as starkly clustered. To the contrary, the worst states and in particular,

the three worst tend to have fairly even statewide distributions of partisans. This suggests that such

deeply biased maps are unlikely to result from neutral line-drawing in these states, and also points to a

tempting opportunity for one party to gerrymander to gain a disproportionate seat share in such a state.

If a party can carefully divide these partisans into districts, it can engineer a large number of districts

that it will narrowly win. With the aid of computer technology, these districts can be drawn carefully

enough to ensure that they stick. This is the heart of aggressive, seat-maximizing gerrymandering, and

looks likely to be occurring in this decades extremely biased states. It is, in short, almost certainly no

coincidence that the worst degrees of partisan bias are observed (with the exception of Texas) in closely

contested and hard fought battleground states.

Single-Party Control. Although there is little evidence supporting the role of minority districts andclustering in driving partisan bias, there is a notable correlation with single-party control of theredistricting process. Indeed, all of the states we found to have extreme partisan bias had maps drawnsolely by one party.

The correlation is clear enough that it suggests that single-party control is virtually a necessity for

extreme partisan bias. There are undoubtedly instances where a party with the power to block an

unfavorable map cuts a bad deal and gives away its leverage: the decision of the Democratic-controlled

Virginia Senate in 2011 to give the Republican-controlled Virginia House of Delegates free rein to

redraw the state house map in exchange for Democratic free rein to redraw the state senate map and the

subsequent Republican takeover of the Virginia Senate is a recent example. But these are few and far

between in general, creating high levels of partisan bias requires single-party control, as our analysis

in this report confirms.

In the end, this report shows that there is both reason for worry and for optimism.

On the troubling side, there is clear evidence that aggressive gerrymandering is distorting the nations

congressional maps, resulting in both large and remarkably durable levels of partisan bias. The rise of

extreme gerrymandering, enabled by more accurate political data and better map-drawing software,

seems poised to continue if left unchecked, allowing parties to manipulate maps to lock in a guaranteed

artificial advantage for themselves. The threat to democracy is both real and alarming.

But on the bright side, robust and relatively easy-to-apply quantitative tools now exist to help citizens

and courts gauge when maps have likely been distorted and to better understand how and why

this distortion is occurring. Further research will undoubtedly build on and improve these methods.

Along with this increased knowledge and awareness, perhaps an opportunity to police and prevent

redistricting abuses will come as well.

METHODOLOGY

A. Data Sources and General Notes on Calculations

We used district-level election results compiled publicly by Dave Wasserman at Cook Political Report

in his National House Popular Vote Trackers.18 All calculations were done using two-party vote shares

and excluding third-party results.

For districts without both a Democrat and Republican running in the general election, we estimated

the vote share both parties would have received in a contested two-party election based on the prior

elections House results, the most recent district-level Presidential results using totals calculated and

compiled by Daily Kos Elections for both 2012 and 2016,19 a districts Cook Partisan Voter Index, and

the winning candidates incumbency status.

B. State Categorization

Each state was placed in one of the following categories based on its map-drawing process:

1. States whose maps were drawn under Republican control, typically where the governor and

legislature control the redistricting process and are all Republican-held. States with Democratic

governors are also included if the Republican-controlled legislature had a veto-proof majority, as

are states with a Republican-controlled legislature where the governor did not have veto power.

These states are Alabama, Florida (2012, 2014), Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, North

Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia (2012, 2014), and Wisconsin.

2. States whose maps were drawn under Democratic control, where the governor and state

legislature control the redistricting process and are all Democrat-held. These states are Illinois,

Maryland, and Massachusetts.

3. States whose maps were drawn under split control, where the governor and legislatures were not

all held by the same party. These states are Kentucky and Missouri.

4. States whose maps were drawn by an independent commission. These states are Arizona,

California, and Washington.

5. States whose maps were drawn by a political commission. These commissions are separated

from independent commissions because of the stronger partisan ties and roles of their members.

The only state in this category is New Jersey.

6. States whose maps were court-imposed, which typically results from a legislative deadlock. This

category includes states whose maps were chosen by a court or drawn by a court (or a court-

appointed panel or special masters). These states are Colorado, Minnesota, and New York.

7. States whose maps were court-modified, which typically results from a court decision overturning

or changing part of a map but leaving the bulk of the map intact. These states are Florida

(2016), Texas, and Virginia (2016).

C. Efficiency Gap

Background

The efficiency gap, developed by University of Chicago law professor Nick Stephanopoulos and Public

Policy Institute of California research fellow Eric McGhee, looks at the number of wasted votes

in a states elections. In any election, nearly 50 percent of votes are wasted: all votes cast for a losing

candidate, and any votes cast for a winning candidate beyond the threshold needed to win (50 percent

of the total + 1 vote). In a hypothetical map with perfect partisan symmetry, Stephanopoulos and

McGhee propose that both parties would waste the same number of votes. On the other hand, a large

difference between the parties wasted votes suggests a partisan gerrymander could be present, giving one

party an advantage by disproportionately wasting the others votes.

When one party draws a gerrymander, it does so to win the most number of seats. A gerrymandering party

seeks to disproportionately waste the opposing partys votes and ensure more of its own votes go toward

electing winning candidates, giving it a structural advantage in turning votes into seats and maximizing the

number of seats it wins without necessarily winning more votes. This is typically done by packing and cracking

the opposing partys voters. Some of the opposing partys voters are packed into a few highly concentrated

districts and the remaining ones are cracked among other districts with just too few in each district to

realistically win. This maximizes the number of wasted votes in both types of districts: the opposing partys

winning districts are oversaturated, wasting a considerable number of votes above 50 percent, and the losing

districts have as many wasted losing votes as possible without making the district competitive.

Stephanopoulos and McGhee propose that measuring these wasted votes can quantitatively demonstrate the

structural advantage given to one party. The efficiency gap, which can be calculated either in terms of seats

or in percentage of votes, assumes a completely neutral or fair plan would have a gap of zero. But in reality

all plans will have at least a slight gap. Stephanopoulos and McGhee propose two standards for determining

when a plan is biased enough to be presumptively unconstitutional: a seat gap of more than two seats for

congressional maps, and a percent gap of more than 8 percent for state legislative maps.

Methodology

We calculated the efficiency gap from the two-party vote total of every state with six districts or more. All

votes for the losing candidate were considered wasted, as were all votes for the winning candidate over 50

percent + 1 of the two-party vote total. In order to prevent high turnout districts from skewing state results,

we first normalized district results by calculating the efficiency gap in terms of a percent for each district

subtracting the number of wasted Republican votes from the number of wasted Democratic votes and

dividing by the two-party vote total in the district and then averaged those percentages to find each states

overall percentage gap. This calculated percentage gap was then multiplied by the number of districts in the

state to find the seat gap.

Discussion & Caveats

The efficiency gap is appealing as a gerrymandering standard because of its simplicity: it is both easy to

calculate (requiring only raw vote totals) and easy to understand (producing a disparity in terms of seats).

People without strong backgrounds in statistics or redistricting can easily understand the measure, making

it a compelling standard.

EXTREME MAPS | 17

But with this simplicity comes possible drawbacks. The efficiency gap rests on the assumption that

for every 1 percent increase in vote share, a party should increase its seat share by 2 percent. For close

states (where the winning party receives around 50 percent - 60 percent of the vote) this 1:2 ratio has

historically been close to actual results for most maps, but much less accurate when the winning party

receives more than 60 percent of the vote. This makes the efficiency gap arguably a fairly accurate

measure for closely contested states but often much less of one for states dominated by one political

party, though some suggest this may not be the case based on historical data.

The efficiency gap will show particularly odd results if one party wins more than 75 percent of the

total vote. Receiving more than 75 percent of the vote means that more of the dominant partys votes

are wasted than the minority partys simply because the minority party has so few votes that can

even be wasted and the efficiency gap will show that the map is disadvantaging the dominant party.

While mathematically correct, this of course does not mean that such a map is disadvantaging the

dominant party and this quirk should be taken into consideration. Such lopsided election results are

rare on the state level however, typically occurring only in small, uncompetitive states such as Vermont

or Wyoming.

As with other measures that take into account seats won, the efficiency gap can also be quite sensitive

over time, fluctuating wildly between elections under the same map. States with even a few close

districts can see significant swings sometimes up to multiple seats in the seat gap results in

subsequent elections whose raw vote totals are only slightly different if even one district flips parties,

and this volatility can make the efficiency gap problematic to use long-term over a series of years or

decades. The instability is more pronounced in smaller states, where a single election can produce a large

percentage shift in the states efficiency gap. Sensitivity testing can be used to assess how plans would

perform under different electoral circumstances. For this report, we attempt to limit this instability by

using the seat gap instead of percentage gap, which takes into consideration the number of districts in

a state, and by eliminating states with fewer than six districts.

D. Seats-to-Votes Curve

Background

Partisan gerrymandering gives one party an unfair advantage in turning their votes into seats. But

determining when an unfair advantage exists requires understanding what a fair translation of votes

into seats looks like. Proportional representation would suggest a 1:1 ratio, but in reality not even the

fairest maps have such a flat ratio. Applying a seats-to-votes curve analysis based on past election results

allows us to generate this baseline.

Aptly named, a seats-to-votes curve plots partys average statewide vote share against that partys share

of seats won in the states congressional delegation. Plotting these results from many elections creates

a large data set that can be used to find a reliable, well-fitting curve. Statewide vote shares from recent

elections can then be placed on the curve to find the expected seat share. Comparing the expected seat

shares to the actual seat shares reveals the degree to which current maps deviate from historical norms.

Methodology

To generate the seats-to-votes curve, we used U.S. House election results from 1972-2010 for states

with more than six districts. We plotted each states mean Democratic vote share against the share

of seats won by Democratic candidates in the same year, and fit a logistic-based curve to the data. A

logistic-based curve was chosen to fit the data sets natural S-shaped curve. We then compared the

actual Democratic seat shares in election results from 2012, 2014, and 2016 to the Democratic seat

shares predicted by the seats-to-votes curve based on the statewide Democratic vote share. As with

the efficiency gap, large differences between the expected and actual seat shares suggest one party was

substantially more successful in turning its votes into seats than expected from historical results, with

partisan gerrymandering being the likely explanation.

Discussion & Caveats

A seats-to-votes curve analysis has the benefit of being based on actual election results. Current

results are compared to actual historical results, instead of suppositions about what fair districting

would look like or what a fair seats to votes ratio would be. Using past election returns as a baseline

incorporates geographic clustering, party waves, and other electoral factors into the model, providing a

more accurate depiction of when recent results are unexpected or abnormal.

The flip side, of course, is that some of the election results used as data points to build the curve

are themselves impermissible (and sometimes later overturned) gerrymanders. Their inclusion could

normalize gerrymandered results in the analysis, but the sheer number of data points included in this

analysis (433 statewide election results, most of which are not extreme gerrymanders) should prevent

the gerrymanders from having a material influence on the curve.

The seats-to-votes curve is more accurate for states dominated by one party than the efficiency gap is,

and expected seat ratios align much more closely in those extreme cases with historical election results

than with the efficiency gap. Even still, the seats-to-votes analysis suffers from the same instability as

the efficiency gap, particularly in small states. Fewer districts means less granularity in the results for

seat share: New Hampshires two districts can only yield a seat share of 0 percent, 50 percent, or 100

EXTREME MAPS | 19

percent, regardless of the vote share, whereas Californias 53 districts create possibilities for seat share

increases in increments of less than 2 percent. This effect from fewer districts often results in extreme

percentage differences in small states, even if the seat share is the fairest possible realistic result. As with

the efficiency gap, excluding small states and using the seat skew curbs this problem.

E. Mean-Median District Vote Share Difference

Background

In his Stanford Law Review article Three Tests for Practical Evaluation of Partisan Gerrymandering,

Princeton University professor Sam Wang proposes comparing a partys mean and median vote share

across districts to detect partisan asymmetry and presumptive gerrymanders.

Comparing a data sets mean and median is a common statistical analysis used to assess how skewed

a set is and detect asymmetries. If the set is balanced or fair, the distribution of values should be fairly

symmetric and its mean (the average of the values) should be very close to its median (the midpoint of

the data set when sorted). But as a data set becomes more skewed and extreme values are added only on

one side, the mean and median begin to diverge, as the mean will shift significantly more towards the

skewed tail than the median will. Looking at the difference between the two can determine the extent

to which a data set is skewed.

By definition, partisan gerrymanders attempt to skew election results in favor of one party. Mathematically,

this means gerrymanders aim to make the favored partys median vote share significantly higher (and

thus more favorable) than its mean, to give the favored party more seats. Gerrymandering tactics like

cracking (spreading opponents across districts to dilute their power) and packing (heavily concentrating

opponents in a few districts) lead to the favored party winning several closer districts (with 50-60

percent of the vote) and the opposing party winning only a few extreme districts (with 70-80 percent

of the vote). This gerrymandering cannot change the mean vote share the statewide mean will be

the same regardless of how the districts are divided but the extremely skewed districts could shift the

median considerably.

The mean vote share provides a better view of the ideal two-party seat share, whereas the median vote

share better demonstrates how seats are actually allocated under a map. An ideal map with perfect

proportional representation would have a mean-median difference of close to zero, and a more extreme

map would have a larger one. For instance, if one party has a mean statewide vote share of 40 percent

but a median vote share of 60 percent, they will have won over half of the districts with much less than

half of the vote, and the mean-median difference of 20 percent indicates that the extreme skew is likely

resulting from gerrymandering.

Wangs test goes one step further and looks at the statistical significance of the difference, in order

to determine whether such a difference was likely to arise by chance. His formula takes the standard

deviation of the vote shares and the number of districts into account. Standard deviation measures the

overall spread/variation in the vote share a higher standard deviation means the values are more

spread out, and a lower one means the values are closer together. Here, a lower standard deviation

increases the likelihood of a statistically significant difference, as it indicates the vote shares in districts

are clumped closer together (as one would expect to see in a gerrymandered state) instead of ranging

20 | BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE

wildly as a random distribution might produce. As a result, some states results may actually becomeless statistically significant even when the mean-median difference increases, as long as the standarddeviation increases as well. Similarly, a higher number of districts also increases the likelihood of astatistically significant result, as one would expect to see more extreme variation in states with smallerdistricts that could be heavily affected by a single election.

Methodology

We calculated the mean Democratic vote share and the median Democratic vote share for every state

with more than six districts, and then subtracted the mean from the median. To determine statistical

significance, we use the standard Wang proposes to calculate a significance level:

[mean-median difference]x number of districts

Significance level =0.756 x[standard deviation]

The result is significant when the significance level is 1.75.

Discussion & Caveats

The mean-median difference helps to reveal intent quantitatively, something that is often discussed

as a key part of gerrymandering but can be hard to prove. Both the efficiency gap and the seats-to-

votes analysis calculate the effects of gerrymandering, estimating how many seats were won unfairly.

The mean-median difference, on the other hand, pinpoints plans that were unlikely to have arisen

from fair maps and were likely to have been crafted with partisan intent. It also has the benefit of

being a fairly stable standard for small states, as the standards for statistical significance change with

the number of districts to prevent instability in a few districts in small states from skewing results.

The mean-median difference is most reliable for states with close two-party vote shares, and becomes

much less valuable for states where one party dominates. In his article, Wang proposes using a

slightly different statistical analysis, the chi-square test, for states where a single party is dominant.

For consistency and to best identify the specific type of aggressive seat maximization described earlier,

we employ the mean-median difference for all states in this report.

The mean-median difference test also does not say how many more seats the gerrymandering party

won (i.e., a mean-median difference of 10 percent does not mean that the favored party won 10

percent more seats). It simply looks for the difference and the statistical significance of the difference,

which suggests whether the difference was likely to arise from chance or whether the district results

suggest deliberate gerrymandering to provide one party with substantially more but still reliably

won seats.

4 The U.S. Supreme Court last considered the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering a

decade ago in Vieth v. Jubelier, 541 U.S. 267 (2004) and League of United Latin American

Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006) but deadlocked on whether such claims were justiciable

and, if so, what the legal test for such claims should be.

5 For the purposes of this report, we use bias and skew interchangeably to refer to the gains

one party receives based on a systematic advantage turning its votes into congressional seats, as

explained in the previous section.

14 Stephanopoulos and McGhee analyze all states that had at least eight districts at some point

between 1972 and 2012, including the decades in which some of these states had fewer than eight

districts. In examining our initial results, we found that states with six and seven districts had

consistent results with larger states, and the volatility and instability associated with analyses of

smaller states only became prominent in states with five or fewer districts. Goedert generally uses

six districts as a cutoff as well. The excluded states are: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota,

South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming, which each have only one congressional district; Hawaii,

Idaho, and Iowa, where a commission drew maps; Connecticut and Nevada, where courts drew

maps; Mississippi, New Hampshire, and New Mexico, where Democrats and Republicans shared

control of redistricting; Arkansas, Oregon, Rhode Island, and West Virginia, where Democrats

controlled redistricting; Kansas, Maine, and Utah, where Republicans controlled redistricting;

and Nebraska, which had a Republican governor and whose legislature is officially non-partisan

but is generally described as having a Republican majority.

15 Stephanopoulos and McGhee, Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap, 831.

16 For consistency, we use Stephanopoulos and McGhees standard for presumptive unconstitutionality

as our cutoff under the seats-to-votes curve analysis as well.

17 Robert M. Craparo, Statistical Significance, in Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics, ed.

Neil J. Salkind. (Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2007), 889891. Statistical significanceoccurs not at a set cut off for the difference between the mean and the median, as it also dependson the number of districts in a state and the standard deviation of the district vote shares in anelection. As such, some elections with high differences may not be statistically significant. Thetest is described in more detail in the methodology appendix.
