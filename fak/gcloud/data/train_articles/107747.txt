Coke Pours $715 Million Into Dr Pepper Deal
Coca-Cola will pay Dr Pepper Snapple Group $715 million for the right to continue selling Dr Pepper drinks once it acquires its North American bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, The Associated Press reported.

After completing the buyout of the United States operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke will distribute Dr Pepper in the United States and Canada Dry in the Northeastern part of the country, where they are currently distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises. It will distribute Canada Dry, C’Plus and Schweppes in Canada.

The agreement follows a similar deal between Dr Pepper and PepsiCo, whose agreement to buy its own top North American bottlers led it to pay Dr Pepper Snapple $900 million to continue selling Dr Pepper, Crush and Schweppes.

Shares of Dr Pepper were down 1.7 percent on Monday as some investors were disappointed with the payout, while Coca-Cola shares were flat. “The terms and cash amount are in line with the previous deal with PepsiCo, however we believe some investors expected a higher payment to come from Coke,” a Credit Suisse analyst, Carlos Laboy, said in a research note. “We have heard from investors who were expecting the number to be north of what PepsiCo paid.”
