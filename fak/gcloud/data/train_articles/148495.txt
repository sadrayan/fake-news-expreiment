Mudik 2016
Beep, beep! Indonesia’s streets are busier than usual today due to Mudik, the mass migration of city dwellers to their rural hometowns.

Coinciding with the end of Ramadan, Mudik sends millions of travelers weaving through the country via car, bus, motorbike, and train. Today’s Doodle captures the excitement of this journey and the gifts that are exchanged at the end of the road.

Safe travels to all this year!
