After the nationwide clown scare during the months of September and October seemed to die down a little, authorities are warning that this is merely the beginning.

According to authorities, clowns nationwide are preparing a “purge” that will take place on the night of Halloween— the 31st of October. Oklahoma City police arrested three clowns Monday night. The three men were arrested after multiple witnesses called 911. Oklahoma police later revealed that these clowns admitted to planning a nationwide purge on Halloween, a purge that will consist of thousands of clowns around the country. According to the three clowns arrested, the clowns will rob, beat, and even kill anyone they see walking down the street, including Children, who will be Trick-or-treating.

Authorities are advising everyone to be home before the sun sets and to NOT let children go trick-or-treating. “We understand that children and even teenagers and adults like to be out on Halloween having a good time. But this is much bigger than Halloween, these people[clowns] will be purging that night, and we must protect ourselves at all costs. Lock your doors and have your legally acquired firearm ready if you have one.” said Oklahoma City Police Chief William Citty.

Police in almost every city are conduction investigations in an attempt to find out more information about this alleged purge and how to stop it, if possible. Stay tuned for more information in the near future.
