Gardner – regarding your Politifact question from yesterday, General Abbott relied on data provided by DPS.

...Is this DPS web page the basis? Our read is it indicates that among more than 200,000 foreign nationals arrested since 2008 there were 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their criminal histories. The page doesn’t timeframe the murders. Texas of late has had about 1,300 homicides a year.

Gov. Perry referenced a similar figure; it led to this fact check.

Yes, General Abbott was citing the DPS Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data. If you have specific questions about this data, you’ll want to direct those to DPS.

Thanks,
