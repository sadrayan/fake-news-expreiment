Neosho Mayor Baker Responds To Uproar Over Raffle – NewsTalk KZRG
A published report that a Neosho youth baseball team plans to raffle an AR-15 rifle has raised eyebrows–and raised ire. Some have expressed outrage that the raffle would continue following last week’s school shooting in Florida. Neosho Mayor Ben Baker, a friend of the baseball team’s coach, Levi Patterson, tells News Talk KZRG the reaction has been extreme.

“The way that this has turned out, it’s just unfortunate. It really troubles me that they (people) will attack a good man and his family to the point where…they literally feel unsafe in public. But the left, how they operate in the name of compassion, they’re perfectly fine with dragging a good man through the mud and trying to destroy his reputation in the community.”

Baker went on to say the Pattersons were trying to do a good deed by raising funds for the baseball team..and that raffles of guns take place often in southwest Missouri.
