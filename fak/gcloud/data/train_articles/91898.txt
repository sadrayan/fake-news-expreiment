Application Process

Applications for this program are initiated in the United States. A qualifying parent will be able to file a CAM Affidavit of Relationship (AOR) Form (DS-7699) and request access for a qualifying child and expanded category relatives with the assistance of a designated refugee resettlement agency that partners with the U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. A list of more than 350 resettlement agency affiliates across more than 180 communities throughout the United States is available at https://www.wrapsnet.org. The application must be completed in-person at an office of a designated resettlement agency affiliate. There are no fees to file a DS-7699 form.

At the time of filing, a qualifying parent will be required to present proof of qualifying lawful presence in the United States, and a digital photo of the qualifying child and eligible family members requesting access to the program.

Once a DS-7699 form has been filed, the qualifying child and all eligible family members will be assisted through the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which manages the U.S. Resettlement Support Center in Latin America. IOM will contact the applicants in their country of origin, and will conduct pre-screening interviews for the qualifying child and family members and support processing as the case proceeds through DNA testing, Department of Homeland Security interview, and all medical and security checks.
