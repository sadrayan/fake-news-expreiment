Police in Kaduna say they caught these guys making weapons illegally
Kaduna state Commissioner of Police, Umar Shehu paraded for paraded two men on Friday for allegedly using their residence for the illegal manufacture of arms and ammunition.

The men are Bulus Kinze and James Kinze, both from Kogun village of Jema’a Local Government Area in the state.

Kinze admitted the act but said they used the weapons to protect themselves.

“Armed bandits have continued to terrorize our area and killing our people, so since we could not get adequate protection from the security agencies, we decided to produce locally made arms to protect ourselves and our people from the recurring attacks by such arm bandits,” he said.

The commissioner informed newsmen that the suspects would be charged to court for prosecution.
