ICYMI: New Jersey Leaders Advocate for Marijuana Legalization and Expungement Legislation

"I want to speak to those who might be on the fence. I donâ€™t know if you have been arrested for marijuana. Please, get on the right side, so we can make history, so that our young men and women can get on with their lives. It all depends on that vote Monday. Please, we need your help. This Governor is working hard, with the legislature, to make a difference. We need your vote Monday, so our family members can begin to live again."
