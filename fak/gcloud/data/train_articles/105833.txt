Rep. Nancy Pelosi Said 'Americans Deserve To Know Whatï¿½s In The Bill.ï¿½
I cannot believe what I just read. But itâ€™s real. Pelosi actually tweeted this:

Did she forget? Sheâ€™s freaking FAMOUS for suggesting that we needed to pass a bill in order to find out what was in it.

IS SHE FOR REAL?

You are completely mental @NancyPelosi ? Like seriously.. Your own words. We have to pass it to know whatâ€™s in it.. what is wrong with you? â€” GiGi (@Gigiteetee1234) June 20, 2017

Wait, I thought you were OK with passing a bill so we could find out what is in the bill. â€” Hawkeye Johnson (@Hawkeyee21) June 20, 2017

Americans deserved to know what was in the bill when we had to â€œvote for it to see whatâ€™s in itï¿½? hypocrisy? U madam are the definition of it â€” michael (@Chilltownfinest) June 20, 2017

This tweet can only mean one of two things: 1.) Sheâ€™s either THAT stupid or 2.) She thinks Americans are THAT stupid. Either way, itâ€™s bad for her.
