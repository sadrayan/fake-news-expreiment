Attack on GOP congressmen is assault on democracy
We’re aware that the SPLC was among hundreds of groups that the man identified as the shooter “liked” on Facebook. I want to be as clear as I can possibly be: The SPLC condemns all forms of violence. We have worked for decades to combat domestic terrorism and violence based on hate.

Our hearts are with those who were injured today and the families of all who have been affected by this deplorable act. We hope and pray for their full recovery.
