How to determine the value of my Disney VHS tapes
In the 15 years I’ve sold VHS tapes on Amazon/eBay, and I’ve never sold a Disney tape, Sealed or Open, for more than $50. If anyone tells you they’re worth more than that, if your intent is to sell, you will end up hanging onto it forever. Any smart capitalist knows collectors, just like everyone else, are generally cheap.

I am still firmly convinced most of the multi-thousand dollar Disney VHS eBay auctions people cite, are probably some really clever scam artists trying to artificially inflate the value of these tapes, because some people out there are potentially that gullible to buy, and there’s no risk involved to find that out, and it would he a brilliant idea, because these tapes are often acquired for cheap.

The Black Diamond appears on quite a few Disney videos from 1980s & 1990s

Not every release with a Black Diamond is suspect to value

If it’s sealed, brand new, it might fetch some dollars depending on title. Most sealed new Disney releases after 1990 I can never sell for more than $10

The ones I find that tend to sell consistently, are Disney’s 1st VHS releases for each film

These are easily identifiable, they have a “puffy” clamshell case, and the artwork cannot be removed. Most of the cases were black whereas all the later Disney Releases (aside from Fantasia) came in a white clamshell.

They generally sell for about $10-$40 (a few examples below)

Some of early 80s white clamshell Disney also sell

And of course, this “banned” artwork version of the Little Mermaid sells often. But in the $5-$20 range
