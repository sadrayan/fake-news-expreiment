Ed Gillespie statement on Northam vote for sanctuary cities in Virginia – Ed Gillespie
Longtime conservative leader, 2014 U.S. Senate nominee, and 2017 Republican candidate for governor Ed Gillespie released the following statement Wednesday on Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam’s vote for sanctuary cities in Virginia. Northam voted against House Bill 2000, introduced by Delegate Charles Poindexter, which would prohibit localities from adopting ordinances or policies refusing to enforce federal immigration laws.

“Lieutenant Governor Northam voted for sanctuary cities in the Commonwealth. Ralph Northam is out-of-step with Virginians who believe that enforcing our nation’s longstanding immigration laws is common sense.

“We shouldn’t have sanctuary cities in Virginia. Local governments should not be able to ignore federal immigration laws. As governor I would support and sign Delegate Poindexter’s HB 2000 because it is a reasonable measure to keep Virginians safe and enforce the law.

“I’m the son of an immigrant whose family has seen the blessings of Liberty in this great country. I know we can be a secure and welcoming nation at the same time and can take a commonsense approach to immigration policies.
