About Natural News

Natural News is a science-based natural health advocacy organization led by activist-turned-scientist Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.

The key mission of Natural News is to empower consumers with factual information about the synthetic chemicals, heavy metals, hormone disruptors and other chemicals found in foods, medicines, personal care products, children's toys and other items.

Natural News covers holistic health, nutritional therapies, consciousness and spirituality, permaculture , organics, animal rights, environmental health, food and superfoods , and performance nutrition.

The site strongly criticizes drugs-and-surgery medicine, vaccines, corporate corruption, animal testing, the use of humans for medical experiments, the chemical contamination of foods, heavy metals in consumer products, factory farming and government corruption.

Natural News also warns its readers about science gone bad and frequently cites examples of science resulting in catastrophies that it calls "crimes" against humanity. Examples of such subjects cited by Natural News include:

Agent Orange

Thalidomide

Nuclear weapons

GMOs and "genetic pollution"

Aspartame and chemical sweeteners

Chemotherapy

The presence of hidden cancer viruses in polio vaccines

The continued use of mercury in vaccines and dental amalgams

The long history of pharmaceutical experiments on human beings, including the Tuskegee syphilis experiments conducted on African Americans in the USA.

Natural News employs a staff of over 20 writers and researchers who write up to 15 original news stories each day.

Some of the many Natural News success stories in exposing fraud and protecting consumers include:

Publishing a comprehensive investigation of fake (imitation) blueberries used in foods throughout the processed food industry. A 2011 mini-documentary created by Mike Adans (the Health Ranger) and published by Natural News received over 2.8 million views on TV.naturalnews.com and caused many food manufacturers to reformulate their foods to use real blueberries rather than fake ones.

Conducting a detailed forensic visual analysis of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets and publishing the photos on Natural News. These photos revealed Chicken McNuggets to contain "strange fibers" that had previously not been known to exist in McNuggets .

Was the first global news site to expose the fake acai berry scam (http://www.naturalnews.com/031280_acai_berries_scam.html), which eventually led to the FTC shutting down the acai operation and levying multi-million-dollar judgements against six individuals and their operating companies (http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/01/fakenews.shtm).

Natural News editor Mike Adams (the Health Ranger) achieved tremendous global exposure for his 2011 parody music video entitled, "Don't Touch My Junk," which made fun of TSA agents using Monty Python-style animation. The video went on to receive over 300,000 views on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhEMRSp7vaY), even after it was flagged as "inappropriate" and restricted from being viewed by users who were not logged in.

Natural News was the first website to expose the Adya Clarity detox scam, where a product containing over 1200 ppm aluminum dissolved in sulfuric acid was imported into the United States as battery acid, then sold through a series of internet webinars to consumers who were encouraged to drink "shots" of the substance. A Health Ranger investigation published by Natural News was able to blow the whistle on the scam, resulting in over two million dollars worth of refunds being issued by the product's top U.S. distributor. (http://www.naturalnews.com/034005_Adya_Clarity_consumer_alert.html)

Natural News led the coverage of the now-famous California "raw milk raids" which saw Rawesome Foods and its founder James Stewart arrested and imprisoned for the "crime" of distributing raw milk to individuals and moms.

Natural News was a major driver in the "no patents on human genes" campaign that ultimately led to the U.S. Supreme Court handing a major defeat to a company that claimed ownership of the BRCA genes used for testing breast cancer in women. (http://www.naturalnews.com/040760_supreme_court_gene_patents_myriad_genetics.html)

Natural News was the first website to break the exclusive story of the GlaxoSmithKline whistleblower Blair Hamrick speaking out as the U.S. Department of Justice's $3 billion settlement with GSK was announced. (http://www.naturalnews.com/036499_Glaxo_whistleblower_bribery.html)

On the vaccine front, Natural News helped expose the falsified vaccine science fraud committed by Merck, as described by two virologists who went public with evidence of the company's fraud. (http://www.naturalnews.com/036328_Merck_mumps_vaccine_False_Claims_Act.html)

Natural News also led the nationwide backlash against the city of Oak Park , Michigan , which had threatened a young mom named Julie Bass with 90 days of jail time for growing a vegetable garden in her own front yard. (http://www.naturalnews.com/032960_Julie_Bass_home_gardening.html) Natural News led a consumer activism campaign to barrage the city of Oak Park with complaints until they agreed to drop the charges against Julie Bass. The city ultimately agreed to drop the charges and Julie Bass was able to continue growing her vegetable garden (http://www.naturalnews.com/033175_Julie_Bass_Oak_Park.html). As part of the campaign, Mike Adams (the Health Ranger) published a parody video which depicted Oak Park city manager Kevin Rulkowski as being a vindictive, South- Parkian moron (http://tv.naturalnews.com/v.asp?v=3A4B88066D390F0EA7C2664E371269D3).

On the parental rights front, Natural News was a leading voice of support for detroit resident Maryanne Godboldo whose home was SWAT raided for her refusal to put her young daugher on psychiatric drugs. (http://www.naturalnews.com/032090_Maryanne_Godboldo_health_freedom.html)

Natural News was the leading voice in the case of the Michigan DNR (Department of Natural Resources) order small, local pig farmers to shoot and destroy their own pigs. (http://www.naturalnews.com/035585_Michigan_farms_raids.html) This story, like many Natural News stories, received global news coverage and was featured on DrudgeReport.com.

Warning Consumers About Fake Gurus and Sociopaths

Natural News editor Mike Adams is the author behind the world's most popular article on "how to spot a sociopath," currently featured in the top five search results on Google for the search term "sociopath." (http://www.naturalnews.com/036112_sociopaths_cults_influence.html) This story has been viewed by millions of readers and continues to help people avoid being exploited by others with sociopathic tendancies .

Mike Adams (the Health Ranger) is also known for posting video parodies of "new age gurus," making fun of their language and their repeated asking for donations for projects that never seem to come to fruition. His YouTube video called "Fake Gurus Exposed" depicts a guru named "Moonbeam Karma" asking for donations for a project involving magical twigs. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXoaC9fhXyc)

Reference Websites

In 2006, Natural News (then NewsTarget.com) launched four reference websites that featured well-referenced details on the healing properties of foods, herbs and nutritional supplements. (The sites have not been updated since their launch, however.)

Those sites are:

HealingFoodReference.com

HerbReference.com

SupplementReference.com

NutrientReference.com

Science

In 2013, Natural News launched SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, a very large relational research database based on ten million scientific studies whose abstracts are collected in the PubMed resources of the National Library of Medicine.

Mike Adams (the Health Ranger) programmed the relational indexing and tokenization algorithms for the project, drawing on his background in the software industry. Unique to the site is the ability to see relationships between any two concepts (such as Vitamin D and breast cancer), then quickly view a list of all the available scientific studies on those two topics.

SCIENCE.naturalnews.com currently covers over 8,000 concepts spanning nutrients, diseases, drug side effects, synthetic chemicals, phytochemicals , amino acids, sweeteners, diets, medical concepts, holistic health therapies and environmental science terms.

Mike Adams promises to continue expanding SCIENCE.naturalnews.com to cover 20 million scientific studies while adding more qualitative relational algorithms to allow readers to easily find relationships of concepts among the "noise" of free-form scientific abstracts.

Blogs

In 2013, Natural News launched BLOGS.naturalnews.com and immediately signed up over 500 writers who now post content covering recipes, how-to articles, nutritional tips and more.

BLOGS.naturalnews.com was founded on the principle of sharing revenues with content creators. Writers who contribute to BLOGS.naturalnews.com earn 100% of the ad revenues for the top ad position above the article. Other suboordinate ad positions on the page earn revenues for Natural News, which makes the service available for free.

Forensic Food Laboratory

In 2013, Natural News launched its Forensic Food Laboratory with Mike Adams as its director.

The Forensic Food Laboratory currently owns a high-powered digital microscope with videography capabilities that Adams has used to conduct microscopy investigations of everyday foods (and other objects).

To date, the Natural News Forensic Food Lab has published photos and videos on:

Microscopy of McNuggets , revealing "strange fibers" found in the nuggets. (http://www.naturalnews.com/041646_chicken_mcnuggets_forensic_food_analysis_strange_fibers.html)

Microscopy of fake blueberries used in food products, including "dissections" of blueberry waffles and muffins. (http://www.naturalnews.com/031054_blueberries_artificial_colors.html)
