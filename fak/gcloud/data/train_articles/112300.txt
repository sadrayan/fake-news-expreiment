Bill Murray Describes Taxes to Children
**UPDATE** The quote attributed to Bill Murray appears to be spurious – originating from a parody Bill Murray Twitter account. However, the economic message, in content and spirit, is still 100% correct.

Too often, children don’t receive a proper education. Liberal teachers support bigger government and higher taxes while promoting liberal propaganda.

But famous actor Bill Murray (below) sets the record straight in a way every child can understand. This is perfect, and 100% true!

And the Federal Government is taking in a record amount of taxes this year… Straight from your pocket! As CNN reported:

The U.S. federal government is bringing in more money in taxes than ever before. Over $2.67 trillion has come in so far this fiscal year, according to the latest Treasury Department report. That’s a record — in dollar terms — for the first 10 months of the year (the government’s fiscal year ends in September). Expect 2015 to finish at an all-time high. The increase in tax revenue is helping the U.S. pay more of its bills. While America still runs a deficit, the overspending has gone down substantially in recent years. So who pays the bulk of U.S. taxes? The burden has shifted from companies to individuals over time. In the early 1950s, corporations accounted for over 30% of U.S. tax revenues. Today, businesses pay about 11% of taxes, according to the U.S. Treasury.
