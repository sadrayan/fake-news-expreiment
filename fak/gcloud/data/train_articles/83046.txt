Weatherman Debunks Limbaugh’s ‘Polar Vortex’ Conspiracy Theory
On his radio show Monday, Rush Limbaugh went off on the “liberal” media for inventing the concept of a “polar vortex” as a way to link the country’s dangerously low temperatures to their “global warming agenda.” Today, one prominent meteorologist attempted to explain just how off-base Limbaugh’s accusations were.

Bernie Rayno, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, told HuffPost Live that the “problem with climate change” is that “you can’t have a debate” because “any time anybody tries to have a debate, it turns into being politicized.” He added, “Whenever you politicize something, you contaminate it.”

Rayno said that even meteorologists who don’t believe in global warming think singling out one weather event is “absurd” and “silly.” As for Limbaugh’s theory that the term “polar vortex” was just invented this week, he said, “We’ve been using the name in this field for — I’ve been in this field for 25 years, this isn’t anything new.”

The Today Show’s resident weatherman, Al Roker, agreed, tweeting out his response to Limbaugh Tuesday afternoon:

Rush Limbaugh claims the Polar Vortex is a creation of a left-wing, liberal media conspiracy. It's Meteorology 101. No political agenda — Al Roker (@alroker) January 7, 2014
