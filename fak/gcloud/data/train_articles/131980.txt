That is a political website, not a newspaper as claimed, and if you read the story carefully, even they describe the Twitter account as only ”purported” to belong to the King.

If you examine that Twitter account, it certainly does not look like it would.

As one commenter further down points out, it is the most unlikely thing in the world that a reigning head of state would choose to communicate on a matter of international relations via Twitter.

Another commenter says a friend in Holland has identified the Twitter account as a fake.

This is how real fake news spreads. From a fake Twitter account to a tiny political website (which has been fact-checked ny Snopes previously for exaggeration, see below) to here…

And thanks to us, now it is being Facebooked,and if it gets on the Rec list will be all over the internet.

It distresses the heck out on me to see people reccing this without critical consideration.

Would be nice if it were true, but improbable in the extreme. For heaven’s sake, on a claim this bizarre, let’s at least await some further confirmation.
