David Kamin - Overview
Putting together the federal budget—deciding both how much to tax and spend and the composition of each—is one of the core responsibilities of Washington policymakers, and is also at the center of American political discourse. This seminar will explore: (1) the basics of the budget, including its composition and key budget concepts; (2) the relationship between the President and Congress and process by which budget decisions get made— including the laws and case-law that govern this process and the recent breakdown of it; and (3) the major policy decisions now facing policymakers. This seminar is designed to provide students with the basic tools of the lawyers and analysts who work with the federal budget, while also asking them to delve into theory underlying federal budget policymaking. Grading for this course will be based on a series of short papers and class participation. There is also an option for a substantial writing assignment focusing on either the current budget process or a major budget policy question.
