On May 1, 1996, a 505 by 255 foot American Flag was flown from the downstream face of Hoover Dam. The flag itself weighed 3,000 pounds and was hoisted by 3 separate cables located at the top of the Dam. The flying of the flag was part of a ceremony in which the 1996 Summer Olympic torch was carrried across Hoover Dam. The photograph is a vertical view taken downstream from the dam.
