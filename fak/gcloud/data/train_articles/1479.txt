Proposal to raise speed limits puts safety concerns on Florida Department of Transportation
Florida is a state where the open road beckons motorists to put the pedal to metal. Yet, our speed limits were set during a bygone era. The state hasn't reviewed them since 1996. It's time to raise outdated speed limits on highways that can safely accommodate faster travel.

State Sens. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, and Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, have a reasonable, bipartisan fix. They've filed legislation that would let the Florida Department of Transportation raise the speed limit — from 70 mph to 75 mph — on long stretches of interstate highways in rural areas. Think Alligator Alley, parts of the Florida Turnpike and most of Interstate 10.

The legislation (SB 392) also would raise the speed limit — from 65 mph to 70 mph — on major state highways outside of urban areas. Roads in congested communities, like those in South Florida, would not be affected.

Speed limits generally are set using the 85th Percentile Rule, the actual speed at which 85 percent of the traffic moves in a given area. So if 85 percent of drivers feel road conditions allow them to comfortably drive at a higher rate of speed, it makes sense to raise speed limits and better serve transportation needs.

Another big selling point of SB 392 is that it shifts responsibility for setting speed limits from politicians to traffic engineers. It would give FDOT the authority to determine which roads should have higher limits, based on road conditions and traffic analysis.

But the department did itself no favors in recently deciding to raise the speed limit — from 55 mph to 60 mph — along a congested stretch of Interstate 95 in Miami-Dade County, where traffic lanes were narrowed to create toll lanes. DOT officials say that after an uptick in the crash rate, the severity of crashes has decreased as motorists became more familiar with the traffic flow. Still, more crashes are more crashes.
