Chick-fil-A Employees in Texas Are Sporting T-Shirts That Are Catching Police Officers' Attention
Across the United States, some police officers have received a less than a warm welcome at their local restaurants.

In Minnesota, Florida, and Missouri, members of law enforcement have had service outright denied to them, in certain cases simply and expressly because they were police officers.

In Conroe, Texas, however, one restaurant is sending a very clear message to members of law enforcement, and it's likely one that won't leave them scrambling for an apology:

In an image posted to Facebook on Friday, Chick-fil-A employees at the College Park location in Conroe are seen wearing uniforms reading “Back the Blue” across the back.

It's a message that - as location manager Eli tells IJ.com - has a two-fold purpose. In addition to supporting neighboring Lone Star College, which has blue as its foremost color, it's also a sign of solidarity with law enforcement:

“We're supporting those everyday heroes that protect us. There are [police officer] regulars that eat here all the time, and we just want them to know that.”

It's not the first time Chick-fil-A has shown support for their 'brothers in blue,' either.

In various locations across the U.S., they've allowed police to host a 'story time' for small children, reportedly suspended sales as a fallen officer's funeral procession passed by, and - in stores across Utah, the chain hosted fundraisers to support the families of fallen officers.

For all of the controversy that Chick-fil-A often finds itself embroiled in, it's refreshing to see that they're still unafraid to take a stand for those they see as heroes.
