29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez makes history as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress
One year ago, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was working in a bar to help support her family. On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez, 29, became the youngest woman in history to be elected to Congress. With all but 2 percent of the votes tallied in the congressional race for New York's 14th District, NBC News reports that Ocasio-Cortez earned support from 78 percent of voters.

"This is what is possible when every day people come together in the collective realization that all our actions — no matter how small or how large — are powerful, worthwhile and capable of lasting change," Ocasio-Cortez said in a speech after her victory. "Words cannot express my gratitude."

Even though she was highly favored to win, Ocasio-Cortez continued her campaign efforts until the final moments. Just one minute before the polls were closed she tweeted, "I am so thankful for every single person who contributed, amplified, and worked to establish this movement. Never forget the hard work it took to get us here. No matter what happens, this is what it takes."
