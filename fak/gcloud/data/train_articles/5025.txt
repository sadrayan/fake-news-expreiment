Fiscal Analysis in Brief

The Fiscal Analysis in Brief is an annual report prepared by the Florida Legislature to summarize fiscal and budgetary information each fiscal year. The document contains graphical depictions and detailed listings of appropriations, fund sources, nonrecurring issues, vetoed items, financial outlooks, and legislation affecting revenues. It also includes the Truth in Bonding Statement used to support the General Appropriations Act. Various sources are used to prepare this document. Among the most important are data from the Legislative Appropriations System/Planning and Budgeting Subsystem (LAS/PBS), multiple consensus estimating conferences, the General Appropriations Act and other fiscal-related legislation, the Governor's Veto Message and explanatory information used during the appropriations process.
