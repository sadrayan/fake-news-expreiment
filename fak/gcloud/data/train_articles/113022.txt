BREAKING: Ilhan Omar’s Cousin Was A 9/11 Hijacker
Earlier this week, Democrats threw a hissy fit when West Virginia Republicans correctly identified Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Abdullahi Omar as “the proof we have forgotten” the lessons of 9/11.

While Democrats whined and complained that the sentiment was “anti-Muslim,” they didn’t tell their supporters as they pushed their fake outrage that Omar is literal proof of this. Her cousin was a 9/11 hijacker.

Omar’s cousin, Alqadib Aleimlaq, was a member of Al Qaeda residing in the United Arab Emirates. He assisted in the hijack of Flight 93, which crash-landed in Pennsylvania and failed to hit its target. Omar’s cousin died in the crash along with the rest of the passengers. But his legacy lives on through her.

Omar has made quite an impression since she was elected. Not only has she repeatedly attacked Israel and Jews as a whole, but she has also suggested “Sharia-friendly” diets in schools and other policies that seem aimed only at expanding her Muslamic religion in America.

Omar’s cousin killed a lot of people. If we allow her to stay in a position of power, she will kill countless more than her terrorist brother could ever dream of.

It’s time for her to resign. If she refuses, we must demand that she be impeached.
