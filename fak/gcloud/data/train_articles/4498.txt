RC: DeMint Wants to Force Senate Vote on Pelosi Earmark Ban Roll Call reports: Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) on Monday announced he would try to force a Senate vote on a one-year earmark ban being floated by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders.



Pelosi floated the idea of enacting a one-year moratorium on earmarks during a leadership meeting Tuesday. Pelosi and other top Democrats have resisted similar proposals in the past. The idea comes as Democrats try to move beyond some recent ethical scandals in a critical election year.



Senate sources say it’s likely DeMint will offer a motion to suspend the rules during the end of the debate on the jobs package currently before the Senate.



“Nancy Pelosi and I don’t agree on many things, but if she’s willing to take a stand for taxpayers, I’ll work with her to put an end to the earmark favor factory,” DeMint said. “The Senate will have the opportunity this week to stand with Americans and put a stop to this wasteful spending. Our nation is drowning in debt that will be paid by our children, and we’ll never stop Washington’s spending addiction unless members of both parties take bold action.”
