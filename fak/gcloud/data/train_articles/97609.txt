Minister’s Message

I am pleased to present the 2015–2016 Report on Plans and Priorities for Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). In the coming year, the Government of Canada will ensure the immigration system continues to help drive Canada’s growth and economic prosperity. The plans and priorities detailed in this year’s report support that goal, while also upholding our country’s great humanitarian and family reunification traditions.

In 2015, we plan to welcome between 260,000 and 285,000 new permanent residents to Canada. This is a notable increase from the annual planning range of 240,000 to 265,000, in place since 2007. It represents the highest planned level of admissions in recent Canadian history, and will make it easier for us to maintain all of our immigration streams while continuing our significant progress on reducing backlogs and wait times throughout the immigration system. Almost 65% of overall admissions this year will be in the economic immigration class, an increase of two per cent over last year’s planned levels. The remaining 35% of admissions will be in the family reunification and humanitarian categories, including refugees.

The introduction of Express Entry on January 1, 2015, underlines the Government’s commitment to ensuring the immigration system supports a strong and prosperous Canada. This new approach to managing and processing applications in our economic immigration programs enables us to select immigrants based on the skills and attributes our country needs, and on criteria linked to immigrants’ economic success.

As we continue to support economic immigration, we will not lose sight of our obligation to protect the most vulnerable of newcomers, particularly immigrant women and children. Once implemented, the Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act tabled in November 2014 will strengthen our laws to protect Canadians and newcomers to Canada from harmful practices, including underage, forced and polygamous marriage, which deny gender equality and deprive individuals of their human rights.

We will also be increasing the number of caregivers becoming permanent residents to 30,000 in 2015, an all-time high in that category. Coupled with reforms introduced in 2014, including the elimination of the requirement to live in an employer’s home, the Caregiver Program will be better, faster and safer for caregivers seeking to make Canada their permanent home.

In the coming year, we will continue to improve our overseas integration and settlement services to ensure immigrants are best set for success and prepared to begin contributing to Canada before they arrive here. Proposals for pre-arrival services will continue to undergo evaluations.

With the passage into law in 2014 of the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act, we will continue to benefit from the first comprehensive reforms to the Citizenship Act in more than a generation. In the coming year, these reforms will allow us to significantly reduce citizenship processing times, which will enable more qualified newcomers to become citizens.

We will continue to work with our international partners, especially the United States, to ensure the safety and security of our borders, while improving efficiencies and ease of travel for legitimate visitors to Canada. Under the Beyond the Border Action Plan, we will oversee the implementation of the Electronic Travel Authorization program, an easy and quick application process for visa-exempt air travellers from countries other than the United States.

As Canada’s Citizenship and Immigration Minister, I present these plans with the conviction they will strengthen Canada’s economy, social cohesion, and national security. The success of our programs depends on the hard work and commitment of CIC’s staff. I would like to thank them for their outstanding service to the citizens, and potential future citizens, of our country.

Year established: 1994

Organizational Context

Raison d'être

In the first years after Confederation, Canada’s leaders had a powerful vision: to connect Canada by rail and make the West the world’s breadbasket as a foundation for the country’s economic prosperity. This vision meant quickly populating the Prairies, leading the Government of Canada to establish its first national immigration policies. Immigrants have been a driving force in Canada’s nationhood and its economic prosperity—as farmers settling lands, as workers in factories fuelling industrial growth, as entrepreneurs and as innovators helping Canada to compete in the global, knowledge-based economy.

Responsibilities

Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) selects foreign nationals as permanent and temporary residents and offers Canada’s protection to refugees. The Department develops Canada’s admissibility policy, which sets the conditions for entering and remaining in Canada; it also conducts, in collaboration with its partners, the screening of potential permanent and temporary residents to protect the health, safety and security of Canadians. Fundamentally, the Department builds a stronger Canada by helping immigrants and refugees settle and integrate into Canadian society and the economy, and by encouraging and facilitating Canadian citizenship. To achieve this, CIC operates 22 in-Canada points of service and 66 points of service in 58 countries.

CIC's broad mandate is partly derived from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act. The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration Canada is responsible for the Citizenship Act of 1977 and shares responsibility with the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness for the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which came into force following major legislative reform in 2002. CIC and the Canada Border Services Agency support their respective ministers in the administration and enforcement of IRPA. These organizations work collaboratively to achieve and balance the objectives of the immigration and refugee programs.

In October 2008, responsibility for administration of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act was transferred to CIC from the Department of Canadian Heritage. Under the Act, CIC promotes the integration of individuals and communities into all aspects of Canadian society and helps to build a stronger, more cohesive society.

In July 2013, the primary responsibility for the Passport Program was transferred from Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD) to CIC, while passport service delivery will be provided through Service Canada.

In August 2013, CIC assumed the responsibility for International Experience Canada (IEC) – archived from DFATD. This transfer allowed the program to better align with government priorities and labour market demands in Canada by linking IEC to other immigration programs.

Jurisdiction over immigration is a shared responsibility between the federal and the provincial and territorial governments under section 95 of the Constitution Act, 1867.

Organizational Priorities

Priority Type Footnote 1 Strategic Outcomes Emphasizing people management Ongoing SO 1, 2, 3, 4—Enabling Description Why is this a priority? Strong people management is fundamental to the success of CIC’s transformative and modernization efforts, which include ongoing changes to both policies and operational approaches. Additional emphasis is required in times of change to make the necessary training and recruitment support available and to appropriately structure the process, procedures and tools to ensure efficiency and streamlining. There must also be an increased focus on workplace wellness to retain staff and maintain employee health and morale. What are the plans for meeting this priority? CIC will continue to pursue several key strategic initiatives to advance this priority, including: Increase capacity and strengthen strategic human resources planning to support increased staffing volumes and client needs.

Implement efficiencies identified through LEAN Note * review of staffing.

Notes Note * The LEAN methodology of organizational change is committed to continuously striving to eliminate waste, inconsistencies and unreasonable requirements. Waste is defined as any expenditure of resources that does not create value for the client. Return to note * referrer

Priority Type Strategic Outcomes Improving/modernizing client service Ongoing SO 1, 2, 3, 4—Enabling Description Why is this a priority? CIC provides many services to clients both within and outside of Canada. It is therefore essential to have a strategic and coherent approach to the design and delivery of services that responds to client needs, realizes operational efficiencies, fosters effectiveness and promotes a culture of service excellence. Striving towards service excellence by improving and modernizing services will help maximize the performance and competitiveness of Canada’s immigration programs and help attract potential applicants. What are the plans for meeting this priority? CIC will continue to progressively offer more and more e-services. This improves client service by simplifying the application process while at the same time reducing the costs per transaction through process streamlining and automation. In 2015–2016, CIC will continue to improve and modernize client service by: Managing client service initiatives: Implementing requirements from the Treasury Board Policy on Service by Exploring ways to provide real-time updates to clients on service standards; Launching a comprehensive Service Strategy; and Developing a user engagement approach to promote awareness and uptake of e-services

Improving ease of use: Launching online applications for Express Entry, electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), and for some citizenship and passport services

Introducing dynamic web forms for temporary resident online applications that adjust questions asked based on individual circumstances

Continuing roll-out of a new Grants and Contributions System, including an online portal to support the Call for Proposals Providing timely service: Maintaining and meeting service standards by Processing fully complete, straightforward eTA applications within 72 hours or less and Express Entry applications in six months; Taking advantage of the new citizenship decision-maker model and increasing the proportion of citizenship grants finalised in 12 months; Expediting the processing of straightforward temporary resident applications; and Improving how files are distributed around the processing network, streamlining processes and centralizing the processing of certain types of applications to further reduce application backlogs

Providing up-to-date case status information: Improving how processing times are communicated to clients on the Web site

Providing more self-serve case status information for more services through MyCIC Providing clear decisions: Completing plain language reviews to ensure communication to clients is understandable and free of jargon Ensuring clients can provide service feedback: Reviewing results of client satisfaction surveys and devising service improvements based on results

Responding to and analysing service feedback received through the Client Feedback Mechanism and devising service improvements based on the feedback

Priority Type Strategic Outcomes Promoting management excellence and accountability Ongoing SO 1, 2, 3, 4—Enabling Description Why is this a priority? Strong management practices, oversight and accountability, strengthened compliance and monitoring, simplified internal rules and procedures, and improved internal services enable the Department to effectively manage its financial, human, information, assets and accommodation resources to achieve its priorities. CIC will continue to build a strong, high-performing institution that is nimble, connected, engaged and ready to face new challenges. What are the plans for meeting this priority? CIC will continue to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of its internal services to support program delivery and improve departmental management practices. The Department will manage its partnerships within the Government of Canada to deliver timely and efficient corporate services and provide the optimal conditions for building a high performing and adaptable workforce. Specifically, CIC will focus on: Implementing information technology solutions to modernize Grants and Contributions management, payment of fees, citizenship grants and information management.

Providing learning and development opportunities for employees in areas of project, risk, conflict, information and performance management; operations; access to information; privacy and security.

Reviewing departmental memoranda of understanding for continued relevance, and introducing rigorous risk-management controls.

Enhancing the Department’s capacity to manage project investments through the continued implementation of project management learning and certification programs.

Developing departmental strategic procurement capabilities through the efficient use of tools, processes and implementation of a strengthened organizational structure.

Risk Analysis

Corporate risks and mitigation strategies identified by senior management are used to set CIC’s strategic directions and inform the development of the Integrated Corporate Plan. Risks and mitigation strategies are reviewed quarterly so they remain current. In 2015–2016, CIC’s ongoing efforts to improve its Corporate Risk Profile will include further refinement of risk-mitigating milestones in its Integrated Corporate Plan, focusing on those that will have the most significant impact on mitigating corporate risks.

Managing a Significant Policy and Program Change Agenda

CIC will work to help Canada remain economically competitive with other countries and attractive to potential immigrants by continuing to implement one of the most ambitious reform agendas in its history. CIC will create efficiencies and improve the client experience through a range of measures, beginning with implementation of the Express Entry application management system launched on January 1, 2015. CIC will work with delivery partners, such as the Canada Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to welcome between 260,000 and 285,000 permanent residents in 2015. This first notable increase in planned levels since 2007 will help address both current and projected labour shortages. Other initiatives include improved self-service options like integrated voice response, e-services and CIC’s updated Web site.

Safeguarding Integrity of Information/Data

In 2015–2016, CIC will promote awareness of information and data risks to staff and provide training on information management and best practices for privacy. In addition, CIC will continue to implement stronger and better tools and processes for collecting, managing and storing information, and for sharing it both internally and externally.

Maintaining program integrity in response to increasingly complex security risks

Fraud prevention is an ongoing challenge in immigration and citizenship programs. As program integrity is strengthened, individuals will develop more sophisticated means of gaining illegal entry to Canada. CIC will continue to strengthen program integrity through improved information sharing, increased fraud-related penalties, and reduced inefficiencies in the processing system.

For example, on June 19, 2014, the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act (Bill C-24) came into force, reinforcing the value of citizenship by cracking down on fraud and ensuring Canadian citizenship is only offered to those who are qualified. Specific measures include stronger penalties for fraud and misrepresentation; expanding the grounds to bar an application for citizenship to include foreign criminality; and making it an offence for unauthorized individuals to knowingly represent or advise a person for a fee on a citizenship application or hearing.

Depending on Partners to Support Delivery of Programs and Services

The delivery of the immigration program is a shared jurisdiction between federal, provincial and territorial governments. The complexity of the immigration and settlement systems means that decisions made by CIC or any of its partners or stakeholders can significantly affect relationships, performance results and the ability to meet objectives for all stakeholders.

CIC will work closely with other federal departments and agencies, as well as third-party service provider organizationsFootnote 3 and other public stakeholders to deliver the immigration program efficiently and effectively, including the continued use of joint governance structures, service standards, and reporting requirements.

Responding to cumulative natural disasters and emerging events

Natural disasters and international crises can lead to unpredictable migration flows that may require Canada’s intervention and specialized support for resettlement. They can also lead to risks to the health and safety of Canadians or to the temporary closure of operational infrastructure. The Department will maintain and improve its emergency response and business continuity plans and procedures so that it can respond efficiently and effectively when emergencies arise. Based on recent experiences such as the Ebola virus crisis, CIC will review and develop flexible policies and procedures, to enable the Department to provide a timely and coordinated emergency response to unexpected world events that could affect CIC’s program delivery.

Note A Includes revenues credited to the vote. In certain situations Parliament authorizes departments or agencies, such as Passport Canada, to spend revenues generated from their operations. These revenues are presented in the planned spending figures. The Passport function was transferred to CIC from DFATD effective July 2, 2013. Return to footnote A referrer

Planned spending decreases by $77M in 2016–2017. This is due primarily to a reduction in funding for the return of fees for terminated applications, the impact of refugee reform as well as the completion of time-limited initiatives under the Beyond the Border Action Plan. From 2016–2017 to 2017–2018, planned spending increases by $6M and is mostly related to a combination of reduced revenues from passport program and a decrease in funding for the Beyond of Border initiative.

The data is broken down between statutory and voted expenditures as shown below: 2012–13 2013–14 2014–15 2015–16 2016–17 2017–18 Statutory $ 73,714,273 - $ 100,028,359 - $ 148,100,677 - $ 95,389,806 - $ 149,739,640 - $ 149,739,640 Votes $ 1,449,611,195 $ 1,478,723,055 $ 1,608,615,740 $ 1,560,056,814 $ 1,537,633,767 $ 1,531,814,242

Overall, the Department’s planned spending will be reduced from current levels to $1,394.3 million in 2017–2018. This decrease is largely due to declining statutory funding supporting the return of fees for terminated applications as announced in Economic Action Plan 2012.

The negative amount in statutory spending is mostly explained by the anticipated surplus of the Passport Program. As this program is financed entirely from the fees charged for passports and other travel documents, its costs and revenues must balance out over its 10-year business cycle.

Section II: Analysis of Programs by Strategic Outcome

This section describes the four strategic outcomes of CIC, reflecting the long-term results that the programs are designed to achieve. The program descriptions and the information regarding benefits to Canadians outline how respective programs support the strategic outcomes. The section also provides details on each program, such as the expected results, performance indicators, targets, planning highlights, and the related financial and non-financial resources. The systematic collection, interpretation and analysis of performance measurement results is a key annual activity and enables the Department to report on expected results through the Departmental Performance Report and to broadly use performance information across the organization to inform decision making.

Strategic Outcome 1: Migration of permanent and temporary residents that strengthens Canada's economy

CIC plays a significant role in fostering Canada’s economic development. By promoting Canada as a destination of choice for innovation, investment and opportunity, CIC encourages talented individuals to come to Canada and to contribute to our prosperity. Canada’s immigration program is based on non-discriminatory principles—foreign nationals are assessed without regard to race, nationality, ethnic origin, colour, religion or gender. Those who are selected to immigrate to Canada have the skills, education, language competencies and work experience to make an immediate economic contribution.

CIC’s efforts, whether through policy and program development or processing applications for the various programs, result in several hundred thousand new permanent residents each year. Under the 2008 amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration Canada has the authority to issue instructions establishing priorities for processing certain categories of applications. In that regard, the Department analyses and monitors its programs to ensure they are responsive to emerging labour market needs.

Through policy and program development and processing applications, CIC’s temporary resident programs help meet Canada’s temporary labour market needs; facilitate global talent mobility and youth exchanges; attract and retain international students; and help enable trade, investment and tourism.

Benefits for Canadians

Immigration continues to have a significant influence on Canadian society and economic development. Permanent residents who arrive in Canada every year enhance Canada’s social fabric, contribute to labour market growth and strengthen the economy. Changes that modernize and improve the immigration system not only strengthen the integrity of the Permanent Economic Residents Program but also benefit Canada by targeting skills Canadian employers need and admitting qualified individuals more quickly.

Temporary foreign workers help generate growth for a number of Canadian industries by meeting short-term and acute needs in the labour market that are not easily filled by the domestic labour force. International students contribute economically as consumers and enrich the fabric of Canadian society through their diverse experiences and talents. Some temporary workers and international students represent a key talent pool to be retained as immigrants.

Canada’s Immigration Plan for 2015

The immigration levels set out in Canada’s immigration plan for 2015 reflect the important role of immigration in supporting Canada’s economic growth and prosperity. In addition, the plan fulfils key objectives of IRPA—to reunite families and uphold Canada’s international legal obligations. Further details can be found in the Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration 2014.

Program 1.1: Permanent Economic Residents

Rooted in objectives outlined in IRPA, the focus of this program is on the selection and processing of immigrants who can support the development of a strong and prosperous Canada, in which the benefits of immigration are shared across all regions of Canada. The acceptance of qualified permanent residents helps the government meet its economic objectives, such as building a skilled work force, addressing immediate and longer-term labour market needs, and supporting national and regional labour force growth. The selection and processing of applications involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Sub-Program 1.1.1: Federal Skilled Workers

The Federal Skilled Workers (FSW) Program is the Government of Canada’s main selection system for skilled immigration. The goal of the program is to select highly skilled immigrants whose high human capital enables them to contribute to Canada’s long-term national and structural labour market needs, in support of a strong and prosperous Canadian economy. The program uses a points system to identify prospective immigrants with the ability to establish economically in Canada, based on their human capital (education, skilled work experience, language skills, etc.), with a minimum language threshold and a third-party foreign educational credential assessment prior to application. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Ensure the FSW Program is successfully functioning within the Express Entry application management system and that it selects skilled immigrants with the human capital and skills to succeed over the long term in the Canadian economy.

Sub-Program 1.1.2: Federal Skilled Tradespersons

The Federal Skilled Tradespersons Program (FSTP) is intended to attract skilled tradespersons who can meet labour demands in specific trades across the country and who are granted permanent residence based on being qualified in a skilled trade. In contrast with the FSW Program’s points-based selection, the FSTP operates on a streamlined pass/fail basis with four mandatory criteria including: a minimum language threshold; a valid offer of employment in Canada or a certificate of qualification from a province or territory in a qualifying skilled trade; at least two years of work experience in the occupation within the last five years; and meeting the employment requirements set out in the National Occupational Classification system. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Planning Highlights

Assess whether the FSTP has the appropriate selection criteria to attract and retain skilled workers to address regional labour shortages and strengthen Canada’s economy.

Ensure the FSTP operates successfully within the Express Entry application management system.

Sub-Program 1.1.3: Quebec Skilled Workers

The Canada-Quebec Accord specifies that the province of Quebec is solely responsible for the selection of applicants destined to the province of Quebec. Federal responsibility under the Accord is to assess an applicant’s admissibility and to issue permanent resident visas. The Quebec Skilled Workers (QSW) Program uses specific criteria to identify immigrants with the human capital and skills needed to establish economically in Quebec. Similar to the FSW Program, the QSW Program assesses applicants according to their age, education, work experience, language proficiency (in French) and enhanced settlement prospects (previous education or work experience in Canada, or a confirmed job offer). The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Process applications of skilled workers for permanent residence selected by the Government of Quebec to support that province in achieving its economic immigration goals.

Sub-Program 1.1.4: Provincial Nominees

The Provincial Nominees (PN) Program supports the Government of Canada’s objective that the benefits of immigration be shared across all regions of Canada. Bilateral immigration agreements are in place with all provinces and territories except Nunavut and Quebec,Footnote 7 conferring on their governments the authority to identify and nominate for permanent residence immigrants who will meet local economic development and regional labour market needs, and who wish to settle in that specific province or territory. As part of the nomination process, provincial and territorial governments assess the skills, education and work or business experience of prospective candidates to ensure that nominees can make an immediate economic contribution to the nominating province or territory. CIC retains the final authority to select nominees who can establish economically in Canada, and verifies that nominees meet all admissibility requirements before issuing permanent resident visas. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Sub-Program 1.1.5: Live-in Caregivers Footnote 8

The Live-in Caregivers Program (LCP) allows persons residing in Canada to employ qualified foreign workers in private residences to provide care for children, elderly persons or persons with a disability. Eligible applicants come to Canada as foreign nationals authorized for temporary work, subject to their employer obtaining a neutral or positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). The LMIA considers whether a Canadian or permanent resident is available and the wage and working conditions being offered. The critical component of the program distinguishing it from the general pool of foreign nationals authorized for temporary work is the requirement for the caregiver to reside in their place of employment. The program is also unique in that foreign workers arriving in Canada under the program are eligible to apply for permanent residence after two years or 3,900 hours of full-time employment within four years of their arrival in Canada. They are granted permanent residence as part of the live-in caregiver category of the Economic Class, with established room under the annual levels plan. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Implement the reformed Caregiver Program, including monitoring the pathways for permanent residence for caregivers and increased permanent residence admissions for caregivers who have already completed their LCP obligations under the 2015 levels plan.

Sub-Program 1.1.6: Canadian Experience Class

The Canadian Experience Class (CEC) was introduced in 2008 as a path to permanent residence for those with eligible work experience in Canada, usually obtained as a result of temporary residence as a foreign worker or international student. The program is complementary to the FSW Program but uses different criteria, including eligible skilled Canadian work experience and a minimum level of proficiency in English or French. The program provides a streamlined route to permanent residence for those who have already established themselves in skilled work in Canada. This allows Canada to retain talented workers who have demonstrated a capacity to integrate successfully and contribute to the Canadian economy. The selection and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Sub-Program 1.1.7: Federal Business Immigrants

Federal business immigrants admitted to Canada are intended to have the experience and skills to support, through their investment, entrepreneurial ideas and business skills, or self-employment, the development of a strong and prosperous economy. The program was designed so that immigrant investors bring business capital to Canada, while entrepreneurs contribute to economic development through business ideas and skills that promote enterprise and employment creation. Self-employed persons hold the intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada in such fields as athletics, cultural activities and farming, thereby making a contribution to specified activities in our economy.

Sub-Program 1.2.1: International Students

CIC supports a range of goals for immigration by managing the entry of international students to Canada. International students contribute to Canada’s educational and international competitiveness, and strengthen our educational institutions. International students are selected by Canadian institutions according to their respective criteria, and CIC authorizes their entry into Canada to study by approving study permits and, where necessary, visas, which allow them to obtain a Canadian education. CIC is responsible for ensuring that the proper documentation, financial and security requirements are met, including the bona fides of all applicants. In order to provide students with additional opportunities to obtain Canadian work experience, qualified international students are authorized to work either on or off-campus without a work permit, or as part of a co-op or internship program with a co-op work permit. Students who want to work in Canada after graduation can apply for a work permit under the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) component, which allows them to gain up to three years of Canadian work experience. Some PGWP holders will also be eligible to apply for permanent residence under the CEC or other programs. The selection and processing of international students involve the issuance of temporary resident visas and study permits to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Sub-Program 1.2.2: Temporary Work Authorization

Foreign nationals can be authorized to work in Canada through various processes. Under situations that require an LMIA, employers are able to hire foreign workers as a last resort to meet their short-term or acute labour and skills needs when qualified Canadian citizens or permanent residents are not available, ensuring that Canadians have the first opportunity for jobs where appropriate. In order to hire a temporary foreign worker to respond to labour market shortages, employers require an LMIA from ESDC, which considers whether a Canadian or permanent resident is available, examines the wage and working conditions being offered, and assess whether the job offer would have a negative, neutral or positive effect on the Canadian labour market. Once the potential employer is in possession of the LMIA, the foreign national may then apply for the work permit at a mission abroad, at the port of entry (if eligible) or inside Canada (if eligible). In certain situations, employers can also seek to employ foreign nationals to work in Canada without an LMIA. Exemptions from the LMIA process are offered where they support broader Canadian interests such as the competitive advantages and reciprocal benefits that Canadians enjoy as a result of international agreements and partnerships (including North America Free Trade Agreement and others). Under these circumstances, the foreign national applies to CIC for a work permit overseas, at a port of entry (if eligible) or from inside Canada (if eligible). CIC’s role is to manage the authorization of foreign nationals to work in Canada. CIC ensures the foreign national meets all admissibility and eligibility requirements, and, when an LMIA is not required, considers the genuineness of the job offer, while also ensuring a robust operation is in place to enforce employer compliance with program requirements. The selection and processing involve the issuance of temporary resident visas and work permits to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

In cooperation with ESDC, continue implementing improvements to the Temporary Work Authorization Program.

Sub-Program 1.2.3: International Experience Canada

International Experience Canada (IEC) is a cultural exchange program that permits Canadians and foreign nationals, aged 18-35, to travel and work in other countries for six months to two years at a time. Foreign participants are issued work permits that are exempt from the requirement of an LMIA on the basis that their work in Canada creates or maintains reciprocal employment for Canadians in other countries. Some foreign participants will also be eligible to apply for permanent residence under the CEC or other programs, thereby contributing to Canada’s permanent economic immigration objectives. Young Canadian participants in other countries obtain foreign work experience, which benefits their future careers in the Canadian workplace and contributes to Canada’s international competitiveness. Exchanges with foreign countries contribute to national interests by strengthening Canada’s bilateral relations and supporting Canada’s economic and trade agenda. Most IEC exchanges occur through bilateral reciprocal Youth Mobility Agreements (YMAs) with other countries. CIC sets the maximum number of foreign national participants it will permit annually, and on an annual basis negotiates bilateral quotas with each country with which Canada has a YMA. The “Participation Fee” paid by approved foreign participants generates revenue to completely fund program costs. Key program activities include YMA negotiation and liaison with new and existing countries; promotion of program participation to Canadians and foreign nationals; and stakeholder engagement to facilitate participation and enhance program accessibility for Canadian youth. Foreign national participant application selection and processing involves the issuance of temporary resident visas and work permits to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants. Canadians’ applications are processed by the governments of the countries where they would like to participate.

Strategic Outcome 2: Family and humanitarian migration that reunites families and offers protection to the displaced and persecuted

CIC is committed to upholding Canada’s humanitarian tradition of reuniting families, resettling refugees and providing protection to those in need.

The Family Class, as set forth in IRPA, allows permanent residents and Canadian citizens to sponsor their immediate family members (i.e., their spouse, common-law or conjugal partner, and dependent children), as well as parents and grandparents, for immigration to Canada. The permanent resident or Canadian citizen must undertake to provide for the basic needs of their sponsored relative for a set period of time, depending on the nature of the relationship. This program facilitates family reunification while ensuring that there is no undue cost to the general public.

As a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and further to provisions set forth in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Canada has international and domestic legal obligations to provide safe haven to individuals in need of protection. Canada meets these obligations through the in-Canada refugee protection system. In addition, Canada partners with other countries and with international and civil society organizations to come to the aid of refugees in need of protection through resettlement. Every year, Canada resettles 10,000 to 14,000 refugees, and is one of the top three resettlement countries globally. CIC engages both domestic and international stakeholders to develop and implement timely, efficient and effective refugee protection policies and programs.

Benefits for Canadians

CIC plays a significant role in upholding Canada’s international humanitarian commitments and domestic obligations and Canada’s reputation with regard to refugees and in promoting the Canadian values of democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law. Through family sponsorship, CIC’s efforts enable Canadian citizens and permanent residents to reunite with family members. Following recent reforms, CIC’s refugee protection system ensures fast and fair review and decisions for those in genuine need of protection, and deters unfounded claims by minimizing factors that may attract refugee claims from persons who are not genuinely in need of protection. The refugee resettlement program is part of the important role that Canada plays in addressing international humanitarian crises and contributes to the safety and security of Canadians.

Program 2.1: Family and Discretionary Immigration

CIC’s family and discretionary programs support the Government of Canada’s social goals for immigration. The program’s objectives are to reunite family members in Canada, and to allow for the processing of exceptional cases. Family Class provisions of IRPA enable Canadian citizens and permanent residents of Canada to apply to sponsor eligible members of the Family Class, including spouses and partners, dependent children, and parents and grandparents. Discretionary provisions in the legislation are used in cases where there are humanitarian and compassionate considerations or for public policy reasons. These discretionary provisions provide the flexibility to approve exceptional and deserving cases not anticipated in the legislation and to support the Government of Canada in its humanitarian response to world events and crises. Eligibility assessment and processing involve the granting of permanent or temporary residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Sub-Program 2.1.1: Spouses, Partners and Children Reunification

The objective of this program is to grant permanent resident status to foreign nationals who are the sponsored spouses, partners and dependent children (including adopted children) of Canadian citizens and permanent residents. This supports the government’s objective to reunite close family members while ensuring that there is no undue cost to the general public. The sponsor, who is a permanent resident or Canadian citizen, is responsible for providing the basic needs of his or her spouse or partner for three years, and for their dependent children for up to 10 years. Processing involves determining the sponsor’s ability to meet the sponsorship obligations and verifying the bona fides of the relationships. Given the close family relationships involved, these family members are the highest priority for processing. Eligibility assessment and processing involve the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Sub-Program 2.1.2: Parents and Grandparents Reunification

The objective of this program is to grant permanent resident status to sponsored foreign nationals who are the parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents. This program makes it possible for Canadian citizens and permanent residents to be reunited with their extended family members, while ensuring that there is no undue cost to the general public. Sponsors must demonstrate, on the basis of three years of Canada Revenue Agency documentation, that they meet minimum necessary income thresholds to sponsor, and can meet their sponsorship obligations (which include providing for the basic needs of their parents and grandparents for 20 years). These requirements, together with this category’s lower processing priority, distinguish it from the spouses, partners and dependent children category. Processing involves the granting of permanent residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Sub-Program 2.1.3: Humanitarian and Compassionate and Public Policy Considerations

The humanitarian and compassionate and public policy provisions of IRPA enable the Minister to address exceptional circumstances by granting an exception to certain criteria or obligations of the Act or by granting permanent or temporary residence. These discretionary provisions provide the flexibility to approve exceptional cases that were not envisioned in the legislation. Under the humanitarian and compassionate provisions of IRPA, an applicant’s circumstances are assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account establishment in Canada, the best interests of a child, and other relevant circumstances brought forward for consideration. The public policy provision is a discretionary tool designed to grant permanent or temporary resident status to individuals in similar circumstances, all of whom must meet eligibility criteria defined in the public policy. The outcome of this program is that exceptional cases are treated with appropriate flexibility, in accordance with Canadian values. Eligibility assessment and processing involve the granting of permanent or temporary residence to qualified applicants, as well as the refusal of unqualified applicants.

Program 2.2: Refugee Protection

The Refugee Protection Program is in the first instance about saving lives and offering protection to the displaced and persecuted. One arm of the program starts overseas, where refugees and persons in refugee-like situations are selected by Canadian visa officers to be resettled as permanent residents to Canada. Flowing from Canada’s international and domestic legal obligations, the in-Canada asylum system evaluates the claims of individuals seeking asylum in Canada and grants protected person status when a positive decision is rendered by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB).

Sub-Program 2.2.2: Privately Sponsored Refugees

The primary objective of the Privately Sponsored Refugees (PSR) Program is to partner with civil society to provide durable solutions to more refugees than would otherwise be admitted under the GAR Program. Canadian visa officers select as permanent residents members of the Convention Refugees Abroad and Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad classes for resettlement in Canada who are referred by private sponsors. These private sponsors then provide the social, financial and emotional support to the refugees upon their arrival in Canada. The program is unique as it engages ordinary Canadians and permanent residents in Canada’s international refugee protection efforts and ensures an additional number of refugees are offered protection over and above those sponsored by the government.

Working closely with the UNHCR, Canadian visa officers identify and select as permanent residents, members of the Convention Refugees Abroad class for resettlement in Canada when there is no other durable solution available within a reasonable period of time. Refugees referred by the visa office are matched with a private sponsor and, upon arrival in Canada, receive six months of income support from the Government of Canada via the Resettlement Assistance Program and six months of income support from their sponsor. Private sponsors also provide arrival and orientation services, temporary accommodation, and ongoing emotional and social support for 12 months. The program is a unique public-private partnership that encourages faith-based, ethnocultural and other community organizations in Canada to play a larger role in offering durable solutions to refugees found to be in need of resettlement by the UNHCR, supporting the objectives of both the GAR and PSR programs.

Flowing from Canada’s international and domestic legal obligations, Canada’s asylum system provides protection to persons fleeing persecution and risk of torture, risk to life, or risk of cruel treatment or punishment, by way of legislative and regulatory measures that enable Canada to meet those obligations. The program establishes fair and efficient procedures that uphold Canada’s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings, while maintaining the overall integrity of the Canadian refugee determination system. Canada’s asylum system ensures that fair consideration is granted to those who come to Canada claiming persecution. Those found by the IRB to be in need of refugee protection receive protected person status, and may apply for permanent residence.

Sub-Program 2.2.5: Pre-removal Risk Assessment

In accordance with its commitment to the principle of non-refoulement, CIC offers a risk assessment before removing a person from Canada. Under IRPA, people who have been issued a removal order can apply to CIC for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). When a person has already had a refugee protection claim assessed by the IRB, only new evidence, such as evidence that demonstrates a sudden change in country conditions, is considered. While some persons whose applications are approved may benefit from a stay of removal, others whose applications are approved may become “protected persons” and may apply and be granted permanent resident status. For most claimants, only one PRRA is allowed in a 12-month period – in other words, a claimant cannot apply for a PRRA for one year following a final decision on a refugee claim from the IRB or a final PRRA decision. For claimants from designated countries of origin, the bar on accessing a PRRA is 36 months.

Strategic Outcome 3: Newcomers and citizens participate in fostering an integrated society

Through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act, IRPA and the Citizenship Act, as well as a broader constitutional and legislative suite that includes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Official Languages Act and the Employment Equity Act among others, the Government of Canada is committed to facilitating the participation of all Canadians in the social, cultural, economic and civic spheres of Canadian society. Accordingly, the focus of this strategic outcome is on a “two-way street” approach that works with communities and Canadian institutions to assist individuals to become active, connected and productive citizens.

Working with a range of social supports, including other levels of government, voluntary sector and community partners, employers, school boards and others, CIC seeks to strengthen social integration by providing newcomers with tools to fully participate in the labour market; promoting social and cultural connections; encouraging active civic participation; and fostering a sense of the rights and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship.

Benefits for Canadians

Canadians enjoy a higher quality of life when citizens and newcomers actively participate in all aspects of society; contribute to a prosperous economy; and have a strong sense of civic pride and attachment.

Program 3.1: Newcomer Settlement and Integration

In accordance with the Canadian Multiculturalism Act, the Employment Equity Act and IRPA, programming is developed based on policies that support the settlement, resettlement, adaptation and integration of newcomers into Canadian society. All permanent residents are eligible for settlement and integration programs. Programming is delivered by third parties (including provincial and municipal governments, school boards and post-secondary institutions, settlement service organizations and other non-governmental actors, and the private sector) across the country.

Advance the implementation of new settlement policy directions and innovative practices to facilitate the successful integration of newcomers in Canada outside Quebec.

Sub-Program 3.1.1: Settlement

Settlement refers to a short period (three to five years) of adaptation by newcomers during which the government provides support and services. Ultimately, the goal of integration is to encourage newcomers to be fully engaged in the economic, social, political and cultural life of Canada. CIC’s Settlement Program assists immigrants and refugees to overcome barriers specific to the newcomer experience, such as a lack of official language skills, limited knowledge of Canada and the recognition of foreign credentials. The program provides language learning services for newcomers, community and employment bridging services, settlement information, and support services that facilitate access to settlement programming. Also, through the Foreign Credentials Referral Office, the program provides information, path-finding and referral services to internationally trained individuals to have their credentials assessed quickly so they can find work in the fields in which they have been trained. Most services are designed and delivered by service provider organizations; however, certain services (such as information provision) are delivered directly by CIC in Canada and overseas.

The ability of newcomers to communicate in one of Canada’s official languages has long been recognized as key to both the initial settlement and the longer-term integration of immigrants. Language learning services are intended to help newcomers develop sufficient linguistic communication skills (including literacy) to enable newcomers to function in Canadian society and contribute to the economy. Through the Settlement Program, CIC funds service provider organizations (SPOs) to deliver various language learning services for newcomers, including language assessment and official language instruction. This program uses transfer payment funding from the Settlement Program.

Newcomers face a variety of barriers to integration, including the need for information and connections to social and economic networks. Settlement information, bridging and other support services including foreign credential referrals, attempt to address these barriers. SPOs are funded to design and deliver bridging services that facilitate newcomers’ connections to the labour market and the r community. Through CIC offices and SPOs, the program also provides prospective immigrants and newcomers with access to settlement-related information so that they can make informed decisions about immigrating to and settling in Canada. The program also funds SPOs to offer services that impro
