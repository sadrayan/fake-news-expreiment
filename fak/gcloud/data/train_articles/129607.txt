Yarmouth, Nova Scotia: Urban Legend based on This Years Shark Scramble Catch.
Submitted by Louis Marchand---- Victoria B.C.

I've replaced the addressee names from the e-mail with 'xxxxxx' but otherwise haven't altered it a bit! Barkley sound is on the west coast of Vancouver Island.



The following was brought to our attention by Louis Marchand. It is a email that is making it's way around the internet. The following is obviously not true because the fish in question were caught in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia by Jamie Doucette from Wedgeport, not in Barkley Sound B.C., however it does shed light on how stories get twisted and how urban legends are born. If you read this Jamie maybe you can email us the real story in your own words. -----Original Message-----

Location: Victoria

E-Mail: gem@eastons.ca Comments: I received this same message through government sources, both federal and provincial (BC), and though the telephone number on the lift is a Nova Scotia number, it isn't entirely out of place to find a great white on the west coast. It also didn't seem out of place to find equipment produced on the east coast but possibly used on both coasts nor is the fog identifiable as east coast fog v/s west coast fog. Port Albion is a legitimate port, across the bay from Uclelet in Barkley Sound, and did not raise any flags. Our biggest clue that this might be a hoax is that it certainly would have made the local news and none of our aquaintences, many who fish or dive on the west coast, had heard anything about this occurrence. Gotta love a good story! Date: 12/22/2004

It got me though as I could have sworn I new the guys standing next to the fish....Maybe you just want to believe it's true.

E-Mail: silverthorn@canada.com Comments: Prior to moving to Quadra Island I was a fisheries observer in the area that the aforementioned critter was reported to be caught. Having been on all of the docks in that area at one time or another, the dock in the picture didn't look familiar unless someone had done a major overhaul in the recent past. The rest of the story seemed very plausible though. We even went so far as to call some friends who are still in the area and see if they'd heard anything about it. Yes, there is a place called Port Albion and you would think someone from Crofton would know that before assuming it was a play on "Port Alberni". It is "across the Bay" from Ucluelet. Good joke and my hat's off to the creator.

As a fisherman/diver I know we have had the great whites off the west coast but that one is a beauty.They have been here when the El Nino currents are here, and that wasn't this year. I saw pictures of a smaller one caught of the coast by a couple of the local guys years ago.

Too bad, a shark like that seen underwater would be a tale to tell for a lucky diver!Maybe better yet from the safety of the boat!

Since it is a posted news item it is not as much the responsibility of the host to prove accuracy as it is the individual who posted the item Even he in all honesty may believe that it is true. What this does illustrated however is how a hoax can become incorporated into what is excepted as fact. The more it is published the more it becomes accepted as fact and an urban legend is created.

E-Mail: dixmoo@mts.net Comments: Hi there! I received the hoax email of the "great white" shark caught near Ucluelet from someone in my office. I'm quite suspicious of these sorts of emails boasting fantastic accomplishments, pictures, "world records" etc. I first checked to see if Ucluelet has an online version of their newspaper to determine if the story was in there. No luck. I then did the next obvious, typing in the name of the boat into "Google" and found your website! I also looked closely at the photos and something didn't "sit right" with me. The one of the shark on the forklift didn't look right for a great white. So I researched it and found another photo on the Florida Museum of Natural History website! (http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/ShortfinMako/Shortfinmako.html) I have sent the information of the hoax email to a US website in case it shows up there. Does anyone know of a similar Canadian website which lists hoaxes? Cheers! Jackie

E-Mail: randmanx@shaw.ca Comments: SHARK - I am from Montreal and now live in Vancouver. I knew the Great White was a hoax - The area code on the crane/forklift is 902...

Randy WEBMASTER COMMENT & CLARIFICATION In December 2004 I set a letter to www.snopes.com explaining how this legend got started and gave this page as an account of how the hoax spread. They did look at the page and post it with the pictures of the shark. Snopes is an excellent site and I commend Barbara and David P. Mikkelson for the great job they are doing on a site that must demand a lot of time and effort. However the clip from http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/yarmouth.asp may leave one with the wrong impression.

Claim: Photographs show a 1035-lb. shark caught in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.

Status: Undetermined.

Example: [Collected on the Internet, 2004 Shark Catch in Yarmouth Nova Scotia This Mako was hooked in the mouth, only fought slightly for 15 minutes, came up along side of the boat to have a look, long enough for one of the crew to put a rope around it tail!!! That's when the s**t hit the fan!! The shark took off towing the 42 foot fishing boat backwards through the water at about 7 Knots. Just like in JAWS. The boat was taking on water, the Shark would jump completely out of the water at times. This went on for an hour before the Shark actually drowned. He weighed in at 1035 LBS.

Fact#1 Shark was caught in Yarmouth Nova Scotia. Proof can be seen in pictures and from Department of Fisheries link below. Fact#2 Someone perverted the information that then spread through the internet. The originator was probably from B.C. area.

I use the word perverted because if you read the comments on this page you will see that this hoax had a negative effect that has hindered peoples' enjoyment of Barkley Sound B.C. Fact #3 Pictures of same shark can be seen at Florida Museum of Natural History website

Link provided by Jackie On Feb. 2, 2005 I contacted Snopes to inform them about this. I hope they have the time to expand on this story and possibly make a link to this page so that they can have a more complete documentation of the origin and spread of this urban legend.



On Feb 5 Snopes wrote back with the a more complete documentation of the story. Thank you Snopes. Date: 2/1/2005

Dark star can call what he wants. This is the third case I have heard of concerning Great Whites in our waters. First was a fisherman off River's Inlet that lost a huge salmon right beside the boat to one. Second was a fellow I saw interviewed on TV who saw one off Seattle, he was actually a marine biologist who had studied Great White's. He said he knew there would be doubters who would claim he really saw another type of shark similar to a White (can't remember what kind) but he was very confident it was White having studied them for years and knowing the difference. No doubt in my mind as to the location (look at the fog). Or is it a plastic shark? Pretty good fake blood on the teeth. I say Dark Star is a doubting Thomas. I'll bet he doesn't even know that there is commercial Tuna industry off the West Coast of BC offshore where the warm currents come up. Thinking about taking a run out there this summer, you have to go about 50 miles out. If there's Tuna why not GreatWhites? happy weekend, almost...

this is a b.s. story from someone who wanted to drum up tourism in Ucluelet The shark is actually a large Mako, caught in the Atlantic ocean The "dawn raider" fished out of yarmouth, nova scotia . the guy who caught it won the derby with it in august 2004 cheers, dark Date: 2/6/2005

I do know it is true and it did happen right here in Yarmouth, the Captain of the boat, standing back to in the first photo happens to be my husbands cousin, Bernard Tedford.

Altho he was not personally responsible for the "catch" , a crewman of the boat was.

Yarmouth is very proud of it's fisherman and so we are all"sticking" up for this Yarmouthonians historical "CATCH"!

After seeing "Jaws" a few times gullible American tourists tend to get pretty nervous when they see those kinds of pictures and they might just be put off on that kayaking or fishing holiday in Canada.... or go to Alaska where they know the water is too cold for Great Whites. Competition for tourism dollars is fierce, it's a lucartive business, and I wouldn't put it past any "out of area" operator to post such pictures to spread fear and misinformaion in order to create uncertanty about a visitors safety. Tourism is fickle and it doesn't take much to ruin the industry.... just look at what SARS did to tourism... which was for the most part a no show. Just the media hype was all it took. Hoaxes are not funny...

I'm from Annapolis Valley, NS, and would like to thank those responsible for correcting the false information on an awasome atlantic predator. First off, although we do have Great Whites off all the coast lines around Nova Scotia in mid to late summer (considered rare though), the shark pictured (probably caught off the southwestern part of the province) is not a Great White at all, its a shortfin mako. I have to agree with the bottom statement on the catch being almost ashame seeing as how she is obviously successful at surviving to attain such a large adult length. Date: 3/7/2005

'And that's when the s**t hit the fan!!. The Shark took off towing the 42 foot fishing boat backwards through the water at about 7 Knots. Just like in JAWS, the boat was taking on water over the stern and the crew watched i! n ! horror as the shark would actually jump completely out of the water at times. This went on for an hour before the shark finally drowned. She weighed in at 1035 LBS. It is suspected she followed a weak El Nino current into local waters in search of food.

I had wondered about the Sharks bleedy mouth since nothing was mentioned in the the false story.

I liked it that the fisher said he would have released it, not that I am a shark fan but perpetuation of a significant scavenger/predator is important.

Then there is the commercial fishing for dog fish.....sure one of BC's biggest exports. Now how about a shark towing a 42 foot boat backwards at seven knots. You know that would take at least a 300 hp diesel engine to do that!

Not to mention the fact that it never made any local news.

Jim Smith told us that he responded and hoisted the fish onto his boat with a cable wrapped around it's head up the ramp of his old naval torpedo recovery boat, which is 70 feet long and that while it was being drug up the ramp it was rocking his boat as the shark was going crazy just prior to dying. Jim pointed out that it was him standing next to the shark on the dock, which honestly looked just like him. This all happened inside Grays Harbor by West Port Washington. Jim told us that the shark was a great white and measured 15 feet long. We enjoyed the story untill coming across your web page.

'And that's when things heated up!!

. The Shark took off towing the 42 foot fishing boat backwards through the water at about 7 Knots. Just like in JAWS, the boat was taking on water over the stern and the crew watched in horror as the shark would actually jump completely out of the water at times. This went on for an hour before the shark finally drowned. She weighed in at 1035 LBS. It is suspected she followed a weak El Nino current into local waters in search of food. Although mid 60 degree water is considered ideal for these sharks, the larger ones can tolerate water in the low 50s. <<<<<<< Congratulations to the crew! Awesome Catch!

Just a fact that the water in the Cheasapeake bay is to fresh north of the Rte. 50 bridge especially this year due to all the rain this winter. and by the way El Nino's are in the Pacific!! 50 Bay Bridge and Sandy Point State Park …at last I have the ultimate excuse not to do the 'Polar Bear Plunge' in January. It's not only crazy to jump into freezing cold water, it could be down right dangerous! Note the expression on the face of the man wearing the Red Baseball cap.

I received the story where it was caught off Rottnest Island, Western Australi a. The (902) area code of the phone number on the crane was a dead giveaway. What cheap thrills do these small minded people get, in twisting the truth and then shipping the fraud around the Internet? Haven't they got more interesting things to do in life? Oh well, it's often a very good illustration of just how gullible people are. There are many that swallow these stories "hook, line and sinker". ;-) All The Best,

A quick Google search led me to your page. Ocean Shores/Longview are near "Westport," which may have come from a perversion of the hometown of the factual fisherman (Wedgewood). Thanks for your good work stomping out lazy liars! -- I second the other posters suggestion the creators get out and walk around "before their behinds get as big as their heads"!

No names were used in the story, although the vessel "Dawn Raider" out of Markley's Marina in Essex, MD was noted.

Every January, the Polar Bear Plunge is held at Sandy Point State Park on the Chesapeake. Given the timing and the added caption of

"Anyone signed up for the Polar Bear Plunge?", I'm sure someone in Maryland is having a good laugh. Special Olympics of Maryland, the beneficiary of the Plunge, may not find it so humorous. Date: 1/25/2010
