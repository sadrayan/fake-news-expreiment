Empire State Building Shines In Celebration Of Ramadan's End
New York City’s iconic Empire State Building will shine green on Wednesday evening in celebration of Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan.

Around 1.6 billion Muslims around the world marked the end of the holy month of fasting with one of the most joyous days of the year. As The Huffington Post’s religion editors note, the day is often full of merriment, thanksgiving and feasts. A common greeting during the holiday is Eid mubarak, which means “Have a blessed Eid!”

The Empire State Building has been lit green ― a color long associated with Ramadan ― for several years, and it has become “an annual lighting” tradition, a spokesman told Agency France-Presse.

The past month has been difficult for some Muslims. A string of attacks carried out by the Islamic State in at least eight countries has left hundreds of Muslims and others dead; nearly 350 people have been killed in a wave of violence stretching from Orlando and Istanbul to Baghdad and Dhaka. Many others have faced discrimination for their faith in the wake of the horror.

But despite the attacks, Ramadan has remained a time of reflection and hope for Muslims around the world, even in the face of some xenophobes wanting to ban them from entering the United States.
