A fundraiser to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has raised nearly $5 million in three days on the online platform GoFundMe.

The fundraiser, titled "We The People Will Fund The Wall," was started by Brian Kolfage, an Iraq war veteran and triple amputee. Kolfage's personal website describes him as a motivational speaker.

"It's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT!," Kolfage wrote on the fundraiser page. "It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling."

The fundraiser comes as the White House and Capitol Hill remain deadlocked over President Donald Trump's threat to shut down the government if Congress does not approve $5 billion in funding for a border wall.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 78,000 people had donated roughly $4.8 million to the GoFundMe campaign, which is still far shy of the $25 billion Trump himself has said is needed for the border wall. "If we can fund a large portion of this wall, it will jumpstart things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians," Kolfage wrote.
