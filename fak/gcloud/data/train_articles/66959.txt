Huckabee: Obama deserves impeachment
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) said "there's no doubt" President Obama "has done plenty of things worthy of impeachment," becoming the latest big-name Republican to raise the specter of removing him from office.

Huckabee, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, told Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace that Obama "absolutely" deserves to be impeached.

He added, though, that the GOP can't push to remove the president right now because they don't have the votes in the Senate.

"From a governmental standpoint you're not going to see it accomplished with this Senate," Huckabee said Monday. "But I think it's an important argument to make that there are a number of things this president has done in the overuse of the executive power, his complete ignoring of the law, even his own law."

Huckabee’s remarks are a break from House and Senate GOP leaders who have pushed hard against any discussion of impeachment.

But despite those statements, a number of GOP lawmakers have continued to raise the issue.

On Sunday, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said that Congress should weigh impeachment if Obama used executive actions to advance his immigration reform agenda.

Democrats have also continued to mention those calls for impeachment in their fundraising pitches.

White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer on Sunday insisted that they were taking the threat of impeachment seriously, saying it was “foolish to discount” the possibility.
