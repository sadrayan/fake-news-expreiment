I write to ask if you are aware of relevant information per this Judicial Watch report posted online today.

Might there be an ISIS camp on the Mexico side of the border but near El Paso?

For our fact check, who or what else would you recommend we consider consulting?

Thanks.

It's hard for me to say there definitely isn't something there, though I'd be very surprised if this were true. You'd want someone from FBI or DHS to confirm/deny.
