Pat Robertson Gets Creepy About Melania Trump's Looks
Christian Conservative leader Pat Robertson discussed last night's RNC convention at the top of his TV show and the topic turned to controversy surrounding Melania Trump's speech.

Robertson agreed with many people when he said, "Trump's speechwriter should be fired for doing - or borrowing a few lines from Mrs. Obama..."

But then Robertson got creepy when he started discussing Mrs. Trump's appearance when he said, "We mentioned the language in that speech, although she was absolutely gorgeous and I think that's why they wanted to put her on. She had a beautiful dress and she's a lovely lady. Trump knows when he's got a winner."

At National Conventions, it's been established since 2000, for first ladies to speak at these conventions and has happened many times before in the past starting with Elanor Roosevelt, but Pat decided Melania was only asked to speak because of her beauty.

And boy, can Donald sure pick a winner!

Robertson didn't stop there when later in the show, while talking to political reporter David Brody he came back to being the creepy uncle.

Brody said that regardless of the plagiarism charges, "Melania Trump needs to get out on the stump. Melania Trump on the stump, I think they should use that actually."

Brody emphasized that she was "poised and articulate" and Trump needs help with women voters.

Pat jumped in again ogling her looks, "She's absolutely gorgeous cause she is a renowned model and Mr. Trump has a good eye for beauty."

In Pat's mind, nobody cares about her poise, charm or how she could connect to voters, it's all about that white dress.
