Episode Transcript

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

THEY DID IT AGAIN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STATEHOUSE REPUBLICANS GROWING THEIR MAJORITY IN THE LEGISLATURE AND PROMISING A BIG AND BOLD AGENDA. REPUBLICANS NOW HOLD A 64 TO 35 MAJORITY IN THE ASSEMBLY AND OUTWEIGH DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE 20 TO 13. SO TONIGHT WE TALK WITH LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY SPEAKER ROBIN VOS AND ASSEMBLY MINORITY LEADER PETER BARCA JOIN US FROM MILWAUKEE, AND THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING HERE.

ROBIN VOS AND PETER BARCA:

THANKS FOR HAVING US ON.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

WELL, FIRST TO YOU, SPEAKER VOS, CONGRATULATIONS, THE LARGEST REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN SIX DECADES. WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR MESSAGE THAT IS INCREASING APPEALING TO VOTERS?

ROBIN VOS:

THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE BEING ON TONIGHT. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING I'VE LEARNED FROM THIS ELECTION IS THAT WE REALLY HAVE AN AGENDA THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE WORKING FOR THEIR INTERESTS. IF YOU GO BACK TO 2011, WE TOOK ON VERY DIFFICULT VOTES, BUT THOSE VOTES ARE NOW PAYING DIVIDENDS. WE NOW KNOW THAT IN THE LAST BUDGET WE WERE ABLE TO PUT $200 MILLION MORE INTO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE PRIORITIES WHICH WE KNOW ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE AND THAT'S HAVING A BALANCED BUDGET WHILE STILL REDUCING TAXES, HOLDING THE LINE ON PROPERTY TAXES ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, DEALING WITH THE HEROIN EPIDEMIC AND FOCUSING ON THINGS LIKE ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA. SO WE HAVE A GREAT MESSAGE.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

REPRESENTATIVE BARCA, HOW STINGING IS THE INCREASING LOPSIDED MAJORITY ON THE PART OF THE REPUBLICANS?

PETER BARCA:

WELL, I THINK WHAT IS ESPECIALLY STINGING IS THAT WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE HAVE NOT FULLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA IS ACTUALLY MAKING IT WORSE FOR THEM. NOW OBVIOUS THE MARQUETTE POLL SHOWS THAT THE STATE FEELS WE'RE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. BUT THE TRUMP WAVE OBVIOUSLY HELPED THE REPUBLICANS ENORMOUSLY. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE WORK TO DO. WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. WE HAVE TO ANALYZE WHY IT IS THAT WORKING PEOPLE DO NOT RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN YOU PASS RIGHT TO WORK, WHEN YOU PASS PREVAILING WAGE, THAT ONLY MAKES A SITUATION IN WISCONSIN WHERE WE HAVE THE MOST DIMINISHED MIDDLE CLASS IN THE ENTIRE NATION GO THE WRONG DIRECTION. BUT WE HAVE WORK TO DO, NO QUESTION.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

SPEAKER VOS, WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH YOUR HISTORIC MAJORITY?

ROBIN VOS:

WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE PRIORITIES WHICH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT IN WISCONSIN. THAT'S HAVING GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS, ENSURING THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE MADE A PRIORITY OVER THE COURSE OF ESPECIALLY THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS FINDING A LONG-TERM SOLUTION FOR DEALING WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION FUND DEFICIT. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT MOST PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE, THEY ARE HAPPY THAT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. THAT WE HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET. THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND. SO WHILE I UNDERSTAND PETER IS FRUSTRATED WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS, TO CONTINUE TO GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE SAME THINGS WHEN VOTERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY REWARDED THE DECISIONS THAT WE HAVE MADE SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO BE DOWN TO ALMOST NOBODY LEFT IN THE ASSEMBLY.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

REPRESENTATIVE BARCA, REPUBLICANS ARE PLEDGING BIGGER AND BOLDER. WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT IN THE MINORITY, AS YOU ARE?

PETER BARCA:

WELL, OBVIOUSLY, FOR US WE'LL CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR WISCONSIN VALUES. WE KNOW THAT WE HAD SOME SUCCESSES. WHEN THEY TRIED TO ESSENTIALLY END OPEN RECORDS IN WISCONSIN, WE WERE ABLE TO PUT UP A STIFF OPPOSITION AND THEY BACKTRACKED. WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S TRIED AT VARIOUS TIMES TO TAKE ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST PENSION SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY AND ATTEMPT TO DIMINISH THAT, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIGHT BACK. WHEN THE GOVERNOR TRIED IN THE BUDGET TO ELIMINATE THE AGING AND DISABILITY CENTERS, WE WERE ABLE TO STOP THAT, AS WELL AS HIS GETTING RID OF SENIOR CARE. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM, WE'RE GOING TO PUT FORWARD A VERY AGGRESSIVE, PROACTIVE PROGRAM, INITIATIVES TO TRY AND REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE'RE THE MOST DIMINISHED MIDDLE CLASS IN THE COUNTRY. AND WE WILL HAVE AN AGENDA THAT'S MUCH MORE FOCUSED, HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE AND WHY WE NEED TO BRING FORWARD INITIATIVES TO HELP REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS. IT IS THE MOST DIMINISHED HERE IN WISCONSIN.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

SPEAKER VOS, I KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS, BUT WHAT SPECIFICS OF BIG AND BOLD CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT?

ROBIN VOS:

SO THE THING THAT I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT IN WASHINGTON D.C. WE NOW HAVE MY FRIEND REINCE PRIEBUS AS THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF. WE HAVE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN HEADING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS. SO I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING THE VOTERS OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST COUPLE YEARS, WHICH IS, WHEN GIVEN THE CHANCE, THEY ARE GOING DEVOLVE POWER FROM A FARAWAY CAPITOL IN WASHINGTON BACK TO STATE CAPITOLS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CHANCE TO DEAL WITH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THEY REPEAL OBAMACARE, GIVING US MORE FREEDOM TO MAKE DECISIONS WHICH ARE GOOD FOR WISCONSINITES. THEY'RE GOING TO ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HOPEFULLY BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN EDUCATION AND FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE DO WORKER TRAINING BETTER? I'M EXCITED THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE WISCONSIN HOPEFULLY LEAD THE WAY, BUT ALL STATE CAPITOLS BECOME THOSE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY THAT THE FRAMERS ORIGINALLY INTENDED THAT UNFORTUNATELY UNDER DEMOCRATS THEY'VE SUCKED POWER INTO WASHINGTON D.C., WHICH IS WHY LOTS OF OUR COUNTRY IS SCREWED UP.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

SPEAKER VOS, I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU ON THIS, WHAT WILL THE STATE DO ABOUT PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN THESE MARKETPLACE HEALTH PLANS IF AND VERY LIKELY WHEN OBAMACARE IS REPEALED? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE?

ROBIN VOS:

WELL, LET'S REMEMBER, FIRST OF ALL, WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL BIPARTISAN PROGRAM IN WISCONSIN CALLED HIRSP. IT WAS THE HIGH INCOME RISK SHARING POOL WHICH ALLOWED US TO COVER AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DROPPED OFF OF THAT AND HAD GO INTO THE EXCHANGES WHERE IT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE WITH WORSE COVERAGE. WISCONSIN HAS BEEN AN INNOVATOR IN THE PAST. I HOPE THEY GIVE US THE FREEDOM BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WASHINGTON FOLLOWS THROUGH ON THEIR PROMISE TO ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SO HARMFUL FOR OUR ECONOMY UNDER OBAMACARE AND GIVE US THE FREEDOM TO DO IT. SO IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL, BUT BASED ON OUR PAST HISTORY OF BIPARTISAN WORK TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE, I THINK WISCONSIN WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

REPRESENTATIVE BARCA, WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?

PETER BARCA:

WELL, MY RESPONSE IS THAT, YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, I HOPE AND I PRAY OUR NEW PRESIDENT IS SUCCESSFUL. I TRULY HOPE THAT THAT HAPPENS. BUT HE MADE BOLD PROMISES. NEXT YEAR I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A DECREASE IN MY HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS BECAUSE HE SAID OBAMACARE IS WHY HEALTH CARE COSTS WENT UP. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING SCORES IF NOT HUNDREDS OF FACTORIES MOVE BACK HERE IN MEXICO, AS HE EVISCERATES THESE TRADE DEALS HE SAID ARE SO HARMFUL. AND I AGREE WITH HIM ON THAT, FRANKLY. SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BOLD PROMISES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND I HOPE THEY'RE ATTAINED. FOR US, WE OBVIOUSLY DO LIKE THE IDEA OF INNOVATING HERE IN WISCONSIN. WE THINK BADGERCARE WAS A PHENOMENAL PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY WE DID TURN DOWN WHAT REPRESENTED OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $3 AND $5 BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL BE THERE ANYMORE. WE'LL FIND OUT WITH OUR NEW PRESIDENT TRUMP. BUT CLEARLY PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. VERY VITAL FOR WORKING CLASS PEOPLE.

ROBIN VOS:

THANK GOODNESS WE DID TURN DOWN THAT FEDERAL MONEY BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH A SITUATION WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER-PROMISED AND UNDER-DELIVERED WHICH IS SO TYPICAL OF WHAT WASHINGTON DOES.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

LET ME ASK ABOUT THIS TRANSPORTATION FUNDING HOLE. SPEAKER VOS, WHAT'S YOUR PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT GOING FORWARD INTO THE BUDGET YEAR?

ROBIN VOS:

WELL JUST THIS LAST WEEK ASSEMBLY REPUBLICANS PUT OUT A DOCUMENT CALLED "NO EASY ANSWERS" AND THAT'S REALLY THE TRUTH OF WHERE WE ARE ON THIS DISCUSSION. THERE IS NO SINGLE ANSWER THAT IS GOING TO SOLVE THE TRANSPORTATION FUND DEFICIT. WE NEED TO FIRST FOCUS ON FINDING EVERY POSSIBLE SAVINGS WHICH IS WHY THE AUDIT IS GOING TO COME OUT SOMETIME TOWARD THE END OF DECEMBER OR BEGINNING OF JANUARY. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ALSO A STUDY SHOWING WHETHER OR NOT THAT TOLLING WILL BE AN OPTION. BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN TAX OUR WAY INTO SOLVING THE DEFICIT. AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN CUT OUR WAY INTO SOLVING THE DEFICIT. I'VE URGED EVERYTHING TO BE ON THE TABLE. ONCE WE SEE FIRST OF ALL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE'RE HAVING A HEARING ON DECEMBER 6 IN THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE TO FULLY EXPLORE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL MEAN FOR TRANSPORTATION. THEN WE'LL BEGIN TO PUT FORWARD IDEAS TO SOLVE THAT DEFICIT WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE. SOME POTENTIAL NEW REVENUES, REDUCTIONS IN SPENDING AND PRIORITIES AS TO WHERE THE SPENDINGS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

REPRESENTATIVE BARCA, HOW DOES THAT PRESCRIPTION SOUND TO YOU?

PETER BARCA:

WELL, LET ME SAY THIS. I HOPE THAT WE CAN TACKLE THIS. IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE TOP THREE PRIORITIES IN WISCONSIN TO SOLVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD SIX YEARS, SIX YEARS. AND THE RESULT IS WE NOW HAVE THE FOURTH WORST ROADS AND BRIDGES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. SO THEY HAVE THIS HISTORIC MAJORITY, AS YOU'VE INDICATED. THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN IN POWER SIX YEARS. AND HE'S TURNED DOWN EVERY SINGLE SUGGESTION THAT'S COME HIS WAY, BOTH FROM A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION THAT HE FORMED, AND FROM HIS OWN SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION. SO DEMOCRATS WILL CONTINUE, LIKE WE DID IN THIS LAST SESSION, TO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES. BUT I JUST HOPE THAT IT'S NOT TWO MORE YEARS OF INACTION, BECAUSE HAVING THE FOURTH WORST ROADS HURTS BUSINESSES AND IT HURTS WORKING CLASS PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO DRIVE TO GO TO WORK OR DRIVE TRUCKS TO DELIVER THEIR GOODS OR SALESPEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. ROADS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT IN A BIG STATE LIKE WISCONSIN.

ROBIN VOS:

ON THAT WE AGREE.

FREDERICA FREYBERG:

WE WILL ALL BE WATCHING. SPEAKER VOS AND REPRESENTATIVE BARCA, MINORITY LEADER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

ROBIN VOS:

THANK YOU.

PETER BARCA:

THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN.
