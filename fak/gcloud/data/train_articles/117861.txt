Green Grow The Rashes
This is one of the most characteristic of all Burns' songs, although one of his earliest.

Chorus

Green grow the rashes, O;

Green grow the rashes, O;

The sweetest hours that e'er I spend,

Are spent amang the lasses, O.

There's nought but care on ev'ry han',

In ev'ry hour that passes, O;

What signifies the life o' man,

An' 'twere na for the lasses, O.

Green grow, etc

The warly race may riches chase,

An' riches still may fly them, O;

An' tho' at last they catch them fast,

Their hearts can ne'er enjoy them, O.

Green grow, etc

But gie me a canny hour at e'en,

My arms about my Dearie, O;

An' warly cares an' warly men,

May a' gae tapsalteerie, O!

Green grow, etc

For you sae douse, ye sneer at this,

Ye're nought but senseless asses, O;

The wisest Man the warl' saw,

He dearly lov'd the lasses, O.

Green grow, etc
