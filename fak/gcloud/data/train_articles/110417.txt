Four 13-year-old girls treated in Manchester after taking 'ecstasy' pills
Four 13-year-old girls have been treated in hospital in Greater Manchester with symptoms similar to those caused by taking ecstasy, police have said.

The teenagers were admitted on Sunday evening after swallowing pink "teddy bear" pills near the Civic Centre in Wythenshawe.

Police used a warrant at a house in Wythenshawe on Monday night as part of their enquiries.

The girls are now recovering at home after being discharged.

"This could have caused devastation for several families and, as with any illegal drug, there can be serious or even fatal consequences if you use them," said Detective Inspector Gareth Davies, from Greater Manchester Police.

"We don't know exactly what these particular tablets contain and I would urge you not to take them."

DCI Davies added: "If you are offered drugs, particularly ones which are a pink and purple colour and have teddy markings on them, then please contact police.

"If you have any information about this incident or have concerns about drugs in the area, I would also urge you to contact police."

Anyone with information is asked to call officers on 101, quoting incident number 2161 from 5 March.
