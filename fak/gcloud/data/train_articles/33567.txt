Mayor Andrew J. Ginther Signs Executive Order on Immigration

Mayor Andrew J. Ginther signed an executive order reaffirming and expanding the city’s policies on immigration today at the Fedderson Community Recreation Center on the Northeast Side.“This executive order reinforces and expands what we have been doing for decades. It is also consistent with the policies of the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. It upholds the rule of law and the diversity that defines our city,” said Mayor Ginther. “The future of Columbus is big enough, bright enough and safe enough for everyone.”The executive order consists of four points:• The City of Columbus welcomes refugees and immigrants.• The City will not use city offices or employees to detain people solely based on their immigration status.• The City will offer the same city services to immigrants and refugees that are offered to all of our residents.• The City will vigorously oppose any effort to require the use of local taxpayer resources for the enforcement of federal immigration policy.

A mayoral executive order concerns the implementation of laws and/or mayoral polices. This is the second executive order signed by Mayor Ginther since he took office in January 2016.
