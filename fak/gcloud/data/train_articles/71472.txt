It's one of the most common questions I get: How many people move to Austin on an average day?

You've probably seen several numbers thrown around out there. But finally, I have a specific number I'm comfortable reporting.

Drumroll, please: 110.

That's the official number from Austin Demographer Ryan Robinson. He detailed the city's phenomenal growth at the Austin Young Chamber of Commerce's first annual meeting Friday.

The 110 figure is the "net arrivals per day," Robinson said. In other words, it factors in the relative few who leave this town (why, I have no idea).

As Robinson puts it: "The state of our union is very, very good."

As the region flirts with the 2 million population mark, Robinson pointed out that Austin is the fastest-growing large city in America, according to data from recent years. What's more, he said, he sees a lot more interaction between Austin and San Antonio.

"The power of those two metro areas together is pretty astounding," he said, adding that Austin's young workforce is the oil keeping Austin's economic engine roaring.

The downside to all the growth is housing costs. Austin Business Journal detailed that issue in this in-depth article titled "The incredible shrinking dollar."

Robinson was one of the first professionals to make one of my "20 Austinites to Know" lists. The data at his fingertips is valuable business intelligence, and it's available to you.
