Ivanka Trump markets her look after RNC speech
Washington (CNN) Looking to model yourself after the daughter of the Republican nominee for president? Ivanka Trump is here to help -- marketing her "look" on Twitter the day after delivering a speech at the GOP convention.

Trump, known for her business savvy, tweeted, "Shop Ivanka's look from her #RNC speech" -- likely the first time the daughter of a major party nominee has promoted a clothing line in conjunction with her father's presidential campaign.

The dress, called "Ivanka Trump Sleeveless Studded Sheath Dress," retails for $138 and is currently sold out on the site. The dress is also sold out at the department store Nordstrom.

The description on Macy's calls the pink dress a "sophisticated sheath dress" that "works wonders at both social and professional occasions with sleek studwork and a fabulous fit."

The tweet includes a photo of Trump introducing her father for his nomination acceptance speech.

She also included a link that redirects to Macy's, which carries her clothing line. It's an affiliate link, which means Trump may be receiving commission from sales.

Trump got into the fashion industry by starting a jewelry collection in 2007, and then eventually expanded into clothing, shoes, handbags and more.
