Cyril Ramaphosa's 2018 Thuma Mina moments
Soon after taking the reins as the first citizen of South Africa earlier this year, Cyril Ramaphosa channeled the late Hugh Masekela by adopting the phrase "thuma mina" (send me) as his manifesto. From campaigns to social media banter, Ramaphosa has become synonymous with the phrase.

The official Thuma Mina campaign has seen the president on the ground, going door-to-door in communities across the country to hear people's grievances.



As the national elections draw closer, President Ramaphosa has been rolling up his sleeves to win over the hearts of South Africans. Here are four of the most memorable 'thuma mina' moments from the first year of his presidency.

Ramaphosa's walks



Promoting healthy living is one of the pillars of his Thuma Mina campaign. In November Ramaphosa participated in the 2018 Old Mutual Soweto Marathon, which left many on social media extremely impressed.



Ramaphosa has participated in several other walks this year, including the 12km Ghandi Walk in Lenasia, south of Johannesburg, in April; a lifestyle walk in Durban in September; a morning walk in Soweto in March; and a walk in Cape Town from Gugulethu to Athlone Stadium in February.
