Maxine Waters Thinks US Should Give North Korea 'Things That They're Asking For'
By Leah Barkoukis, Townhall.com



Resistance Hero Maxine Waters has quite the strategy for dealing with escalating tensions with North Korea: figure out if the U.S. can give them the “things that they’re asking for.”

That’s right, the California Democrat sees a resolution to the crisis through diplomacy, telling a TMZ reporter that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson needs to fill the State department with those who can engage Pyongyang.

"We're on the verge of nuclear war, what are your thoughts on this?" the reporter asked.

"I want us to be very careful, very alert to what is happening and to avoid war," Waters said. "I think we can do this with some diplomacy, but we have got to have Tillerson, who is our secretary of state, get those positions filled for deputy [and] for assistant, so that we can engage with North Korea."

While she acknowledged North Korea has been threatening the United States, she believes we should still pursue diplomacy.

"I think there's some things that they want from us, and we have to find out whether or not we can work with them on the things that they're asking for," Waters said.
