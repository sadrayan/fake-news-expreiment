Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has warned the Israeli regime against any military strikes against the Islamic Republic, insisting that it will gravely regret such moves.

“The bankrupt, uncivilized and criminal Zionist regime (Israel) wish to inflict losses on Iran but they know that Iran's response to any such efforts will be crushing and regrettable,” said President Ahmadinejad in an interview with Lebanese-based al-Manar TV on Wednesday.Pointing to Iran's nuclear case, the president stated that the West's stance on the issue can be analyzed in line with objectives of the arrogant system, considering the ongoing developments in the region.He noted that the Western position on Iran's nuclear case proved that they are opposed to any advancement made by Muslim countries.Ahmadinejad also stated that arrogant powers did their utmost to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear country. Notwithstanding, Iran is a nuclear country now.He warned Western powers that they are doomed to sustain yet another defeat if they persist with their previous misdeeds.President Ahmadinejad also blasted the performance of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding Iran's nuclear program and emphasized that although Iran carried out all its undertakings, the IAEA deprived the country of its legitimate rights as an IAEA member and prompted illegal sanctions against the country.The Iranian chief executive insisted that the Islamic Republic will never give up its principles while it believes that the West must change its confrontational attitude into a cooperative one.The United States and Israel have repeatedly threatened Tehran with the "option" of a military strike, based on the allegation that Iran's nuclear work may consist of a covert military agenda.Iran insists that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful and within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it is a signatory.SF/MB/HRF
