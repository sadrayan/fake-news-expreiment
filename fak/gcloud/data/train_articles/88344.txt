Obama in-kinds Cuba issue to Rubio; Scott polls and flexes political muscle; more Medicaid mayhem; Pythons and ‘flakka’ and bears, oh my!

By Marc Caputo ( mcaputo@politico.com; @MarcACaputo)

Good Wednesday morning. It’s tax day and politicians are thrilled about it because it gives them a chance to bash one of America’s most-hated government institutions, the IRS. Marco Rubio, for instance, has a tax event today. It’s the 44 th day of the 60-day state legislative session and lawmakers are nowhere nearer to bridging the $4.2 billion divide -- largely over Medicaid expansion and hospital funding for the Low Income Pool, or LIP. On Monday, the feds said that the two issues of Medicaid expansion and LIP funding (more than $1 billion in federal money) are linked. So basically the feds support the approach of the Senate’s budget, while Gov. Scott supports the House version (which lacks both Medicaid expansion and LIP – see below).

Story Continued Below

IN THE HOUSE: An entire day of floor votes is scheduled. Representatives take the floor at 10:30 a.m. Lawmakers will hear bills that give film and/or TV tax incentives to stay in Florida; make sure amusement arcades aren’t penalized by the state’s internet café laws; and that allow people to register to vote online (Scott’s administration opposes this bill).

IN THE SENATE: The Senate has all-day committee meetings where members are scheduled to confirm Scott’s AHCA Secretary (this could produce fireworks over Medicaid). They’ll also hear bills mandating a 24-hour waiting period before a woman gets an abortion; allows concealed weapon permit holders to have guns on college campuses (this bill might be in serious trouble); striking an old statute that prohibited people of the opposite sex from co-habitating.

SCOTT POLLS—Rick Scott’s political committee, Let’s Get to Work, released results of a statewide Florida poll it conducted that shows the governor is on solid public-opinion ground when it comes to his priorities this lawmaking session. Scott’s job-approval is in positive territory, 50-45 percent (a +5) while President Obama is viewed more negatively 47-51 percent. In a blank-ballot question concerning which party should control Congress, 35 percent said Democrats and 36 percent favor Republicans – basically dead-even. Other results:

--Obamacare: It still remains unpopular with 42 percent in favor and 55 percent opposed. Asked if Obamacare has harmed or helped a person’s family, 23 percent said helped and 31 percent said harmed, and 44 percent said it made no difference.

--Tax cuts: by 74-15 percent, respondents said they favored a cut in the telecommunications tax that could save the average Florida family $43. The poll question could be criticized as leading, but the results of the poll are significant because Scott is relentlessly on message and this survey (by OnMessage Inc.) shows why he frames answers in a certain way.

--Medicaid expansion: Scott’s pollsters didn’t ask if people favored or disfavored Medicaid expansion outright, but framed the framed the question this way: “Would you favor or oppose the state of Florida taking over Federal Health Care Programs here in Florida if you knew that it would cost state tax payers billions of dollars over the next 5 years?” About 23 percent said yes and 64 percent said no. The question, like the tax-cut issues above, shows how and why Scot talks about this issue.

--Tests and tuition: By 57-32 percent, respondents said they favored a legislative proposal (just signed by Scott) limiting state-mandated standardized tests. By 64-24 percent, respondents said they’d be more likely to support a state budget that blocks college tuition increases.

SCOTT FLEXES— Not only is Scott essentially campaigning for his priorities as if he were on the ballot (he has raised $1.5 million this quarter and embarked on an ad campaign last month) he’s summoning the GOP presidential candidates to Florida for a June 2 Orlando Economic Growth Summit. “Potential and announced candidates will have an opportunity to speak on their vision for economic growth for our country,” a press release said. Confirmed for attendance: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker.

--“Scott Signs School Testing Bill,” by The Naples Daily News’ Jenna Buzzacco-Foerster: “Among other things, the bill eliminates the 11th grade English language assessment, prohibits final exams where statewide end of course exams already exist and caps the amount of time students can sit for tests.” http://bit.ly/1OaOOqp

--HALF TRUE: “Rick Scott says feds are ‘walking away’ from funding Florida's Low Income Pool program,” by PolitiFact’s Joshua Gillin: http://bit.ly/1DEIqGF

--“Feds Officially Link Lip Talks To Medicaid Expansion,” by The Naples Daily News Matt Dixon: “Federal officials announced Tuesday that ongoing negotiations with Florida leaders over $2.1 billion in hospital funding are tied to the state’s willingness to expand Medicaid under President Barack Obama’s health care law.” http://bit.ly/1IKDnHO

--“Tension mounts in Tallahassee over Medicaid expansion, hospital funding,” by The Miami Herald’s Kathleen McGrory: “Federal health officials turned up the pressure on Florida Tuesday, saying the future of $1.3 billion in federal funding for hospitals that treat low-income patients is tied to whether the Legislature expands Medicaid.” http://bit.ly/1H6LvjO

OBAMA FOR…RUBIO? Barely 24 hours old, Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign got what amounted to an in-kind political contribution from the unlikeliest of sources: the Obama Administration’s decision to de-list Cuba as a state sponsor of terror. That ensured Rubio would become the ready-made counterpoint to Obama just as the Republican was embarking on a media blitz in the wake of his Monday announcement that he’s seeking the presidency. This is the type of earned media that helps Rubio get his message out with nary a penny spent. Last year, when Obama and Raul Castro jointly announced efforts to thaw relations between the two countries, Rubio was instantly the news media’s go-to Republican to provide a contrary position. Here we are a gain.

--“Rubio: I’d grow Guantánamo,” by The Miami Herald’s Carol Rosenberg: “If President Barack Obama manages to close Guantánamo prison, would-be GOP nominee Marco Rubio said Monday, a President Rubio would reopen it….

“They’re killed by a drone or they’re targeted in some other way,” he said. “But there’s tremendous value in capturing people that are enemy combatants and from them being able to gather actionable intelligence that can not only prevent attacks against the homeland and abroad but allow us to disrupt the cells they’ve created in different parts of the world.” http://hrld.us/1IIPepD

--“Rubio’s wife enters the national media glare,” by The Tampa Bay Times’ Alex Leary: “Jeanette Dousdebes Rubio has kept a low public profile as her husband, Sen. Marco Rubio, has risen in politics. But that will change as he runs for president. In the first big splash, the couple sat for an interview that airs on Good Morning America.” http://bit.ly/1PIE2eL

MIAMI HEARTS OBAMACARE -- “Rubio & Bush Hometown Loves Obamacare,” by The Gelber Blog's By Dan Gelber: “Will someone please ask Jeb or Marco how they would deliver health care to the 400,000 folks from their hometown who signed up for Obamacare? Please, ask the question. More importantly, ask them why when given the chance they were unable to do anything to address a health care crisis in their own state and hometown?” http://bit.ly/1yrwbNy

SENATE RACE DOMINOES—It might be easier soon to name a member of Florida’s congressional delegation who isn’t entertaining a bid for U.S. Senate now that Rubio plans to run for president instead of reelection. Consider the headlines:

--“David Jolly considering U.S. Senate run - but not quickly,” by The Tampa Bay Times’ Adam C. Smith: http://bit.ly/1IKA2s8

--“As expected, Rep. Ron DeSantis is thinking of Senate run,” by The Tampa Bay Times’ Alex Leary: http://bit.ly/1FRd7aX

--“Rep. Vern Buchanan says he ‘has not ruled out’ running for Marco Rubio's Senate seat in 2016,” by The Bradenton Herald’s Kate Irby: http://bit.ly/1PIFjm6

-- “Rep. Tom Rooney Says He Would Win Rubio’s Senate Seat In 2016,” by The Shark Tank’s Javier Manjarres: http://bit.ly/1zdSiBS

DON GAETZ IN THE FRAY -- “Don Gaetz (net worth $25M) eyes wide-open U.S. Senate seat,” by The Tampa Bay Times’ Steve Bousquet: “Republican Sen. Don Gaetz of Niceville said Tuesday he’s considering entering Florida’s wide-open 2016 U.S. Senate race as a self-funding candidate. He said his wife Victoria is totally on board with him leaping into the void created by CFO Jeff Atwater’s unexpected decision to not seek the seat held by Sen. Marco Rubio.” http://bit.ly/1yrwSXd

BEER FOR THE PEOPLE—“ Senate passes growler, tap room bill,” by The Tampa Bay Times’ Michael Auslen: “The Florida Senate was ready to vote on a bill allowing craft breweries to fill and sell half-gallon beer growlers — then Sen. Jack Latvala filed a rare amendment on the floor, changing the language. The bill (SB 186) still passed, by a unanimous vote.” http://bit.ly/1PIDy8k

COP BODY CAMS -- “Shield of police body camera videos tightened,” by The Tampa Bay Times’ Michael Auslen: “Under [a new] amendment, SB 248, would only shield videos taken in public places from disclosure under open records laws. Before, it also applied to any medical emergency, including incidents of police brutality that have endeared body cameras to reformers.” http://bit.ly/1GHsu8S

PRISON BATTLE -- “House continues on collision course with Senate over prisons,” by The Palm Beach Post’s John Kennedy: “Lawmakers continued Tuesday on a collision course over attempts to repair Florida’s troubled prison system, with a House panel approving an overhaul which fails to endorse the Senate’s plan for an independent oversight commission. With less than three weeks remaining in the scheduled legislative session, Rep. Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami … dug in against creating the outside panel, which also has drawn criticism from Gov. Rick Scott and DOC Secretary Julie Jones.” http://pbpo.st/1Ox2Tkh

THE UNKINDEST CUT? “Civil rights case filed to stop Florida boy’s circumcision,” by AP’s Matt Sedensky: “A Florida woman who fled with her son to keep his circumcision from going forward has filed a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of the boy, hoping a federal judge might intervene where state judges haven’t. Heather Hironimus filed the complaint late Monday, repeating her claims that surgery on her 4-year-old son isn’t necessary, that the boy doesn't want it, and that his constitutional rights are being violated.” http://apne.ws/1FG3dGI

GAY ADOPTION BAN -- “Florida Legislature repeals 38-year old ban on gay adoption,” by AP: “Florida’s 38-year-old ban on gay adoption is getting tossed out by the state's Republican-controlled Legislature. The Florida Senate on Tuesday voted 27-11 for an adoption bill (HB 7013) that repeals the law first passed in 1977. It now heads to Gov. Rick Scott. Sen. Don Gaetz, the sponsor of the bill, called the current ban ‘meaningless’ since it is no longer enforced. An appeals court ruled it unconstitutional in 2010.” http://apne.ws/1OxqQb9

WOULDN’T YOU? “Man flees after deputy saves him from heroin overdose,” by AP: http://apne.ws/1DEJN8c

UF HAS A NUKE PLANT? “UF’s nuclear reactor back, ready to assist students,” by The Gainesville Sun's Andrew Silver: “The small nuclear reactor on the University of Florida campus has been sleeping for about four years while the Nuclear Science Center was renovated. Just over two weeks ago, it woke up — with upgrades. And it’s still safe, UF officials said last week.” http://bit.ly/1GHxoCZ

SNAKES BEWARE -- “Florida plans to give hunters another shot at pythons in 2016,” by The Miami herald’s Jenny Staletovich: “Florida wildlife officials announced Monday the return of the ‘Python Challenge,’ a monthlong hunt that in 2013 that was wildly successful — at least in terms of drawing out-of-town reporters and TV crews who helped raised the profile of one of the state’s most destructive and wily invaders. The hunt itself did not put a major dent in the Burmese python population, with 1,600 hunters bagging 68 snakes.” http://hrld.us/1IajW7W

BEARS BEWARE -- “Bear hunt on agenda for Florida wildlife commissioners this week,” by The Tampa Bay Times’ Craig Pittman: “For 21 years, it has been illegal to hunt the black bear in Florida. That may change in the fall. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission meets this week to decide whether to give tentative approval to rules for a revival of bear hunting, banned since 1994. If commissioners give the proposed rules a green light on Wednesday, then a final vote would come at their June meeting.” http://bit.ly/1NzaD8c

Can’t we train the bears to hunt the pythons?
