Privacy Center – Our Approach to Privacy – Snap Inc.
We are committed to creating products that make the Snapchat app better for Snapchatters. That’s why our ad products are built from scratch, specifically for Snapchat. These include things like movie trailers in Discover, as well as Sponsored Geofilters and Lenses.

Your choices matter. Everyone is different and no one is going to like everything they see, so we make it easy tap to skip a video if you’re not into it, including ads. Ultimately, you decide what to watch, and which Lenses and Geofilters to use on your Snaps.

We want you to feel understood. We want to understand what’s relevant to you and your life, and we want to show you things that you’ll care about. At the same time, we don’t want to serve ads that are so custom-tailored that they feel invasive or uncomfortable. It’s a difficult balance and we may not always get it right, so we are counting on Snapchatters for feedback; please consider sharing your experiences with us.
