NJ Transit approves largest fare hike in agency history
Commuters are stinging today from the decision by NJ Transit’s board to raise train and some bus fares 25-percent — tied for the biggest fare hike in NJ Transit’s history — but the agency’s executive director said he didn’t expect another increase in the next three years.

"Short of the world coming to an end, we’re not going to be looking for a fare hike for quite a while," executive director Jim Weinstein said after the board approved fare increases of 25 percent for train and some bus riders and 10 percent for local bus riders and light rail commuters.

The fare hike, the first since a 9-percent increase in 2007, was needed to close a $300 million budget hole for the fiscal year that begins July 1, Weinstein said.

The vote by the board capped a nearly two-month period since a bombshell letter from a NJ Transit union leader, quoting Weinstein as saying there could be a fare increase of 20 to 30 percent, was leaked to the press.

The increase was originally going to be a flat 25 percent across the board, until testimony at a dozen public hearings and thousands of written comments prompted NJ Transit leaders modify the increases.

The fare increase for local bus routes was dropped to 10 percent and Access Link bus trips for the disabled, thought to be on the chopping block, were restored.

Even so 32 trains will be deleted and bus and train rider Gary Johnson of Newark predicted that the fare hike would prompt more people to jump into cars.

"When the cost of gas hit $4 a gallon in 2008, people drove less," he said. "When the cost of transit goes up 25 percent this year, fewer people will ride transit. This will put more commuters onto our highways, which are already over-crowded."
