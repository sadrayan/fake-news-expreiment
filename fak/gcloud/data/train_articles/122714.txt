OREO, AT 75, THE WORLD'S FAVORITE COOKIE; MACHINE IMAGERY, HOMEY DECORATION
THE Oreo is the stuff of legend in part because of its taste and its texture - a pleasing juxtaposition of soft, sweet cream and hard, crisp chocolate -but also because of its appearance. It stands as the archetype of its kind, a reminder that cookies are designed as consciously as buildings, and sometimes better.

The Oreo is a cookie that embraces contradictions. Not only is it dark on the outside and light on the inside, but it is lavishly ornate in its exterior design while being utterly simple within.

In an even more fundamental fashion, however, the Oreo's form leaps across stylistic boundaries.

The way in which the two chocolate wafers appear to float, held together only by a recessed inner layer of cream filling, seems to epitomize the modernist esthetic, while the richly decorated chocolate wafers are a celebration of the role of ornament. So, like a building that mixes sleek glass and gargoyles, this cookie does nothing less than transcend the gulf separating modernism and traditionalism.

The ornamental pattern of the wafer itself, however, is the Oreo's visual signature. Stamped out by brass rollers passing over sheets of chocolate dough, the pattern consists of a series of four-leaf clovers around the word ''OREO,'' which is set within the traditional trademark of Nabisco, its manufacturer - that trademark being a horizonal oval with what looks like a television antenna extending up from it. Around the clovers, a broken line forms a broken circle. Beyond that, the outer edge of the cookie is slightly ridged, serving both as a visual frame for the ornamental center and as a means of grasping the cookie with comparative ease.

As a design, it is pleasantly dowdy, like the wallpaper one might find in an old country house, or the wall stenciling that was common in the early years of this century, when the Oreo was created.
