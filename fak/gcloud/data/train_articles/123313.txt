Act of Union 1707
The Acts of Union, passed by the English and Scottish Parliaments in 1707, led to the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain on 1 May of that year. The UK Parliament met for the first time in October 1707.

Here we look at the relationship between the two independent kingdoms of England and Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries. We explore the critical period leading up to the passing of Acts of Union by both parliaments what happened afterwards, and the development of a British identity.
