The Michigan Daily
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Arab population in the United States has

nearly doubled in the past two decades, according to the Census

Bureau's first report on the group.

Experts cited liberalized U.S. immigration laws and unrest in

the Middle East that led many people to come to America.

The bureau counted nearly 1.2 million Arabs in the United States

in 2000, compared with 860,000 in 1990 and 610,000 in 1980.

About 60 percent trace their ancestry to three countries:

Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.

While earlier Arab immigrants came from countries with large

Christian populations, newer arrivals come from heavily Muslim

countries such as Iraq and Yemen.

"Immigrants from the Arab world come for the same reason all

immigrants come - economic opportunity, opportunities to have an

education, to develop a professional career," said Helen Samhan,

executive director of the Arab American Institute Foundation, a

research group.

Samhan said the lifting of U.S. immigration quotas in the 1960s

opened the door to people from Arab countries and many took

advantage during the 1980s and 1990s, with a large number coming

from nations such as Lebanon and Iraq where there were wars.

Almost half of the Arabs in the United States live in five

states - California (190,890), New York (120,370), Michigan

(115,284), New Jersey (71,770) and Florida (77,461).

"It would be better to come to America than Europe or Canada,"

said Zak Trad, 33, of Anaheim, Calif., who came from Lebanon three

years ago. "It's the largest Arab community not in an Arab country.

I didn't think I would be a stranger here."

New York City, the first stop for millions of immigrants for

more than a century, had the largest Arab population among U.S.

cities, 69,985. The Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Mich., where many

Arabs first settled to work in the automobile industry, was next at

29,181.

Sterling Heights, Mich., was the city with the largest

percentage of Arab-Americans, 3.7 percent, followed by Jersey City,

N.J., with 2.8 percent. Dearborn's population is about 30 percent

Arab but it was not ranked because the Census Bureau only counted

cities with at least 100,000 residents; Dearborn has about

98,000.

The Census Bureau asked those who received the long version of

their decennial questionnaire to list their ancestry. The form was

sent to about one-sixth of all households.

Arab-Americans say their population is larger than that reported

by the Census Bureau, but many are reluctant to fill out government

forms because they came from countries with oppressive regimes.

The census report stops at 2000 so there is no data to measure

the impact of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But tighter

immigration procedures imposed after then have reduced the flow of

Arabs to the United States.

The Arab American Institute Foundation said that just over

15,000 visas were issued to immigrants from Arab countries in 2002,

compared with more than 21,000 in 2001.

"The fact that immigration procedures and visa applications have

been so tightly screened is going to slow down the volume of new

immigrants," Samhan said. "The scrutiny that will be placed on

immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries is going to be even

greater than other places."

The backlash that occurred against Arab Americans following

Sept. 11 served to draw them closer and get more involved in

politics. The concentration of Arab-Americans in a few key election

states, particularly Michigan, also has boosted their political

influence.

In October, seven of the eight Democratic presidential

candidates attended the Arab American Institute's national

leadership conference in Dearborn, as did the heads of the

Democratic and Republican parties.
