Manchin Disappointed Bipartisan Border Security and Immigration Deal Failed in Senate

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on the failure of a bipartisan agreement on border security and immigration in the Senate.

“Today the Senate had the chance to pass a bipartisan compromise on border security and immigration and I’m disappointed it failed. We worked on the proposal for weeks, meeting every day to work through complicated issues in a constructive way that would have secured the border and solved some difficult immigration issues.

“I share the President's commitment to border security. That’s why I voted for his plan. That’s why I fought to ensure the $25 billion he requested for border security was included in the bipartisan deal. That’s why I opposed the Democratic proposal that did not provide a single penny for border security.

“And that’s why I was the only Democrat to cosponsor a commonsense amendment that would penalize sanctuary cities for flaunting federal immigration laws. Allowing cities to ignore the rule of law sets a dangerous precedent, and worse, these policies prevent us from finding and deporting criminals and convicted felons who are re-entering the country illegally. I have repeatedly voted for legislation that would withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities and I am disappointed that this amendment failed today.

“Throughout my time as a businessman, Governor, and legislator, I have made hard choice to cut deals on difficult issues. But it is very difficult to make progress in any negotiation when either side insists on getting 100% of what they want. The bipartisan group that I organized with Republican Senator Susan Collins remains committed to finding common sense solutions, and I am hopeful more of my colleagues will join us.”
