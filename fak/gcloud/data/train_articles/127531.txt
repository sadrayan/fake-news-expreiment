Karachi car bomb kills 11 outside US consulate
America closed all its diplomatic offices in Pakistan yesterday after a suicide car bomb exploded outside its consulate in Karachi, killing 11 people.

The blast, the third in Karachi this year, killed the suspected bomber and Pakistani passers-by.

Western diplomats and some police sources immediately linked the attack to the al-Qa'eda network, with its connections to Pakistani and Kashmiri militants.

A previously unknown group calling itself al-Qanoon, "The Law", claimed responsibility in a statement written in Urdu and delivered to media offices in Karachi.

In language similar to the rhetoric employed by al-Qa'eda, it said: "America, its allies and its slave Pakistani rulers should be prepared for more attacks. The bomb blast is the beginning of al-Qanoon's jihadi [Holy War] activities in Pakistan."

The bombing came a day after a visit to Pakistan by Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defence Secretary, on a mission to defuse the threat of war between India and Pakistan.

It was unclear whether the Karachi bombing was a direct response to President Pervaiz Musharraf's decision, under US pressure, to halt cross-border infiltrations into Indian-ruled Kashmir.

The blast destroyed part of the consulate's perimeter wall. Two hired guards, a US Marine and five Pakistani staff members were injured.

America ordered the closure of its embassy in Islamabad and consulates around the country, at least until next week. The American Centre in Islamabad was also shut down.

The Foreign Office said security at British missions was being closely monitored.
