Russia’s Defense Ministry “abandons” Ageev captured by Ukrainian Armed Forces in Luhansk region
The next “they are not there” Viktor Ageev is not listed with the Russian Armed Forces any more

Russian Defense Ministry denies Viktor Ageev, the Russian military man, was captured in Luhansk region. The Russian institution states he was transferred to the reserve last year in May and has never joined the contract military service, Interfax reports.

“Viktor has never served a contract military service in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. According to the data of the Russia’s Defense Ministry, Ageev served a military conscription in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, after that he left military service in accordance with the established procedure,” – reads the message of the Russia’s Defense Ministry.

According to Russia’s Defense Ministry this conclusion can be made after taking a close look at the military registration card of Ageev.

“There is a relevant entry on the second page of the military registration card of Ageev, which says that this citizen was transferred to the reserve in May 2016. Also there should have been an entry on Ageev’s enlistment in the contract service in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which Ukrainian special services had no time to draw out of ignorance,” reads the message.

According to the employees of the Russian Ministry of Defense, this is the reason why other photos of the military registration card have never been published.

Earlier it was reported that Ukrainian military officers neutralized reconnaissance and sabotage enemy group in Anti-Terrorist Operation zone.

Four militants were apprehended as a result, two more — commander and one of the saboteurs, who were strongly resisting, have been eliminated. Among those captured was Viktor Ageev, who drafted in Altai Krai and served under a contract after that.
