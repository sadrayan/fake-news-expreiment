Sea creatures fall from sky during insane storm
These images show the extraordinary moment an octopus and starfish fell from the sky after being sucked up by a powerful storm.

The sea tornado fizzled out before making landfall on the coastal city of Qingdao, China, but the marine creatures which had been whirling around in the storm cloud were suddenly spat out.

Images shared on social media showed different creatures stuck to car windscreens after the rainstorm.

According to the Qingdao Meteorological Administration, the violent weather was recorded late on Tuesday afternoon.

Hurricane-force winds blew at a shocking 34.8 miles per second, registering storm force 12 on the Beaufort scale.

The wild weather conditions are believed to have whipped up waterspouts in the Yellow Sea, which began hoovering up sea creatures like shrimp, octopus, starfish and mollusks before releasing them when they hit the land.

An amusing snap also showed a 100-RMB banknote (equivalent to $13) stuck to one driverâ€™s windscreen.

Meanwhile, an intense hail storm near the neighboring coastal city of Weifang destroyed entire melon farms and left buildings riddled with bullet-hole-like dents.

The short-lived downfall of enormous hailstones caused costly damage to car windshields and windows.
