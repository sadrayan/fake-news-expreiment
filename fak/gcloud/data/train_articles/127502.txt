Anti-immigrant group confuses bus seats for women wearing burkas
The comical reactions to the photo gained further momentum when another user, Sindre Beyer, shared screenshots on Facebook.

“What happens when a photo of some empty bus seats is posted to a disgusting Facebook group and nearly everyone thinks they see a bunch of burkas?” he asked.

Eli Eriksen Sveen responded to the post: “See only what they want to see…”

“Don't know if I'm gonna laugh or cry,” wrote another.

Ole Christian Apeland wrote: “Funny! But also very sad and scary.”

Beyer told Norwegian new site Nettavisen he was “shocked by how much hate and fake news is spread there”.
