Dubai Living

Four quick tips to help you improve your outdoor space in your Dubai apartment or villa

With the weather starting to rapidly cool down, this is the perfect time to start using your balcony or garden once again. With these quick and easy fixes, your balcony or terrace will look a million dollars in no time!

Invest in the right furniture

Although there is a lot of garden furniture on the market, choosing the right type may be difficult. First of all, everything needs to be weather proof and able to withstand the harsh summer heat. Avoid anything painted, such as painted wood as the heat will make the paint peel off, and make sure your cushions are kept inside or in storage during the hot months to stop the coloured material fading.

Add life with some plants

Buying a selection of potted plants can really add life to your Dubai property’s balcony or garden. With resources such as Dubai Garden Centre, buying the right plants is easy and affordable.

Clean the glass regularly

It may sound like an obvious point to make, but having super clear glass on your balcony can make a world of difference. Especially when the summer months stop you going outside, you should still keep up with cleaning your balcony and the glass to avoid any maintenance damage.

Light up your outdoor space

There are many solar powered options on the market for great, trendy lighting that doesn’t cost you anything and is good for the environment! Adding a type of lantern or fairy light to your outdoor space can add a real element of magic to your Dubai apartment or house.
