MADISON, Wis. - Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is withholding judgment for now on President Donald Trump's proposal to increase steel and aluminum tariffs.

The proposal has generated broad opposition from Republicans, including Gov. Scott Walker, while liberal Democrats and unions have praised the move.

Baldwin said Tuesday she wants to see all the details of the administration's plan first. Baldwin says she supports sending a "strong message to bad actors" like Russia and China, but she also fears a blanket tariff could start a trade war with allies like Canada and hurt Wisconsin manufacturers and the state's agricultural economy.

Baldwin's two Republican challengers didn't take firm positions on Trump's plan.

Republican Sen. Leah Vukmir's campaign manager says she applauds Trump fighting for better trade deals. And a spokesman for Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson says he supports renegotiating trade deals to benefit the U.S.
