State Partisan Composition
You often hear the phrases “split control” or “divided government.” These terms relate to the party control of state legislatures or state government, which may change with each election.

Current and historic party control of state legislatures and government can be accessed below.

For consistency, the historic charts show the party control as of January in each year. (If you are looking for election results visit this page: 2017 Results for Legislative Partisan Composition | Post-Election)
