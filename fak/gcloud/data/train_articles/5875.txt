Presidential candidates' wealth: Who's worth the most?
A lot has been made during this presidential campaign about how much Donald Trump is worth—mostly by The Donald himself, who has repeatedly suggested how incredibly rich he is. Trump claims to have a net worth close to $10 billion, while Forbes says his actual worth is around $4 billion (which is still pretty impressive)

How much money do some of the other big names running for President have? There’s actually a wide range.

First, let’s look at Trump’s fellow business executive, Carly Fiorina. The former HP CEO has a net worth of around $69 million, according to reports from Bloomberg. Some of that money comes from the massive “golden parachute” she received when she was forced to resign from HP. Her payment for leaving was said to be $21 million in cash, plus $19 million in stocks and other benefits.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson’s net worth is thought to be around $10 million. He wrote a book about his life, Gifted Hands, which is likely a major source of income for the candidate.

A few other presidential hopeful have done pretty well for themselves too, according to CBS: John Kasich is worth at least $9 million, and possibly up to $22 million. Jeb Bush has around $20 million, and that likely doesn’t count all the family money he could someday inherit. Mike Huckabee’s worth comes in somewhere between $7 million and $29 million, much of which he made when he cashed in after leaving public office, giving speeches and hosting a show on Fox News.

Then there’s Marco Rubio. The Florida senator’s net worth is listed as just shy of $450,000 by CBS. As recently as 2013, though, Rubio’s family was in the red due to loans, according to The Hill.

On the Democrat side, we all know Hillary Clinton is worth a lot of money. Reports show it to be around $30 million. Her main rival Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, is worth less than $400,000.
