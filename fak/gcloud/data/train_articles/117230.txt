Offer $1M severance pay
There are about 40 million people over age 50 in the work force. Pay them $1 million apiece severance with these stipulations:

They leave their jobs, which means 40 million job openings. Unemployment fixed.

They buy new American cars; 40 million cars ordered. Auto industry fixed.

They either buy a house or pay off their mortgage. Housing crisis fixed.

Some people make things so complicated when they don't have to be.

This is a lot less than the billions given to banks and insurance companies.
