Evan:

Hope all is as good as it can be.

I write for a fact-check, seeking your backup for the statement quoted by The New Yorker: "The last majority-Anglo high school class in Texas graduated in 2014."

What led you to that conclusion? A reader asked us to check the claim.

Thanks,

g.

Subject: Re: Query, for a fact-check

from steve murdock i believe, or possibly from tea data -- i've known that for so long that i forget where i heard it and checked it first. right now, i can tell you with certainly, enrollment in texas public schools is a bit more than 52% hispanic and under 29% anglo. that's definitively from tea data. just looked it up for the lbj school grad school class i teach.

Thanks. I gather you did not mean there hasn’t been an Anglo-majority graduating class anywhere in Texas since 2014? We’ll try to gauge that.

Will reach out to Murdock and TEA.

At this moment, it looks to me like 2003 might have been the last year White students accounted for the majority of Texas public high school graduates, again per TEA data.

See the 2003 counts here, the 2004 counts here.

You were quoted saying: "The last majority-Anglo high school class in Texas graduated in 2014."

To this moment in reviewing state data covering 2003 through 2015, we haven’t spotted a year when White students comprised a majority of seniors in high school (not just graduates). In 2003, the state’s 125,262 high-school seniors amounted to 47.5 percent of 263,571 seniors, according to the agency. In 2015, per TEA, 109,200 White seniors comprised 32.2 percent of 339,626 seniors.

According to the TEA’s counts, White students most recently comprised the majority of Texas public high school graduates in 2003. That year, the agency says, 112,460 Anglo students made up 50.7 percent of the state’s 222,021 graduates. The next year, agency figures indicate, 112,495 White students made up 49.1 percent of the state’s 229,133 graduates.

Raw data links below. I expect we will wrap up Tuesday.

okay, gardner. thank you for the heads up. i’m confused that this assertion is so far off based on your reporting, because i understood it to be true, but if it’s wrong, it’s wrong. my pants will require a fire extinguisher.
