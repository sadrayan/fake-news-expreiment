Did You Know About These Three Types Of Wings Worn By Indian Air Force Pilots?
The Indian Air Force, the fourth most destructive air power in the world, was founded on 8th October, 1932. To commemorate the establishment of the Indian Air Force, Air Force day is celebrated all over India on this day.

The Indian Air Force has been involved in five wars since its inception and has proved its worth in securing the blue skies of our country. Some of the major operations undertaken by the Indian Air Force include Operation ‘Cactus', Operation ‘Meghdoot' and Operation ‘Vijay'.

On this Indian Air Force day, we take a look at the wings worn by the IAF pilots, post-independence.

The Air Force badges or wings consist of three main components. The monogram IAF, which is at the centre, the wreath surrounding the monogram and the state emblem mounted on top of the monogram. Here are the colours of the embroidery as depicted in the IAF badges:

a) Wings and lettering - White

(b) Laurel wreath - Brown

(c) Shading, eyes of lions and the wheel - Black at the base of the state emblem

(d) Tongue of the lions -Scarlet

(e) Remainder of State Emblem –White

The three types of wings currently being used are:

1. Standard Wings

These wings are worn on the summer work uniform and winter jacket by the Indian Air Force pilots. The wings feature the standard IAF monogram on the 4 inch long wings brevet. The Ashoka Emblem is mounted on top of the IAF monogram.
