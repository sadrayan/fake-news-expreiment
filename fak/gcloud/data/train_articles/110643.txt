Sharpton demands accountability, but still owes millions in back taxes
He schmoozes with the mayor and dictates policy to the police commissioner, but the Rev. Al Sharpton and the tax man still don’t see eye to eye.

The deadbeat preacher, along with his nonprofit National Action Network and two for-profit firms, have racked up a total of $4.7 million in outstanding debt and liens, according to federal and state tax ­records.

Sharpton himself owes New York state $806,875 and has federal liens for unpaid personal income taxes against him totaling $2.6 million, records show.

The Harlem-based NAN owed $813,576 to the federal government at the end of 2012, according to the most recent filings for the group.

Sharpton’s company, Rev-Al Communications, owes $447,826 to the state. His Bo-Spanky Consulting firm has only $18.21 in outstanding debt, according to state records.

Sharpton claims he’s paying down the debts according to plans he has ­negotiated with federal and state officials.

“It’s significantly less. It’s nowhere near the millions of dollars. We have totally lived up to our agreement with them,” said Sharpton.

Asked to provide a more specific reckoning of his tax bills, Sharpton declined, saying he was getting ready to appear on television.

“It’s being paid down,” he said.

Sharpton raked in $241,000 in salary from NAN in 2012, according to its federal tax filing. NAN didn’t respond to questions about Sharpton’s speaking and TV-appearance income.

The firebrand activist still has an outstanding balance of $208,000 with the Federal Election Commission for improperly taking campaign money and government matching funds during his 2004 presidential bid, his April 2014 FEC filing shows.
