Occasionally in the business world, I've heard people refer to something called "The Waiter Rule." Simply put, how you treat a waiter or a waitress reveals a lot about your character. It may sound insignificant, but over the years I've certainly found it to be true.

You would be amazed at how poorly some people treat waiters and waitresses. They yell at them if they forget an order or spill a drink. They threaten to have them fired, or even demand to speak to a supervisor. Their actions speak volumes and reveal more about their character than anything they could say or do in the most impressive business meetings or boardrooms.

On the flip side are those who take everything in stride. They treat service people -- waiters, bellmen, security guards, secretaries -- with the same respect they would give the CEO of a huge corporation. Those are the kind of people I respond to because that's the kind of person I am.

How you treat a waiter demonstrates how you would most likely treat your actual employees. It shows the true makeup of your personality and your true disposition. You might be a demanding boss, but it doesn't mean you have to be a demeaning and nasty one.

So think twice the next time you sit down at a table and get ready to order. And don't forget to leave a big tip.
