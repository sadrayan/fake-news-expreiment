"Urban Myths" Samuel Beckett and Andre the Giant (TV Episode 2017)
Trivia

This is a charming odd couple fantasy based on an overly embellished legend. Samuel Beckett did live in the same small village near the Roussimoffs. Samuel Beckett did not hire Boris Roussimoff to build a cottage. Young Andre did not grow too large to ride the school bus. The village simply did not have a school bus. The villagers, including Samuel Beckett, who spotted the children walking to or from school would stop and give them rides. In addition to his Citroen convertible (not shown in this short), Beckett did have a pickup truck and the kids, sometimes including Andre, would pile into the back or sit on the tailgate. Beckett did not develop any more of relationship with Andre than he did with any of the other children. The real fact that Samuel Beckett did sometimes drive a child, who would one day become professional wrestling's "Andre the Giant," to school became a charming legend that was an easy target for embellishment.
