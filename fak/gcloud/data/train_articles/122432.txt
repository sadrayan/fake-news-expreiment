Houston Televangelist Joel Osteen Refuses To Open His Megachurch For Flood Survivors
Televangelist Joel Osteen is the Senior Pastor of Lakewood Church, an enormous 16,000 seat “Megachurch” in Houston, Texas. His televised sermons are seen by over 7 million viewers weekly and over 20 million monthly in over 100 countries.

The pastor is a celebrity in Houston and a very, very wealthy man. Osteen believes in and preaches the “Prosperity Gospel,” which is effectively the belief that if you do good things, you will get material blessings from God. And it certainly works for Osteen, who lives in a $10.5 million mansion in Houston.

His followers were surprised that Osteen hasn’t opened up his megachurch, that was converted from an arena that seats over 16,000, to the thousands of people that have been displaced by flooding following Hurricane Harvey.

Osteen has tweeted, saying, “Victoria & I are praying for everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey. Please join us as we pray for the safety of our Texas friends & family.” But his followers were not happy.

Osteen did cancel services on Sunday, saying that there was “flooding” at the church. But thus far, there has been no proof of that.
