Florida takes its time spending federal stimulus money Sentinel Special Report

By Dec. 31, Florida had used 15 percent of cash ÃÂ creating or saving a mere 34,966 jobs

But that's not how it has worked in Florida. The money is here -- but the jobs aren't. At least not yet.

A year ago this week, President Obama signed into law the controversial $787 billion stimulus plan intended to pour billions of dollars into all 50 states and create millions of jobs.

Since Obama signed the bill last Feb. 17, nearly $7.7 billion worth of grants, contracts and loans have flowed into Florida, cascading into the coffers of state and local governments, nonprofits and even private businesses.

Targeted for everything from road projects to teachers' salaries, green-energy programs to cancer research, the money was sent with orders to spend it as quickly as possible to put people to work and help lift the economy out of the recession.

But by the end of 2009, only 15 cents of every dollar sent to Florida had been spent, one of the lowest rates in the country, according to an Orlando Sentinel analysis of federal-stimulus-grant progress reports.

What's more, the money created or saved just 34,966 jobs. The bulk of them -- 30,647 full-time jobs -- were credited to the $5.5 billion of stimulus dollars administered by state government. But all but about 5,000 of them were teachers, counselors and other public-school employees targeted for layoffs.

Meanwhile, Florida's work force lost nearly 1.1 million jobs in 2009 -- and the unemployment rate increased from 9.4 percent to 11.8 percent.

To many Republican conservatives, who have denounced Obama's stimulus plan as "out-of-control" government spending and have argued that tax cuts would be more effective, these numbers validate their criticism.

"At the end of the day, we will find this stimulus money will have done very little to create jobs in this state," said state Sen. Carey Baker, R-Eustis, chairman of the Senate's Committee on General Government Appropriations.

University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith is more measured -- but barely: "We really struggled to pass this act, and we're coming up on a year, with only a fraction of it hitting the economy," he said. "The government infrastructure was just not ready for this money."

State officials insist they're being deliberate -- not laggard -- in parceling out billions of stimulus dollars to schools, law enforcement, roads, energy conservation and human services. As a result, they said, the impact -- and jobs created -- should be greater this year as spending ramps up.

"We feel the sense of urgency," said Gov. Charlie Crist. "Myself as much as anyone understands that the unemployment rate is at 11.8 percent in our state. I talk to people in that situation every day. I look into their eyes. I understand the urgency. But I also want to make sure every dollar spent goes to those who need it the most."
