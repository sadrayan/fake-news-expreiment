Target Store Grants Target stores provide grants to K-12 schools and other nonprofit organizations to bring art and culture experiences to schools, support educational field trips, and provide early childhood reading programs. It’s part of our commitment to give 5% of our income to the communities we serve—more than $3 million each week.
