Union ad against Joe Heck inaccurate again

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) has rolled out a second television ad targeting Republican House candidate Joe Heck.

For the second time in a week, the labor union is accusing Heck of wanting to privatize Social Security. The television commercial features Phyllis Hamilton, a single mother with 40 years in the workforce.

"If it was up to Joe Heck, he would have erased her retirement, gambling it away on Wall Street, turning Social Security into another Wall Street bailout," the commercial says. "Tell Joe Heck that's not a risk Phyllis or any of us want to take."

Like the first ad AFSCME released, the commercial is inaccurate.

Under Heck's proposed plan, Phyllis Hamilton would have the option of investing her share of Social Security in the private market - if she chose to.

Heck is not calling for mandatory private investment, nor the dismantling of public Social Security. Instead, he advocates for giving people a choice to decide how they want to invest. Employers would continue to contribute to the existing Social Security system.

While her name is never mentioned, AFSCME launched the commercial on behalf of Rep. Dina Titus, Heck's Democratic opponent.

The union plans to spend $750,000 in media buys to help Titus get re-elected.

Democrats also are organizing a protest with Las Vegas-area seniors this afternoon at Heck's campaign office.
