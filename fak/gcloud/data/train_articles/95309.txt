Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Rabies • Rabies is a serious disease. It is caused by a virus. • Rabies is mainly a disease of animals. Humans get rabies when they are bitten by infected animals. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death.

• The early symptoms of rabies in people are similar to that of many other illnesses, including fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, more specific symptoms appear and may include anxiety, hallucinations, increase in saliva, partial paralysis, and fear of water. Death usually occurs within days of the onset of these symptoms. • Human rabies is almost always fatal.

• Wild animals - especially bats - are the most common source of human rabies infection in the United States. Skunks, raccoons, dogs, cats, coyotes, foxes, and other mammals can also transmit the disease.

• Although human rabies is rare in the United States, tens of thousands of people are vaccinated each year as a precaution after animal bites. Also, rabies is far more common in other parts of the world, with about 40,000 - 70,000 rabies-related deaths worldwide each year. Bites from unvaccinated dogs cause most of these cases.

• Rabies vaccine can prevent rabies.

Rabies Vaccine Schedule The pre-exposure schedule for rabies vaccination is 3 doses. Anyone who has been bitten by an animal, or who otherwise may have been exposed to rabies, should see a doctor immediately. The doctor will determine if they need to be vaccinated.
