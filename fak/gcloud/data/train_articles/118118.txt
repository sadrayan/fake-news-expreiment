EU flag burned as thousands join nationalist march in Poland
Protestors burned an EU flag as thousands took to the streets in Warsaw

In a show of defiance against EU lawmakers, an estimated 25,000 people joined a march to commemorate the anniversary of Poland's return to independence after the First World War.

Poland only joined the EU in 2004, however, many in Warsaw used the event to express rising anger with Brussels amid Europe's ongoing migrant crisis.

The nationalist display is believed to have been attended by far-right neo-Nazi groups.

A eurosceptic party recently claimed victory in the eastern European country's elections, with Poland's pro-EU prime minister also set to be replaced.
