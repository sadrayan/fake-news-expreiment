Clinton’s plans might add billions to the national debt. Trump’s could add trillions.
Clinton increases spending by $1.65 trillion, but her plan also raises $1.5 trillion in new taxes, so she adds $150 billion to the debt, plus interest on the new money she’ll need to borrow to fund her programs.

These boxes represent the major contributor

to Trump’s additional debt: $4.5 trillion in

tax cuts.

Trump promised his plan would not add at all to the national debt in a September speech, but there’s little evidence that’s possible.

He hasn’t proposed enough spending changes to account for the significantly lower income for the federal government.

Trump’s campaign insists that his entire economic plan, including tax cuts, deregulation and major changes in trade policy, would supercharge the economy. But most analysts are skeptical that the plan could produce enough growth to offset Trump’s additional deficits.

The campaign expects growth that “would require productivity rates that we haven’t seen in modern history,” said Marc Goldwein, a senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which produced the report.

To do so, Trump would need to contend with an aging U.S. population, which Goldwein warned would be difficult if Trump is also slowing immigration.
