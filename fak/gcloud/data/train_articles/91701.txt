State: Crist popular on foe's turf
The Buzz: Florida politics Crist popular on foe's turf By Times staff writers

Published September 4, 2005

It's no big surprise that Pinellas County's Republican legislative delegation is solidly behind Charlie Crist's gubernatorial campaign; Pinellas is his home county, after all. More striking is that in Miami-Dade, the home county of Republican candidate Tom Gallagher, most of the Republican delegation is backing Crist, too. It's a testament to the countless visits and personal attention Crist has showered on grass roots activists and politicos for years that many Miami-Dade lawmakers say they know him much better than Gallagher. "Most of the delegation has been with Charlie from the very beginning, and it's been enthusiastic support," said state Rep. Juan Zapata. "There's more enthusiasm for Charlie at this stage than there even was for Mel (Martinez's U.S. Senate campaign) at the very beginning." Of Miami-Dade's 12 Republican state representatives, six are openly backing Crist, two are openly backing Gallagher, and the rest are neutral or uncommitted. In addition, state Sen. Alex Villalobos, Miami-Dade County Commission Chairman Joe Martinez and Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez are backing Gallagher. "There's a lot of people who know of Tom Gallagher. But they know Charlie Crist," said state Rep. Juan-Carlos Planas. Gallagher's state House backers from Miami are Reps. Ralph Arza and David Rivera. Crist's are Reps. Zapata, Planas, Gus Barreiro, Rene Garcia, Marcelo Llorente and Julio Robaina. SECOND THOUGHTS IN SANTA ROSA: The Republican Party in Santa Rosa County, near Pensacola, sent letters to 1,900 graduating high school seniors, urging them to register to vote with the GOP. Party chairwoman Nancy Cole's letter was straightforward: It said her party "believes in individual responsibilities as opposed to government dictates." But an attached pamphlet produced by the Republican Party of Florida has Democrats fuming. The flier defines "liberal Democrats" as having "an extremist record of placing the rights of criminals above all" and "aligned with extreme left-wing elements that (believe) God should be totally excluded from public utterances." The flier lists the state party phone number and a disclaimer "Paid for by the Republican Party of Florida." "Celebrating the milestone of high school graduation is hardly the time for cheap political ploys," said Democratic Party spokesman Steve Schale. Cole said she believes some Democrats hold such views, but she said she also knows plenty of Democrats who don't. As for the flier, she didn't try to mount a defense of it. "It's a bit radical," Cole said. "I don't know that I would send it again." BANKING ON IT: Democrat Alex Sink joined the race for chief financial officer by citing her work as "Florida's highest ranking female bank president." That would be as former chief of Florida operations for Bank of America. So it's hardly a surprise that Sink would choose her old workplace to deposit her CFO campaign money. But Republican Tom Lee, the Senate president from Brandon who's also running for CFO, also keeps about $1.1-million in political donations at the Bank of America. Lee has a fundraising committee, Floridians Uniting for a Stronger Tomorrow (www.flust.com) separate from his CFO campaign, that lists Bank of America as payee for meals, travel and office supplies. This is the soft-money account Lee created in 2003, to use as a hedge against those who would attack Republican senators. THINKING INSIDE THE BOX: Things could get crowded in the president's box at the Florida State-University of Miami football game Monday night. Usually about 250 people watch the game from the prestigious perch overlooking Doak Campbell Stadium. This time more than 400 will be rubbing elbows in the suite. The demand for tickets from legislators and other public officials is over the top. Gov. Jeb Bush, at least four members of the Florida Supreme Court and Sen. Bill Nelson are among those expected in the box. SIGNING UP: A gushing crowd gathered to see Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist at Miami's Versailles restaurant on Thursday. Members of the local Christian Coalition chapter presented him with a petition calling for a state constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages and civil unions. Crist cheerfully signed. His office released petitions for the ballot initiative to the state Supreme Court for review on the same day. His rival for the GOP nomination, CFO Tom Gallagher, already has signed the petition, as has his wife, Laura Gallagher. GRAVY TRAIN GONE: The political earth shook in Fort Lauderdale last week as Bill Scherer - a leading Republican fundraiser, Bush-Cheney "Pioneer" and key figure in the 2000 recount legal battles - lost his multimillion-dollar-a-year contract as general counsel to the North Broward Hospital District. The seven-member board that runs Broward's public hospitals (all of them Jeb Bush appointees) voted to take its legal work in-house on a 4-3 vote. Among those voting to fire Scherer after 17 years was a new board member, Maureen Jaeger, who is the South Florida office manager for Attorney General Charlie Crist. Scherer has donated money to Crist's Republican opponent for governor, Gallagher, but surely, that's a coincidence. As Jaeger told the Miami Herald: "You have to run a hospital district like a business . . . I think we're going to save lots of money." FROM ARNOLD TO JEB: She's back! Donna Arduin, Gov. Bush's first budget director who drew ire from across state government for her adherence to strict fiscal conservatism, is back advising Florida's chief executive. Bush on Tuesday announced that Arduin, who left Bush's office in 2003 to work for then-new California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, would join Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Arduin, 42, of Fort Lauderdale is a principal in the consulting firm Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics LLA. She left Schwarzenegger's shop late last year.
