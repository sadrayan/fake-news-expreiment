Our Mission

What We Believe

FAIR, the Federation for American Immigrationis a non-partisan, public interest organization of concerned Americans, united in the belief that our immigration policies and laws should again serve the nation’s future needs. This means better border management, lower levels of overall immigration, and a greater focus on highly skilled immigrants.With a support base comprising nearly 50 private foundations and over 1.3 million diverse members and supporters, FAIR is free of party loyalties and special interest connections.FAIR evaluates policies, seeking out solutions that help reduce the negative impact of uncontrolled immigration on the nation’s security, economy, workforce, education, healthcare, andFAIR seeks to reduce overall immigration to a more normal level. Reducing legal immigration levels from well over one million presently to 300,000 a year over a sustained period will allow America to manage growth, address environmental concerns, and maintain a high quality of life.FAIR puts the interests of American citizens and future generations ahead of big business and partisan demands.Immigration, within proper limits, can be positive. Adhering to the rule of law is central to successful assimilation and citizenship.

Tough decisions require strong leadership. Strong leadership, in turn, is underscored by defined principles that anchor public policy.



Immigration can be an emotional topic: We believe in respecting the basic human rights and the dignity of all involved. As such, FAIR opposes policies based on favoritism toward, or discrimination against, any person based on race, color, religion, or gender.



We understand that under any rational system of ordered entry, the demand will always vastly exceed available slots. Tough decisions will therefore always be necessary.
