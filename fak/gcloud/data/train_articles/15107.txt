Death Penalty for Offenses Other Than Murder
As it relates to crimes against individuals, though, the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was not taken.

-Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority in Kennedy v. Louisiana (2008)

INTRODUCTION

The death penalty in the United States is used almost exclusively for the crime of murder. Although state and federal statutes contain various capital crimes other than those involving the death of the victim, only two people were on death row for a non-murder offense (Patrick Kennedy and Richard Davis in Louisiana) when the U.S. Supreme Court addressed this issue in 2008. No one has been executed for such a crime since the death penalty was re-instated in 1976. In 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, held that the death penalty for the rape of an adult was "grossly disproportionate" and an "excessive punishment," and hence was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The Court looked at the relatively few states that allowed the death penalty for rape and the few death sentences that had been handed down.



Some states passed new laws allowing the death penalty for the rape of a child. In 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the death sentence for Patrick Kennedy for the rape of his step-daughter, LOUISIANA v. KENNEDY (No. 05-KA-1981, May 22, 2007). Kennedy was convicted in 2003. However, Louisiana's law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 25, 2008. See Kennedy v. Louisiana for more information. This decision also held that the death penalty would be disproportionate for any offense against an individual that did not involve death of the victim.

Unclear Death Penalty Statutes for the Rape of a Child

STATES OFFENSES ENACTED EXISTING DEATH SENTENCES/EXECUTIONS NOTES Florida (?) Sexual battery or attempted sexual battery with injury of a child under 12;

Fla. Stat. Ann. sec. 794.011 1974 0/0 Buford v.

Statute has not been repealed but appears unconstitutional. See Welsh v. State, 850 So. 2d 467, 468 n.1 (Fla. 2003) (reference to capital crime only "historical").
