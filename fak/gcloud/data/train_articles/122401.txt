Marrero man arrested in Walmart bathroom videotaping
The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office has arrested a Marrero man after authorities say he was videotaping other men inside a Walmart bathroom this weekend. Darrell Young, 24, of 7120 Gentry Road, was booked on Friday with video voyeurism and has since been released from custody.

Authorities said that a victim reported going to the bathroom at a Walmart in the 4800 block of Lapalco Boulevard on Friday and entering the stall. The man reported that after he had undressed, he noticed a hand coming under the stall divider holding a cell phone, the arrest report stated.

The man quickly jumped up and got dressed. He left the bathroom and sought out a store manager who waited near the bathroom until Young exited. Young was taken into custody and interviewed by the Sheriff's office, the report stated. During questioning, Young admitted to filming men in the bathroom and then using those videos for sexual arousal.
