Gov. Brown calls for an investigation of alleged mismanagement at California's tax board
Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) (Josh Newman for State Senate)

Opponents of a gas-tax increase approved by the Legislature last week plan to launch a recall drive against freshman state Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) for voting in favor of the tax hike as part of a plan to raise $5.2 billion annually for road and bridge repairs.

Former San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio, a radio talk show host, said there is statewide interest in targeting Newman with a recall drive as punishment for his vote and to deprive the Democrats of their two-thirds majority in the Senate.

“We’re about focusing in and disciplining these politicians in Sacramento who recklessly raise the gas and car tax and we're going to start out with Mr. Newman first,” DeMaio said. “We will then turn to the remaining Democrats and tell them, 'Either you repeal the car tax or we will pick off more of you.'”
