Survey data on lifestyle risk factors for adults and youth that contribute to the leading causes of death and chronic disease in Texas and the U.S.

Data Description:

The Texas Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), initiated in 1991, is a federally funded classroom-based paper survey conducted biennially on odd years to monitor priority health-risk behaviors that contribute substantially to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems among youth and adults in the United States. This surveillance can be used to monitor the Healthy People 2020 Objectives for smoking, overweight, exercise, seat belt use, fruit/vegetable consumption, alcohol consumption, drug use, sexual activity and other risk factors so that intervention priorities can be established and the long-term impact of health promotion programs can be monitored.
