Pence: Medicare and Social Security Report Shows Need for Real Reform - Blog
U.S. Congressman Mike Pence, Chairman of the House Republican Conference, issued the following statement today in response to the release of the 2009 Social Security and Medicare Trustees report, which highlights the deteriorating financial condition of the Medicare and Social Security programs:



“The American people know we cannot borrow, spend and tax our way back to a growing economy. Our nation’s entitlement programs are quickly going bankrupt and yet President Obama has not offered a plan to preserve Medicare and Social Security for our children and grandchildren.



“Instead the Administration and Democrats in Congress would rather pass a government-controlled health care plan that will deprive roughly 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage and lead to federal bureaucrats denying critical care for patients. Taking money from seniors to pay for a government takeover of health care is an irresponsible prescription for reform.



“The American people want this Congress and this President to practice fiscal discipline and reform. We ought to do so by getting serious about real entitlement reform and an overhaul of health care that puts patients in front of politics."
