Suffolk County Law Limiting Tobacco Sales to Persons over Age 21 Takes Effect

Law comprises tobacco, e-cigarettes, liquid nicotine and like products

Commissioner of Health Services James Tomarken, MD, MPH, reminds vendors and residents that as of January 1, 2015, it is illegal to sell tobacco, e-cigarettes, and liquid nicotine in Suffolk County to persons under the age of 21. Prior to January 1, it had been illegal to sell these products to persons under the age of 19.

Dr. Tomarken said that it is also important to know that since 2009, it has been illegal to use e-cigarettes and similar products in public places where traditional forms of smoking are banned. Anyone who violates these provisions may be fined a minimum of $300.

Vendors will be contacted when new 2015 Tobacco 21 signs are available at county offices. Vendors may obtain a temporary copy of the signage by visiting the Suffolk County Government website. www.suffolkcountyny.gov/Departments/HealthServices/PreventiveMedicine/OfficeofHealthEducation/SmokingCessation/TobaccoVendorEducationProgram.aspx.

Suffolk County residents who wish to quit smoking are advised to seek support. Suffolk County offers cessation classes at no cost to residents.
