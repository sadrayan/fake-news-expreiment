Tom:

Hello again.

I write because I’m trying to check this claim by U.S. Senate candidate Steve Stockman: “In every poll,” John Cornyn “always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about.”

I see that PPP did a November poll suggesting Cornyn would trail Rick Perry, though lead Louie Gohmert and David Barton, if I read right. Did your press-release figures on these hypothetical match-ups reflect GOP primary voters only? If not, what were those primary-voter results?

Have you seen (or conducted) other polls bearing on Stockman’s claim?

Other thoughts?

Thanks.

Those numbers were just among Republican primary voters.

Cornyn did lose out 49/33 on our poll to a generic ‘more conservative’ candidate.

I guess Stockman could argue Gohmert and Barton are not people the voters have heard about. Gohmert’s name recognition was 38% and we didn’t test Barton’s but it would doubtless have been lower-

Sorry to belabor this, but it bears on Stockman’s accuracy. He said that “in every poll,” Cornyn “always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about.”

Is there evidence that voters have “heard about” all the individuals you tested against Cornyn? What is it?

What’s your opinion of which tested foes are “heard about” or not and why?

Appreciated.

My bar of whether voters have heard about a candidate would be whether they have 50% name recognition. Perry was the only one we tested who fit that bill. So Stockman’s statement might be true at some level but it’s not particularly compelling since there really just wasn’t much polling out there testing Cornyn against anyone who voters are very familiar with
