Obama says he will go down as a great president

During Barack Obama’s final press conference Friday afternoon, he spent a majority of the time patting himself on the back.

Obama told a room full of reporters that after eight years of his presidency, the United States is stronger, in better shape, and more respected across the world than ever before.

“Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago.”

Compiling a list of reasons why Barack Obama is a terrible president seems like a project for a book rather than a column, but I am sure many of you agree that Obama will undoubtedly go down as one of the worst presidents in American history.

The biggest failure in American history

We don’t even need to choose one failure of his–the list of catastrophic failures will forever place the United States in a bad position.

Our allies no long trust or respect us while our enemies no long fear us. Obama is right, he did accomplish all of that on his own.

It’s clear that he’s been a disaster for America on a scale that few other presidents can match. Just look at his record. What’s worse, his blatantly disrespectful attitude stinks of entitlement a delusional thinking; Obama literally thinks we owe him something for his “leadership”.

How does it make you feel to read that he thinks he will go down as one of the greatest presidents in our history?
