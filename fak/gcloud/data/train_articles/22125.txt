Red to Blue
The key to winning back a Democratic House is right here -- with diverse candidates like those below. Red to Blue is a highly competitive and battle-tested program at the DCCC that arms top-tier candidates with organizational and fundraising support to help them continue to run strong campaigns. Come November, these candidates and others will take the fight to Paul Ryanâ€™s House Republicans -- and fight to flip these seats from red to blue.
