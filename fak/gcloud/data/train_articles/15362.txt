In the most current Rankings and Estimates publication, Table H-11: Current expenditures for public K-12 schools per student in fall enrollment, 2012-13 ($), on page 55, is computed by dividing total current expenditures (federal, state, and local) by the fall enrollment. State, local, and federal funds are included in the calculation.

· Current Expenditures include all the items below in “Column 2”-- a through d only.

· Other current expenditures, capital outlay, and interest on school debt—also described as expenditures—do not count in the calculation of per student expenditures.

· The “Other” current expenditure items are programs that are not part of the regular public elementary and secondary school program and therefore do not count in the calculation.

Per Student expenditures is defined as Current Expenditures divided by fall enrollment.
