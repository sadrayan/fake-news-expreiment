Professor Davis:

I had a chance today to read portions of your “Three Roads to the Alamo” because I am trying to fact-check a local claim that James Bowie and Stephen F. Austin each owned slaves. Your book says Bowie’s family kept slaves from the start and that Bowie and two brothers engaged in smuggling slaves to some profit. Bowie personally, you wrote, sold a single slave, Henry, 19, to a cousin in 1828. Also, Bowie was involved in the family’s sale of land and 80 slaves in January 1831. In an end note, you also expressed doubt about a story that Bowie saved a runaway slave in 1821. You wrote: “Given that slaves in general were property to Bowie, and that this one in particular could have meant profit, it is inconceivable that he would act to help the runaway.”

Is it accurate to say Bowie owned slaves? Any caveats? Other thoughts?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks,

On an airport at the moment so no extended reply. No question Bowie owned slaves, most for resale, but at different times had personal slave or slaves as well. Don't know about Austin. WCD
