What a pair! Beyoncé’s daughter, Blue, joined Gwyneth Paltrow’s daughter, Apple, for a birthday brunch on Saturday, May 14.

The BFFs posed for the sweet shot, celebrating Apple's 12th birthday on Saturday, with two of their friends. Paltrow, 43, shared the photo on Instagram, writing, “Birthday brunch squad #godsistersandbesties.”

Blue, 4, and Apple also hung out earlier this year at Super Bowl 50, where they held hands in an adorable pic while wearing glamorous bomber jackets. Beyoncé, 34, joined Apple’s dad, Chris Martin, on stage as his band, Coldplay, ran through some of their biggest hits for the headlining gig in February.

Although the children may seem like an unlikely pair, their A-list moms have been friends for years.

“We just kind of hooked up and became really close,” Paltrow said of the “Formation” singer during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in 2010, before she called the entertainer and her husband, Jay Z, “incredible people.”

“They’re very, very kind, generous, good, good people,” she added.

At the 2013 premiere of her HBO documentary Life Is but a Dream, Beyoncé reciprocated the praise, telling E! News that the Iron Man actress is “a great friend on every level.”

Queen Bey also collaborated with Martin, 39, who split from Paltrow in 2014, on Coldplay’s recent single “Hymn for the Weekend.”
