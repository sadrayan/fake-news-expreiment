Irma has been the most powerful ever Atlantic Ocean hurricane, killing 38 people after tearing through the Caribbean and causing widespread devastation.

It was reduced from category five to four as it hit Florida, but its deadly 120mph winds still claimed the lives of 11.

Footage of downtown Miami underwater quickly went viral and now something even more terrifying has surfaced.

The short clip appears to show three menacing-looking fins swimming across a street as water gushes down.

They start to separate from formation before the video comes to an end.

Initially, the chilling sight terrified viewers, with one commenting: “Nope, that is genuinely terrifying.”
