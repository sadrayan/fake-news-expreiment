Request for Voter Registration Applications
Am I Registered to Vote? Can't remember if you've registered in the past? Please feel free to use our Texas Voter Information Website that not only confirms whether you are registered or not, but will even allow you to search for your polling place location prior to an election. The service is easy to use. All you need is a Texas Driver's license to get started. If you know that you have not registered to vote then please use the Informal Online Application service which is displayed to the right. Am I Registered to Vote?



Informal Online Application You may fill out a voter registration application online, print it and mail it to the voter registrar in your county of residence. You are not registered until you have filled out the online application, printed it, and mailed it to your local County Voter Registrar.
