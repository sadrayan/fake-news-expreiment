Firearm aficionados criticized a video posted on Wednesday by USA Today for its portrayal of the Ruger AR-556, the rifle that was reportedly used by the man who killed 26 people at a church in rural Texas on Sunday.

In the brief video, USA Today identified components of the assault-style rifle and its attachments, some of them rare and ineffectual, including what appeared to be a belt-driven chainsaw.

Firearm enthusiasts and media personalities were quick to point out the far-fetched modification, the example of which some have used to fuel stereotypes against the gun industry and gun owners, particularly in the wake of mass shootings.

Some people found humor in the improbability of the attachment with memes.

USA Today replied to its video with the tweet, saying: "To clarify, the video shows both the shooter's modifications, as well as other possible modifications. The shooter did not use a chainsaw bayonet."
