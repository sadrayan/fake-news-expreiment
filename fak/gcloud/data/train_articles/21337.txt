Someone is Lying on the Internet
Random internet videos are as trustworthy as gas station sushi on a summer afternoon. But that doesn’t stop their circulation, especially by those with an agenda- or a conspiracy- to further. Take, for example, the following video that found its way around the internet this week, purporting to show the construction site of a Syrian refugee community in West Virginia:

Wow Unbelievable! Scary, who authorized this? BHO?#NotMe What this guy is saying is frightening, it makes me feel like we've already lost the battle. How long can we hang on to our America.

A few notes for the uninitiated: the more emojis included with the handle of a Twitter user, the less prone said user is to sensibility. The inclusion of multiple gold stars in particular (a nod to the disgraced General Michael Flynn) are a telltale sign of a Q Anon fan. This video checks all the boxes for your garden variety tin-foil hat Q Anon tweet:

Trump Country Setting? Check. Immigrants? Check. Muslims? Check. Righteous indignation over the use of your tax dollars for “those people”? Check. Blue collar American fed up with it all? Check!

And it also has the main characteristic of a Q Anon offering: It is not real. Noted another West Virginian who saw the video:

1) That’s Littlepage Terrace on the West Side of Charleston. It is a 2 min walk from my office.

2)The property has been subsidized housing since the 1940s and still is to this day.

3)There are no Syrians living there. — C.A. Marino™️ (@CA_Marino1) March 6, 2019

4)The “Funeral Home” he points to and says being demolished is actually a Rite Aid. and it’s not being demolished.

5)The project cleaned up the west side and replaced buildings that were an eyesore. Before and after pics of the project -Exact spot where video was filmed. pic.twitter.com/j6TRWz1Z3F — C.A. Marino™️ (@CA_Marino1) March 6, 2019

As a resident of West Virginia, I can assure you that there are few Syrian refugee settlements in my state. In fact, ccording to the most recent available information, a grand total of 7 Syrian refugees have settled in West Virginia- since 2002, and there is no forthcoming influx of “321” Syrians. The WOWK News story he references does not appear to exist. (It is true that in 2016-2017 a local organization was in place to offer resettlement assistance to 30 Syrian refugee families; however, the project was halted due to decisions by the US State Department.)

But then, not much of this man’s rant makes sense: “This will be a sharia Muslim zone and no non-christians will be allowed to walk here. Except Muslims.” (So, it will be a Christian and Muslim zone?) In addition, I can tell you based that man’s accent he is definitely not from West Virginia. He’s a mid-western refugee at best, but I digress. It just makes one wonder what the motive is for the creation of this blatantly false propaganda. Perhaps the true intention is to turn West Virginians against additional cigarette and gas taxes by making them think this is the intended use of those funds.

It’s humorous how silly and easy to debunk this video was, but it is no doubt finding its way to the computers and smartphones of plenty of people all over West Virginia and the rest of the country who will swallow it hook, line, and sinker. It has been “liked” and retweeted over 8000 times as of this writing. It misinforms, fans the flames of resentment and hatred, and deepens the divide. And that’s not funny.
