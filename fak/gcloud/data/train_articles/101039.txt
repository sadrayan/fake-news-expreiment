Description

The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was founded in December 2007 as an umbrella organization for pro-Taliban groups operating mostly in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly North West Frontier Province), Pakistan. It was led, first, by militant commander Baitullah Mehsud and, following his death, by Hakimullah Mehsud. The TTP aims to create a Taliban-style Islamic emirate under Sharia Law, beginning in Pakistan's tribal areas and later extending to include Muslims elsewhere. The TTP strives to untie pro-Taliban groups in FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to assist the Afghan Taliban in their campaign against President Karzai and US/NATO forces in Afghanistan, and to attack Pakistani state, military, and police installations. The TTP has conducted numerous armed, bomb and suicide attacks to achieve its objectives. The TTP has also engaged in criminal activity, such as extortion, theft, robbery and kidnapping for ransom to support its terrorist operations. The TTP maintains links to Al Qaida (AQ), Lashka-e-Jahngvi (LJ) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), all listed terrorist groups under Canada's Criminal Code. Recently, in February 2018, the TPP claimed responsibility for a suicide attack at an army base in northern Pakistan, killing at least 11 soldiers and wounding 13 others.
