Florida recount timeline: How did we get here?
From the moment election results trickled in Tuesday night, it was clear Florida was headed for a nail-biter. However, no one could have imagined the outcome: Three statewide races that are undecided a week later and in the middle of a recount, including the marquee contests for U.S. Senate and governor.

Here's how the events of the last week have unfolded.

Nov. 6. — Election Day

7 p.m.

After a day of extraordinary turnout across Florida, the polls close in most of the state, excluding the Panhandle.

8 p.m.

Polls close in the rest of the state. Early results appear favorable to Democrats in many of the top races — but there's a long way to go.

10:57 p.m.

Democrat Andrew Gillum tells supporters in Tallahassee he called Republican Ron DeSantis to congratulate him for winning the Florida race for governor. DeSantis leads Gillum by 77,377 votes.

11:14 p.m.

DeSantis gives victory speech from Orlando: "There's one day in November where elites don't get to call the shots, don't get to craft the narrative or set the agenda. On election day it's the voice of the people that rules."

Nov. 7 — Too close to call

12:04 a.m.

Republican Rick Scott claims victory in his U.S. Senate race over Democrat Bill Nelson though the Associated Press has not declared him the winner. Scott holds a 57,671-vote advantage over Nelson.

"We can make change," Scott says. "We did it over the last eight years in Tallahassee, we can do it in Washington, D.C."

Nelson campaign manager Pete Mitchell tells a withering Orlando crowd: "This is obviously not the result Senator Nelson's campaign has worked hard for. The senator will be making a full statement tomorrow to thank all those who rallied for his cause."

1:09 a.m.

Nelson campaign releases statement clarifying that the candidate is "waiting for all the votes to be counted."

9:55 a.m.

Floridians wake up to a surprise: The races for governor, U.S. Senate and agriculture commissioner, already close, have tightened considerably.

Having narrowed the gap to 34,435-votes overnight, Nelson trails Scott by just 0.42 percentage points, within the range for a state-mandated machine recount. "We are proceeding to a recount," he says in a statement, which also announces he is hiring veteran recount attorney Marc Elias.

Throughout the day, Broward and Palm Beach counties continues to count ballots, much to the chagrin of Republicans, who see their leads dwindle.

Nov. 8 — What’s happening in Broward?

10 a.m.

Florida's chief election officer, Secretary of State Ken Detzner, tells county elections supervisors to plan for recounts of multiple statewide races. "The recounts will be nationally watched … (we're) under a microscope," Detzner says on a conference call.

10:30 a.m.

With 21,888 votes separating the Senate candidates, Nelson lawyer Elias in a conference call lays out the path to victory: Count all the ballots in South Florida, resolve Broward County undervote problem in a recount, win a majority of provisional ballots.

12:30 p.m.

Protestors, including U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, convene outside the Broward County supervisor of elections office, demanding to know why officials there continue to count ballots two days after the election has ended. At this point, 65 of the 67 Florida counties have finished counting all but provisional and overseas military ballots. The two that have not are Broward and Palm Beach.

Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) November 9, 2018

2:06 p.m.

As Broward and Palm Beach counties tally even more votes, Gillum moves within 0.48 percentage points of DeSantis to force a recount.

Meanwhile, in the race for Agriculture Commissioner, Democrat Nikki Fried takes the lead over Republican Matt Caldwell.

8:27 p.m.

In a late-night press conference at the Governor's Mansion, Scott announces he and the National Republican Senatorial Committee are suing Palm Beach and Broward supervisors of elections to gain access to voting data. He also says he has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate unspecified acts of voter fraud in those counties.

"I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election," Scott says.

Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin responds: "The goal here is to see that all the votes in Florida are counted and counted accurately. Rick Scott's action appears to be politically motivated and borne out of desperation."

Scott leads Nelson by 15,079, DeSantis leads Gillum by 36,219 and Fried leads by 2,896.

Nov. 9 — Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits

10:45 a.m.

Nelson lawyer Elias announces lawsuit against the Florida Secretary of State demanding the state count any mail-in and provisional ballots disqualified because of a signature mismatch.

12:36 p.m.

No, President Trump, they haven't only 'found' votes for Democrats in Florida

Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they “found” many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. “The Broward Effect.” How come they never find Republican votes? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018

1:30 p.m.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement says it is not investigating Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes. FDLE spokeswoman says the Department of State has not received any allegations of voter fraud, and that Scott did not put his request in writing.

3:30 p.m.

Speaking for the first time since the election, Nelson rebuffs Scott criticism of ongoing ballot counting. Scott "isn't telling the truth, which is: votes are not being found; they're being counted," Nelson said.

4:30 p.m.

Circuit Judge Carol-Lisa Phillips says Broward election chief Snipes is in violation of Florida public records laws for not fulfilling a request for information by Scott's campaign. Philips orders the county's elections chief to turn over to Scott's campaign for the U.S. Senate an accounting of total ballots cast and a breakdown of votes by category — all due by 7 p.m. Friday.

Meanwhile, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Krista Marx orders that any ballot that Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher or her staff disqualifies will need to be reviewed by the county's canvassing board. Marx also ordered Bucher to provide a list by 4 p.m. Friday of everyone who voted by provisional ballot.

Later, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida schedules Nelson's lawsuit for Wednesday, Nov. 14.

Caldwell also filed a lawsuit in Broward County to determine if Snipes "illegally included ballots after polls closed" Nov. 6. His campaign also files a public records request for vote counts and emails among Snipes, her team and any third parties regarding ballot counting.

Nov. 10 — Recount!

10 a.m.

Election monitors from the Florida Department of Elections stationed in Broward County have seen no evidence of criminal activity in the administration of Tuesday's election, a DOE staffer tells the Miami Herald early Saturday.

This information, presented just hours before elections departments across the state must provide unofficial final results, contradicts allegations of fraud in the Broward elections office made by Scott's attorneys Thursday and echoed by Republican protesters who descended on the headquarters of the Broward elections office Friday.

12 p.m.

All 67 counties report unofficial election results to the Secretary of State.

1:50 p.m.

Secretary of State Ken Detzner orders statewide machine recount of over 8.2 million ballots in races for U.S. Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner.

DeSantis is leading Gillum in the race for governor by 0.41 percent (33,684 votes), Scott is leading Nelson in the Senate race by 0.15 percent (12,562), and Fried is leading Caldwell in the agriculture commissioner race by 0.18 percent (5,326 votes).

Three state legislative races are also headed to recount, including a Tampa Senate contest between House Minority Leader Janet Cruz and incumbent Republican Dana Young. Cruz leads by nearly 300 votes.

3 p.m.

Gillum retracts concession. "I say this recognizing that my fate in this may or may not change."

I am replacing my earlier concession with an unapologetic and uncompromised call to count every vote. — Andrew Gillum (@AndrewGillum) November 10, 2018

Nov. 11 — It begins

7 a.m.

Broward County's woes continue on its first day of recount as a series of technical glitches delay for hours the scheduled recount of more than 700,000 ballots cast in the midterm election.

The recount, scheduled to begin at 7 a.m., finally got away — sort of — at 11:23. But officials said no actual counting would begin for hours and possibly days.

Twenty-two improperly cast ballots, considered void due to mismatched signatures and other violations, were included Saturday in the final vote totals submitted by Broward County to the Florida Secretary of State's office.

Nov. 12 —The counting, and lawsuits, continue

11:30 a.m.

Nelson sues the Florida Department of State in an effort to count vote-by-mail ballots that were postmarked before Election Day but not delivered before polls closed.

Nelson's attorney, Marc Elias says voters should not be disenfranchised because of mail delivery delays that aren't their fault. As an example, he cites the Miami-Dade County postal facility that was evacuated because explosive devices sent to prominent Democrats were processed there.

"Florida's 7 p.m. Election Day receipt deadline for vote by mail ballots burdens the right to vote of eligible voters," the suit said.

12:54 p.m.

Nelson calls on Scott to recuse himself from recount. Meanwhile, the League of Women Voters and Common Cause sue to force Scott to do just that.

2 p.m.

Broward County Circuit Judge Jack Tuter turns down Scott's request to "impound and secure" all voting machines in Broward's elections headquarters when they're not being used to recount ballots.

But he offers a compromise: Add three Broward Sheriff's deputies to the current lineup of BSO officers and private security guards overseeing the recount under way at the county's election's center in Lauderhill.

Tuter says he saw no sign of wrongdoing in Broward vote counting and also warns the lawyers for all the candidates engaged in recounts to tone down their political attacks.

The supervisor of elections in Bay County, where Hurricane Michael hit the hardest, acknowledges his office violated orders from Scott and allowed people to vote by fax and email.

5 p.m.

Nelson lawyer Elias says counties should not be forced to finish machine recount by Nov. 15, the date state law mandates counties report second unofficial results to the state. Several counties, including Palm Beach, have expressed they are unlikely to complete the recount by the deadline. Is this the next legal challenge?

10:58 a.m.

After multiple machine issues over several days, Broward County finally begins to recount ballots in the U.S. Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner races.
