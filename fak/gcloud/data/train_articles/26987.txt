BREAKING: Fox News Just Fired Their Most Controversial Anchor
Many hosts from different televisions go live and bash our President for no reason and are twisting every word that comes out from his mouth.

Fox News had enough this time. Finally they decided to let go one person who spoke against the President for many times. Shep Smith is out of the game ladies and gentlemen.

According to few reports, the head of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch told that due to the enormous disrespect towards the President, Shep is going to go out of this network. This is why you should never mix your personal life with your business life. He said:

“Shep has shown that he’s not the kind of anchor suitable for the Fox News audience. While we respect his right to have a liberal opinion and his right to choose his sexual orientation, our viewers don’t need to be exposed to it. Maybe Shep can go work for MSNBC and get a show with Rachel Maddow.”

Regarding the fact that Shep had another three months contract Fox decided that this is for the best of their own network. There is no information who will fill for him but it was about time steps like this to happen.
