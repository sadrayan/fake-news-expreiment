Wendy Davis or Ted Cruz for DMN Texan of the Year?
EDITOR’S NOTE: The poll is now shut down, and we’ve posted the results at the bottom. Thanks to those of you who participated.

One longtime editor at this newspaper left me a phone message. He said something like:

“I’m telling you this now, because I know you’re going to be bugging me later. Texan of the Year for 2013: Ted Cruz, without question.”

Cruz, without question. Is that right?

Figure, Cruz hasn’t even completed his first nine months in the Senate and already is established as a must quote representing the right wing of the GOP. He’s been courting Iowa voters already despite being a raw novice in elected politics.

Doesn’t Cruz fit the bill as political phenom? I think the right wing of our readership would root for him.

The left wing? They’ve got Wendy Davis.

In head-to-head competition, though, I’d say Cruz measures up more as a consequential figure. He actually is on the big stage and already has emerged as an impact player.

Davis has delighted Texas’ long-suffering left with her filibuster that temporarily delayed an anti-abortion bill. She’s got Democrats very excited, but her impact is more about raising expectations at this point. Is that right?

Which one makes more sense as the Dallas Morning News Texan of the Year? Or does either?

Here’s what more than 21,000 readers said in their responses:

Ted Cruz: 11,352 (54 percent)

Wendy Davis: 9,015 (43 percent)

Other: 711 (3 percent)
