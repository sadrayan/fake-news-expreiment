A Healthier Way to Flavor
Senomyx discovers novel natural high intensity sweeteners and flavor ingredients that boost taste sensations such as sweet. Our flavor ingredients help food and beverage companies create or reformulate better-for-you products, for example, by allowing them to significantly reduce the use of traditional, higher-calorie sweeteners, while maintaining the same taste. We also develop savory flavors, bitter taste blockers and cooling agents. Our products are used by many of the worldâ€™s leading food and beverage companies.
