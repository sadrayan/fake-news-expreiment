UPS FedEx Shipping
Solutions for Business When you compare shipping rates, you'll see differences among the carriers. One might charge you dimensional weight while another carrier won't. Dimensional weight is a calculated based on the size of the box rather than the actual weight. This occurs with large, light packages. The professionals at PostalAnnex help you pick the right box to avoid dimensional weight when possible, all without sacrificing protection of your valuables.
