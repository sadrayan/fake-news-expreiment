Highlights From PISA 2009: Performance of U.S. 15-Year-Old Students in Reading, Mathematics, and Science Literacy in an International Context
Description:

This report provides international comparisons of average performance in reading literacy and three reading literacy subscales and in mathematics literacy and science literacy. It includes the percentages of students reaching PISA proficiency levels, for the United States and the OECD countries on average, and trends in U.S. performance over time. It also reports average scores by gender for the United States and other countries and by student race/ethnicity and school socioeconomic contexts within the United States. Supplemental tables on the NCES website include additional data from PISA 2009, including the percentages of students in all PISA countries reaching the PISA proficiency levels and information on trends in performance around the world in reading, mathematics, and science literacy.



After the initial release of the NCES PISA 2009 U.S. national report and supplemental tables, some minor changes were made to the report text and to the supplemental tables. View the errata notice for more detail.
