Blackburn Issues Statement on the $1.3 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill
WASHINGTON - We have Republicans in the House, the Senate, and the White House. It's time we start to show some fiscal restraint. Our national debt is growing out of control, and we can't continue to pass these massive spending bills and expect future generations to deal with our negligence.

I voted “no” for the 1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill, because Washington has a spending problem, and we cannot continue to kick this can down the road. Our deficits are increasing, and our debt is at an unsustainable level. We cannot continue to max out our nation’s credit card and expect future generations to deal with the consequences.

We have a moral obligation to enact real spending reform. There are government programs in that 2,200 page spending bill that you may not even know exist, and you should not be on the hook to fund them all.
