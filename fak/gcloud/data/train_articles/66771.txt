Texas student groups' graduation rates outpace peers
AUSTIN – According to the latest figures released by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics, the Class of 2013 high school graduation rate for Texas African-American and Hispanic students topped that of similar students groups across the country.



In addition, various student groups in Texas – including White, Asian, Economically Disadvantaged and students with disabilities – rank in the top five nationally in national Class of 2013 graduation rate comparisons.



“Across the board, student groups in the Texas Class of 2013 easily outpaced the national graduation rate of their counterparts in other states,” said Commissioner of Education Michael Williams. “The Class of 2013 comparisons confirm Texas as a national education leader committed to helping every student earn a high school diploma and that bodes well for our state’s economic future.”

Last month, numbers compiled by National Center for Education Statistics showed the Texas Class of 2013 set a high school graduation rate of 88.0 percent, topping the national average of 81.4 percent. The Texas graduation rate hit 88.0 percent for the second consecutive year, tying Wisconsin for the nation’s third highest. Only Iowa at 89.7 percent and Nebraska at 88.5 percent posted higher graduation rates for the Class of 2013.



Note that NCES updated its Class of 2013 data (now including percentages to the first decimal point) which has adjusted Texas’ overall national ranking to third. Figures released earlier this year had initially indicated Texas ranked second tied with four other states for the Class of 2013.



The National Center for Education Statistics is the primary federal entity for collecting, analyzing and reporting data related to education in the United States and other nations. Since 2010, states, districts and schools have used a common metric – the adjusted cohort graduation rate – in reporting graduation rates to the federal government. Use of the adjusted cohort graduation rate allows for an accurate and uniform comparison between the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
