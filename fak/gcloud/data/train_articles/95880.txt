Snapshot of Presidential Candidate Social Networking Stats: Nov 3, 2008
Tomorrow is the big day, so let’s take a snapshot of the social media campaign results, it took me a few minutes to dive into their profiles and grab numbers. Here’s what I found:

Internet Usage in United States

Obama: @barackobama has 112,474 followers

McCain: @JohnMcCain (is it real?) 4,603 followers Obama has 240 times more followers in Twitter than McCain Community Platforms/Branded Social Networks

MyBarackObama: I was unable to find total number of registered members (anyone have data?)

McCain Space: I was unable to find total number of registered members (anyone have data?)

Interesting that the ratios between MySpace and Facebook are the same, Youtube nearly the same. I was not able to find data on LinkedIn, they don’t make it easy to find ‘connections’ numbers.

It’s clear that Obama is dominating the social media activity, this could because of two reasons: 1) Obama campaign moved quicker to social networking and soical media, McCain only recently launched his own social network with KickApps. 2) The Social Technographics (behaviors to adopt social media) skew heavier towards demographics, yet these percentages are far greater than the margins shown in technographics.

I’ll link to any other social media campaign analysis, leave a link below –later, if I get time, I’ll try to do a summary.
