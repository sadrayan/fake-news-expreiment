Bush Sees Oil Glut Undermining U.s.

Bush earlier called cheap oil ``a two-edged sword for America.`` Despite White House insistence on free-market pricing, Bush said the U.S. is worried about the collapse of oil prices and considers its effect on the domestic oil market a threat to national security.

DHAHRAN, SAUDI ARABIA â€” Vice President George Bush and Saudi King Fahd said Sunday the world needs stable oil prices but, during a midnight session in the king`s chromed and carpeted palace, there was no agreement on how to achieve them or at what price.

Bush told the king of his concern during their three-hour formal meeting, and a senior administration official said the vice president ``made it clear that Saudi interests and United States interests are not identical in oil pricing.``

Bush`s visit here has been focused on oil because of the startled reaction of the world oil market last week, when Bush said he would plead with King Fahd for more stability in oil production and pricing.

The meeting, attended by Saudi princes and government ministers, came a day after Bush met with petroleum minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani at the American ambassador`s residence in Riyadh, the capital.

No dollar figures were cited during the meeting with the king, the senior administration official told reporters, but the talk was more specific during the meeting with Yamani.

The discussion with the king ranged from the stalled Middle East peace process to the threat of a spillover of fighting in the Iran-Iraq war. When the leaders left the meeting shortly after 1 a.m., both looked cheery, and Bush described it as ``most informative and hospitable.``

Later, one of the vice president`s aides characterized the talks as a

``very open exchange of views, very frankly put on both sides, outlining each of our positions.`` He also said that ``the king felt Saudi Arabia, in nonroyal terms, was given a bum rap in stories about Saudi Arabia`s role in the oil situation.``

This desert kingdom has increased oil production to more than 4 million barrels a day, up from only 2 million a day last summer. Oil analysts believe it is an effort to drive out or weaken many of the non-OPEC producers and to discipline fellow OPEC members who violated production quotas and price agreements.

For its part, a Saudi official said privately, the kingdom believes it has been carrying other members of OPEC for too long, lowering its own production from a high of 10 million barrels a day a decade ago.

Earlier, Bush told a group of American businessmen in Riyadh: ``We have a problem, and the world has a problem. . . . This problem of free fall . . . we don`t have a simple and easy answer to it, frankly.``

Bush`s message was that lower oil prices are a boon to many sectors of the American economy, but not to all of them.
