OneVoice International
We depend on donors like you to support our vital work to empower everyday Israelis and Palestinians to make the two-state solution a reality – showing them that peace is indeed possible and within reach. In furtherance of its mission, OneVoice conducts and supports charitable, educational, and advocacy-based projects and activities. The Movement is supported by PeaceWorks Foundation, a Section 501(c)(3) charitable organization, PeaceWorks Action, Inc., a Section 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and other individuals, charitable institutions, and advocacy organizations across the globe. Together with your important financial support, we are able to give our Youth Leaders the tools to take action and create a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.

The payment dropdown tabs to the right provide you with the option to donate to either the PeaceWorks Foundation or PeaceWorks Action, Inc. Please note that while contributions to the PeaceWorks Foundation are tax deductible, those to PeaceWorks Action, Inc. are not.

Whether you are donating to the PeaceWorks Foundation or PeaceWorks Action, Inc., know that your contributions are the important difference between the current toxic status quo and a proud Israel standing side-by-side in peace and security with a Palestinian state.
