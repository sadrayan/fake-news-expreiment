RACINE- The Racine County sheriff's department is trying to find out how election related documents ended up in a dumpster.



The sheriff's department confirms they are investigating possible voting irregularities at the Cesar Chavez Community Center.

They told TODAY'S TMJ4 they are looking into whether voter registration documents were tossed into a dumpster on election day.



The mayor was also at that polling station election day, asking officials how election day was running.



But now there are questions about possible voter irregularities at this polling station.



The votes are tallied, and John Lehman won Senate District 21 by more than 800 votes, but this race is far from over.



While Van Wanggaard has remained silent since election night, his campaign spokesperson says they are considering a recount because of rumored voter fraud.



The Racine County sheriff's department sent a statement saying



"The district attorney requested that the sheriff's office contact individuals who were alleging that voting irregularities had occurred at the Dr. John Bryant Center."



They went on to say they are looking into, "suspicious voter registration documents from the dumpster"



The conservative group the MacIver Institute is reporting that, "multiple voter registration forms were discovered, including mostly-blank forms that had been pre-certified by an election official."



The city clerk says they have the same number of registration forms as number voters.



Neither John Lehman or Van Wanggaard would comment on the ongoing investigation.

Wanggaard has until Friday evening to decide if he's going to request a recount.
