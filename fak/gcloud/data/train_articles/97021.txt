Europe has opened its doors but EU trade partners concessions before making investments in South Africa. Of these, the most important thing is that Germany will not invest in South Africa, as long as the discrimination of a BEE (Black Economic Empowerment) has not been scraped.

Political observers and businessmen in South Africa placed the damned outcome of the negotiations at the feet of the ANC government. The German delegation was serious about looking at South Africa as an investment opportunity, but stated unequivocally that they wanted concessions, which included that BEE was unacceptable.

Observers point out that German businessmen prefer to decide who they are employing and why they will not tolerate any unlawful favor of blacks.

Cyril Ramaphosa was in Brussels last week where he persuaded businessmen and political leaders to visit his country, but now it seems that they are not interested in his country as long as discriminatory measures are in place.
