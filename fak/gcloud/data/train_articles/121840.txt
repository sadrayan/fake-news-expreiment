On Thursday, nearly 90 honor students at Lexington Middle School were sent home with a homework assignment that parents called inappropriate.

"It's kind of shocking that that's the kind of topics they're teaching" said parent Elaine Miller.

The questions featured algebra equations followed by multiple choice questions about Maya Angelou.

One of the questions said, "Trying to support her son as a single mother, she (Angelou) worked as a pimp, prostitute, and blank."

Parents said their students are not even studying Angelou.

"I'm kind of concerned now. What's going on in schools?" asked Miller.

The school district issued an apology to the parents and students said it would not happen again. The worksheet came from an external teacher resource website, which is a common tool used by the district, however, it was not vetted carefully by the teacher.

As for the co-mingling of math and language arts, the district said this has been done for years to help with reading comprehension.
