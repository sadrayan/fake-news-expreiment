Sanders Trolls Hillary by Releasing Transcripts of All of His Wall Street Speeches
Last night, Hillary Clinton said she would release the transcripts of her Goldman Sachs speeches when the other candidates do the same. A town hall voter confronted her about why she can’t just get it over with.

Clinton said, “I am happy to release anything I have when everybody else does the same, because every other candidate in this race has given speeches to private groups, including Senator Sanders.”

Well, in response, the Sanders campaign put out a press release with the transcripts of all the Wall Street speeches he’s given. That’s right, all zero of them:

Sen. Sanders accepts Clinton’s challenge. He will release all of the transcripts of all of his Wall Street speeches. That’s easy. The fact is, there weren’t any. Bernie gave no speeches to Wall Street firms. He wasn’t paid anything while Secretary Clinton made millions, including $675,000 for three paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.

Last night, the Sanders campaign tweeted out a link to an “I Will Look Into It” countdown clock for Clinton, along with this:

Don't worry. The $500 payout was given to charity. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 19, 2016
