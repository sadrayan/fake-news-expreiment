THE murder rate of women increased by 117% between 2015 and 2016/17. In a report by Statistics South Africa following research looking into issues of violence against women, it was noted that the number of women who experienced sexual offences jumped from 31665 in 2015/16 to 70813 in 2016/17, an increase of 53%.

The 2016/17 Victims of Crime report revealed that 250 in 100000 women were victims of sexual offence compared with 120 in 100000 men.

“The 2016/17 SAPS statistics noted 80% of the reported sexual offences were rape.

“Stats SA’s estimates that 68.5% of the victims were women, we obtained a crude estimate of the number of women raped per 100000 as 138. This figure is among the highest in the world. For this reason, some have labelled South Africa the ‘rape capital of the world’,” the report stated.

The report revealed that 3.8% of black men thought it was acceptable to hit a woman, followed by 1.5% of coloured men, 1.4% of white men and 1% of Indian men. - Virgilatte Gwangwa
