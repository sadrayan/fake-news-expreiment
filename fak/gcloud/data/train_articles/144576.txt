The Whitman, 21 East 26th Street, NYC - Condo Apartments
There are currently no apartments available

The Whitman is a six-story building at 21 East 26th Street across from Madison Square Park that was converted to four large condominium apartments in 2013 by David Mitchell of Mitchell Holdings LLC.

The very handsome building, which extends through the block to 27th Street, was erected in 1924 and was a former showroom building. Mitchell Holdings acquired it in 2011 from Plumbersâ€™ Local 1 for about $13 million.

Jeffrey Cole was the architect for the conversion.
