Civil War Erupts In Sweden as Irate Swedes Burn Nine Muslim Refugee Centers to the Ground
Refugee centers in Sweden are being burned to the ground in what appears to be a statement against the significant number of refugees the country has allowed in. The multiple arsons have all been at facilities which house or are slated to house immigrants.

One could say that someone in Sweden is mad as hell and bringing fire and brimstone to the facilities that are to be used for refugees. Seven arson fires have occurred, all of which seem to be connected with immigrant centers.



Sweden has taken in more refugees than any other European country in proportion to its population. With 100,000 “asylum seekers” already in the country this year and another 90,000 thought to be arriving before the end of the year, the citizens of Sweden may not be as welcoming as they once were.
