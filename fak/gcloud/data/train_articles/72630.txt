CBO: Millions Would Pay More for Less Under House GOP Health Plan
Along with reducing health coverage by 24 million, as we wrote earlier today, the House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would make coverage less available and less affordable for virtually all age and income groups — causing uninsured rates to rise for young, middle-age, and older Americans with incomes both below and above 200 percent of the federal poverty line — the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found.

While dismissing CBO’s analysis, Republicans have pointed to one of its numbers: that average individual market premiums will fall by 10 percent by 2026. In doing so, they apparently misunderstood what the report says would happen to the individual market and to low- and moderate-income people, most of whom would pay more in premiums for skimpier health insurance that charges substantially higher deductibles and co-payments.
