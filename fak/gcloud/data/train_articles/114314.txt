Synopsis

Although part of England's empire, Montserrat was settled largely by Irish emigrants, and provides an opportunity to view the interaction of Irish emigrants with English imperialism in a situation in which the Irish were not a small minority among white settlers. Within this context, this book explores whether the "Irish" imperialism on Montserrat differed from English imperialism in other colonies. The author argues that, despite the long history of oppression in Ireland, the Irish proved to be as effective and as unfeeling colonists as the English and the Scottish. He dismisses as a myth the "nice" Irish slave holder, challenges the view that indentured labour prevailed in West Indies in the 17th century, and argues that the long-held habit of ignoring ethnic strife within the white ruling classes in the West Indies is misconceived.
