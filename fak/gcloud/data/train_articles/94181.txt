GovTrack data was used in the production of these scores.

Notes:

Data on which Bipartisan Index lifetime scores are based begins with the 103rd Congress (1993-1994). Consequently, Senate service before 1993 does not factor into a Senator’s lifetime score.

Lifetime scores are the average of a Senator’s Bipartisan Index scores for each Congress in which they served for at least 10 months.

Senators do not receive a score for Congresses in which they served fewer than 10 months.

Beginning in the 113th Congress (2013-2014), the scores of Senators who sponsored fewer than 3 bills are excluded (applies only to Jeff Sessions).

The scores of the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader in each Congress are excluded because their roles in the legislative process impose on them different sponsorship and co-sponsorship practices than other members. But Senators who have served as Majority and/or Minority Leader are scored on Congresses in which they did not serve in one of those leadership roles.

If a Senator served as Majority Leader and/or Minority Leader for less than half a Congress, his/her score from that Congress is counted in the lifetime score (applies only to Trent Lott in the 104th Congress).

Senators who switched parties during a Congress are scored as a member of the party to which they belonged the longest during that Congress.
