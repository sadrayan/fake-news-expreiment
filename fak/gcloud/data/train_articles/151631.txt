Jussie Smollett Timeline: Judge Unseals Case File
Updated May 23, 2019

On Thursday, Judge Steven G. Watkins of the Circuit Court of Cook County unsealed the “Empire” star Jussie Smollett’s court records after media organizations including The New York Times requested the action, citing a need for more transparency.

The decision could allow public access to documents from the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office that could shed light on why the office dropped all charges against Mr. Smollett in March.

A lawyer for Mr. Smollett, Brian Watson, argued at a hearing last week that the media had plenty of access to Mr. Smollett’s case and that unsealing it would violate his rights.

Here’s a timeline of how we got here.

Jan. 29: Mr. Smollett, who is black and gay, tells the police that at about 1:30 a.m., two masked men he believed to be white attacked him on the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in downtown Chicago. The assailants, according to Mr. Smollett, hurled homophobic and racial slurs at him, put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him.
