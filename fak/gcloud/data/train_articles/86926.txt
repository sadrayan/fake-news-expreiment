Sexual Assault Exam

Reimbursement Guidelines

On November 9, 2001, the OAG published guidelines concerning submission of requests for reimbursements by law enforcement agencies pursuant to Article 56.06 (a) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. The OAG has since formalized the guidelines by promulgation of administrative rules governing these reimbursements; the rules were adopted on July 30, 2002.

Reimbursement of reasonable costs is based on the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission Medical Fee Guidelines. The services and maximum reimbursement rates are listed in the new administrative rule.

For maximum reimbursement, submit itemized bills with individual charges listed for each service rendered. The maximum aggregate amount for which the OAG will reimburse a law enforcement agency for all costs associated with a forensic sexual assault examination of a victim will be $700.00.
