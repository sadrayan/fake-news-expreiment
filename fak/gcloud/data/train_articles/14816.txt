The Great Displacement: Mayoral Forum!
The next mayor of Chicago has an historic opportunity to make Chicago a sanctuary city for all working class, Black, and Latinx families at a time when disinvestment is pushing hundreds of thousands of African-Americans out of Chicago and squeezing working-class Latinx and white communities ever tighter.

Come hear from leading mayoral candidates on how they will stop the pushout of working people and build a Chicago for the many, not the few.

Sponsors (in formation): Action Now, Chicago Teachers Union, Grassroots Illinois Action, National Association of Letter Carriers Branch 11, People United for Action, SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana, UE Western Region, United Working Families.

Candidate invitations will be based on viability (measured by polling) and grassroots support (measured by an online vote).
