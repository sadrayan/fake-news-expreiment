Kellogg’s Now Adding Traces of Peanut Flour Across Product Lines
As we predicted, Kellogg’s is now intentionally adding traces of peanut flour to other products beyond their Keebler and Austin Cracker lines.

Here is the nutritional panel for Kellogg’s Nutrigrain Apple Cobbler Fruit Crunch Bars as they are now listed on the Kellogg’s website:



Note that peanut flour is the last ingredient listed, meaning only a trace amount of the allergen has been added – too little to provide a functional application for doing so such as enhancing the nutritional content or taste. This lends credence to the assertion that the company is taking this action to avoid complying with new directives of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) that go into effect in September.

To date, the company has issued no press release explaining their decision to add minute quantities of peanut flour, but we can only surmise that we are in the early stage of a plan to add traces of allergens across much of their product line to avoid the complications of complying with the FSMA that were intended to make foods safer for the allergic community, not the opposite.

We urge you to take action by signing the petition to Kellogg’s, reading our Media Briefing on the issue, and becoming the local champion for this cause by contacting your local media.
