California Must Complete the State Water Project

For the past three years, Jerry Brown and the California Democrats have been more interested in telling Californians how to kill their lawns, cut their showers, and fine their neighbors than actually fixing our broken water system in California. Their negligence directly caused the failure of Oroville Dam and the evacuation of 188,000 Californians, not to mention the wasting of all of the water conserved by Californians statewide between 2014 and 2017. California still has not spent $1 of the $7 Billion Water Bond issued in 2014 on water storage. California has more than enough water for the entire state, including the enormously productive Central Valley that has lacked water for years, and Southern California. Completing the State Water Project will preserve the Delta, and will supply Californians with abundant water through our inevitable droughts and floods.
