What We Do CHIR faculty and staff study health insurance underwriting, marketing and products, as well as the complex and developing relationship between state and federal rules governing the health insurance marketplace. CHIR provides policy expertise and technical assistance to federal and state policymakers, regulators and stakeholders seeking a reformed and sustainable insurance marketplace in which all consumers have access to affordable and adequate coverage.
