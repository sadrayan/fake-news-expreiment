NV Dems Chair: Donald Trump Would Be an Unmitigated Disaster for Nevada’s Economy
Las Vegas, NV – A new report this week from Moody’s Analytics – written by a former adviser to Republican U.S. Senator John McCain – found that Donald Trump’s irresponsible economic proposals would lead to a “lengthy recession” and destroy 3.5 million American jobs.

Nevada State Democratic Party Chair Roberta Lange released the following statement after Hillary Clinton’s economic speech earlier today:

“While our economy is rebounding and creating new jobs, too many Nevadans are working harder than ever but still struggling to get ahead and stay ahead. Hillary Clinton understands that. Her commitment to raising the minimum wage, making college debt-free, ensuring paid family leave and supporting union workers will strengthen families and lift up communities across our state.

“By contrast, Donald Trump would be an unmitigated disaster for Nevada’s economy if he ever gets elected to the White House. He would explode the federal debt. He would enact huge tax cuts for the rich. He would strip away Wall Street reforms. He wants to build a wall of hate instead of rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure or fixing our broken immigration system. He’s fighting the efforts of workers to get a fair union contract at his own hotel in Las Vegas. He says “wages are too high” and has literally no plans to make higher education more affordable.

“So far, Trump’s campaign for President looks a lot like his failed career in business: he enriches himself while ripping off the American people.”
