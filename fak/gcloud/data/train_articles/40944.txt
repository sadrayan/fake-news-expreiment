Building an Effective Approach to Terrorism Prevention
The National Security Strategy of the United States (December 2017) highlighted the need for U.S. intelligence and homeland security experts to work with law enforcement and civic leaders on terrorism prevention. The National Strategy for Counterterrorism (October 2018) further stated that terrorism prevention must be an integral part of our counterterrorism strategy. Given the administrationâ€™s prioritization of terrorism prevention, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducted a comprehensive review of its terrorism prevention programs, both internally and with the assistance of an external review by the RAND Corporation.

Elizabeth Neumann, Assistant Secretary for Threat Prevention and Security Policy, will present the findings of the RAND report, followed by a discussion on how DHS is building an effective approach to terrorism prevention.
