Research Interests

Wayne Lee specializes in early modern military history, with a particular focus on North America and the Atlantic World, but he teaches military history from a full global perspective at the undergraduate and graduate level. He also teaches courses on violence as well as on the early English exploration of the Atlantic. As a kind of additional career, he works with archaeology projects, and recently published his work (listed below) from a project in the mountains of northern Albania. He is now working on a new project in southern Greece. For more details on Professor Lee’s research see the link to his web page below.
