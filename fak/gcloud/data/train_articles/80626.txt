This Week by Joe Kyrillos

Hello Friends –

Recently, I signed on to a lawsuit to repeal ObamaCare. It’s remarkable. Regardless of township or region of the state I travel to, there is overwhelming outrage over the passage of ObamaCare.

The fears are unanimous. ObamaCare is too expensive. It is a government takeover of our healthcare system. Services will be diminished. The patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated. It will not make healthcare more affordable. And it will bankrupt small businesses.

In fact, the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office just released a study that said ObamaCare will not cost $900 Billion, but instead will cost Americans $1.76 Trillion!



It’s simple. We must repeal ObamaCare. Not only because it doesn’t improve our healthcare system, but also because it is bad for our economy.

Thank you for all you do and I will talk with you soon.
