Bryan:

I am back at this fact check. Which specific West Texas cities/towns was Miller thinking of when he said they’re currently having to truck in water?

Thanks.

According to TCEQ, over the past few years there have been several Texas public water system that were forced to haul potable water to their communities due to persistent drought conditions. Below is a list of those communities and I understand staff at TCEQ believe there could be other systems that hauled water that did not notify TCEQ.

· LCRA Spicewood Beach WSC

· Laurel Canyon Ranch Water System

· Twin Buttes Water System

· 620 Oaks Office Park

· Oak Trail Shores

· Berry Oaks Water Company

· Barton Creek Lakeside

· SJWTX North Point Subdivision

· Barnhart WSC

· Cooley Point

· Saddleridge Subdivision

Recent rainfall has provided temporary relief to some in the Lone Star State. However, it is not enough to break the ongoing drought. More than half of Texas is still suffering from drought conditions. It’s critical for all Texans take a look at their water use habits and find common-sense ways to conserve.

I hope this helps your research. Take care.
