Tyson Foods: Labor Day at Tyson Foods
Labor Day at Tyson Foods



Tyson Foods observes Labor Day as a paid holiday for all team members. For a brief period in 2008, we agreed in a labor union negotiation for one plant in Tennessee to change the date Labor Day was observed to accommodate some of our team members. We immediately renegotiated with the union to revert to the original Labor Day observance.





Sadly, a decision that was reversed after a few weeks in 2008 still circulates on the Internet as if it were current – but it’s not. Tyson Foods proudly celebrates our nation’s workforce on Labor Day as a paid holiday for all team members. We also celebrate our nation’s military on Memorial Day as a paid holiday for all team members. We honor all who defend and work in our great country.
