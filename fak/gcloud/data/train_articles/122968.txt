For an American, 6 Olympics and 6 Medals
Kim Rhode of the United States won the bronze medal in women’s skeet, joining the Italian luger Armin Zöggeler as the only athletes who have earned an individual medal in six straight Olympics.

“Every emotion hits you at once,” said Rhode, who plans to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Games. “You want to run, scream, cry, and you just don’t know which one to do first. It doesn’t matter if it’s the gold, silver or the bronze.”

Diana Bacosi hit 15 of 16 targets in the gold medal match to defeat her Italian teammate Chiara Cainero. But Rhode was the center of attention as she wrapped up a record that started with her double trap gold medal as a precocious 17-year-old at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Rhode then earned bronze in Sydney, gold in Athens, silver in Beijing and gold in London.
