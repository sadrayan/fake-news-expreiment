The Source: Anti-Discrimination Ordinance | Prostate Cancer
In the first segment:

With the historic Supreme Court rulings favoring the gay community last week, we take a look at the San Antonio anti-discrimination ordinance proposed by District 1 Councilman Diego Bernal.

The ordinance would update the city code to include additional protections for sexual orientation, gender identity and veteran status. Bernal joins us in the studio to talk about the ordinance.

In the second segment:

Men continue to get treatment, radiation and surgery for prostate cancers that don't threaten their lives. The incidence of over treatment has gone up according to a study in the Journal of American Medical Association published last week.

Dr. Ian Thompson, director of the Cancer Therapy and Research Center at the UT Health Science Center joins us to talk about UTHSC's efforts to monitor the disease.
