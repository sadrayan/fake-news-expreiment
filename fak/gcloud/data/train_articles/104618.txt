Rosie O'Donnell Violates Federal Law, Offers To Bribe Republican Senators To Vote Against Tax Bill
Late on Tuesday evening, as Republicans moved to pass a historic tax reform package, Rosie O’Donnell — nemesis of Donald Trump and former television star — tweeted out offers of bribery to Republican senators to vote down the bill. She didn’t just do it once. She did it over and over again:

Rosie may have hit the hooch last night, if her other tweets are any indicator:

Rachel Meadow would certainly not be pleased.

Bribery is illegal under federal law. Here’s the relevant portion of 18 USC §201(b):

So Rosie actually broke the law with the tweet itself. Attorney General Sessions, get cracking!
