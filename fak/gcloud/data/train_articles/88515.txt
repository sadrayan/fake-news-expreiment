Democrats have been walking a fine line of publicly opposing super PACs while privately acting as boosters of the group. Reid and Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) have all attended Majority PAC fundraisers in New York, Chicago, Phoenix and other cities.

Overall, the super PAC raised $2.4 million in July, receiving $1 million from the building trade unions super PAC Working for Americans. Blum Capital Partnerâ€™s Richard Blum contributed $200,000, and Zumiez Chairman Thomas Campion and William Little, Jr. both contributed $100,000. Lobbying firm Elmendorf Strategies also pitched in $10,000.

Majority PAC spent $2.7 million on independent expenditures in July, opposing Republican candidates Richard Mourdock in Indiana, John Brunner of Missouri, former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson and Rep. Richard Berg of North Dakota. The group also made expenditures opposing Republican candidates Josh Mandel of Ohio, Eric Hovde of Wisconsin and and former Sen. George Allen (Va.).
