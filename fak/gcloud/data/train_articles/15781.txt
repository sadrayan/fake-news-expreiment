Thank you for allowing Dr. Brad Zehner at St. Edward’s University the time he needed to review the files from the study so he could accurately answer your questions. Please find the answers you requested attached. Regarding your question about any update to the study, the Texas Association of Business analyzed additional published research, case studies and media coverage in an effort to provide an up-to-date representation of legislation and economic impacts. Our Supplemental Research can be found on pages 16-18. I have also attached our one-page summary of the economic impact for your information. It has been updated to reflect the projected economic impact of the 2018 NCAA Men’s Final Four recently released by the City of San Antonio. Please feel free to call me at (512) 270-9358 if you have any additional questions.

Best regards, Belinda

Questions below:

1. Double-checking: Study 1 was completed in October 2015?

2. Was there a pre-2017 update of any kind?

3. Which professor or professors supervised the graduate students doing the fiscal part of Study 1?

4. Was the fiscal impact estimates part of Study 1 launched using a conventional methodology? If so, what’s the best way to describe the approach?

5. Is it correct the cited impacts were drawn from research or warnings in three states where at this time the described mandates don’t exist?

6. Per the methodology for the fiscal part of Study 1, could you unpack this a bit: “The research team used a direct percentage comparison to guide conclusions; in the event that no equivalent measures existed, the team used a ‘breaking’ factor of 3 percent, applied to either growth or overall value. This figure was deemed conservative since the LGBT population of Texas is estimated at approximately 3.3 percent of all residents.” Specifically, what’s a “breaking factor?” Why would the share of the population estimated as LGBT relate to a growth rate?

7. Why did the report present three-year projections?

8. In “Data Extrapolation: Arizona,” what led the researchers to reach the figures $464 million and $964 million? Does either figure presume the Super Bowl not occurring in Houston in 2017?

9. In the same section, what was the basis of the 12,000 jobs figure? Was the same formula employed to reach the report’s other job loss estimates? If not, how were those job loss estimates reached?

10. For the impacts bulleted in the Indiana section, how precisely was each figure derived, including the $8.5 billion figure?

I hope this covers the topic but there would likely be follow-up questions. I appreciate that responsiveness is stepping up.

Thanks for the opportunity to respond to the feedback on the economic impact study. Please find our comments below on the review of methodology and findings by other researchers, as well as the two sources you requested in your earlier follow up.

The researchers you consulted echo TAB’s concern that discriminatory legislation will have a significant, negative impact on the Texas economy.

We agree that the full extent of that impact could vary based on the content, extent and number of discriminatory bills passed, including SB 6. That’s exactly why our study estimates a range of impact on GDP and jobs, as opposed to a precise number.

Whether it’s $964 million or as high as $8.5 billion, the passage of discriminatory legislation is a very high and completely unnecessary cost for Texas, our business, our communities and our state revenue to suffer.

In a time when state budgets are especially tight and so many state priorities like public education, CPS reform and transportation must be addressed, it makes passage of discriminatory legislation a cost that Texas cannot afford, while doing nothing to improve public safety.

Regarding some specific comments presented by the third-parties you contacted, we’d like to note:

Dr. Werner of UT Austin suggested we could only draw from one state (North Carolina) that has discriminatory legislation signed into law. However, there are two states that are already suffering significant economic losses due to laws like Texas’ SB 6. North Carolina and Indiana – both states which did pass discriminatory legislation, and was subsequently modified in Indiana – provide a clear sense of the significant losses that a state will suffer when discriminatory legislation is passed. The economic toll continues to add up in North Carolina. We take into consideration their direct experiences as well as recognizing that a state as large as Texas plays host to even more events and conferences – both annually (e.g., SXSW, F1, etc.) and periodically (e.g., Super Bowl, All-Star games, etc.). Our study provides a range of potential economic impact and job losses that could be expected with the passage of legislation like SB 6 and similar bills.

As Dr. Depken of UNC-Charlotte shared with you, “the cost benefit ratio … will be amazingly high for this initiative,” and we strongly agree.

And, Dr. Schweitzer of Wharton notes how the effects can “snowball,” something that is consistent with the range of impact we provided as well as the fact that North Carolina continues to take on additional losses from the passage of HB 2.

Finally, the faculty member’s response regarding your sourcing questions:

1. Salary estimate: https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_tx.htm#00-0000 which reports the average salary for Texas jobs used to calculate the number of lost jobs based on economic decline

2. 15% decline in GDP: “That 15%, as best I can tell, is unfortunately a typo, and is confusing as it references the Dean Runyan travel numbers which appear later in the report, but are not used in that particular calculation. It only occurs in that one section. The actual number should be .5%, which is what is referenced elsewhere in the report and in the table. The stated loss in Indiana was $1.5 Billion, which is .5% of Indiana’s GDP of $387B. Apply that same .5% loss to Texas’ GDP of $1.7 Trillion, and you get the $8.5B that we stated.”

I hope this provides all the information you need.

Got it.

I’m confused by an early part of the reply. It seems to suggest the study finished in 2015 concerned the effects of a 2017 proposal. What am I misreading?

EXCERPT: “This study focused on the potential economic impact on Texas should the proposed legislation - Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act – be passed by the Texas Legislation in 2017. The study is titled, Discrimination and The Texas Economy Study. The study was completed on October 23, 2015.”

Yes, the study was completed after the 2015 (84th) legislative session to project what would be the economic impact if the 2017 (85th) legislative session passed discriminatory legislation.

Also, I now realize, there is no explanation in the study or the follow-up document for the Indiana-tied discussion of a 15 percent drop in GDP. What was the basis of this element? Why 15 percent?

Good afternoon.

Past the questions I relayed Wednesday, I have these follow-up questions. It would be helpful to hear back soon. It could be that this information is right there in the study and I just misread.

My questions:

--What was the study’s source for the city of New Orleans making a prediction about Jindal’s order? After not coming up with the cited source from the study, we web-searched to find this 2015 Travel Weekly news story quoting Stephen Perry, ceo for the New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau, saying that when the stalled-out legislation that was the model for Jindal’s order was referred to a legislative panel, 80 percent to 85 percent of the city's “most important corporate customers” called to say that if it were to pass, "it’s unlikely we’re going to be able to come back here.” Perry otherwise said Jindal’s order “caused a lot of consternation and confusion,” Travel Weekly reported. That story doesn’t attach the 80-85 comment to Jindal’s order.

The Travel Weekly piece was in regards to the RFRA that did not pass. After it failed, Jindal accomplished the same goal with his exec order.

http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/01/jared_kushner_registered_vote.html

--What was the study’s source for the sales tax projection including this notation: (Helger, 2015, the study says, but the link provided in the follow-up document doesn’t lead to anything specific to the cited tax losses, which I am guessing might be limited to Harris County; ?).

The Perryman study shows travel and tourism industry contributes $3.3 billion in local tax revenues throughout Texas.

--The study’s cited Indiana losses of $1.5 billion reflect an Indiana legislator’s comment in this April 2015 WNDU news story. Did the researchers rely on anything past that comment?

I did not find another source for Indiana, but there are a few sources that have quantified the impact in NC at nearly $1 billion in less than a year.

--The study says the 2014 NCAA Final Four in Arlington generated almost $277 million in revenue. The source for that appears to be a 2013 news story quoting a study predicting nearly that much in “economic impact,” not revenue. Did the researchers consider post-tournament data?

The post-tournament data by the North Texas Commission reported that the economic impact of the Final Four in Arlington was $276 million.

--What was the study’s source for the declaration that the Texas travel industry has a $31 billion annual impact? I see the document you shared refers to Dean Runyan, 2015b as a source. I haven’t found that one out there and I am also not spotting the $31 billion figure in the 2015p report here.

On page 6 of the report by Dean Runyan, Texas 2015 GDP from travel was $33.5 billion, and direct travel spending in 2015 was $68.7 billion. A recent report completed by Dr. M. Ray Perryman in December 2016 showed that direct travel spending in Texas totaled $72 billion in 2016, and the travel industry directly supports 688,000 jobs.

Here is the response from the faculty member:

http://gov.texas.gov/files/ecodev/texas-economic-overview.pdf This document has the Texas economy at $1.657 trillion Also see: https://www.comptroller.texas.gov/transparency/reports/forecasts/2014-15/summary_calendar.php $1.7 trillion is simply a rounding issue. $1.65 trillion is 97% of $1.7 trillion well with the commonly accepted range of 5%.

OK. Any idea why the study says $8.5 billion? Maybe my math is bad; I get $8.29 billion based on the figure in that document.

Because they rounded the figures to one decimal point before they calculated the estimate.

1.7 trillion x .5% = 8.5 billion
