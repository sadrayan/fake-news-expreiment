NV Energy in coalition challenging petition against new rooftop solar rates
CARSON CITY â€” NV Energy has acknowledged that it is part of a coalition challenging a referendum petition filed by rooftop solar supporters seeking a public vote in November to return Nevada's net metering program back to more favorable rates for homeowners.

A statement from the company said: "NV Energy is part of a coalition called Citizens for Solar and Energy Fairness. The coalition has retained legal counsel and has filed a challenge to the referendum."

The link between NV Energy and the political action committee was first reported by Politico.

An attorney representing NV Energy and its PAC has argued in a court filing that the referendum petition should be rejected.

The referendum was filed by the Bring Back Solar Alliance.

A hearing date on the challenge filed in District Court in Carson City has not yet been set.

The referendum proposes to repeal certain language in a bill passed by the 2015 Legislature requiring the Nevada Public Utilities Commission to set a new rate class for net metering customers. The effect would be to return Nevada's rooftop solar program to pre-2016 rates.

If the petition survives the legal challenge, supporters will have to gather 55,234 valid signatures from registered Nevada voters, including at least 13,809 signatures from each of state's four congressional districts, by June 21 to get the measure to the November general election ballot.
