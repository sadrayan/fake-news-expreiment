The rough figure I quoted came from the Williams Institute, however, it was a little old. The latest survey they completed last year puts the number higher. Across the US, about 1.4 million Americans are trans, which if my math is right, would make us 1 in every 231 people.

· Estimates for adults: https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf

· Estimates for youth aged 13–17: https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/TransAgeReport.pdf

Nationally, it’s estimated that 0.6% of the adult population (1.4 million adults) and 0.7% of the 13–17 age group (about 150,000 people) are transgender.

In Texas, the percentage is higher. We have one of the highest rates of transgender people in the country: 0.66% of the adult population (125,350 adults) and 0.73% of the 13–17 age group (13,800). So in Texas, that’s about 1 in every 152 adults, and 1 in every 137 people teens between the ages of 13 and 17.

If you'd like to reach out to someone who knows more about this, Ma'ayn Anafi at the National Center for Transgender Equality would be a great person to contact...

If you do a Politifact segment on this, please let me know!
