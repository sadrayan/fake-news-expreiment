This MAY NOT have been the method or tool used to kill, euthanize, or free/relocate, the animal captured. When animals are captured and/or restrained, WS employees use methods or tools to euthanize, and approved handling and transport are used to free or relocate. Removed/Destroyed only counts the removal or destruction of dens and burrows. For Column IS / Non-IS: IS = Invasive Species; Non-IS = Not an Invasive Species Invasive species in this report are highlighted. Each year, Wildlife Services manages damage caused by many invasive species.
