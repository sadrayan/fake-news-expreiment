Here is Rep. Doggett’s reply to your request from this afternoon:

“Jim Skaggs, who is a supporter of ultra-conservatives, like Ted Cruz and Donna Campbell. Surely, the Austin Tea Party does not deny its active opposition to Prop. 1.”

Thanks,

Leslie Tisdale

Press Secretary

Congressman Lloyd Doggett (D-TX)
