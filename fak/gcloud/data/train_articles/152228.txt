A DRUNKEN sex per­vert ended up with frost­bite in his WILLY af­ter hav­ing sex with a SNOW­MAN!

Ha­bit­ual drunk­ard Ken­neth Guille­spie, 64, was found half- naked and scream­ing in agony next to the re­mains of the five- foot snow sculp­ture.

And when he ar­rived for treat­ment at North Cen­tral In­fir­mary in Black­burn, Lancs, shocked medics found the booze- soaked layabout was suf­fer­ing from FROST­BITE of the JOHN­SON!

A source at the hospi­tal told Sun­day Sport: “Ken’s a reg­u­lar vis­i­tor to A& E. Nor­mally it’s just bumps and scrapes – or some­one has given him a hid­ing be­cause he’s been un­ruly.

Wedged

“Oc­ca­sion­ally he’ll get trapped in some­thing or get an ob­ject wedged up him. But this is the most bizarre mishap yet.

“Frost­bite of the pe­nis may sound funny but it can be very se­ri­ous in­deed.

“Frost­bite can cause in­fec­tion and gan­grene and ul­ti­mately this may lead to the mem­ber be­ing am­pu­tated.

“From what I heard, Ken is still in one piece.”

But the un­em­ployed former post­man may not re­main in one piece if he re­turns to the scene of his un­con­ven­tional cou­pling – as lo­cal res­i­dents are said to be on the warpath.

Ian Jessop of the Rams­g­reave and Brownhill Com­mu­nity Se­cu­rity Fo­rum said: “If that dirty f*** er comes back here af­ter what he did, I won’t be re­spon­si­ble for the re­ac­tion of the com­mu­nity.

“Sev­eral peo­ple have al­ready vowed to dis­mem­ber him af­ter what he did to the kids’ snow­man.

“He left a pile of empty bot­tles, a wrecked snow­man and a trail of frozen man- juice in the mid­dle of the com­mu­nity recre­ation ground.

“This bug­ger’s worse than Jimmy Sav­ile.”

Last night Guille­spie was said to be re­cov­er­ing with friends in nearby Dar­wen, though could not be con­tacted as Sun­day Sport went to press.
