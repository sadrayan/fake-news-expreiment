Schindler's List (1993)
Trivia

In a memorable scene when Poldek Pfefferberg ( Jonathan Sagall ) runs into a German patrol during the Ghetto clearing, he is forced to improvise and snaps to attention and salutes the Germans with two fingers to his forehead (he explains that he was ordered to clear the road of rubble so the troops could run without hindrance). This two-finger salute is actually the correct way of saluting in the Polish military, though the Germans were obviously not impressed by it. See more
