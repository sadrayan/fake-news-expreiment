Tony Podesta Arrested: Arrest Warrants Issued for Hillary Clinton & John Podesta

Mainstream media blackout as key Democrats indicted

Just days ago, Tony Podesta stepped down from the Podesta Group after probing conducted under the authority of special counsel Robert Mueller led to an investigation by the Justice Department.

Arrests records confirm that 74-year-old Anthony, founder of the Podesta Group, brother of John Podesta, and a major player in the Pizzagate scandal, was arrested last night.

In a shocking turn of events, three key Democrats have been indicted, yet there's a total mainstream media blackout.

Tony is currently in custody with the US Marshals with the Podesta brothers' lawyers pleading with Mueller to keep the indictments sealed.

According to sources within the US Marshalls office, Anthony Podesta surrendered himself late on Saturday under the terms that it's kept hidden from the press.

John Podesta and Hillary Clinton have negotiated the same deal but will surrender themselves on Monday morning.
