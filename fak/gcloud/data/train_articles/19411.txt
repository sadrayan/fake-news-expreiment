South Sudan: Maternal & Child Health

With 2,054 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, South Sudan has the highest maternal mortality rate in the world. Due in part to the high fertility rate, each mother has a one in seven chance of dying in childbirth during her lifetime. Babies are at even greater risk; 25% die from common, often preventable childhood illnesses before they reach their fifth birthday. The high impact services that International Medical Corps implements in primary health clinics in South Sudan focus on improving the health of women and their children. Several of our primary and secondary health facilities also provide Emergency Obstetric Care, ensuring care for women experiencing complications during delivery.

International Medical Corps is helping South Sudan progress toward the Millenium Development Goal of reducing child mortality and improving maternal health through direct service delivery at primary and secondary level health clinics, as well as capacity strengthening programs through the National Health Training Institute in Kajo Keji.
