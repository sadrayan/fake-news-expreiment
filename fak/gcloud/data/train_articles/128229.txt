Daniel Craig Bought Himself an Aston Martin V12 Vantage Roadster Birthday Present
Daniel Craig, aka Agent 007, celebrated his 45th birthday with a car worthy of his name: an Aston Martin V12 Vantage Roadster. Daniel Craig paid an impressive sum of £150,000 (around $226,000 at the current exchange rates) for his sports car, but unfortunately it does not come with an ejector seat or hidden weapons.

The famous actor went to London to take delivery of his car and he dressed inconspicuously in an attempt to zip around London without anyone recognizing him. We are not very sure if he was successful in his attempt, but for sure he was very pleased with his new toy.

And why wouldn’t he? The V12 Vantage Roadster is powered by a 6-liter V-12 engine that delivers an amazing 510 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque. The engine is mated to a six-speed manual gearbox, sprinting the car from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds and up to a top speed of 190 mph.
