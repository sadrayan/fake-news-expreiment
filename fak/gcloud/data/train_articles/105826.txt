America First Foreign Policy!
We must put America First!

America has pursued a disastrous, in many ways treasonous foreign policy that has put the interests of foreign nations and globalists objectives over the most basic interests of the American people.

A perfect example is the fact that the American Government was the original sponsor of al Qaeda and bin Laden which ultimately committed unspeakable terror upon America.

Another is that the political leaders of this country have supported al Nusra which is an al Qaeda radical jihadist terror organization in Syria, and they sent your money to support the horrific rise of ISIS.

The political sell-outs tried to destroy the secular government in Syria which has protected the millions of Christians in that nation.

They have led us into insane wars that have cost the American people trillions of our tax dollars and led to the injury and harm of hundreds of thousands of brave American warriors in wars that have not only betrayed them but directly led to the terror that we now face today.

Today the globalists who control both the bosses of the media, banks and the Democratic and Republican Party are pursuing a reckless against Russia, which is the only Western Nation on Earth that defines itself openly Christian nation.

We must have an America first policy, and have it now.
