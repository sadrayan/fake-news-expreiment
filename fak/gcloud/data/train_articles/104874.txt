DeKalb County Physician Indicted for Using Medicaid Funds to Perform Abortions
A DeKalb County Grand Jury indicted Tyrone Cecil Malloy, MD, and his former office manager CathyAnn Edwards Warner on December 8, 2011, on two counts of Medicaid Fraud, O.C.G.A. 49-4-146.1(b)(2). Malloy owns and operates Old National Gynecology, a medical practice devoted to the performance of abortions.

The indictment alleges that Malloy and Edwards accepted medical assistance payments for medical office visits associated with the performance of elective abortions and for ultrasound services which were never performed. Federal funds may not be used to pay for abortions and services associated with abortions, except in instances where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or under circumstances in which continuation of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the mother.

Medicaid Fraud is punishable by one to ten years in prison and a fine of $10,000.00.
