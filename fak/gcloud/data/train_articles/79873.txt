These Are The Terrifying Syrian Refugees Coming To The U.S.

1 / 19

Syrian refugee Nujeen, 16, waits to be carried from the shoreline to the road after landing on the Greek island of Lesbos with her older sister Nisreen. They fled Aleppo with their parents over two years ago and had been living in Turkey before deciding to seek better medical care for Nujeen in Europe. After a rough crossing that left most of the passengers cold and terrified, Nujeen seemed calm and happy. Speaking fluent English, she described the journey: "I enjoyed it. I have never been on a boat before. It was very beautiful. I didn't know if I was going to live or die, but thanks to God we are here."<br><br><a href="https://twitter.com/nujeenmustafa" target="_blank">Nujeen's</a> resilience captured headlines around the world this year, and earned her a shoutout on HBO's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umqvYhb3wf4" target="_blank">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>." It was more than just a mention for Nujeen, however, as Oliver got actors from her favorite American soap opera, "Days of Our Lives," to pay tribute to the teen. Nujeen has since arrived in Germany.
