RNC's Announces Next Phase of the 2016 Republican National Convention Site Selection Process
WASHINGTON – Today the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) Site Selection Committee (SSC) voted to narrow the list of sites in contention for the 2016 Republican National Convention from eight to six cities. Cities moving on to the next round of consideration are Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, and Las Vegas.



A small team of RNC staff will visit the six cities for a more in-depth and technical look at financing, convention venues, media workspace, and hotels. The SSC will reconvene soon after the RNC’s Spring Meeting to make a determination on which of these six cities will receive official site visits from the full RNC delegation.



Following today’s vote, SSC Chair Enid Mickelsen released the following statement:

“After a painstaking review, I’m pleased to announce that six cities have moved on to the next round of consideration for the 2016 Republican National Convention. The eyes of the world will be on the RNC and our host city in the summer of 2016, and these six cities have shown they have what it takes to move forward.



“In any other year, Columbus and Phoenix could have topped the list, but with so many strong cities competing, the committee had to make the difficult decision to narrow the field. Phoenix and Columbus are great American cities, and I hope they’ll pursue a future bid for an RNC convention.



“I want to thank each city for their tireless efforts and hard work throughout this process, and I look forward to this next phase as we select a city to help us nominate the next Republican President of the United States.”
