Saving Media or Trading on Trust?
Extending research from Wojdynski and Evans, this experimental study replicates the challenges of effectively disclosing native advertising to readers and demonstrates a promising inoculation method that increases likelihood of recognition. Moreover, this quantitative research indicates that both legacy and online news publishers were evaluated less favorably for displaying native advertising. Attitudes toward the publisher and perceptions of its credibility declined for both, although online publishers suffered greater attitudinal damage than did legacy publishers who may benefit from their established reputation.

Introduction As advertising and subscriber revenues continue to plummet (Cillizza 2015 Cillizza, Chris. 2015. “We Already Knew Legacy Media Had a Problem. but These Two Charts Are Really Depressing.” The Washington Post, April 29. http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/04/29/we-already-knew-legacy-media-had-a-problem-but-these-two-charts-are-really-depressing/; McChesney and Pickard 2011 McChesney, Robert W., and Victor Pickard. 2011. Will the Last Reporter Please Turn out the Lights? The Collapse of Journalism and What Can Be Done to Fix It. New York: The New Press.), legacy publishers are looking for ways to fund the costs of producing the content in their publications. With the technological revolution of digital media, a controversial practice is drawing increasing attention: the notion of “native advertising.” Native advertising refers to the practice of creating advertisements (ads) that mimic, or appear “native” to, the platform on which they appear. These messages adopt the same format, font, and tone as a traditional piece of journalism or user-generated post, often looking nearly identical to the content created by the platform publisher (Austin and Newman 2015 Austin, Shaun, and Nic Newman. 2015. “Attitudes to Sponsored and Branded Content (Native Advertising).” In Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2015: Tracking the Future of News, 100–107.

The Interactive Advertising Bureau (2013 Interactive Advertising Bureau. 2013. “The Native Advertising Playbook.” December 4. http://www.iab.com/guidelines/native-advertising/, 3) defines native advertising as “paid ads that are so cohesive with the page content, assimilated into the design, and consistent with the platform behavior that the viewer simply feels that they belong.” It is varyingly referred to with different types of disclosures such as sponsored content, branded content, or promoted content. This inconsistent labeling of native advertising complicates an audience member’s ability to identify the type of content he or she is consuming (Austin and Newman 2015 Austin, Shaun, and Nic Newman. 2015. “Attitudes to Sponsored and Branded Content (Native Advertising).” In Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2015: Tracking the Future of News, 100–107.

Not only are there various pseudonyms for native ads, the Interactive Advertising Bureau identifies six different forms of native including in-feed units, paid-search units, recommendation widgets, promoted listings, in-ad with native elements, and custom (Interactive Advertising Bureau 2013 Interactive Advertising Bureau. 2013. “The Native Advertising Playbook.” December 4. http://www.iab.com/guidelines/native-advertising/; for overviews, see Conill 2016 Conill, Raul Ferrier. 2016. “Camouflaging Church as State: An Exploratory Study of Journalism’s Native Advertising.” Journalism Studies. doi:10.1080/1461670X.2016.1165138.; Einstein 2016 Einstein, Mara. 2016. Black Ops Advertising: Native Ads, Content Marketing, and the Covert World of the Digital Sell. New York : O/R Books.). This study focuses on customized native advertising: specially produced content by a publisher to look like online news articles. The use of native advertising has become an ongoing topic of debate in advertising and journalism circles. Proponents of native advertising claim that beyond benefiting advertisers, it represents a promising stream of premium revenue for publishers to replace the income lost by declining subscriptions and the lower cost-per-thousand ad rates inherent in online advertising (Carlson 2015 Carlson, Matt. 2015. “When News Sites Go Native: Redefining the Advertising–Editorial Divide in Response to Native Advertising.” Journalism 16 (7): 849–865.; Howe 2015 Howe, Patrick. 2015. “How Native Advertisements Could Be the Solution to the Internet’s Bad-Ad Problem.” The Conversation, September 22. https://theconversation.com/how-native-advertisements-could-be-the-solution-to-the-internets-bad-ad-problem-45145; Sonderman and Tran 2013 Sonderman, Jeff, and Millie Tran. 2013. “Understanding the Rise of Sponsored Content.” American Press Institute, November 13. http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/white-papers/understanding-rise-sponsored-content/). Whereas media scarcity once allowed legacy publishers to thrive when audiences were hard to reach, in an era of media abundance, online publishers must now persuade audiences to return and stay. Native purportedly facilitates this effort because readers may find it beneficial and can respond positively to it (Austin and Newman 2015 Austin, Shaun, and Nic Newman. 2015. “Attitudes to Sponsored and Branded Content (Native Advertising).” In Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2015: Tracking the Future of News, 100–107. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.; Carlson 2015 Carlson, Matt. 2015. “When News Sites Go Native: Redefining the Advertising–Editorial Divide in Response to Native Advertising.” Journalism 16 (7): 849–865.; Egan 2016 Egan, Beth Donnelly. 2016. “Why Native Advertising is Great Advertising.” MediaPost, November 4. http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/288351/why-native-advertising-is-great-advertising.html). While some evidence demonstrates native advertising is more engaging than traditional display or banner advertising (Sterling 2015 Sterling, Greg. 2015. “Native Ads: Effective, but Are They Accepted by Consumers?” Marketing Land, August 28. http://marketingland.com/native-ads-effective-but-are-they-accepted-by-consumers-140615; Tutaj and van Reijmersdal 2012 Tutaj, Karolina, and Eva A. van Reijmersdal. 2012. “Effects of Online Advertising Format and Persuasion Knowledge on Audience Reactions.” Journal of Marketing Communications 18 (1): 5–18.10.1080/13527266.2011.620765), it becomes controversial when the message closely resembles editorial content and is not clearly labeled or understood by readers to be advertising, thereby violating the journalistic norm of transparency (Conill 2016 Conill, Raul Ferrier. 2016. “Camouflaging Church as State: An Exploratory Study of Journalism’s Native Advertising.” Journalism Studies. doi:10.1080/1461670X.2016.1165138.; Einstein 2016 Einstein, Mara. 2016. Black Ops Advertising: Native Ads, Content Marketing, and the Covert World of the Digital Sell. New York : O/R Books.; Kovach and Rosenstiel 2001 Kovach, Bill, and Tom Rosenstiel. 2001. The Elements of Journalism. What Newspeople Should Know and the Public Should Expect. New York: Crown Publishers.; Sonderman and Tran 2013 Sonderman, Jeff, and Millie Tran. 2013. “Understanding the Rise of Sponsored Content.” American Press Institute, November 13. http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/white-papers/understanding-rise-sponsored-content/). Moreover, critics argue that proponents are generally citing industry-sponsored studies (Garfield 2016 Garfield, Bob. 2016. “Beware the Native of Brazile.” MediaPost, November 7. http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/288414/beware-the-native-of-brazile.html) and that the values and interests of advertisers ultimately clash with those of journalistic publishers (An and Bergen 2007 An, Soontae, and Lori Bergen. 2007. “Advertiser Pressure on Daily Newspapers: A Survey of Advertising Sales Executives.” Journal of Advertising 36 (2): 111–121.10.2753/JOA0091-3367360208; DeLorme and Fedler 2005 DeLorme, Denise. E, and Fred Fedler. 2005. “An Historical Analysis of Journalists’Attitudes toward Advertisers and Advertising’s Influence.” American Journalism 22 (2): 7–40.). Consequently, the use of native advertising raises important ethical and normative questions about whose interests are being served by a practice that blurs the line between journalism and advertising. While native advertising is not new, the emergence of digital media has offered new territory in which it proliferates. Nearly three out of four online publishers in the United States now offer native advertising opportunities (Gilley 2013 Gilley, Stephanie. 2013. “Blurred Lines: Advertising or Content?—an FTC Workshop on Native Advertising.” Federal Trade Commission, December 4. http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2013/12/blurred-lines-advertising-or-content-ftc-workshop-native). Although the United States leads in expenditures on native ads, the practice is gaining global momentum with significant spending occurring worldwide, particularly in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom (Adyoulike 2015 Adyoulike. 2015. “Native Advertising Set to Double by 2018.” PRNewswire, December 18. http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/native-advertising-set-to-double-by-2018-562919861.html). Regardless of location, as legacy publishers try to keep pace with their digital-only competitors, their heritage may present both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, many traditional publishers have built up brand reputations over the years, providing their journalism a great deal of credibility and authority. On the other hand, with these reputations comes increased risk when adaptations are made to journalistic conventions. Thus, when newspapers such as the New York Times and the Guardian, or magazines like The Atlantic and Forbes, offer sponsored content to their readers, what impact will this have on their own publishing reputations? This debate over the implications of blurring editorial and commercial interests has been explored theoretically (cf. Baerug and Harro-Loit 2012 Baerug, Jan Richard, and Halliki Harro-Loit. 2012. “Journalism Embracing Advertising as Traditional Journalism Discourse Becomes Marginal: A Comparative Study of European MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events) Magazines.” Journalism Practice 6 (2): 172–186.10.1080/17512786.2011.616647; Carlson 2015 Carlson, Matt. 2015. “When News Sites Go Native: Redefining the Advertising–Editorial Divide in Response to Native Advertising.” Journalism 16 (7): 849–865.; Coddington 2015 Coddington, Mark. 2015. “The Wall Becomes a Curtain: Revisiting Journalism’s News-Business Boundary.” In Boundaries of Journalism: Professionalism, Practices and Participation, edited by M. Carlson and S. C. Lewis, 67–82. New York : Routledge.). As called for by Einstein (2016 Einstein, Mara. 2016. Black Ops Advertising: Native Ads, Content Marketing, and the Covert World of the Digital Sell. New York : O/R Books.) and others, this study offers empirical evidence to contribute to the growing interest on this topic in the academic literature, particularly as it relates to legacy news publishers. This paper attempts to capture a novel format of the long-standing coexistence between news media and the advertising industry. The goal of this study is to empirically examine the possible effects of using native advertising in legacy and online news media from the perspective of readers. The paper first addresses the practice of advertising within the context of the consumer persuasion knowledge model (PKM) and framing theory. It then considers how publisher credibility may interact with native advertising recognition and consumer evaluations. An experimental study provides empirical evidence of the effects of native ads on consumer attitudes and perceived credibility of messages and publishers. Extending recent research from Wojdynski and Evans (2016 Wojdynski, Bartosz W., and Nathaniel J. Evans. 2016. “Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 45 (2): 157–168.10.1080/00913367.2015.1115380), we replicate the challenges of effectively disclosing native advertising and demonstrate a promising inoculation method that increases likelihood of recognition. Moreover, our research suggests that the reputational characteristic of a publisher influences advertising recognition, which subsequently affects consumer behavior and evaluations of publishers.

Literature Review and Theoretical Development Since the early twentieth century, advertising was an integral part of American newspapers, providing nearly half of annual revenues. By the 1950s, advertising’s contributions to the bottom line had risen to at least two-thirds of publisher revenues. With the growing presence of advertising, publishers and journalists became increasingly aware of the potential influences advertising could exert over their publications (DeLorme and Fedler 2005 DeLorme, Denise. E, and Fred Fedler. 2005. “An Historical Analysis of Journalists’Attitudes toward Advertisers and Advertising’s Influence.” American Journalism 22 (2): 7–40.). In particular, journalists and editors were concerned with maintaining the editorial integrity of their publications when faced with advertisers who demanded favorable coverage or attempted to suppress unfavorable articles (An and Bergen 2007 An, Soontae, and Lori Bergen. 2007. “Advertiser Pressure on Daily Newspapers: A Survey of Advertising Sales Executives.” Journal of Advertising 36 (2): 111–121.10.2753/JOA0091-3367360208; Baerug and Harro-Loit 2012 Baerug, Jan Richard, and Halliki Harro-Loit. 2012. “Journalism Embracing Advertising as Traditional Journalism Discourse Becomes Marginal: A Comparative Study of European MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events) Magazines.” Journalism Practice 6 (2): 172–186.10.1080/17512786.2011.616647; DeLorme and Fedler 2005 DeLorme, Denise. E, and Fred Fedler. 2005. “An Historical Analysis of Journalists’Attitudes toward Advertisers and Advertising’s Influence.” American Journalism 22 (2): 7–40.). To preserve the editorial independence of journalists from the business side of running a publication, a proverbial “wall” was established separating these competing interests (Coddington 2015 Coddington, Mark. 2015. “The Wall Becomes a Curtain: Revisiting Journalism’s News-Business Boundary.” In Boundaries of Journalism: Professionalism, Practices and Participation, edited by M. Carlson and S. C. Lewis, 67–82. New York : Routledge.; Conill 2016 Conill, Raul Ferrier. 2016. “Camouflaging Church as State: An Exploratory Study of Journalism’s Native Advertising.” Journalism Studies. doi:10.1080/1461670X.2016.1165138.; Kovach and Rosenstiel 2001 Kovach, Bill, and Tom Rosenstiel. 2001. The Elements of Journalism. What Newspeople Should Know and the Public Should Expect. New York: Crown Publishers.). Journalists were encouraged to remain independent in their reporting by ignoring pressures to appease advertiser demands (Coddington 2015 Coddington, Mark. 2015. “The Wall Becomes a Curtain: Revisiting Journalism’s News-Business Boundary.” In Boundaries of Journalism: Professionalism, Practices and Participation, edited by M. Carlson and S. C. Lewis, 67–82. New York : Routledge.; DeLorme and Fedler 2005 DeLorme, Denise. E, and Fred Fedler. 2005. “An Historical Analysis of Journalists’Attitudes toward Advertisers and Advertising’s Influence.” American Journalism 22 (2): 7–40.). Although journalists generally agreed that this boundary should exist in theory, today many are questioning what Coddington (2015 Coddington, Mark. 2015. “The Wall Becomes a Curtain: Revisiting Journalism’s News-Business Boundary.” In Boundaries of Journalism: Professionalism, Practices and Participation, edited by M. Carlson and S. C. Lewis, 67–82. New York : Routledge., 68) referred to as an “anachronistic relic of a time when the news industry’s survival wasn’t threatened.” Indeed, as circulations have declined and readers have turned to ad avoidance and ad-blocking software, publishers have been keen to find new sources of revenue (Austin and Newman 2015 Austin, Shaun, and Nic Newman. 2015. “Attitudes to Sponsored and Branded Content (Native Advertising).” In Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2015: Tracking the Future of News, 100–107. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.; Johnson 2013 Johnson, Justin P. 2013. “Targeted Advertising and Advertising Avoidance.” The Rand Journal of Economics 44 (1): 128–144.10.1111/rand.2013.44.issue-1). With this search, the language of newsroom leaders has increasingly come to dispute the need for the church–state division and defends the use of advertising as content that no longer has to erode consumer trust (Conill 2016 Conill, Raul Ferrier. 2016. “Camouflaging Church as State: An Exploratory Study of Journalism’s Native Advertising.” Journalism Studies. doi:10.1080/1461670X.2016.1165138.), despite years of evidence to the contrary. Numerous studies have documented the less than favorable attitudes consumers have toward advertising (Calfee and Ringold 1994 Calfee, John E., and Debra J. Ringold. 1994. “The Seventy Percent Majority: Enduring Consumer Beliefs about Advertising.” Journal of Public Policy and Marketing 13 (2): 228–238.; Gao, Zhang, and Li 2014 Gao, Zhihong, Hongxia Zhang, and Sherry F. Li. 2014. “Consumer Attitudes toward Advertising in the Digital Age: A China-United States Comparative Study.” Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising 35 (1): 12–28.10.1080/10641734.2014.866844; Larkin 1977 Larkin, Ernest F. 1977. “A Factor Analysis of College Student Attitudes toward Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 6 (2): 42–46.10.1080/00913367.1977.10672693; Mittal 1994 Mittal, Banwari. 1994. “Public Assessment of TV Advertising: Faint Praise and Harsh Criticism.” Journal of Advertising Research 34 (1): 35–53.; Pollay and Mittal 1993 Pollay, Richard W. and Banwari Mittal. 1993. “Here’s the Beef: Factors, Determinants, and Segments in Consumer Criticism of Advertising.” Journal of Marketing 57(3): 99–114. 10.2307/1251857; Shavitt, Lowrey, and Haefner 1998 Shavitt, Sharon, Pamela Lowrey, and James Haefner. 1998. “Public Attitudes toward Advertising: More Favorable than You Might Think.” Journal of Advertising Research 38 (4): 7–22.). Recent polls indicate that three out of four people believe ads contain exaggerated claims (White 2013 White, Charlie 2013. “Does Anyone Really Believe Advertising Anymore?” Mashable. Accessed . http://mashable.com/2013/01/05/advertising-credibility/), while only one in ten people trust advertisers to do what is right most of the time or always (Madden 2014 Madden, Mary. 2014. Few Feel That the Government or Advertisers Can Be Trusted. Pew Research Center. Accessed July 30, 2015. http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/11/12/few-feel-that-the-government-or-advertisers-can-be-trusted/). Indeed, practitioners of advertising consistently have been near the bottom of Gallup’s annual list of professional honesty and ethics in the United States (just above car sales people and members of Congress) since the question was first asked in 1976 (Gallup 2014 Gallup. 2014. “Honesty/Ethics in Professions.” http://www.gallup.com/poll/1654/Honesty-Ethics-Professions.aspx). With the fragmentation of media and the use of new technologies, advertising has become even more intrusive and has raised new concerns involving consumer annoyance and privacy (Austin and Newman 2015 Austin, Shaun, and Nic Newman. 2015. “Attitudes to Sponsored and Branded Content (Native Advertising).” In Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2015: Tracking the Future of News, 100–107. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.; Einstein 2016 Einstein, Mara. 2016. Black Ops Advertising: Native Ads, Content Marketing, and the Covert World of the Digital Sell. New York : O/R Books.; Palmer 2005 Palmer, D. E. 2005. “Pops-Ups, Cookies, and Spam: Toward a Deeper Analysis of the Ethical Significance of Internet Marketing Practices.” Journal of Business Ethics 58 (May): 271–280.10.1007/s10551-005-1421-8; Turow 2012 Turow, Joseph. 2012. The Daily You: How the New Advertising Industry is Defining Your Identity and Your worth. New Haven , CT : Yale University Press.). Persuasion Knowledge Model Many people have negative attitudes toward advertising because it is generally understood as a means of persuasion. According to the consumer PKM, the general public has a fairly clear understanding of the persuasive tactics employed by advertising (Friestad and Wright 1994 Friestad, Marian, and Peter Wright. 1994. “The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts.” Journal of Consumer Research 21 (June): 1–31.10.1086/jcr.1994.21.issue-1) and will use various strategies to resist or avoid advertising (Fransen et al. 2015 Fransen, Marieke L., Peeter W. J. Verlegh, Amna Kirmani, and Edith G. Smit. 2015. “A Typology of Consumer Strategies for Resisting Advertising, and a Review of Mechanisms for Countering Them.” International Journal of Advertising 34 (1): 6–16.; Friestad and Wright 1994 Friestad, Marian, and Peter Wright. 1994. “The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts.” Journal of Consumer Research 21 (June): 1–31.10.1086/jcr.1994.21.issue-1). The PKM suggests that in order for an individual to decide how to react to a persuasion attempt, he or she must observe that a persuasive attempt is taking place. One’s motivation to react to a persuasive attempt can be deterred by difficulties in identifying the agent or company responsible for the message (Friestad and Wright 1994 Friestad, Marian, and Peter Wright. 1994. “The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts.” Journal of Consumer Research 21 (June): 1–31.10.1086/jcr.1994.21.issue-1; Shrum et al. 2012 Shrum, L. J., Min Liu, Mark Nespoli, and Tina M. Lowrey. 2012. “Persuasion in the Marketplace: How Theories of Persuasion Apply to Marketing and Advertising.” In The SAGE Persuasion Handbook, edited by J. Dillard and L. Shen, 314–330. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.). Indeed, the findings of recent studies demonstrating neutral and even positive effects of native advertising were attributed to most participants not recognizing that they were viewing advertising (Howe and Teufel 2014 Howe, Patrick, and Bradley Teufel. 2014. “Native Advertising and Digital Natives: The Effects of Age and Advertisement Format on News Website Credibility Judgments.” ISOJ 4 (1): 78–90.; Tutaj and van Reijmersdal 2012 Tutaj, Karolina, and Eva A. van Reijmersdal. 2012. “Effects of Online Advertising Format and Persuasion Knowledge on Audience Reactions.” Journal of Marketing Communications 18 (1): 5–18.10.1080/13527266.2011.620765; Wojdynski and Evans 2016 Wojdynski, Bartosz W., and Nathaniel J. Evans. 2016. “Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 45 (2): 157–168.10.1080/00913367.2015.1115380). Native advertising has emerged as a tactic to avoid the unfavorable attitudes associated with traditional, interruptive advertising yet still be able to transmit a persuasive message to an audience (Austin and Newman 2015 Austin, Shaun, and Nic Newman. 2015. “Attitudes to Sponsored and Branded Content (Native Advertising).” In Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2015: Tracking the Future of News, 100–107. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.; Conill 2016 Conill, Raul Ferrier. 2016. “Camouflaging Church as State: An Exploratory Study of Journalism’s Native Advertising.” Journalism Studies. doi:10.1080/1461670X.2016.1165138.; Einstein 2016 Einstein, Mara. 2016. Black Ops Advertising: Native Ads, Content Marketing, and the Covert World of the Digital Sell. New York : O/R Books.; Sonderman and Tran 2013 Sonderman, Jeff, and Millie Tran. 2013. “Understanding the Rise of Sponsored Content.” American Press Institute, November 13. http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/white-papers/understanding-rise-sponsored-content/). According to framing theory, the way in which content is presented can influence how people interpret it (Goffman 1974 Goffman, Erving. 1974. Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience. Cambridge , MA : Harvard University Press.). To “frame” something is a metaphorical reference to the boundaries surrounding the context within which information is presented. Some attributes in a communicating text are made more salient than others (Entman 1994 Entman, Robert. M. 1994. “Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm.” In Defining Media Studies: Reflections on the Future of the Field, edited by M. Levy and M. Gurevitch, 293–300. New York: Oxford University Press.). In the case of native advertising, the source of the content is minimized while its consistency with the editorial surroundings is critical. Because the practice of native advertising blurs the frames surrounding what appears to be editorial and what is promotional content, readers are less likely to recognize that they are being exposed to advertising (Carlson 2015 Carlson, Matt. 2015. “When News Sites Go Native: Redefining the Advertising–Editorial Divide in Response to Native Advertising.” Journalism 16 (7): 849–865.; Conill 2016 Conill, Raul Ferrier. 2016. “Camouflaging Church as State: An Exploratory Study of Journalism’s Native Advertising.” Journalism Studies. doi:10.1080/1461670X.2016.1165138.; Howe and Teufel 2014 Howe, Patrick, and Bradley Teufel. 2014. “Native Advertising and Digital Natives: The Effects of Age and Advertisement Format on News Website Credibility Judgments.” ISOJ 4 (1): 78–90.; Sonderman and Tran 2013 Sonderman, Jeff, and Millie Tran. 2013. “Understanding the Rise of Sponsored Content.” American Press Institute, November 13. http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/white-papers/understanding-rise-sponsored-content/). Even when efforts are made to be transparent, research has shown that people often do not notice paid advertising labels whether in print or online environments (Cameron 1994 Cameron, Glen T. 1994. “Does Publicity Outperform Advertising: An Experimental Test of the Third-Party Endorsement.” Journal of Public Relations Research 6: 185–207.10.1207/s1532754xjprr0603_03; Gilley 2013 Gilley, Stephanie. 2013. “Blurred Lines: Advertising or Content?—an FTC Workshop on Native Advertising.” Federal Trade Commission, December 4. http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2013/12/blurred-lines-advertising-or-content-ftc-workshop-native; Kim, Pasadeos, and Barban 2001 Kim, B.-H., Y. Pasadeos, and A. Barban. 2001. “On the Deceptive Effectiveness of Labeled and Unlabeled Advertorial Formats.” Mass Communication and Society 4 (3): 265–281.10.1207/S15327825MCS0403_02; Wojdynski and Evans 2016 Wojdynski, Bartosz W., and Nathaniel J. Evans. 2016. “Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 45 (2): 157–168.10.1080/00913367.2015.1115380). Furthermore, even when labels such as “sponsored content” are clearly applied, a majority of people do not understand what the word “sponsored” is supposed to mean (Gilley 2013 Gilley, Stephanie. 2013. “Blurred Lines: Advertising or Content?—an FTC Workshop on Native Advertising.” Federal Trade Commission, December 4. http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2013/12/blurred-lines-advertising-or-content-ftc-workshop-native). For instance, in a study using the most recognizable language for advertising disclosure, “sponsored content,” fewer than one in five participants understood that the article they read was paid advertising (Wojdynski and Evans 2016 Wojdynski, Bartosz W., and Nathaniel J. Evans. 2016. “Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 45 (2): 157–168.10.1080/00913367.2015.1115380). Thus, we expect attitudes toward a message will be influenced by how its framing is perceived. H1: Content presented as a news article will elicit (a) more favorable attitudes and (b) greater credibility than the same content labeled as native advertising. H2: Content presented as a news article will elicit (a) more favorable attitudes and (b) greater credibility than the same content labeled and perceived as native advertising. Source Credibility and Attribution Similar to advertorials11. An advertorial is “a print advertisement disguised as editorial material” (Kim, Pasadeos, and Barban 2001 Kim, B.-H., Y. Pasadeos, and A. Barban. 2001. “On the Deceptive Effectiveness of Labeled and Unlabeled Advertorial Formats.” Mass Communication and Society 4 (3): 265–281.10.1207/S15327825MCS0403_02, 265).View all notes of the print era, part of the appeal of native advertising for advertisers is the perceived credibility of publishers by their audiences (Salmon et al. 1985 Salmon, Charles T., Neonard N. Reid, James Pokrywcznski, and Robert W. Willett. 1985. “The Effectiveness of Advocacy Advertising Relative to News Coverage.” Communication Research 12: 546–567.10.1177/009365085012004006; Sonderman and Tran 2013 Sonderman, Jeff, and Millie Tran. 2013. “Understanding the Rise of Sponsored Content.” American Press Institute, November 13. http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/white-papers/understanding-rise-sponsored-content/). Indeed, consumers are more likely to read editorial content than advertising content (Elliott 1984 Elliott, Stuart J. 1984. “Advertorials: Straddling a Fine Line in Print.” Advertising Age 3 (April 30): 36–37.; Simon 1986 Simon, Raymond. 1986. Public Relations Management: A Casebook. Columbus , OH : Publishing Horizons.). Generally, editorial material is perceived as more credible than commercial messages because, unlike presumably unbiased news, consumers understand that advertisers are trying to sell something and will therefore only provide positive information (Batinic and Appel 2013 Batinic, Bernad, and Markus Appel. 2013. “Mass Communication, Social Influence, and Consumer Behavior: Two Field Experiments.” Journal of Applied Social Psychology 43 (7): 1353–1368.10.1111/jasp.2013.43.issue-7; Friestad and Wright 1994 Friestad, Marian, and Peter Wright. 1994. “The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts.” Journal of Consumer Research 21 (June): 1–31.10.1086/jcr.1994.21.issue-1; van Reijmersdal, Neijens, and Smit 2005 van Reijmersdal, Eva A., Peter C. Neijens, and Edith G. Smit. 2005. “Readers’ Reactions to Mixtures of Advertising and Editorial Content in Magazines.” Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising 27 (Fall): 39–53.10.1080/10641734.2005.10505180, 2010 van Reijmersdal, Eva A., Peter C. Neijens, and Edith G. Smit. 2010. “Customer Magazines: Effects of Commerciality on Readers’ Reactions.” Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising 32 (1): 59–67.10.1080/10641734.2010.10505275). Furthermore, when source credibility is perceived as high, consumers are less likely to counter-argue and therefore more likely to be persuaded than when source credibility is low (Grewal, Gotlieb, and Marmorstein 1994 Grewal, Dhruv, Jerry Gotlieb, and Howard Marmorstein. 1994. “The Moderating Effects of Message Framing and Source Credibility on the Price-Perceived Risk Relationship.” Journal of Consumer Research 21 (1): 145–154.10.1086/jcr.1994.21.issue-1). The credibility of a source is comprised of multiple dimensions that include believability, perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and bias (Birnbaum and Stegner 1979 Birnbaum, Michael H., and Steven E. Stegner. 1979. “Source Credibility in Social Judgment: Bias, Expertise, and the Judge’s Point of View.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 37 (1): 48–74.10.1037/0022-3514.37.1.48; Friestad and Wright 1994 Friestad, Marian, and Peter Wright. 1994. “The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts.” Journal of Consumer Research 21 (June): 1–31.10.1086/jcr.1994.21.issue-1; Hovland and Weiss 1951 Hovland, Carl I., and Walter Weiss. 1951. “The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.” Public Opinion Quarterly 15 (4): 635–650.10.1086/266350; Meyer 1988 Meyer, Philip. 1988. “Defining and Measuring Credibility of Newspapers: Developing an Index.” Journalism Quarterly 65 (3): 567–574.10.1177/107769908806500301). Sources rated higher in expertise are more likely to induce changes in attitudes compared to low-expertise sources (Hovland and Weiss 1951 Hovland, Carl I., and Walter Weiss. 1951. “The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.” Public Opinion Quarterly 15 (4): 635–650.10.1086/266350; Milburn 1991 Milburn, Michael A. 1991. Persuasion and Politics: The Social Psychology of Public Opinion. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole.). Lower credibility sources are less persuasive (Greenberg and Miller 1966 Greenberg, Bradley S., and Gerald R. Miller. 1966. “The Effects of Low-Credible Sources on Message Acceptance.” Speech Monographs 33 (2): 127–136.10.1080/03637756609375488). Moreover, credibility is lowered for sources perceived as offering biased content or for offering content for an ulterior motive other than informative (Hass 1981 Hass, R. Glenn. 1981. “Effects of Source Characteristics on Cognitive Response and Persuasion.” In Cognitive Responses in Persuasion, edited by Richard E. Petty, Thomas M. Ostrom, and Timothy C. Brock, 141–172. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc..). Compared to nascent digital-only news organizations, legacy publishers have built up brand reputations over the years often providing their journalism a great deal of credibility and authority (Greer 2003 Greer, Jennifer. D. 2003. “Evaluating the Credibility of Online Information: A Test of Source and Advertising Influence.” Mass Communication and Society 6 (1): 11–28.10.1207/S15327825MCS0601_3). Indeed, the same article published by a high-credibility source was evaluated more favorably than when published by a low-credibility source (Go, Jung, and Mu 2014 Go, Eun, Eun Hwa Jung, and Wu Mu. 2014. “The Effects of Source Cues on Online News Perception.” Computers in Human Behavior 38: 358–367.10.1016/j.chb.2014.05.044). Past research also indicates that banner ads for lower-involvement products are affected by the reputation of the site on which the ad appears. Banner advertising was more persuasive when on a high-credibility site than when on a low-credibility site (Shamdasani, Stanaland, and Tan 2001 Shamdasani, Prem N., Andrea J. S. Stanaland, and Juliana Tan. 2001. “Location, Location, Location: Insights for Advertising Placement on the Web.” Journal of Advertising Research 41 (4): 7–21.10.2501/JAR-41-4-7-21). It is expected, then, that the credibility of a publisher will enhance the persuasiveness of a native ad. H3: Native ads appearing on a news site with greater levels of publisher credibility will be more persuasive than native ads appearing on a site with lower levels of publisher credibility. While the credibility of a publisher may affect the persuasiveness of a native ad, there may also be a reverse effect whereby recognition of a native ad influences the reputation of a publisher that hosts promotional material mimicking its editorial content. The PKM indicates that consumers attempt to understand the strategic behavior involved in the presentation of a persuasive message, including how and why it was delivered (Friestad and Wright 1994 Friestad, Marian, and Peter Wright. 1994. “The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts.” Journal of Consumer Research 21 (June): 1–31.10.1086/jcr.1994.21.issue-1). This understanding can be moderated by the perception of whether the reasons for a behavior are internally or externally attributable (Thibaut and Riecken 1955 Thibaut, John W., and Henry W. Riecken. 1955. “Some Determinants and Consequences of the Perception of Social Causality.” Journal of Personality 24 (2): 113–133.10.1111/jopy.1955.24.issue-2). For example, some people may interpret the use of native advertising as self-serving (internal attribution), while others may recognize the use of native advertising as related to economic challenges in the news industry (external attribution). Moreover, the perceived status of a source has been shown to affect evaluations as a consequence of expected compliance with a behavior. Noncompliance with expectations leads to lower evaluations. The lowered evaluations, however, were shown to attenuate with lower-status sources whose behavior was attributed to external factors beyond their control (Thibaut and Riecken 1955 Thibaut, John W., and Henry W. Riecken. 1955. “Some Determinants and Consequences of the Perception of Social Causality.” Journal of Personality 24 (2): 113–133.10.1111/jopy.1955.24.issue-2). While message credibility has been shown to decline when the promotional nature of its content increases (Cole and Greer 2013 Cole, James T., and Jennifer D. Greer. 2013. “Audience Response to Brand Journalism: The Effect of Frame, Source, and Involvement.” Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly 90 (4): 673–690.10.1177/1077699013503160), little research has been conducted to measure consumer perceptions of the publisher’s credibility when sponsored content is recognized. One study demonstrated that reader attitudes toward a magazine were lower when it was published by a commercial brand rather than a neutral publisher (van Reijmersdal, Neijens, and Smit 2010 van Reijmersdal, Eva A., Peter C. Neijens, and Edith G. Smit. 2010. “Customer Magazines: Effects of Commerciality on Readers’ Reactions.” Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising 32 (1): 59–67.10.1080/10641734.2010.10505275).22. In industry parlance, this genre of commercially branded magazine (such as Kraft Foods’ Food & Family) is referred to as “customer magazines” (van Reijmersdal, Neijens, and Smit 2010 van Reijmersdal, Eva A., Peter C. Neijens, and Edith G. Smit. 2010. “Customer Magazines: Effects of Commerciality on Readers’ Reactions.” Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising 32 (1): 59–67.10.1080/10641734.2010.10505275) and is the equivalent of what the American Press Institute calls content marketing. Essentially, it is a brand’s owned media.View all notes Another study showed no effects on the credibility of a generic news website among those exposed to a native display ad (Howe and Teufel 2014 Howe, Patrick, and Bradley Teufel. 2014. “Native Advertising and Digital Natives: The Effects of Age and Advertisement Format on News Website Credibility Judgments.” ISOJ 4 (1): 78–90.).33. It is unclear from the conference paper how many respondents recognized the native ad as being sponsored.View all notes Conversely, a study on the credibility of websites found that what was most detrimental were ads that were indistinguishable from the site’s content (Fogg et al. 2002 Fogg, B. J., Kameda, T., Boyd, J., Marshall, J., Sethi, R., Sockol, M., et al. 2002. Stanford–Makovsky Web Credibility Study 2002: Investigating What Makes Web Sites Credible Today. http://credibility.stanford.edu/pdf/Stanford-MakovskyWebCredStudy2002-prelim.pdf). Thus, although research exists on perceptions of content marketing credibility, no studies have been found addressing how recognition of native advertising affects consumer perceptions of legacy publishers. Therefore, the following research questions are posed: RQ1: Does recognition of native advertising influence the credibility of the publisher? RQ2: Does recognition of native advertising affect reader perceptions of publisher credibility differently for legacy media versus a digital start-up? Media Literacy and Inoculation Media literacy is the ability to think critically about the content one is consuming. More specifically, representational media literacy refers to one’s ability to identify an agent or author’s purpose, who the intended audience is, the presence of and type of bias, as well as point of view (Hobbs 2013 Hobbs, Renee. 2013. “The Blurring of Art, Journalism, and Advocacy: Confronting 21st Century Propaganda in a World of Online Journalism.” I/S: A Journal of Law and Policy 8(3): 625-637.). Similarly, how consumers perceive marketers and products is based upon their ability to perform schema-like functions such as guiding their attention, making inferences, generating predictions, and evaluating the goal-seeking behaviors of a persuasion agent. These skills are not stagnant, but develop and mature over time (Friestad and Wright 1994 Friestad, Marian, and Peter Wright. 1994. “The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts.” Journal of Consumer Research 21 (June): 1–31.10.1086/jcr.1994.21.issue-1). Because an inherent characteristic of native advertising is its ability to blend in with other content on a site, consumers may not recognize it as a form of persuasion and therefore may misattribute a publisher’s intent for providing the material, particularly when the native ad is in editorial format (Baerug and Harro-Loit 2012 Baerug, Jan Richard, and Halliki Harro-Loit. 2012. “Journalism Embracing Advertising as Traditional Journalism Discourse Becomes Marginal: A Comparative Study of European MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events) Magazines.” Journalism Practice 6 (2): 172–186.10.1080/17512786.2011.616647). Thus, this study also seeks to test the theory of inoculation as a strategy to prepare audiences for native advertising content. According to inoculation theory, people who are forewarned about a persuasive message attempt are better able to resist the persuasion (McGuire 1961 McGuire, William J. 1961. “The Effectiveness of Supportive and Refutational Defenses in Immunizing and Restoring Beliefs against Persuasion.” Sociometry 24: 184–197.10.2307/2786067). For instance, college students who were forewarned about credit card marketing practices and the hazards of debt were more resistant to credit card solicitations than those who were not forewarned (Compton and Pfau 2004 Compton, Josh A., and Michael Pfau. 2004. “Use of Inoculation to Foster Resistance to Credit Card Marketing Targeting College Students.” Journal of Applied Communication Research 32 (4): 343–364.10.1080/0090988042000276014). Furthermore, in a study specifically about native advertising, participants primed about the presence of a native ad were more likely to recognize it and more likely to perceive its persuasive intent (Wu et al. 2016 Wu, Mu, Yan Huang, Ruobing Li, Denise Sevick Bortree, Fan Yang, Anli Xiao, and Ruoxu Wang. 2016. “A Tale of Two Sources in Native Advertising: Examining the Effects of Source Credibility and Priming on Content, Organizations, and Media Evaluations.” American Behavioral Scientist 60 (12): 1492–1509.10.1177/0002764216660139). Thus, it is expected that people who are alerted to the practices of native advertising will be more likely to recognize and interpret it when exposed. H4: People inoculated by a forewarning of native ad content are more likely to recognize native advertising when exposed than people who are not forewarned. H5: People inoculated by a forewarning of native ad content are (a) more likely to perceive the persuasive intent, and (b) less likely to be persuaded by native advertising than people who are not forewarned.

Measures Participant ability to discern advertising content from editorial content—or, advertising recognition—was measured by asking respondents whether there was any advertising on the news Web page they saw. Participants in the branded article conditions were significantly more likely to report seeing advertising (34 percent) than were those in the unbranded article conditions (21 percent) [χ2(1, N = 375) = 6.88, p < 0.01]. Following Tutaj and van Reijmersdal (2012 Tutaj, Karolina, and Eva A. van Reijmersdal. 2012. “Effects of Online Advertising Format and Persuasion Knowledge on Audience Reactions.” Journal of Marketing Communications 18 (1): 5–18.10.1080/13527266.2011.620765), respondents who reported affirmatively were asked an open-ended question eliciting what made them think there was advertising. Responses were coded as 1 if they mentioned the “sponsored content” disclosure (18 percent) or 0 if they did not mention the disclosure (82 percent). Since only 19 participants met this “narrow” definition of advertising recognition, we also calculated a “broad” definition of advertising recognition. Broad recognition of advertising (60 percent) also included those who claimed the article was an ad because of cues such as the tone of the article, repeated mention of the sponsor’s name, or a link to the sponsor’s website at the bottom of the article where readers could get more information. Participant advertising recognition was used as an independent variable throughout the analysis. Various dependent measures were used to measure the effects of native advertising. An ad’s persuasiveness was measured via purchase intent which was operationalized by asking participants how likely they would be to purchase a product from the company featured in the article they read. This was assessed using a seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = extremely likely to 7 = extremely unlikely (mean = 2.80, SD = 1.68). Attitudes toward the article and publisher were measured using a series of seven-point semantic differential scales that included unappealing/appealing, good/bad, unpleasant/pleasant, favorable/unfavorable, and unlikeable/likeable. After reverse coding to match word polarity, the five items were combined to form index measures of attitudes toward the article (mean = 5.77, SD = 1.20; α = 0.94), attitudes toward the brand (mean = 5.95, SD = 1.05; α = 0.94), and attitudes toward the publisher (mean = 5.04, SD = 1.22; α = 0.96). Credibility of the article and publisher were measured using a series of seven-point Likert scales on the attributes of honesty, trustworthiness, conviction, bias, and credibility, where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. After reverse-coding to achieve word polarity, the five items were combined to form index measures of article credibility (mean = 4.99, SD = 1.25; α = 0.85), brand credibility (mean = 5.20, SD = 1.10; α = 0.80), and publisher credibility (mean = 4.74, SD = 1.17; α = 0.84). Perceptions of persuasive intent were operationalized by assessing a participant’s level of PK about the article (Rozendaal, Buijzen, and Valkenburg 2010 Rozendaal, E., M. Buijzen, and P. Valkenburg. 2010. “Comparing Children’s and Adults’ Cognitive Advertising Competencies in the Netherlands.” Journal of Children and Media 4: 77–89.10.1080/17482790903407333). This was measured using six seven-point Likert items where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. Two items referred to article selling intent (e.g. “The article encourages readers to buy a product”), two items involved article persuasive intent (e.g. “The article encourages readers to think favorably about a specific company”), and two items were about the informational content of the article. The six items were subjected to a principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Two components had eigenvalues over Kaiser’s criterion of 1 (Field 2009 Field, A. 2009. Discovering Statistics Using SPSS. 3rd ed. London: Sage.) and in combination explained 61 percent of the variance. One component represents selling intent and the other represents persuasive intent. Following Wojdynski and Evans (2016 Wojdynski, Bartosz W., and Nathaniel J. Evans. 2016. “Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 45 (2): 157–168.10.1080/00913367.2015.1115380), four items (α = 0.70) were averaged to form a single measurement of article persuasive and selling intent (mean = 4.71, SD = 1.14). Similarly, publisher PK was measured using four seven-point Likert items. Two items referred to publisher selling intent (e.g. “The publisher is encouraging readers to buy a product”) and two items involved publisher persuasive intent (e.g. “The publisher is encouraging readers to think favorably about a specific company”). The four items (α = 0.79) were averaged to form a single measurement of publisher persuasive and selling intent (mean = 4.48, SD = 1.28). Since the article and publisher measures of PK were significantly correlated (r2 = 0.66, p < 0.01), the eight items of article and publisher PK were averaged to form a single measure of PK persuasive and selling intent (α = 0.84, mean = 4.59, SD = 1.11).

Manipulation Checks Manipulation checks measured participant’s article content understanding and source recognition. The checks included measurement of article content recall and source recall. Article content recall was measured using a nominal scale. Among those who saw a branded article, 99 percent were correctly able to identify the company as Ben & Jerry’s. Among those who saw an unbranded article, 91 percent were correctly able to identify that the article was about no specific company. To measure source recall, participants were asked to identify which of five news organizations published the article they were shown. Among those in the digital condition, 35 percent correctly identified UpdateNews.com as the publisher. Another 35 percent incorrectly identified NewsToday.com as the publisher. While a majority of participants did not accurately recall the correct source in the start-up condition, 70 percent did recognize the source as a digital publisher rather than a legacy publisher. Among participants in the legacy media condition, 51 percent correctly identified the New York Times (versus 22 percent incorrectly identifying NewsToday.com) and 42 percent correctly identified the Wall Street Journal (versus 25 percent incorrectly identifying NewsToday.com) as the publisher. Again, while not a majority, the largest plurality of respondents was able to correctly identify the source in the legacy conditions.

Results The first two hypotheses predicted that content presented as a news article would be evaluated more favorably and more credibly than content labeled as native advertising (H1) or content perceived as native advertising (H2). These hypotheses were tested using multiple independent sample t-tests. Recognition of native advertising (i.e. perception) had a significantly negative effect on attitudes toward the content [t(145) = 3.12, p < 0.01] and perceived credibility of the content [t(145) = 4.49, p < 0.0001] when compared to content presented as a news article. Content labeled but not necessarily recognized as native advertising was not perceived differently from content labeled as a news article. Thus, H1a and H1b were not supported, but H2a and H2b were supported. H3 examined whether publisher reputation moderates the effects of native advertising persuasion. Specifically, it predicted that native advertising on a news site with greater publisher credibility would be more persuasive than native advertising on a news site with lower credibility. No significant differences were found between the levels of purchase intent when comparing a native ad exhibited on a legacy versus digital-only site [t = 1.44, p = not significant (ns)]. Thus, there is no support for H3. Our research questions explored whether (RQ1) advertising recognition influences credibility of the publisher, and (RQ2) whether recognition of native advertising affects reader perceptions of publisher credibility differently for legacy media versus digital media. A χ2 test [χ2(1, N = 109) = 7.34, p < 0.01] indicated that people in the digital conditions were more likely (67 percent) to broadly recognize advertising than those in the legacy conditions (41 percent). In turn, native advertising recognition had a negative effect on attitudes toward both legacy [t(75) = 1.65, p ≤ 0.10] and digital publishers [t(66) = 5.34, p < 0.0001] when compared to content labeled as a news article (see Figure 2). Moreover, narrow recognition of native advertising hurt attitudes toward digital publishers more than legacy publishers [t(17) = 2.44, p < 0.05]. In the context of affecting the credibility of a publisher, the results were directionally similar. However, the only relationship that was statistically significant was the decline in credibility of digital publishers between those who saw content labeled as a news article (mean = 4.93, SD = 0.98) and those who narrowly recognized the content as native advertising (mean = 3.53, SD = 1.62) [t(64) = 3.61, p < 0.001]. These results suggest digital publishers suffer more reputational damage from native advertising than do legacy publishers. Saving Media or Trading on Trust? The effects of native advertising on audience perceptions of legacy and online news publishers All authors Michelle A. Amazeen Ashley R.

Overall, only 23 percent of respondents correctly identified the native advertising article as sponsored content. A χ2 test [χ2(1, N = 248) = 5.94, p < 0.05] indicated that forewarned participants (inoculated) were more likely to believe there was advertising on the news page they viewed (40 percent) compared to those who were not forewarned (25 percent). However, those that believed they were exposed to advertising were not always accurate in their explanations. For example, some thought they saw banner ads at the top of the article or in a sidebar (neither of which existed). Others were unable to specify why they thought they saw advertising. Forewarned participants were directionally, but not significantly, more likely to (narrowly) recognize the sponsored content label (27 percent) compared to those who were not forewarned (17 percent) [χ2(1, N = 82) = 1.12, p = ns]. Using the broader definition of native advertising recognition, 60 percent of respondents considered the article to be an ad and yielded marginally significant results. Those who were forewarned were more likely (65 percent) to recognize native advertising (defined broadly) than were those who were not forewarned (50 percent) [χ2(1, N = 82) = 1.87, p < 0.10, one-tailed]. Thus, results suggest directional support for H4. H5 predicted that inoculation would influence the effects of native advertising on persuasion. Specifically, it was expected that forewarned people would be (1) more likely to perceive the persuasive intent of a message in terms of PK, and (2) less likely to be persuaded by native advertising in terms of purchase intent compared to people who were not forewarned. Inoculation did not have an effect on PK [t(79) = 0.00, p = ns] or on purchase intent [t(79) = 0.34, p = ns]. Even when comparing participants who were successfully inoculated based upon a broad definition of advertising recognition, there were no differences compared to participants who were not inoculated who did not broadly recognize advertising. Thus, the results do not support H5a and H5b.

Discussion The results of this study have implications for the news industry, Federal Trade Commission policy, and for advertisers. First, this study expands the “uneasy relationship” Carlson (2015 Carlson, Matt. 2015. “When News Sites Go Native: Redefining the Advertising–Editorial Divide in Response to Native Advertising.” Journalism 16 (7): 849–865., 851) observed between advertisers and journalistic publishers surrounding the use of native advertising to also include audiences. That is, publishers need to consider carefully whether the seeming benefits of native advertising—near-term revenue—are worth jeopardizing their relationships with readers by the potential loss of favorable evaluations and credibility among audiences that this study indicates. Second, consistent with Wojdynski and Evans (2016 Wojdynski, Bartosz W., and Nathaniel J. Evans. 2016. “Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 45 (2): 157–168.10.1080/00913367.2015.1115380), we find that simply labeling native advertising is not sufficient for fostering recognition among readers. This study extends their research by testing an intervention, an interruptive message that successfully forewarned readers about the use of sponsored content by publishers. Last, the theoretical contributions of our research demonstrate that characteristics of publishers influence both advertising recognition as well as the role advertising recognition plays on consumer behavior and evaluations. These findings may affect where advertisers choose to place native advertising but also whether certain types of publishers want to accept native advertising on their sites—decisions that may be incompatible. The ability of consumers to recognize native advertising has been a concern of the Federal Trade Commission (2015 Federal Trade Commission. 2015. “Native Advertising: A Guide for Businesses.” https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/native-advertising-guide-businesses). As such, its guidance to advertisers is to employ clear and prominent disclosures when the commercial nature of content is uncertain to a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances.88. The “reasonable consumer” standard is based upon the Federal Trade Commission’s Policy Statement on Deception (Miller 1983 Miller, James C. III. 1983. “FTC Policy Statement on Deception.” Federal Trade Commission, October 14. https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1983/10/ftc-policy-statement-deception).View all notes Only 17 percent of participants in our study correctly identified material labeled “sponsored content”—the most recognizable language according to Wojdynski and Evans (2016 Wojdynski, Bartosz W., and Nathaniel J. Evans. 2016. “Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 45 (2): 157–168.10.1080/00913367.2015.1115380)—as advertising. However, consistent with inoculation theory, we find suggestive support that an interruptive message forewarning readers about the use of sponsored content by publishers directionally, but not significantly, increased recognition to 27 percent. Using a broader definition of advertising recognition also demonstrated that inoculating readers with an interruptive intervention marginally increased recognition from 50 to 65 percent. Thus, advertisers, publishers, and policymakers now have a choice in alternate interventions that can be effectively used to increase consumer understanding of the commercial nature of content. Besides using the “sponsored content” label (rather than language that is ambiguous to consumers), native advertising that mimics journalism can employ middle-positioned (within-content) disclosures (Wojdynski and Evans 2016 Wojdynski, Bartosz W., and Nathaniel J. Evans. 2016. “Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising.” Journal of Advertising 45 (2): 157–168.10.1080/00913367.2015.1115380) or an interruptive forewarning to alert readers about the nature of the content. With the innovations of pop-ups and interstitials, the technological infrastructure exists to employ the interruptive intervention. Although this proposition may be counter to the intended obscurity of native advertising disclosures, it has precedence. Facebook is reportedly considering using pop-up technology to alert its readers to fake news articles that have been disputed by fact-checkers (Isaac 2016 Isaac, Mike. 2016. “Facebook Mounts Effort to Limit Tide of Fake News.” The New York times, December 15. http://nyti.ms/2hKDeO2). At a point in time when media trust is at its lowest in recorded history (Swift 2016 Swift, Art. 2016. “Americans’ Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low.” Gallup, September 14. http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx), some media publishers may finally be confronting the moral obligations and ethical standards of their industry even if it goes against their financial interests.99. The extent to which this is happening is beyond the scope of this study, although it seems unlikely given that some publishers have actually sought to make native advertising disclosures less noticeable to appease advertisers (Einstein 2016 Einstein, Mara. 2016. Black Ops Advertising: Native Ads, Content Marketing, and the Covert World of the Digital Sell. New York : O/R Books., 106).View all notes This study also extends knowledge on the practice of native advertising by better understanding how it interacts with and affects publishers. Although no differences in purchase intent were noted between when native ads were present on legacy versus digital sites, people were more likely to recognize native advertising when it was on a digital site. It may be that the absence of reputational cues from a fictitious site made participants more aware of explicit disclosures. Furthermore, both legacy and digital publishers were evaluated less favorably by participants when native advertising was recognized. Attitudes toward the publisher and perceptions of its credibility declined for both, although digital publishers suffered greater attitudinal damage than did legacy publishers who may benefit from their established reputation. The implications of these findings appear to be conflicting for advertisers and journalistic publishers. It is in the interest of advertisers to place native ads on legacy media sites because they are less likely to be recognized as advertising. However, by accepting native advertising, both types of publishers harm their reputations, although digital-only publishers are at greater risk of reputational damage than are legacy publishers. What this study is unable to answer is how perceptions of publishers may change across time and with varying amounts of native advertising content. These are acknowledged limitations of the present study, but issues that could be addressed by future research. The projected growth of native advertising (Adyoulike 2015 Adyoulike. 2015. “Native Advertising Set to Double by 2018.” PRNewswire, December 18. http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/native-advertising-set-to-double-by-2018-562919861.html) suggests either a lack of awareness among publishers of the negative effects of native advertising on audience attitudes and perceived credibility of publishers or a rejection of the normative principles enshrined by the church–state wall as observed by Carlson (2015 Carlson, Matt. 2015. “When News Sites Go Native: Redefining the Advertising–Editorial Divide in Response to Native Advertising.” Journalism 16 (7): 849–865.), Coddington (2015 Coddington, Mark. 2015. “The Wall Becomes a Curtain: Revisiting Journalism’s News-Business Boundary.” In Boundaries of Journalism: Professionalism, Practices and Participation, edited by M. Carlson and S. C. Lewis, 67–82. New York : Routledge.), Conill (2016 Conill, Raul Ferrier. 2016. “Camouflaging Church as State: An Exploratory Study of Journalism’s Native Advertising.” Journalism Studies. doi:10.1080/1461670X.2016.1165138.), and others. Best practices for ensuring editorial independence involve maintaining editorial control without relinquishing responsibilities to funders of content—regardless of who those funders are (American Press Institute 2017 American Press Institute. 2017. “Guidance on Philanthropic Funding of Media and News.” January 12. https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/nonprofit-funding-guidance/; DeLorme and Fedler 2005 DeLorme, Denise. E, and Fred Fedler. 2005. “An Historical Analysis of Journalists’Attitudes toward Advertisers and Advertising’s Influence.” American Journalism 22 (2): 7–40.; Kovach and Rosenstiel 2001 Kovach, Bill, and Tom Rosenstiel. 2001. The Elements of Journalism. What Newspeople Should Know and the Public Should Expect. New York: Crown Publishers.). Nonetheless, a growing number of publications are enlisting editorial staff in creating native advertising, in some cases contractually stipulating this as an obligation of writers (Bilton 2014 Bilton, Ricardo. 2014. “Meet the Publishers Who Ask Their Reporters to Write Native Ads.” Digiday, June 5. http://digiday.com/publishers/publishers-enlist-reporters-write-native-ad-content/). This includes legacy publishers such as Conde Nast (with publications like The New Yorker and Vanity Fair) and Time Inc. (People, Sports Illustrated, Time) in the hard-news business space where the church–state wall should presumably be strongest (Moses 2015 Moses, Lucia. 2015. “Editors React: Conde Nast Enlists Its Journalists to Write Ads.” Digiday, January 27. http://digiday.com/publishers/conde-nast-enlist-journalists-create-ads/). News organizations should also be transparent about who funded the content, not only from a journalistic integrity standpoint, but also because journalism demands transparency from other institutions (American Press Institute 2017 American Press Institute. 2017. “Guidance on Philanthropic Funding of Media and News.” January 12. https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/nonprofit-funding-guidance/). Publishers cannot have it both ways—obscuring the transparency of commercial content in their publications yet demanding transparency from those they hold to account in their reporting. Although creating content confusion is not a new practice (Baerug and Harro-Loit 2012 Baerug, Jan Richard, and Halliki Harro-Loit. 2012. “Journalism Embracing Advertising as Traditional Journalism Discourse Becomes Marginal: A Comparative Study of European MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events) Magazines.” Journalism Practice 6 (2): 172–186.10.1080/17512786.2011.616647; DeLorme and Fedler 2005 DeLorme, Denise. E, and Fred Fedler. 2005. “An Historical Analysis of Journalists’Attitudes toward Advertisers and Advertising’s Influence.” American Journalism 22 (2): 7–40.; Einstein 2016 Einstein, Mara. 2016. Black Ops Advertising: Native Ads, Content Marketing, and the Covert World of the Digital Sell. New York : O/R Books.), this growing willingness to blur the boundaries (Conill 2016 Conill, Raul Ferrier. 2016. “Camouflaging Church as State: An Exploratory Study of Journalism’s Native Advertising.” Journalism Studies. doi:10.1080/1461670X.2016.1165138.) has established the conditions ripe for the proliferation of other content providers who wish to operate in an environment of opaqueness: fake news purveyors. Thus, as Pickard (2017 Pickard, Victor. 2017. “The Problem with Our Media is Extreme Commercialism.” The Nation, January 30. https://www.thenation.com/article/the-problem-with-our-media-is-extreme-commercialism/) observes, “digital journalism’s increasing reliance on exposing readers to invasive and deceptive advertising” is a problem and makes it much harder for journalists to call out practices that fund their profession. As with any research effort, some caveats must be noted. While the native advertising stimuli used in this study were pre-tested for enjoyment and interest, it is possible that the findings may vary if a different company was the focus of the ad. Given the furious criticisms drawn by the Atlantic for its Church of Scientology native ad (Carlson 2015 Carlson, Matt. 2015. “When News Sites Go Native: Redefining the Advertising–Editorial Divide in Response to Native Advertising.” Journalism 16 (7): 849–865.), the type of client may, indeed, have an interaction effect with the publisher type, as demonstrated by Wu et al. (2016 Wu, Mu, Yan Huang, Ruobing Li, Denise Sevick Bortree, Fan Yang, Anli Xiao, and Ruoxu Wang. 2016. “A Tale of Two Sources in Native Advertising: Examining the Effects of Source Credibility and Priming on Content, Organizations, and Media Evaluations.” American Behavioral Scientist 60 (12): 1492–1509.10.1177/0002764216660139). As native advertising is increasingly adopted by health communication advocates and even for political advocacy, it will be important to test whether these findings generalize to other types of companies and causes. Furthermore, article-based content is but one of many variations on the types of native advertising currently being employed. Thus, these findings are likely less applicable in cases where an ad is not emulating journalistic content. It is also important to note that these findings are based upon one of two legacy publishers and a fictitious digital publisher. The data indicating reputation damage may be overdetermined by the lower source-credibility condition publisher being unknown to respondents. The results may differ if comparisons were made to a familiar digital-only publisher such as Huffington Post or Vice. However, research does exist indicating that even unknown sources can be just as credible and persuasive as known sources in certain contexts (Weber, Dunaway, and Johnson 2012 Weber, Christopher, Johanna Dunaway, and Tyler Johnson. 2012. “It’s All in the Name: Source Cue Ambiguity and the Persuasive Appeal of Campaign Ads.” Political Behavior 34: 561–584.10.1007/s11109-011-9172-y). Nonetheless, future studies should consider implementing genuine sources in all conditions. In conclusion, these findings expand on the types of discussions about advertising–editorial normative guidelines raised by Carlson (2015 Carlson, Matt. 2015. “When News Sites Go Native: Redefining the Advertising–Editorial Divide in Response to Native Advertising.” Journalism 16 (7): 849–865.). The blurred boundaries surrounding the convergence of news and commercialism do, indeed, diminish the credibility of online publishers as critics have feared. What remains open is whether the reputational risks evidenced in the study outweigh the potential for income generation from native advertising. What also remains unsettled is whether this type of boundary-blurring journalism is acceptable to informed audiences. If the emphatic response from one of our participants to the open-ended question about whether they noticed any advertising is an indication—“The entire damn thing is an ad. Everything is a goddamn ad now!”—publishers need to be doing more research on audience responses to native advertising.
