The Albert Einstein Center for Fundamental Physics (AEC) has been founded in 2011. Its aim is to foster high-level research and teaching in fundamental physics at the University of Bern. The main focus is on experimental and theoretical particle physics and its applications (e.g. medical physics), as well as on the related spinoff and outreach activities.

The AEC has been initially established with contribution of the Institute for Theoretical Physics (ITP) and of the Laboratory for High-Energy Physics (LHEP) of the University of Bern. With its over 100 members the AEC is among the largest university groups of scientists working on particle physics in Switzerland, and a strong player at the international level.

Our educational activities are organized together with Physics and Astronomy.
