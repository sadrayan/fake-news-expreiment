"We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States, undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country." - Barack Hussein Obama

The full quote:

"Those who enter the country illegally, and those who employ them, are disrespecting the rule of law, and they are showing disregard to those who are following the law. We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States, undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country."
