The LIBRE Initiative
Founded in 2011, The LIBRE InitiativeÂ® is a non-partisan, non-profit grassroots organization that advances the principles and values of a free and open society to empower the U.S. Hispanic community so it can thrive and contribute to a more prosperous America.



LIBRE is dedicated to informing the U.S. Hispanic community about the benefits of a constitutionally limited government, property rights, rule of law, sound money supply and free enterprise through a variety of community events, research and policy initiatives that protect our free and open society.



Our mission is to equip the Hispanic community with the tools they need to be prosperous. We are committed to developing a network of Hispanic pro-liberty activists across the United States so that our message reaches every corner of the country.
