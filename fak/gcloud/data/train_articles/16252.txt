I have always relied on the Department of Justice to be a credible source of information--as have other human rights and anti-trafficking organizations. 2011 is the most recent numbers available. To our knowledge, this is also the first time that DOJ has put out some disclaimer on the 2011 stat.

Moreover, the stat correlates with emerging data we are seeing from states such as Florida. New York, California, and Connecticut where many if not most of the children identified as trafficked and exploited are US kids, and from the foster care system. And it is what we are consistently hearing from organizations serving trafficked and exploited children and youth.

Thanks and Be Well,

Malika

Good afternoon.

I write because I am researching the accuracy of a statement Tuesday by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn that “more than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens.” His spokesman, Drew Brandewie, who urged me to contact you, noted this 2011 Justice Department report, which has the 83 percent figure (and Table 5, which seems to suggest 75 percent; I am inquiring). Separately, a DOJ spokeswoman, Kara McCarthy, told us by email the cited “data should be interpreted with caution because they aren’t nationally representative; they’re only based on task force data from some cities.”

What information do you consider reliable on the citizenship of victims of sexual trafficking in the U.S.? Why?

What expert or experts would you suggest we consult?

I would be happy to visit for our story by email or phone. I am hoping to complete this story by midday Friday.

Thanks.
