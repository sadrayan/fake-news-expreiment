__________________________________________________________________ ALTRUSAGRAM Official Newsletter of Altrusa International, Inc., of New York Summer Issue, 2014 __________________________________________________________________ PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE I have always considered autumn to be the season of new beginnings, no matter what the calendar says. Adults come back rejuvenated by their summer vacations to tackle the workplace anew, while kids of all ages anticipate the new school year (either eagerly or with dread). This fall also starts a new chapter in my life as the incoming president of the Altrusa International Club of New York. I suppose you could say that I am eagerly anticipating my new duties…with dread (just kidding!!). I am truly looking forward to the upcoming year and would like to extend a warm welcome to our returning and new members. To our new members, in particular, welcome into the fold and thank you for joining us. As I began to prepare for the upcoming club year, I revisited the mission statement for Altrusa, to wit: “We make our communities better through leadership, partnership and service.” Now, that is a very simple statement that packs a whole load of meaning. I started to think of other quotes of similar simplicity and immediate impact: “Without community service, we would not have a strong quality of life. It's important to the person who serves as well as the recipient. It's the way in which we ourselves grow and develop.” --Dorothy Height, educator and social activist Each member’s reasons for joining Altrusa are as unique as the individual who espouses them, but I am sure that we all believe in the adage that the reward is in the giving and in the sharing. In the recent past, New York Altrusans have undertaken such projects as serving lunch to the homeless and hungry at the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen; donating books and clothing (especially pajamas) to children in need in shelters and in the Hour Children program; and donating funds for the purchase of bed nets and solar cookers for distribution in developing countries. The smiles of thanks we have received are our reward. Over the next year, we will continue with similar projects, along with developing some brand-new ones that, hopefully, will spark the interest of current members, while attracting new recruits to our ranks. These new projects, if they are to succeed, will require active and thoughtful collaboration of our membership with prestigious outside organizations. Which brings me to the next quote: "Unity is strength. . . when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved." --Mattie J. T. Stepanek, peace activist and NY Times-bestselling poet and essayist who died at the age of 13 from a rare form of muscular dystrophy A club, by definition, is a team, i.e., an association working collaboratively in pursuit of common interests. Every culture has proverbs that praise the value of, and the strength to be found in, teamwork and collaboration; here are but two: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” -- African proverb “One chopstick is very easily to be broken, but ten chopsticks together are so hard to break.” –Chinese proverb I do not think I would be remiss in saying that we all recognize the value of teamwork and of increasing our chopsticks (um… our membership), so as to better undertake our good works in both the local and global communities. And, collaboration with outside organizations could only be to the benefit of all parties. So, the plan is, simply, to increase our active projects and embark on outside collaboration to complement our regular dinner meeting roster of speakers, who will continue to give talks on current events and other interesting topics. In closing, I hope to see everyone at the September meeting at the National Arts Club and start the year off with a bang, and not a whimper. My personal thanks to outgoing president, Catherine Kleszczewski, and last year’s board, as well as to the incoming board for all your support and good wishes. See you on September 23rd! Anne Marie Basic, President ****************************************************************** NEW YORK CLUB OFFICERS Newly-elected Officers were installed at the June Dinner Meeting, along with a new Board of Directors.

President Anne Marie Basic wants this dinner to be a “get to know you” meeting with an exchange of ideas and suggestions for the coming year. Yearbooks will be distributed and you can sign up for a Committee. Hopefully, you will all be able to attend. ****************************************************************** OUR FOUNDING MEMBERS Back in June, I found myself at a stone wall while I was doing some research on the computer, and thought it would be interesting to see what could be found out about the Altrusa International New York Club’s charter members. Starting with our most famous member, Eleanor Roosevelt. I’m sure you all know her history. Her husband, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was Governor of New York, and 32nd President of the US. She was a tireless worker to improve human condition and the United Nation’s first Chairperson for the Committee on Human Rights. Mrs. Roosevelt joined in the first year and was not considered a charter member. Of the original charter members, nineteen in all, information was found for only twelve. The first secretary, Vera Bull Hull, was married to an inventor, William C. Hull. As administratrix of his estate in September, 1947, Mrs. Hull filed for a patent on her husband’s invention of an appliance in the form of a footrest (situated at foot of hospital bed) that enabled a patient to exercise his leg muscles while lying in bed. It also had the advantage of lifting the covers off the legs and feet for added comfort. Dr. Lillian M. Gilbreth, is well-known to most of us due to her daughters’ novels, “Cheaper By The Dozen” and “Belles on Their Toes,” and the film portrayal by Myrna Loy. She was a well-respected mechanical engineer by profession. Florence Brobeck wrote best-selling cookbooks and had a weekly column in The New York Times in 1936-37. She was also associate editor of The New York Herald Tribune Women’s Page in the 1940’s. Elsie Eaves was the first female associate member of The American Society of Civil Engineers and a founding member of the American Association of Cost Engineers, now known as the ACCE. Gloria Browning was a dressmaker. May Alexander was a dress salesperson. Margaret B. Benson, born in England, was a merchandising clerk. While Grace M. Clarke, also born in England, was a nurse manager. Catherine Fisher was a supervisor for the telephone company, and Elizabeth Phillips was a secretary for the telephone company. Susie W. Smith was a railroad company clerk. Elizabeth R. Wylie, born in Scotland, she was a manager and was married late in life to Dr. Frederick Demarest. Regrettably, I was unable to get the official names of the companies that employed these women nor the names of the educational institutions they attended. It’s a long shot, but if anyone knows anything more about these women, or the other charter members – Evelyn Hopper, charter President; Eva B. Gage; Frances Massey; Bertha Miller; Cora S. Riefer; Helen Waldo; Jeanette Ware -- please let us know as it would be nice to have this history. ****************************************************************** 3 ****************************************************************** ANNUAL BELMONT FUNDRAISER FOR THE NY CLUB’S FOUNDATION This year’s fundraiser at Belmont Race Track was a lot of fun for all who attended. There was a true air of excitement. While the profits were down about $200 from last year’s fundraiser, it was a successful effort. In fact, the lesser profit had more to do with the fact that Belmont raised their prices but we chose not to pass that on to our loyal attendees. ************************************************************* THIRTEEN HELPFUL HOUSEHOLD HINTS Shirley Day has sent these hints which you may find very helpful. The simplest way to slice cherry tomatoes is to place them between to lids and run a knife through all of them at once. Do you find yourself throwing out hard blocks of brown sugar every time you go to the package? Try storing a few marshmallows in the bag with the brown sugar. Make sure that the bag is airtight. Don’t have a watering can? Create one by puncturing holes in the top of a used milk bottle. Remove pet hair from furniture and carpets with a squeegee. Water straight from the tap becomes cloudy when frozen. To make ice cubes crystal clear, allow a kettle of boiled water to cool slightly and use this to fill your ice cube trays. Use a large muffin tin to cook stuffed peppers in the oven - it will help keep them upright. Add half a teaspoon of baking soda to the water when hard-boiling eggs to make the shells incredibly easy to peel off. To tell if eggs are fresh, immerse them in a bowl of water. Fresh eggs will lie on the bottom, while stale eggs will float to the surface. Grandchildren are a blessing but the wee ones can’t always keep within the lines or even on the paper. In that case, WD40 can be used to remove crayon marks from any surface! To clean a wooden chopping board, sprinkle on a handful of Kosher salt and rub with half a lemon. Rinse with clean water and dry to ensure it is clean and germ-free. To sharpen scissors, simply cut through sandpaper. Store bed sheets inside their pillowcases for easy storage and access. I’ve tried this, not only does it give easy access and storage, it makes an attractive and neat shelf in the linen closet. Psst! Don’t tell the Container Store, but you can use egg boxes to store delicate Christmas tree decorations. Use chalk to remove grease stains from clothes. Simply rub white chalk on the affected area and wash as normal - the chalk will absorb the grease and be washed away in the cycle. ************************************************************* The Altrusa Club of New York has a website: http://altrusanewyorkcity.tripod.com .

It feels like summer! It is time to put away the winter clothes and bring out the summer wardrobe! First of all, I want to thank everyone on the board and all the members as well! Special thanks to Penny for being on top of our finances, for organizing our reservations at the National Arts Club, and for countless hours of putting together the Treasurer’s report and our biggest fundraiser of the year at Belmont Racetrack; to Audrey, for putting together the directory, newsletter, and for giving me guidance; to Jessica, for hosting wine and cheese events and for her guidance; to Carole Kennedy for hosting and organizing our jewelry workshop, to Julie, my mother, for throwing me into the “lion’s den.” I thank everyone who has not been mentioned here by name. You are and have been an inspiration to me! I want to wish our new board members, especially President-Elect Anne Marie Basic, a successful and uplifting future for our club and for those charities we assist and a thank you especially to our Foundation board members (Thank you, Carole Lancaster, for keeping it together). A big thank you goes to Maureen McGough for taking the time to install our new slate of officers! Maureen, you are a powerhouse! It is difficult to find the right words as this is my final message to you as President of Altrusa International Club of New York other than giving suggestions on how to help our communities grow stronger. There have been many news stories of caution. Tornados, murder trials, kidnapped school girls from Nigeria, a Korean ferry boat that sunk leaving countless victims and grieving families…more bad news than good news. Some stories are receiving more attention than others. There was one shocking story that did not make much of a splash: "Widow Loses House Over $6.30 Tax Bill!" (Forbes,(April 29, 2014) NBC News) What?! Apparently, the Pennsylvania Court was not flexible regarding the defendant paying the remaining balance of her property taxes. Without going into great detail, she is a widow. Her late husband left her the house and all of the finances that go with it. She relied on him 100% to pay all the bills and taxes. She had nothing to do with it. What’s the lesson here? I know that many of you, if not all of the members in our club are financially literate. If you know of someone who is not, it is a necessary and good deed to take action and educate that person in finance, even if they say that they do not have a “head for numbers.” I repeat. Educate someone about personal finance: a student, a wife (who will someday become a widow or divorced – always a possibility), an unemployed person, a cousin, etc. Some might not want to be taught (Please ask why, because ignorance is NOT bliss in this case!). Send gentle reminders such as sending them stories of financial misfortune or have them check out these websites: www.investopedia.com or www.smckids.com (for kids).This is not a popular topic. No one likes to talk about money. BUT no one likes to eat cat food either! Another article that I read was in today’s Wall Street Journal (May 12, 2014), “Should Companies Monitor Their Employees’ Social Media?” This seems like common sense, but if any of you have a social media count, you should ask yourself, “Why do you have one?” There have been many articles that list mostly the cons of having such an account. For example, if you announce to your Facebook friends that you will be on vacation for a week, guess what? You might be inviting someone to break into your home, or to live in your house. Ugh! Also, I see people posting pics of themselves at crazy parties, children’s activities. Okay, be aware that you are opening up yourself to potential employers rejecting your job application. Also, there was a story of a mother who actually posted her child’s weekly schedule! Guess what? Her child was kidnapped. I don’t know if the child was ever found. My point is this: even though some of us feel safe and secure in the land of cyberspace, it should be treated as if we are swimming in the ocean of shark-infested waters. Sometimes there is a false sense of security (i.e. Hackers are able to steal millions of debit and credit card numbers). There are many people out there who are wolves in sheep’s clothing (or they are simply nuts). Be cautious in who you confide in. Caveat emptor. I feel the urgency to inform and to bring attention to issues that are not so obvious, to things that we don’t want to talk about. On a lighter note, I have learned a great deal in these last two years. Everyone who has served as club president and our members, both longtime and new, have taught me how to become a better leader. A true leader listens, and is accessible to their board and club members. Throughout history, the most successful leaders were people who see the world in a realistic, sober fashion, and not being a “Pollyanna,” (who has always had their way in life). True leaders have the ability to empathize and to remain calm in a crisis, but find a solution rather than complain and not act. Thank you for this opportunity to serve you! Be aware, be safe, and have a “MAH-vel – ous” summer everyone! See you all at our fundraiser at Belmont on Sunday, June 22nd!

Catherine Kleszczewski, May 12, 2014 ****************************************************************** APRIL DINNER MEETING The Dinner Meeting that would normally have been held on Tuesday, April 22nd and was to be incorporated into the Friday, April 25th UN Woman’s Project Orange dinner at Audrey Braver’s apartment at 21-55 34th Avenue, Apt 6B, Long Island City. That dinner was to have celebrated the six month anniversary of UN Project Orange and a small fundraiser for the New York Club. ************************************************************* ANNUAL BELMONT FUNDRAISER This year’s racing event will be on Sunday, June 22, 2014. The price of a single ticket is $125.00 each, buy two and the price is reduced to $100.00 each. Buy two, bring a friend. It’s a bargain! In fact invite all your friends.

The Members voted on this increase at the March meeting. Dues renewal notice is on the last page of this newsletter. Please complete in full. Dues must be paid no later than May 31st to avoid the $30.00 late payment fee. ****************************************************************** May Dinner Meeting Please note: Change of Date. The May Dinner Meeting will be on May 20 th , not May 28 th, as originally scheduled due to a change in the National Arts Calendar. District Two Governor, Maureen McGough, will join us and perform the Installation of Officers. This is our last regular meeting of the Altrusa International Club of New York and all members should try their best to attend—especially and most importantly, the newly-elected officers. ****************************************************************** Memorial Day Memorial Day is coming up as well as D-Day. So many other events such as the worst tragedy of the US Navy in history: the USS Indianapolis, which delivered the atom bomb. The ship sank on July 30, 1945. Out of 1,197 sailors, 300 went down with the ship. The rest survived only to find themselves in shark-infested waters for about a week. Only 317 men survived. Google it if interested in further details. Monopoly - I Did Not Know This!

(You'll never look at the game the same way again!)



Starting in 1941, an increasing number of British Airmen found themselves as the involuntary guests of the Third Reich, and the Crown was casting about for ways and means to facilitate their escape...



Now obviously, one of the most helpful aids to that end is a useful and accurate map, one showing not only where stuff was, but also showing the locations of 'safe houses' where a POW on-the-lam could go for food and shelter.



Paper maps had some real drawbacks -- they make a lot of noise when you open and fold them, they wear out rapidly, and if they get wet, they turn into mush.



Someone in MI-5 (similar to America's OSS) got the idea of printing escape maps on silk. It's durable, can be scrunched-up into tiny wads, and unfolded as many times as needed, and makes no noise whatsoever.



At that time, there was only one manufacturer in Great Britain that had perfected the technology of printing on silk, and that was John Waddington, Ltd. When approached by the government, the firm was only too happy to do its bit for the war effort.



By pure coincidence, Waddington was also the U.K. Licensee for the popular American board game, Monopoly. As it happened, 'games and pastimes' was a category of item qualified for insertion into 'CARE packages', dispatched by the International Red Cross to prisoners of war. Under the strictest of secrecy, in a securely guarded and inaccessible old workshop on the grounds of Waddington's, a group of sworn-to-secrecy employees began mass-producing escape maps, keyed to each region of Germany, Italy, France, or where ever Allied POW camps were located. When processed, these maps could be folded into such tiny dots that they would actually fit inside a Monopoly playing piece.



As long as they were at it, the clever workmen at Waddington's also managed to add:

1. A playing token, containing a small magnetic compass

2. A two-part metal file that could easily be screwed together

3. Useful amounts of genuine high-denomination German, Italian, and French currency, hidden within the piles of Monopoly money!



British and American air crews were advised, before taking off on their first mission, how to identify a 'rigged' Monopoly set -- by means of a tiny red dot, one cleverly rigged to look like an ordinary printing glitch, located in the corner of the Free Parking square.



Of the estimated 35,000 Allied POWS who successfully escaped, an estimated one-third were aided in their flight by the rigged Monopoly sets. Everyone who did so was sworn to secrecy indefinitely, since the British Government might want to use this highly successful ruse in still another, future war.



The story wasn't declassified until 2007, when the surviving craftsmen from Waddington's, as well as the firm itself, were finally honored in a public ceremony. It's always nice when you can play that 'Get Out of Jail Free' card!



I realize that many of you are (probably) too young to have any personal connection to WWII (Dec. '41 to Aug. '45), but this is still an interesting bit of history. http://www.snopes.com/military/monopoly.asp = TRUE! *************************************************************

__________________________________________________________________ ALTRUSAGRAM Official Newsletter of Altrusa International, Inc., of NY April, 2014, Issue __________________________________________________________________ PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE It’s springtime, everyone! April Fool! Happy Birthday, Altrusa – April 25th. I hope everyone has filed their taxes already. Nothing like listening to Schnittke’s Concerto Grosso No. 1 while writing this to you. (Wow, I wish I had written this piece). Obviously, the spring air has put me into a giddy mood. Lately, I have been volunteering my time to my son’s music class. I edited parts for my son’s first band piece. Yes, it’s not a common way to volunteer, I admit. But, it is certainly much more constructive than selling cupcakes at a table in the cafeteria (unless baking is one’s livelihood). If you are an expert in a particular craft (painting, jewelry-making, investing, computers, etc.) even if it’s not main stream, then you should share it with the world. Years ago (last century), I was accepted but decided not to attend the University of Southern California’s Film Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television. It was an incredible opportunity to learn from the best film composers in the business. Instead, my first priority was to become a mother. Like many women, we tend to sacrifice our personal goals to attain other goals which rely on timing (i.e. biological clocks). We women do not have control of the calendar in this respect. Well, good came from that decision. Not only do I have two beautiful children, but also they compose music! So, you can say the amount of composers in our family has tripled! This is a repeated theme in many of my messages as your president: teach what you know. Because you never know who will benefit. If your passion is writing, teaching or giving guidance in a particular field, then it’s a possibility that that person might wish to become a writer or teach someone in their family or community what you just taught them. That type of volunteering is what helps make the world a better place, thus giving back to one’s community. Happy Earth Day! April 22nd. We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children. – Native American Proverb Catherine Kleszczewski, President ****************************************************************** 1 APRIL DINNER MEETING This month the Dinner Meeting which would normally be held on April 22nd has been postponed and incorporated into the April 25th Un Woman’s Project Orange dinner at Audrey Braver’s apartment at 21-55 34th Avenue, Apt 6B, Long Island City.

April 25 th is the six-month anniversary of Project Orange. The New York Altrusa International Club has chosen to have an Orange Dinner as their way to celebrate the six month anniversary . A ll the food will be orange in color or accented with orange, e.g., macaroni and cheese, and salad with orange slices, etc. The dinner will be potluck; everyone is encouraged to bring some kind of “orange” food. This will be a fund raiser so the cost will be a $25.00 donation for each of us; $30.00 if you don’t bring food. We have already had offers of table cloth, napkins, paper plates. The macaroni and cheese is covered, as is the salad. Please call Audrey at: 718-721-4229 to make reservations and for directions to her apartment and what you will bring. Items still needed are: Orange juice, orange soda, gin, vodka (for Mimosas and Screwdrivers); Dessert suggestions—Orange Sherbet, Orange-iced cake/cupcakes; Another entrée—Salmon or Lox, perhaps ************************************************************* ANNUAL BELMONT FUNDRAISER This year’s racing even will be on Sunday, June 22, 2014.

Dates for the dinner meetings at the National Arts Club for the coming season are as follows: September 23rd, October 28th, January 27th, March 24th, and May 19th. Another venue will be found for the dinner meetings November 18th, February 24th. The April dinner meeting will be cancelled so members can attend the District Meeting in April. The New York Club is responsible for activity at the District Meeting. Audrey Braver discussed the Orange Dinner schedule for April 25th. The event will be held at Audrey Braver’s home, beginning at 6 pm, members will contribute food in the orange theme. This is to support the UN awareness campaign on violence against women.

Carole Kennedy reviewed the information for the fund raiser for May 10th, 2014 Jewelry Making at her Broadway store. The store will have information on Altrusa on their web page and a window display At the May 20th meeting, the District Governor Maureen McGough will attend and install the new officers and directors. Belmont “Day at the Races” tickets are available for sale. Meeting was adjourned at 5:45 PM Submitted by Jessica Leeds ************************************************************* 3 REPORT FROM DISTRICT TWO 58 th ANNUAL CONFERENCE There was a total attendance of 78 (including 13 first timers) at the Richmond Conference. This insured that it would be a lively and fun conference. The International Representative was International President, Ilona Kerby. She is a native of Longview, Washington, and is a thoroughly charming, fun person. While her message was inspiring and encouraging, it brought home the point that Altrusa has lost about 1,000 members this past year through attrition, we are an aging group, and the disbandment of clubs. This is despite the fact that Altrusa is adding new clubs and expanding into new countries. Therefore recruitment of new members is not only desirable, it is essential. The International Office has moved to less expensive quarters and is relying on E-blasts to get news to the members—please read them when you get them as the “International Altrusan” will now be published only once a year and that issue will be devoted to the International Convention. Ilona also stressed the fact that International is insisting that every club be incorporated by December 31, 2014. International office will be providing assistance to the clubs to help with this transition. Indeed, some information regarding incorporation of not-for-profits in New York State was given to the club’s representative to share with the club. The fun part of the Conference was just that—FUN with capital letters. The service projects included pruning in the azalea garden of Bryan Park; a blood drive, garden work in the learning therapy garden at St. Joseph’s Villa, an organization devoted to helping children; packing baskets for the residents of Safe Harbor, a shelter for battered women. After dinner on Friday night, the Capital City ASTRA club ran a Bingo game which is always fun. The Awards Banquet on Saturday night was exciting. The New York club received three club awards—second place for both the Eleanor Pettersen Awards for Membership Growth in number of members and by percentage; and second place for the Nina Fay Calhoun International Relations Award for our Project Orange; and Julie Kleszczewski and Jessica Leeds shared top place for the Sponsorship Award with six new members. Catherine Kleszczewski received recognition for Presidential Excellence. At the end of the evening, the catering and wait staff were invited to take a bow and receive their tips for the Conference service. Then the staff returned their tips to Altrusa as a donation. This was a first since I’ve been going to Conferences. While the Richmond Club was host and the membership certainly worked hard to make this a great conference, kudos go to Tammy Boyd who supervised everything and raised troubleshooting to an art form. Whatever glitsch was thrown at her, she rose to the challenge. Thank you, Tammy. ************************************************************ The Altrusa Club of New York has a website: http://altrusanewyorkcity.tripod.com . Don’t forget to visit it.

Adults come back rejuvenated by their summer vacations to tackle the workplace anew, while kids of all ages anticipate the new school year (either eagerly or with dread). This fall also starts a new chapter in my life as the incoming president of the Altrusa International Club of New York. I suppose you could say that I am eagerly anticipating my new duties…with dread (just kidding!!). I am truly looking forward to the upcoming year and would like to extend a warm welcome to our returning and new members. To our new members, in particular, welcome into the fold and thank you for joining us. As I began to prepare for the upcoming club year, I revisited the mission statement for Altrusa, to wit: “We make our communities better through leadership, partnership and service.” Now, that is a very simple statement that packs a whole load of meaning. I started to think of other quotes of similar simplicity and immediate impact: “Without community service, we would not have a strong quality of life. It's important to the person who serves as well as the recipient. It's the way in which we ourselves grow and develop.” --Dorothy Height, educator and social activist Each member’s reasons for joining Altrusa are as unique as the individual who espouses them, but I am sure that we all believe in the adage that the reward is in the giving and in the sharing. In the recent past, New York Altrusans have undertaken such projects as serving lunch to the homeless and hungry at the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen; donating books and clothing (especially pajamas) to children in need in shelters and in the Hour Children program; and donating funds for the purchase of bed nets and solar cookers for distribution in developing countries. The smiles of thanks we have received are our reward. Over the next year, we will continue with similar projects, along with developing some brand-new ones that, hopefully, will spark the interest of current members, while attracting new recruits to our ranks. These new projects, if they are to succeed, will require active and thoughtful collaboration of our membership with prestigious outside organizations. Which brings me to the next quote: "Unity is strength. . . when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved." --Mattie J. T. Stepanek, peace activist and NY Times-bestselling poet and essayist who died at the age of 13 from a rare form of muscular dystrophy A club, by definition, is a team, i.e., an association working collaboratively in pursuit of common interests. Every culture has proverbs that praise the value of, and the strength to be found in, teamwork and collaboration; here are but two: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” -- African proverb “One chopstick is very easily to be broken, but ten chopsticks together are so hard to break.” –Chinese proverb I do not think I would be remiss in saying that we all recognize the value of teamwork and of increasing our chopsticks (um… our membership), so as to better undertake our good works in both the local and global communities. And, collaboration with outside organizations could only be to the benefit of all parties. So, the plan is, simply, to increase our active projects and embark on outside collaboration to complement our regular dinner meeting roster of speakers, who will continue to give talks on current events and other interesting topics. In closing, I hope to see everyone at the September meeting at the National Arts Club and start the year off with a bang, and not a whimper. My personal thanks to outgoing president, Catherine Kleszczewski, and last year’s board, as well as to the incoming board for all your support and good wishes. See you on September 23rd! Anne Marie Basic, President ****************************************************************** NEW YORK CLUB OFFICERS Newly-elected Officers were installed at the June Dinner Meeting, along with a new Board of Directors. This list will be in the Club’s Yearbook which will be distributed at the September Dinner Meeting (another reason to attend).

President Anne Marie Basic wants this dinner to be a “get to know you” meeting with an exchange of ideas and suggestions for the coming year. Yearbooks will be distributed and you can sign up for a Committee. Hopefully, you will all be able to attend. ****************************************************************** OUR FOUNDING MEMBERS Back in June, I found myself at a stone wall while I was doing some research on the computer, and thought it would be interesting to see what could be found out about the Altrusa International New York Club’s charter members. Starting with our most famous member, Eleanor Roosevelt. I’m sure you all know her history. Her husband, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was Governor of New York, and 32nd President of the US. She was a tireless worker to improve human condition and the United Nation’s first Chairperson for the Committee on Human Rights. Mrs. Roosevelt joined in the first year and was not considered a charter member. Of the original charter members, nineteen in all, information was found for only twelve. The first secretary, Vera Bull Hull, was married to an inventor, William C. Hull. As administratrix of his estate in September, 1947, Mrs. Hull filed for a patent on her husband’s invention of an appliance in the form of a footrest (situated at foot of hospital bed) that enabled a patient to exercise his leg muscles while lying in bed. It also had the advantage of lifting the covers off the legs and feet for added comfort. Dr. Lillian M. Gilbreth, is well-known to most of us due to her daughters’ novels, “Cheaper By The Dozen” and “Belles on Their Toes,” and the film portrayal by Myrna Loy. She was a well-respected mechanical engineer by profession. Florence Brobeck wrote best-selling cookbooks and had a weekly column in The New York Times in 1936-37. She was also associate editor of The New York Herald Tribune Women’s Page in the 1940’s. Elsie Eaves was the first female associate member of The American Society of Civil Engineers and a founding member of the American Association of Cost Engineers, now known as the ACCE. Gloria Browning was a dressmaker. May Alexander was a dress salesperson. Margaret B. Benson, born in England, was a merchandising clerk. While Grace M. Clarke, also born in England, was a nurse manager. Catherine Fisher was a supervisor for the telephone company, and Elizabeth Phillips was a secretary for the telephone company. Susie W. Smith was a railroad company clerk. Elizabeth R. Wylie, born in Scotland, she was a manager and was married late in life to Dr. Frederick Demarest. Regrettably, I was unable to get the official names of the companies that employed these women nor the names of the educational institutions they attended. It’s a long shot, but if anyone knows anything more about these women, or the other charter members – Evelyn Hopper, charter President; Eva B. Gage; Frances Massey; Bertha Miller; Cora S. Riefer; Helen Waldo; Jeanette Ware -- please let us know as it would be nice to have this history. ****************************************************************** 3 ****************************************************************** ANNUAL BELMONT FUNDRAISER FOR THE NY CLUB’S FOUNDATION This year’s fundraiser at Belmont Race Track was a lot of fun for all who attended. There was a true air of excitement. While the profits were down about $200 from last year’s fundraiser, it was a successful effort. In fact, the lesser profit had more to do with the fact that Belmont raised their prices but we chose not to pass that on to our loyal attendees. ************************************************************* THIRTEEN HELPFUL HOUSEHOLD HINTS Shirley Day has sent these hints which you may find very helpful. The simplest way to slice cherry tomatoes is to place them between to lids and run a knife through all of them at once. Do you find yourself throwing out hard blocks of brown sugar every time you go to the package? Try storing a few marshmallows in the bag with the brown sugar. Make sure that the bag is airtight. Don’t have a watering can? Create one by puncturing holes in the top of a used milk bottle. Remove pet hair from furniture and carpets with a squeegee. Water straight from the tap becomes cloudy when frozen. To make ice cubes crystal clear, allow a kettle of boiled water to cool slightly and use this to fill your ice cube trays. Use a large muffin tin to cook stuffed peppers in the oven - it will help keep them upright. Add half a teaspoon of baking soda to the water when hard-boiling eggs to make the shells incredibly easy to peel off. To tell if eggs are fresh, immerse them in a bowl of water. Fresh eggs will lie on the bottom, while stale eggs will float to the surface. Grandchildren are a blessing but the wee ones can’t always keep within the lines or even on the paper. In that case, WD40 can be used to remove crayon marks from any surface! To clean a wooden chopping board, sprinkle on a handful of Kosher salt and rub with half a lemon. Rinse with clean water and dry to ensure it is clean and germ-free. To sharpen scissors, simply cut through sandpaper. Store bed sheets inside their pillowcases for easy storage and access. I’ve tried this, not only does it give easy access and storage, it makes an attractive and neat shelf in the linen closet. Psst! Don’t tell the Container Store, but you can use egg boxes to store delicate Christmas tree decorations. Use chalk to remove grease stains from clothes. Simply rub white chalk on the affected area and wash as normal - the chalk will absorb the grease and be washed away in the cycle. ************************************************************* The Altrusa Club of New York has a website: http://altrusanewyorkcity.tripod.com .

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE



Happy February weather! As one newspaper put it,” S’no more!” That groundhog wasn’t kidding!

So many events have occurred: Super Bowl Sunday – it wasn’t a game, it was a massacre! Groundhog Day on the same day as the Super Bowl (that cute, furry little critter! Leave Phil alone!); death of an actor from my generation, Philip Seymour Hoffmann. He was only 46, and a father of three children ages 5, 7 and 10; death of Shirley Temple Black, actress and UN Ambassador, age 85. She lit up the lives of millions during the Great Depression with her cheerful talent, innocence and grace.

February 9, 2014 marked the 50th Anniversary of the Beatles performing on the Ed Sullivan Show in New York (aka “The British Invasion!”), in front of a U.S. audience. I can’t help think that all of those screaming teenage fans are now in their 60s! On another light note, there’s the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. All of the Olympians from every nation are amazing – so many stories, so many words of inspiration. Russia’s Police Choir http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P08B_lBUL0E really caught my attention.(Oo La La!) Besides, rooting for the USA, I am rooting for the Jamaican bobsled team!

Should I discuss the influence of Washington and Lincoln since President’s Day is coming up? Beside the fact that February is Black History Month, Rosa Parks birthday was on February 4th.

Even though the holidays are over, I feel as though life has been nonstop. I mean look at all the events that have already occurred before Valentine’s Day! The bottom line is: life goes on. In our minds and hearts, we know that life isn’t always fair or beautiful. There are troglodytes (please remember this word for our meeting in February. Spelling counts, ladies.) in this world, but still…hopefully we can all experience the beauty of life and give that to others in need. Making small gestures such as giving food or saying a “hello” can brighten someone’s spirit. When our spirit is lighter, we can succeed and love so much more.

Think “Hot Cocoa” and click on this link for a special treat! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5E_zXbmrlM

"Here Comes The Sun"

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

And I say it's all right



Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter

Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here



Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

And I say it's all right



Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces

Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here



Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

And I say it's all right



Sun, sun, sun, here it comes (repeat times)



Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting

Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear



Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

And I say it's all right



Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

It's all right, it's all right

- Written by George Harrison of the Beatles

Have a Happy Valentine’s Day! XOX

DISTRICT II CONFERENCE UPDATE



At the January dinner meeting, we selected our representatives to the District II Conference. Audrey Braver and Abaynesh Asrat are the delegates, and Henie Parish and Julie Kleszczewski are the alternates. Remember this Conference is not just for delegates. It is for all members. Richmond, VA, is an historically rich city, well worth the visit.



We should all think about attending, if not this year, certainly next year when our Area (I) is the host. Location will be Washington, DC--lots to do in DC. We will also need volunteers to help with the various phases of the conference. So, please, start your planning now—2015 is less than a year away.



***********************************************************************



EASTER EGGS



The South Central Pennsylvania Altrusa Club is taking orders for their divine Peanut Butter, Coconut, Butter Cream and PB Krispie Easter eggs. Cost is $12/dozen, or $15/dozen for special orders, e.g., white chocolate, bittersweet or milk chocolate. Order forms will be available at the Dinner Meeting.

A FEW SMILES AND WISE ADVICE



The following comments have been attributed to Andy Rooney, our apologies if this is not the correct attribution.

“ I've learned …

That the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.

That just one person saying to me, 'You've made my day!' makes my day.

That being kind is more important than being right.

That you should never say no to a gift from a child.

That simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights when I was a child did wonders for me as an adult.

That life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end, the faster it goes.

That to ignore the facts does not change the facts.

That when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that person continue to hurt you.

That love, not time, heals all wounds.

That everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile..

That opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.

That when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.

That a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.

That the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.

ALTRUSAGRAM Official Newsletter of Altrusa International of New York January 2014 Issue __________________________________________________________________ PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE I hope everyone has had a happy new year so far. A new year gives us an opportunity to regroup; and to think how we can make a positive difference. Lately, I have been reading and watching biographies and interviews of famous and successful people. One of the things that they all have in common was their drive for having quality content, and not so much focus on procedure. I think, at times, we all want to do the right thing and follow protocol of what other clubs and/or companies are doing. However, sometimes, the larger the company, the more confusion there is. For example, why did all of these companies such as Enron, JP Morgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs (to name a few), get themselves into financial trouble? The short answer is their accounting practices, but, of course, it is more complicated than that. Google to find the answer. In a lost interview with Steve Jobs (filmed in 1994, available on Netflix), he explained why Apple with its new CEO, John Sculley, back then in the 1980’s, had so much trouble. Sculley thought that just having a great idea would be enough to push the company forward. Per Jobs, having an excellent idea is only 10% of the success, but in reality it’s 90% hard work. This hard work includes the shaping of the idea: figuring out what works and what doesn’t work. Not all ideas work. [Remember this word for our January dinner meeting: Rosebud] John Sculley, who was the CEO at the time after Jobs was fired, was the former CEO of Pepsico. Pepsi’s concept of an innovative idea was making a new bottle shape. Sculley didn’t understand that as a team of professionals work on an idea, that idea can change slightly (i.e. certain materials such as metal or glass may work differently than thought.) Where am I going with all of this? We all have great ideas. But if we don’t put the work into them, then they fizzle out. A few months ago, I asked each of you to fill out a survey on how to improve our club. Only a few responded (Thank you, to those who gave their invaluable input). To those who chose to remain silent, I am assuming you like the way our club is functioning right now. Feedback and ideas are welcomed any time. When providing feedback, also include a solution and evidence to back it up. As Dale Carnegie once said, “only fools criticize.” As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birthday approaches, let us remember his legacy. From time to time, I often think about MLK, Jr. as well as Nelson Mandela, and all the positive energy that they had. (When you have a chance, please watch the movie, “Invicus.” It’s a must-see!) Without them, this world would be a much different place. On that note, please invite a friend or colleague to one of our dinner meetings. Let us celebrate our cultural diversity! Catherine Klescszewski, President ************************************************************************ JANUARY DINNER MEETING Our speaker speaker is Carol Smolenski, the Executive Director and one of the founders of ECPAT-USA, has been working in the field of children’s rights for eighteen years. She is a long-time nationally recognized leader working to stop the commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking of children. This is a most important topic and I’m sure you will find it both interesting and stimulating. Don’t forget to make your reservations with Penny Gardner, 212-348-1433. ************************************************************************ QUILT PROJECT We received a thoughtful thank you note from Yvette, Director of Volunteer Services for the two quilts we donated. We visited the VA Hospital the Saturday before Christmas … There was a snowstorm which delayed my friend. But we finally made it about 4:30 p.m.! One quilt is a bold design using recycled maroon curtains, gingham sheets and other fabrics of the tied quilt we made. This was given to a gentleman whose home is in Pennsylvania so he had very few visits. He was so happy! Our maroon and gingham surprise was the icing on the cake for he was returning home in the morning! The other as you know was composed of beautiful tiny triangles framed in pale green. This quilt was given to a totally thrilled female veteran who worked in the battle zone as a medic. ************************************************************************ 2 ************************************************************************ CALL TO CONFERENCE In case you didn’t receive the District Service Bulletin, below is information about the District Two Conference, April 11-13, 2014, in Richmond, VA. The Fifty-eighth Annual District Two Conference will be hosted by the Richmond club at the Holiday Inn Airport, Sandston, VA April 10 - 13, 2014. Conference Chair Tammy Boyd and Co-Chair Cindi Jennings have been working hard to plan an exciting, growth-producing experience for us. Our International Representative will be International President Ilona Kerby who is a member of the Longview-Kelso, WA Club in District Twelve. We are honored to have Ilona attending our Conference as it will be her first Conference in her position as International President. Let’s welcome her and show her how District Two presents the most rewarding and informative Conference! Ilona is stressing the importance of growing Altrusa – every Club increasing their membership by one new member. How proud District Two would be to know that we are doing so by having our new members attend Conference! I would like to see the First Timers Session packed! Stress to Club members the camaraderie we experience with our sisters and brothers in Altrusa Service, the networking and leadership training provided through workshops, and the heartfelt joy experienced by participating in our service projects. There will be two general sessions – one on Friday and one on Saturday -- and it is imperative that each Club sends its allotted delegates and alternates as this is where the business of the District takes place. So many times members ask “what does District do for us?” Come to Conference and find out! There will be training for Club Presidents and Club Treasurers; an opportunity to meet International President Ilona Kerby and participate in her all-session workshop; an Astra Workshop; town hall session for sharing club service projects; an Area meeting session to discuss Fall Workshops; opportunities to be updated on International and District objectives; and all-session workshops from a guest speaker on Friday who works in A Domestic Violence Safe House and on Saturday whose specialty is in Leadership and Career Transitions. The District Board and members of Altrusa International of Richmond, VA look forward to seeing many Altrusans at Conference. Delegates and Alternates: Names of Delegate(s) and Alternates(s) from each club must be reported on the enclosed form to the District Secretary. There are NO credential cards to give to your delegates(s) or alternates(s). Delegates and alternates are determined sixty (60) days prior to District Conference pursuant to Club Bylaws. Each club in good standing that has an Active and Active Retired membership of 20 members shall be entitled to one delegate and one alternate. For each additional 20 members or portion thereof, a club shall be entitled to 1 additional delegate and alternate. The District Treasurer will review with the District Secretary and notify you of any discrepancies. Send attached form by 3/1/14 to: District Two Secretary Tammy Boyd, 117 McCauley Pkwy, Aylett, VA 23009. Please let me know if you need a Registration form. 3 A Cruise on the Danube Clelia was generous enough to write about her recent vacation and submit it to the Altrusagram. It is, as always, entertaining. For years I had been dreaming of doing a cruise on the scenic Danube. None of my friends was interested and time was passing. Then one day I talked about this plan to a friend in Brazil and the moment I mentioned Danube, her eyes sparkled. I had found a companion and Edilah and I went on a cruise in October of 2013. The Danube has always been the main route to connect west Europe to the Black Sea. But this river had large rock formations and swift waters that represented sizeable obstacles. Charlemagne had dreamed of a canal creating a continuous waterway linking hundreds of inland ports and such a canal was finally built and finished in 1992, making our cruise possible. We went through 67 locks ! We spent 12 days and 14 nights aboard the Var, of the Viking River Cruise Line. Their ships are small and every cabin has a balcony. We were 138 aboard, a group consisting of many Americans, Canadians, some Englishmen, a few Australians and two Brazilians. We started in Budapest and ended up in Amsterdam, Holland We sailed mostly at night, but also some mornings and every day we were in a different town. Sometimes it was a large city like Vienna, in Austria, or Nuremberg and Cologne, in Germany. But we also stopped in medieval towns and charming villages such as Bratislava, in Slovakia, Melk (famous for its magnificent baroque abbey), in Austria, and Passau (city of three rivers), Regensburg (a very well preserved medieval city), Bamberg (with its smoked beer), Wurzburg (a baroque town that is a center of production of wines, mostly white) and Wertheim (famous for its blown glass artifacts), in Germany. It was wonderful to enjoy a cup of tea watching baroque and grandiose castles, fabulous churches and monasteries pass by on both sides of the river. The famous Melk Abbey and the magnificent St. Stephan cathedral of Passau can be seen and photographed from the ship. Sometimes one village was very close to another, but other times all we saw was beautiful green or yellow plantations on terraced land. Before arriving at Amsterdam we spent one day in Kinderduck, on the Rhine. This town has Holland’s largest assemblage of wind mills, 19 of them, built at the beginning of the 18 th century.

Meeting adjourned at 7:09 p.m. Respectfully submitted by Julie Harrison Kleszczewski ********************************************************************* 5 A FEW SMILES FOR A WINTRY JANUARY At a recent luncheon, we were discussing the aging process. This discussion was prompted by the fact that two members of our group were in Rehab and not able to join us that day. So, I thought I would share some thoughts about getting old. Our younger members will benefit from this article--just wait a decade or two. #1 I very quietly confided to my best friend that I was having an affair. She turned to me and asked, “Are you having it catered?” And that, my friend, is the definition of 'OLD'! #2 Reporters interviewing a 104-year-old woman: “And what do you think is the best thing about being 104?” the reporter asked. She simply replied, “No peer pressure.” #3 I’ve sure gotten old! I've had two bypass surgeries, a hip replacement, new knees, fought prostate cancer and diabetes. I'm half blind, can't hear anything quieter than a jet engine, take 40 different medications that make me dizzy, winded, and subject to blackouts. Have bouts with dementia. Have poor circulation. I can hardly feel my hands and feet anymore. Can't remember if I'm 85 or 92. Have lost all my friends. But, thank God, I still have my driver's license. #4 THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: I don't want to brag or make anyone jealous or anything, but I can still fit into the earrings I wore in high school. #5 My memory's not as sharp as it used to be. Also, my memory's not as sharp as it used to be. ********************************************************************* REMEMBER: This is your newsletter.

It’s important to think about why we do what we do. I am in the middle of reading the book, “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg. He states that 40% of all the things that we do is by habit, not necessarily because we want to do it or by free will. He also explains how we can change our habits. Look into yourself and ask, “Is this what I want to do with my life?” Maybe you are thinking, “Why does that matter? I have lived most of my life already.” Well, I have news for you: It’s never too late to do what you want to do. For example, as a college student, I remember listening to Pearl Bailey at a benefit in Washington, DC. At the age of 71, she graduated from college with a Bachelor’s in Religion. She said she was a French Major, but she switched to Religion because she thought it was easier to understand God than it was to understand French. People laughed at that statement. What stayed with me from that day was that Pearl had the courage to go back to school to earn her undergraduate degree. She didn’t let age stop her. Another example, after a 14-year hiatus, I am composing music again. It’s a little bit of a learning curve because technology and methods in this area have changed, but it’s for the better. Why is Catherine writing about all of this? What I am trying to tell you is to WAKE UP. Expand yourselves: think of new ideas for possible projects and programs. Think about what you can do to help others, and help our Altrusa club grow. When you share Altrusa with a friend or someone who you think is nice, you are actually helping the community. Many hands make light work. And why do we like helping others? One reason is because it makes us feel good about ourselves. Wouldn’t we want our friends to feel good about themselves as well? When you give to the community, you are, in fact, giving to yourself. Also, if you are talented in something, let’s say, art. Imagine that you are a talented artist, but you don’t create another artwork for the rest of your life. Don’t you think that it’s unfair to the world? Without music and art, our quality of life in society would suffer; our souls would be lost. Just this week, about 1,500 pieces of art were found in a Munich apartment. This artwork had been confiscated by the Nazis. Some of the works were by Picasso, Chagall and Matisse. The world has been deprived of experiencing these works of art! I suggest there are many other places which have hidden “gems.” Whether it is created and hidden from the world, or never created at all, but hidden in our brains, it is depriving the world. The same goes for education. For every person in the world who cannot read or write, they are crippling our society. For example, there are many diseases out there that no known cure has been found. One of those uneducated individuals could possibly find the answer, or be the next Marie Curie, the next Da Vinci if they pursue an education. I am thankful for many people in my life and for the things that I have in place, but there are so many things that we can do to improve our lives, directly and indirectly. If you can’t find the time or have the strength to help, then assisting monetarily or mentoring someone who you think would benefit would be a great help. One type of charity which is often overlooked is the arts. One such arts organization is HERE. They have a website: www.HERE.org . It is worth a visit to see the various arts projects they support. I made my donation to help support the creation and production of a new opera, called Scarlet Ibis, composed by Stefan Weisman and libretto by David Cote. Their work will be premiered in January 2015. If you think that it’s frivolous to give to arts, then I would like you to do an experiment: Try to live without music and art for one day, and see what happens. Can’t do it, right? To do this, there would be no TV, no books, no newspapers, no looking at the walls in your home, no internet, etc. Music is everywhere. You get my point. Looking forward to seeing you all at our next dinner meeting on November 19. HAPPY THANKSGIVING! Catherine Kleszczewski. President Altrusa International, New York Club ************************************************************************ INTERESTING FACT ABOUT THANKSGIVING DAY The person responsible for making Thanksgiving a national holiday was a woman by the name of Sarah Hale. She was a mother of five. Over a 37-year period, she wrote letters to the U.S. President. Finally, in 1860, President Abraham Lincoln said “yes” and Thanksgiving became a national holiday. Sarah Hale also wrote the song, “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Some “food” for thought. ******************************************************************************* A COUPLE OF SMILES GETTING OLDER An older gentleman was on the operating table awaiting surgery and he insisted that his son,

a renowned surgeon, perform the operation. As he was about to get the anesthesia, he asked to speak to his son. "Yes, Dad, what is it?"

“Don't be nervous, son; do your best, and just remember, if it doesn't go well, if something happens to me, your mother is going to come and live with you and your wife...."



REPAIRING HEARTS

A mechanic was removing a cylinder head from the motor of a Harley motorcycle when he spotted a well-known heart surgeon in his shop.



The surgeon was there, waiting for the service manager to come and take a look at his bike.



The mechanic shouted across the garage, "Hey, Doc, can I ask you a question?"



The surgeon a bit surprised, walked over to the mechanic working on the motorcycle. The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked, "So Doc, look at this engine. I open its heart, take the valves out, fix 'em, put 'em back in, and when I finish, it works just like new. So how come I get such a small salary and you get the really big bucks, when you and I are doing basically the same work?"



The surgeon paused, smiled and leaned over, and whispered to the mechanic... "Try doing it with the engine running." ************************************************************************ NOVEMBER DINNER MEETING Please Note: The November Dinner Meeting is scheduled for November 19, and not November 26 as originally planned. Our speaker will be Dr. Glen Chalmers from Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen. He will give us an update on their outstanding program and their trials and tribulations in view of today’s economic situation. I’m sure all club members will find his presentation most enlightening. The Reverend Glenn B. Chalmers—has been the Rector of the Church of the Holy Apostles and Executive Director of the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen since May of 2009. He was Executive Director of Cathedral Shelter of Chicago from 1997-2009, Rector of Grace Episcopal Church of Lawrence, Mass from 1990-97, Director of Program Development of Episcopal City Mission in Boston, MA, from 1998-90, and Vicar of Grace Episcopal Church in Elizabeth, NJ, from 1982-1988. He received his D. Min. in 2008 from the Graduate Theological Foundation, his M.S.W. in 1982 from Rutgers University and a M. Div. in Applied Ministries from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1980. Rev. Chalmers and Shirley, a volunteer at the Soup Kitchen. Don’t forget you must make a reservation with Penny Gardner, 212-348-1433, by November 11th for the dinner meeting on the 19th. ************************************************************************ DID YOU KNOW? Below are a selection of interesting facts that you probably didn’t know but will find a handy solution in certain situations. Most aluminum foil boxes have press-in tabs that secure the roll in place, so you don’t have worry about it flying out every time you rip off a sheet. Chinese takeout containers are actually made to fold out into plates. The containers actually are meant to unfold into a makeshift plate, which you can easily reassemble into a box for storing leftovers. Greek yogurt containers are meant to be folded in half. Chances are you’ve been scooping the toppings with your spoon onto the yogurt. But, have you realized, the topping holder folds over, so you can pour the toppings DIRECTLY ON TOP? Soda can tabs double as straw holders. Turn the tab around so that it acts as holder that can stop the straw from raising out of the can as the soda fizzes. ************************************************************************ MINUTES OF NOVEMBER BOARD MEETING Attendees: Catherine Kleszczewski; Audrey Braver, Penny Gardner; Gwen Acsadi, Carole Kennedy; Julie Kleszczewski. Excused: Anne Marie Basic; Jessica Leeds, Henie Parish, Margaret Stadler. President Catherine called meeting to order at 6:17 p.m. The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE



Finally, spring is here. It feels like summer! It is time to put away the winter clothes and bring out the summer wardrobe!

First of all, I want to thank everyone on the board and all the members as well! Special thanks to Penny for being on top of our finances, for organizing our reservations at the National Arts Club, and for countless hours of putting together the Treasurer’s report and our biggest fundraiser of the year at Belmont Racetrack; to Audrey, for putting together the directory, newsletter, and for giving me guidance; to Jessica, for hosting wine and cheese events and for her guidance; to Carole Kennedy for hosting and organizing our jewelry workshop, to Julie, my mother, for throwing me into the “lion’s den.” I thank everyone who has not been mentioned here by name. You are and have been an inspiration to me! I want to wish our new board members, especially President-Elect Anne Marie Basic, a successful and uplifting future for our club and for those charities we assist and a thank you especially to our Foundation board members (Thank you, Carole Lancaster, for keeping it together). A big thank you goes to Maureen McGough for taking the time to install our new slate of officers! Maureen, you are a powerhouse!

It is difficult to find the right words as this is my final message to you as President of Altrusa International Club of New York other than giving suggestions on how to help our communities grow stronger. There have been many news stories of caution. Tornados, murder trials, kidnapped school girls from Nigeria, a Korean ferry boat that sunk leaving countless victims and grieving families…more bad news than good news. Some stories are receiving more attention than others. There was one shocking story that did not make much of a splash: "Widow Loses House Over $6.30 Tax Bill!" (Forbes,(April 29, 2014) NBC News) What?! Apparently, the Pennsylvania Court was not flexible regarding the defendant paying the remaining balance of her property taxes. Without going into great detail, she is a widow. Her late husband left her the house and all of the finances that go with it. She relied on him 100% to pay all the bills and taxes. She had nothing to do with it. What’s the lesson here? I know that many of you, if not all of the members in our club are financially literate. If you know of someone who is not, it is a necessary and good deed to take action and educate that person in finance, even if they say that they do not have a “head for numbers.”

I repeat. Educate someone about personal finance: a student, a wife (who will someday become a widow or divorced – always a possibility), an unemployed person, a cousin, etc. Some might not want to be taught (Please ask why, because ignorance is NOT bliss in this case!). Send gentle reminders such as sending them stories of financial misfortune or have them check out these websites: www.investopedia.com or www.smckids.com (for kids).This is not a popular topic. No one likes to talk about money. BUT no one likes to eat cat food either!

President’s Message (continued from page 1)

Another article that I read was in today’s Wall Street Journal (May 12, 2014), “Should Companies Monitor Their Employees’ Social Media?” This seems like common sense, but if any of you have a social media count, you should ask yourself, “Why do you have one?” There have been many articles that list mostly the cons of having such an account. For example, if you announce to your Facebook friends that you will be on vacation for a week, guess what? You might be inviting someone to break into your home, or to live in your house. Ugh! Also, I see people posting pics of themselves at crazy parties, children’s activities. Okay, be aware that you are opening up yourself to potential employers rejecting your job application. Also, there was a story of a mother who actually posted her child’s weekly schedule! Guess what? Her child was kidnapped. I don’t know if the child was ever found.

My point is this: even though some of us feel safe and secure in the land of cyberspace, it should be treated as if we are swimming in the ocean of shark-infested waters. Sometimes there is a false sense of security (i.e. Hackers are able to steal millions of debit and credit card numbers). There are many people out there who are wolves in sheep’s clothing (or they are simply nuts). Be cautious in who you confide in. Caveat emptor.

I feel the urgency to inform and to bring attention to issues that are not so obvious, to things that we don’t want to talk about.

On a lighter note, I have learned a great deal in these last two years. Everyone who has served as club president and our members, both longtime and new, have taught me how to become a better leader. A true leader listens, and is accessible to their board and club members. Throughout history, the most successful leaders were people who see the world in a realistic, sober fashion, and not being a “Pollyanna,” (who has always had their way in life). True leaders have the ability to empathize and to remain calm in a crisis, but find a solution rather than complain and not act. Thank you for this opportunity to serve you!

Be aware, be safe, and have a “MAH-vel – ous” summer everyone!

See you all at our fundraiser at Belmont on Sunday, June 22nd!



Catherine Kleszczewski, May 12, 2014

Memorial Day



Memorial Day is coming up as well as D-Day. So many other events such as the worst tragedy of the US Navy in history: the USS Indianapolis, which delivered the atom bomb. The ship sank on July 30, 1945. Out of 1,197 sailors, 300 went down with the ship. The rest survived only to find themselves in shark-infested waters for about a week. Only 317 men survived. Google it if interested in further details.

Monopoly - I Did Not Know This!

(You'll never look at the game the same way again!)



Starting in 1941, an increasing number of British Airmen found themselves as the involuntary guests of the Third Reich, and the Crown was casting about for ways and means to facilitate their escape...



Now obviously, one of the most helpful aids to that end is a useful and accurate map, one showing not only where stuff was, but also showing the locations of 'safe houses' where a POW on-the-lam could go for food and shelter.



Paper maps had some real drawbacks -- they make a lot of noise when you open and fold them, they wear out rapidly, and if they get wet, they turn into mush.



Someone in MI-5 (similar to America's OSS) got the idea of printing escape maps on silk. It's durable, can be scrunched-up into tiny wads, and unfolded as many times as needed, and makes no noise whatsoever.





At that time, there was only one manufacturer in Great Britain that had perfected the technology of printing on silk, and that was John Waddington, Ltd. When approached by the government, the firm was only too happy to do its bit for the war effort.





By pure coincidence, Waddington was also the U.K. Licensee for the popular American board game, Monopoly. As it happened, 'games and pastimes' was a category of item qualified for insertion into 'CARE packages', dispatched by the International Red Cross to prisoners of war. Under the strictest of secrecy, in a securely guarded and inaccessible old workshop on the grounds of Waddington's, a group of sworn-to-secrecy employees began mass-producing escape maps, keyed to each region of Germany, Italy, France, or where ever Allied POW camps were located. When processed, these maps could be folded into such tiny dots that they would actually fit inside a Monopoly playing piece.



As long as they were at it, the clever workmen at Waddington's also managed to add:

1. A playing token, containing a small magnetic compass

2. A two-part metal file that could easily be screwed together

3. Useful amounts of genuine high-denomination German, Italian, and French currency, hidden within the piles of Monopoly money!



British and American air crews were advised, before taking off on their first mission, how to identify a 'rigged' Monopoly set -- by means of a tiny red dot, one cleverly rigged to look like an ordinary printing glitch, located in the corner of the Free Parking square.



Of the estimated 35,000 Allied POWS who successfully escaped, an estimated one-third were aided in their flight by the rigged Monopoly sets. Everyone who did so was sworn to secrecy indefinitely, since the British Government might want to use this highly successful ruse in still another, future war.



The story wasn't declassified until 2007, when the surviving craftsmen from Waddington's, as well as the firm itself, were finally honored in a public ceremony.



It's always nice when you can play that 'Get Out of Jail Free' card!



I realize that many of you are (probably) too young to have any personal connection to WWII (Dec. '41 to Aug. '45), but this is still an interesting bit of history.
