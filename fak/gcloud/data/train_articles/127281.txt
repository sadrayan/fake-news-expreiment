Dental Stem Cell Banking
YOU PLAN FOR YOUR CHILD’S EDUCATION. PLAN FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE, TOO.

From teaching healthy eating habits to instilling strong values, you already do so much to prepare your child for a happy and healthy life. Banking stem cells may not be as obvious as saving for college, but it could mean just as much to your child’s future well-being and quality of life.

For decades, doctors have harnessed the unique ability of stem cells to treat leukemia and genetic blood diseases. Today, over 1,700 clinical studies are under way demonstrating the use of stem cells to treat other diseases, to heal injuries, and to grow replacement tissues like organs, bone, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, and brain cells.

Banking today means your child has the potential to benefit from the advanced therapies of tomorrow.
