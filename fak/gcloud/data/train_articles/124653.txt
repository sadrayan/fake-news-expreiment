Evolutionary Significance of Sexual Cannibalism
“Sexual cannibalism” refers to females killing and consuming their male partner at some stage during courtship and mating. Sexual cannibalism can occur before or during mating, which will determine potential explanations for its occurrence. This chapter discusses sexual cannibalism in the context of both sexual and natural selection. The natural history and taxonomic distribution of sexual cannibalism is discussed. Various explanations of sexual cannibalism are outlined, emphasizing how the timing of sexual cannibalism changes the costs and benefits to males and females. The evolutionary significance of sexual cannibalism depends on whether it occurs before or after insemination. Preinsemination sexual cannibalism is a nonadaptive consequence of selection on aggressive foraging in juvenile females. It is an adaptive component of female foraging, where females trade off foraging and mating requirements. It is a radical form of female mate choice. Sexual cannibalism could have evolved through the process of sexual, rather than, natural selection. It is evident that sexual cannibalism facilitates both female choice and cryptic female choice. Female foraging strategies that include sexual cannibalism are strongly opposed by counter selection on male mating success.
