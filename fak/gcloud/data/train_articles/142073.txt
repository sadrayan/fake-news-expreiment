Why should the police and pub landlords ban england flags, shirts etc. just in case it offends others. What is your opinion? Are you offended by this?

I heard today that the police are going around pubs and clubs

saying that we cant wear our England tops for the football and we have

to take the flags down as its upsetting immigrants that dont come from

here! Now Im not racist, but this is going too far! Would you remove your turban and burkha because it upsets me. We respect other cultures and other people when abroad why can't they respect us. If they find england football shirts offensive and they know England are playing don't go to the pub stay at home. Let the rest of us enjoy!!!!
