Jasper police officers suspended for 'white power' hand symbol in post-arrest photo
Four officers from the Jasper Police Department have been suspended after making and upside-down "OK" sign with their hands in a post-arrest photo taken by a Jasper Daily Mountain Eagle photographer, city officials told AL.com.

Some people have claimed the gesture is actually a hate symbol that means "white power." The photo in question was posted Thursday in a story about a recent drug arrest in Jasper.

Jasper Mayor David O'Mary told AL.com in an email the officers have been suspended from the narcotics team.

"The Civil Service Board has a say in what happens relative to compensation loss. We feel it is within the powers of the Mayor to impose a five day loss of pay," O'Mary said in an email. "In addition we will require some diversity training."

He said the officers could be suspended for two weeks.

Some people consider the hand symbol, simply the hand sign for "OK," is actually a sign that means "white power."

However, opinions on this matter are varied. Last year, the Anti-Defamation League said the hand sign is not a hate symbol.

A post from the ADL blog claims the rhetoric behind the "OK" was created in a social media hoax that began on 4chan.

"The 'OK' hand gesture hoax originated in February 2017 when an anonymous 4channer announced 'Operation O-KKK,' telling other members that 'we must flood Twitter and other social media websites...claiming that the OK hand sign is a symbol of white supremacy,'" according to the blog.

The blog post accused 4chan users of trying to spread other white supremacy hoaxes and encouraged people to "skeptical" when someone says a symbol is a new hate symbol.
