The Mugwumps consisted of CASS ELLIOT, DENNY DOHERTY, JAMES HENDRICKS and ZAL YANOVSKY, and were together for several months in 1964. These recordings are the only recordings done for Warner Brothers Records in just a couple of days in the summer of 1964. It's an important key in the evolution of not only The Mamas & The Papas , but also of folk/rock. You can hear the blend of Cass & Denny most clearly on the song " EVERYBODY'S BEEN TALKIN' " - a sublime folk/rock song that is the most similar link to the sound of The Mamas & The Papas , and written by Cass & James Hendricks.



The songs range from covers of R&B songs like The Coasters' " SEARCHIN' " with all 4 members singing, and the rousing " SO FINE " where you can clearly hear the power of Cass Elliot & containing a great guitar solo from Zal, and a harmonica solo [ possibly from an uncredited John Sebastian , who was a friend to all the members as well ]. The Beatles' are clearly an influence and it was that influence on Cass & the rest of the group to go electric after singing folk music in various folk groups like The Big 3 and The Halifax Three. " DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN " is a rousing rock number, " HERE IT IS ANOTHER DAY " is another beautiful Elliot/Hendricks folk/rock ballad, and songs like " I'LL REMEMBER TONIGHT " and " DO WHAT THEY DON'T SAY " are more pop influenced songs with horns added too. I've listened to this album for over 30 years, and the release of it on CD at last is definitely merited.



The fact that THE MUGWUMPS laid down these tracks for a proposed album in 1964 is certainly crucial in the overall history of the Mamas & Papas & The Lovin' Spoonful. One single was originally released in 1964 - " I'LL REMEMBER TONIGHT "/ " I DON'T WANNA KNOW " and when both groups were big sensations, this album was released in 1967, and tagged " AN HISTORIC RECORDING " even then. The songs & the music are thoroughly enjoyable. The seeds of folk/rock and The Mamas & Papas are here, and for any fan of 60's music, this contains some great tunes and harmonies. The Mugwumps are pointing the way to the wave of American rock groups that emerged and made history months later in 1965. An important , but also great to listen to album!
