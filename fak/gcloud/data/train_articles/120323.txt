Chris Johnson, ARI, at Pittsburgh: Johnson has been a revelation after once looking like his career was coming to an abrupt end. He's averaging 5.1 yards per carry as the Cardinals' primary ballcarrier, a productive streak that has thus far allowed him to fend off stiff competition for carries from Andre Ellington and rookie David Johnson.

As big of a win as this was for the 49ersas a team, it was almost over shadowed in the end by a small dust upbetween the head coaches after the game. Jim Harbaughwas surely excited his team came out with the W, and was jumping up and down as he found Jim Schwartz for the post game hand shake. Schwartz appeared to get agitated about something during the shake, and proceeded to run him down about 30 yards and bump him. That started another little something, but it all turned out to bemuch ado about cheap jerseys nothing.
