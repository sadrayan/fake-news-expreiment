She blew kisses to Trump as he walked away, and screamed, “I’m not going to take a shower!”

Trump was at the Prince William County Fair Ground for a campaign stop in which he assured voters he has the foreign policy chops to be president, according to the Daily Mail.

He told the crowd he is “very, very, very pro-Israel” and advertised an upcoming trip to the Jewish state to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he said has “absolutely no support from President Obama.”

The Republican front-runner also said Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot stand Obama, like a lot of people.”

“What else is new?” he quipped.
