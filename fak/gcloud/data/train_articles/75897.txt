Gaming Compact Agreements

The State of Wisconsin has entered into gaming compact agreements with all eleven (11) federally recognized Tribes of Indians in Wisconsin, as permitted by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, 25 U.S.C. sec. 2701 (Act). Tribal/State gaming compacts are negotiated between a Tribe and the State to set forth the rules, regulations and conditions under which a Tribe may conduct Class III gaming, as defined in the Act. Compact documents for each Tribe include the original compact document, first and second amendments and relevant memorandum of understanding of government to government and technical matters. The multiple documents unique to each Tribe may reference each other and are all inter-related.
