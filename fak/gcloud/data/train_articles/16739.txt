Got it.

Whose document is this? We like to attribute authorship. Do you have the actual approved resolutions?

I trust you saw my other queries.

I realize too I donâ€™t know yet how you got to your conclusion about the counties representing more than half of Republican voters.

Gardner, I read your stuff. I know you are a really smart dude!!ðŸ˜Š. I am sure you are an expert at using the Secretary of State website. Simply add up the voting results for each county and subtract from the state total. You can use Governor numbers or you can use total number of votes cast in the Republican primary.

Bexar, Dallas, Harris, Tarrant, Travis, Denton, Collin, Montgomery.........just those counties alone add up fast!

Source of document does not want to be named. If you call all the county chairs and spend some time with a calculator and the SOS web site I am confident you will be satisfied that my claim is ðŸ’¯ % true.ðŸ˜Š
