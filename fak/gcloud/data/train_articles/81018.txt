Walker isn't only incoming governor clashing with unions
Our attention may have been locked on the drama in Madison this week over the state's public-employee contract, but the Wall Street Journal reports this morning that similar battles are being waged in other Midwestern states.

In Ohio, incoming Republican John Kasich wants to change binding-arbitration rules. And in Iowa, Gov.-elect Terry Branstad wants the state's largest employee union to reopen the contract it agreed on with Democratic Gov. Chet Culver last month, the Journal reports. Culver OK'd the contracts after he was defeated by Branstad and, unlike the no-raise contract agreements in Wiscosnin, they call for pay hikes.

The Columbus Dispatch also took note of the Wisconsin dispute in this story on the future of Public-sector unions in Ohio.
