11 Saved American Lives (9781451663488): Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., Bill Harlow: Books
I have found this book interesting. Jose Rodriguez is an unapologetic advocate for lawful use of what some folks might consider "rough" measures to gain information from those who would attack our nation's citizens and injure or kill as many as possible. He provides substantive information detailing (as much as national security permits) methods and results from the efforts of those ordered to obtain HUMIT (human intelligence) only to find judgement passed in hindsight by all too often armchair critics. As anyone knows who has been tasked with protecting innocent people from the intent and actions of very evil people, there is never a pretty path to success. That said, I am genuinely grateful to the men and women who undertake difficult tasks in our behalf. It's an interesting read.
