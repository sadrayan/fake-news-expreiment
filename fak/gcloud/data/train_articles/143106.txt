California Rep. Waters not facing corruption charges
Rep. Maxine Waters is not currently facing corruption charges in Congress, despite the false claim of a story detailing allegations she was cleared of eight years ago.

The headline on an item appearing on the newsoftrump site and other right-wing websites says the House Ethics Committee charged the California democrat with three counts of corruption. It detailed charges that she improperly set up a meeting in 2008 on behalf of executives at a bank her husband invested in.

A House ethics panel cleared Waters of the charges in 2012 after an investigation lasting more than three years.

Waters’ office said there’s no truth to the new account.
