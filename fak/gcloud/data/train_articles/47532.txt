If You’re Going to Canada to Buy Weed, Here’s What You Need to Know
Recreational marijuana is now legal in Canada, giving adults the right to buy, carry and share up to 30 grams , or slightly over an ounce, of dried cannabis at one time — enough weed to roll roughly 60 joints. But where you can use it and how it is sold varies by province and territory. And don’t even think of trying to bring a joint back across the border.

Here’s what you need to know if you’re heading to Canada for weed.

How old do I have to be to buy legally?

You must be 19 to buy, possess and consume cannabis in most of Canada, including British Columbia. The minimum legal age is 18 in Alberta and Québec, although Québec’s newly elected government has pledged to raise the minimum age to 21. And everyone in your group needs to be of age: Sharing with minors is a crime.

Where can marijuana be purchased?

While the number of shops is expected to grow, options remain limited. Retail stores have yet to open in Ontario, where the government is moving forward with a tightly regulated private retail model scheduled to begin April 1.

And only one shop has opened in British Columbia so far — in Kamloops, B.C.

Global News, a Canadian television network put together a “province-by-province list of government-run, private and online outlets where you can get your hands on some bud.” Roughly a dozen legal cannabis stores have opened in Québec, including three in Montreal , Québec’s largest city. Global News points out at least three more are scheduled to open later this month, including another in Montreal .
