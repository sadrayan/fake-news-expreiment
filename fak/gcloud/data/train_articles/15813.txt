Email blast from David Alameel, U.S. Senate candidate, Feb. 7, 2014

It’s long past time to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home. It has been more than 12 years and more than 40,000 troops are still stationed in Afghanistan with no clear objective.

The billions we are spending there could be put to much better use creating good paying jobs, ensuring a quality education for all Texas children, and protecting Social Security and Medicare.

Add your name today and join me in urging an end to this war.

Most importantly, more than 40,000 troops are still in harm’s way because this war has been allowed to continue. Even in the best case, by the end of the year at least 10,000 American soldiers will still be on the ground.

I proudly served in the U.S. Army and have the utmost respect for the job our soldiers have done, but now it’s time to bring them home. Click here to join me today in calling for an end to the war in Afghanistan!

Thank you for joining me today,

David Alameel
