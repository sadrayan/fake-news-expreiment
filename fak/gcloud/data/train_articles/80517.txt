ITEP Tax Inequality Index

According to ITEP’s Tax Inequality Index, North Carolina has the 31st most unfair state and local tax system in the country. States with regressive tax structures have negative tax inequality indexes, meaning that incomes are less equal in those states after state and local taxes than before (See Appendix B for state-by-state rankings and more details).
