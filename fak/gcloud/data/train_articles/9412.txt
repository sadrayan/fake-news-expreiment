Scroll down for updates, breakdown of B.O. Republicans voting yes…



(Design by Wes M.)

Screw up, move up. Eric Holder sailed through.

Senate voted 75-21. All NAYS were Republicans.

Stand by for roll call vote. Nearly 20 Bend Over Republicans joined Dems to confirm. Voting yes: GOP Sen. Kit Bond. Why? Because Holder is a “good listener:”

A group of nearly 20 GOP senators joined all Democrats in supporting his nomination to lead President Obama’s Justice Department. Twenty-one Republicans voted against his confirmation. …Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) had seriously considered voting against Holder but eventually supported him. “I found Mr. Holder to be a good listener, which is an important prerequisite for any good leader,” said Bond, the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I believe him when he says that he’s willing to take good ideas from wherever they come.”

Ok, the official Senate roll call vote is not up yet, but C-SPAN just flashed the list of Republicans who voted against.

Here are the 21 Nays:
