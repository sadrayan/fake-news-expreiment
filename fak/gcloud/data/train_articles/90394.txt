Rubio Votes In Support Of Kate’s Law, Addressing Sanctuary Cities
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) today issued the following statement after voting to support two bills addressing sanctuary city policies:

“We have a broken immigration that needs to be fixed, and the only way it’s going to happen is a step by step approach that begins with securing our border and enforcing our laws. Today, I was proud to support two first steps to fix our broken immigration system, including Kate’s Law which would ensure meaningful jail time for criminals who repeatedly violate our immigration laws, as well as another proposal to address the problem of sanctuary city policies.

“A year ago almost to the week, 32-year old Kate Steinle was murdered in cold blood in the middle of the day by someone who should have never been in our country to begin with. Kate’s murder reminded us of just how broken and nonsensical our immigration laws have become. It is common sense that every local government in America should cooperate with federal immigration laws, yet today we have numerous cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities trying to enforce those laws. These sanctuary city policies make our immigration problems worse by sending the wrong message that the immigration laws of this country can be violated with impunity.

“That’s why I voted for these bills to bar non-law enforcement federal funding from any city that prevents its law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration officials in the enforcement of our laws. Passing these bills and preventing future tragedies like the senseless murder of Kate Steinle is one way we can honor her memory. It is simply unconscionable that any city in America has a policy that allows a man such as the one who killed her, who had been deported as many as five times, to freely roam its streets.”
