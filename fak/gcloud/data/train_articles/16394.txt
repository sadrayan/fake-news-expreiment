Thanks for the inquiry. Please see the response to your questions below:

Q:"Our men and women of the" National "Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves." I write now to see if more information was available at that time on this topic.

A: Currently, there is no new information on this matter. To date, the Texas National Guard is not aware of any service members utilizing the food banks for resources. It is important to note, the Texas National Guard offers robust services to its service members and their families who identify a need, including temporary financial assistance, resilience training and counseling, family readiness and reintegration activities.

Additionally, those service members supporting Operation Strong Safety receive pay, allowance for housing, and per diem for meals on the normal state payroll schedule.

Q:Also, is there any update?

Not at this time.

Should you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us.

Very Respectfully,

Texas Military Forces Public Affairs Staff
