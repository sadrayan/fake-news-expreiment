Will third-party voters decide the 2020 presidential election?

Statement of Methodology

This survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted between March 13 and March 17, 2019, and is based on live telephone interviews of adults 18 years of age or older, residing in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Quota and demographic information—including region, race, and age—were determined from national census data. Samples of both standard landlines and cell phones were called using a probability-proportionate-to-size method, which means that the phone numbers assigned to each state were proportional to the number of adult residents in each state. States were grouped into four general regions. Respondents in the households were selected by initially asking for the youngest adult. Surveys were administered in English and Spanish. The margin of sampling error for results based on the total sample is +/-3 percentage points. Error margins increase for smaller subgroups in the cross-tabulation document above. All surveys may be subject to other sources of error, including but not limited to coverage error and measurement error.
