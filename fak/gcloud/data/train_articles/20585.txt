NAEP State Comparisons.net
State Comparisons provides tables and maps that compare states and jurisdictions based on the average scale scores for selected groups of public school students within a single assessment year, or compare the change in performance between two assessment years. For example: See how the average reading score for male students in a particular state compares to the average

reading score for male students in other states in 2005, or See how the change (from 2002 to the focal year) in reading scores for male students in a particular

state compares to the change in reading scores for male students in other states. For more information regarding the use of State Comparisons read the State Comparisons Overview .
