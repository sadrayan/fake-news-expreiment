Clarksville Mugshots: MAN UP EDITION.
So we look at the zaniest photos of arrested people we can find in the Clarksville area. We laugh, love, and be merry. I’m sure that several people that read this site have also been on the sheriff’s arrest page, and I’m sure that some of you will likely be there in the future.

So a word of advice for the fellas…when your photo op arrives and it’s time to get your mugshot that will last TILL THE WORLD IMPLODES, I’ve got one word of advice:

MAN UP.

This everlasting moment will define you as a man for the rest of your life (probably). Do you wanna look like a lil’ whiny infantile creature? Like THIS guy?



C’mon amigo! Public intoxic is like the level 1-1 of Super Mario Brothers for Clarksville arrestees. ANYONE can get that, so why you crying?

Or how about this?

If you’re crying because your life is over…well it is. Because if your friends didn’t disown you for the arrest, they’ll definitely not stick around with that photo in your file. Suddenly every phone call you make goes to voice mail. Wonder why that is???

BE PREPARED. Hopefully the shock of being arrested has wore off by the time your pic is snapped. Don’t be “Mr. Deer-In-Headlights” like this fella…



MAN UP…don’t be afraid of what you know you can’t avoid. Get up there and play it cool….



DAMN, I didn’t say look like you want to rape the camera (I’m sure that’s arrest-worthy as well).

I said play it cool. When it doubt, study the following picture.



It’s not a big-ass cheesy smile. It’s a smirk with just enough attitude to say “Yes, I know I’ll never be able to get a job that pays more than $25,000 a year. But that won’t bring me down.”

Good luck men. Make me proud, because obviously it’s too late to make your mothers proud.
