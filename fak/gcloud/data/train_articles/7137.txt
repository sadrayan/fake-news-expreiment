Higher Education Legislation in 2013
States increased funding for higher education by an average of 5 percent in 2013 making the appropriations process one of the yearâ€™s most significant legislative trends. After several years of budget deficits or minimal revenue growth, state legislators in 43 states took advantage of strong tax revenues in 2013 to increase funding for higher education institutions. This increased state support combined with tuition freezes by institutions in 13 states led to the lowest average tuition increase since the early 1980s. Even with a small break in tuition increases, college affordability and student loan debt remained a primary concern of students and their families and a top legislative priority. Other legislative trends in 2013 included the success of veterans, in-state tuition for undocumented students, online learning, workforce development, transfer and articulation, and performance funding.

Student Loans and Affordability

The total amount of student loan debt in the United States recently crossed the $1 trillion threshold to become the second largest category of household debt in the country behind home mortgages. Mounting concern over student loan debt coupled with perennial concerns about the affordability of college led state policymakers to take several actions in 2013. Connecticut, New Jersey and Texas passed legislation to improve the quality of financial aid information available and the financial literacy of students. New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming passed legislation to create loan repayment programs that will assist teachers who meet certain requirements. Texas also passed legislation to offer students fixed tuition rates for four years at certain institutions while Oregon passed legislation to study offering fixed tuition rates at all four-year institutions. Colorado and Virginia passed legislation that will make saving for college easier by allowing residents to directly deposit income tax refunds into college savings accounts. Finally, Arizona and Indiana passed legislation to allow state entities to become direct lenders of student loans.

Workforce Development

Recognizing the need for a well-educated workforce in the modern economy, several states passed legislation in 2013 to improve the human capital of residents.

Online Learning

Online learning has been around for many years in various forms, but current state budget constraints combined with innovations such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have renewed interest in the role technology will play in postsecondary education. In California, students enrolled at a California State University (CSU) are now able to take online courses offered by other CSU institutions. In Florida, the Board of Education and Board of Governors are charged with developing rules to enable high schools students to earn academic credit for online courses including MOOCs.

State Legislation California Assembly Bill 386: Under this bill, students enrolled at a California State University (CSU) campus will have the opportunity to enroll in online courses available at other CSU campuses. As long as space is available, any student enrolled at a CSU campus who meets specified requirements can enroll in an online course offered by another CSU campus without formal admission and without payment of additional tuition or fees. Florida House Bill 7029: Beginning in the 2015-2016 school year, the State Board of Education and the Board of Governors shall adopt rules that enable students to earn academic credit for online courses, including massive open online courses, prior to initial enrollment at a postsecondary institution.

Performance Funding

In an effort to align state goals with those of postsecondary institutions, a growing number of states have begun allocating some amount of higher education funding based on the outcomes produced by institutions. In 2013, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, North Carolina and North Dakota joined 17 other states in allocating a portion of higher education funding based on how well institutions performed on specific metrics. In addition, Arizona and South Dakota approved changes to existing performance funding systems.
