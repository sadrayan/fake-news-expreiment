LAS VEGAS - The rumor of a second shooter during the mass shooting in Las Vegas at an outdoor country music concert started shortly after the gunfire ended Sunday night.

It received so much attention, Las Vegas police addressed it at a Tuesday night news conference.

"I want to emphasize Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant," said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said.

He said, there was no evidence to support the theory of another shooter.

Stephen Paddock was found dead in a hotel room on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. The shooting stopped 11 minutes after the police received their first call.

A video is posted on YouTube where a person claims that flashes of light prove there was another shooter in a hotel room at a lower level.

Aside from the police statement, more evidence against a second shooter is the fact no other windows in the hotel were broken. The windows do not open. Paddock had to break the windows in his room to shoot from them.
