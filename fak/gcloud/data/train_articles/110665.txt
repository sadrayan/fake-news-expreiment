Hillary Clinton was one of the many women to respond to the Senate’s approval Tuesday of a bill requiring women to register for the draft when they turn 18. Clinton told The Huffington Post that she supports the measure, though she continues to favor an all-volunteer military, which the U.S. has had since 1973.

“I am on record as supporting the all-volunteer military, which I think at this time does serve our country well,” Clinton told The Huffington Post. “And I am very committed to supporting and really lifting up the men and women in uniform and their families.”

Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, said after the vote that “it’s just a matter of time” until women are treated equally in the military. The reaction from women outside of politics, including commenters on Women in the World’s Facebook page, was decidedly more diverse.

“Equal pay and Full Control of our bodies. Then we can talk,” Luna Kelley wrote on Facebook.

“Not until the military starts taking sexual assault cases seriously. We shouldn’t have a draft anyways,” Gabrielle Morrow said.

Brandy Naugle said that if a draft were enacted and women were forced to serve, “the US government would be forced to confront the realities of the female body, mind, and possibilities.”

“I think this would be a big step toward real female empowerment and also a general change in attitude toward the quickness in going to war. I see this as potentially a very good thing,” Naugle wrote.
