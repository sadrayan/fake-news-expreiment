Hoax Reports Claim ‘Pig Gives Birth to Human Baby’
According to a number of breathless “news” reports that are currently beings shared via social media, a mother pig in Kenya has given birth to a strange human-like creature.





The reports feature several photographs depicting the bizarre looking human-pig hybrid. Some versions claim that the baby died soon after delivery.

But, not surprisingly, the story is utter nonsense. The “baby hybrid pig” is not a real living creature but rather a silicon sculpture created by the Italian artist Maganuco Laira.

The images used in the hoax reports come from the artist’s Etsy store. In the photographs, the sculpture has been staged for effect in a farmyard setting, complete with mother pig picture.

In the Etsy listing for the baby pig hybrid, the artist notes that:

This piece a set of silicones, arts and other details in silicone paste is an acetic silicone made in moldable paste through a body and head process. They are super soft platinum silicone

Maganuco Laira has created a whole menagerie of strange and unusual creatures, which she sells via her Etsy shop. But, alas, if you wanted the baby hybrid pig for yourself, you are too late. The sculpture has already been sold.

An example of the circulating reports:

Residents of Muranga are shocked after a pig delivered a creature that resembles a human being. Yesterday morning, Kamau heard commotion in the pig’s house and when he went to check what was going on, he found out the pig was delivering. He helped it deliver successfully but was shocked the young one resembled a baby boy.
