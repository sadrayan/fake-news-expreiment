CREW Urges Presidential Candidates to Disclose Tax Returns

Washington, D.C. – In light of Sen. Barack Obama’s (D-IL) release of his tax returns this week, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) urges the remaining presidential candidates, Sens. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and John McCain (R-AZ), to release their returns as well. When running for president, candidates must be willing to put all their cards on the table. We encourage Sens. Clinton and McCain to do so now.

Below, CREW has compiled a list of presidential and vice presidential candidates who have released their returns since 1992.
