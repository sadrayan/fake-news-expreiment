Shocking Video Of Car Running Over Trump Protesters On Highway -
At some point, most Americans will crack.

The protests, the demonstrations, the riots. It all becomes too much.

Blocking the road, chanting “F**k the Police!” and “Shut This Sh*t Down!” It’s offensive, vulgar and accomplishes nothing.

Perhaps that’s why this driver snapped. Perhaps that’s why he may very well have killed someone.

You can see protesters in this undated and unknown video (posted by the Facebook group “Trump Supporters”) blocking a highway. It looks like a protest in Brazil. It’s unknown what they’re protesting, but one can take a good guess. You can see what looks like a black flag waving.
