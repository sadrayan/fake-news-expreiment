So Who The Heck Was Oscar Mayer: The Real People Behind Those Brand Names: Doug Gelbert: 9781569800829: Amazon.com: Books
If you have ever wondered if Colonel Sanders was actually a Colonel or if there was an actual Mary Kay, this is the book for you. Trivia buffs and "just plain curious" people will enjoy this comprehensive guide to all those wonderful household names we have grown up with over the years.



Brands like Armour, Keebler, Hershey, Jack Daniel's, Max Factor, Kresge's, Black & Decker, Fisher-Price and countless others are so much a part of our lives. Yet most people know nothing about the men and women who created those famous companies. Well, here is the straight skinny on many of those hallowed names.



The names are broken down into categories: 'In the Kitchen,' 'On the Vanity,' 'On the Desk' and so on. Each person/company is then covered in one-two page capsule histories.



This is a marvelous book and makes for fascinating reading. Then why only four stars? It has no photographs and that's a major omission. After reading about all these over-achievers, you want to see a mugshot!
