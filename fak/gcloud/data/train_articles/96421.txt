Poll: NH residents favor increase in minimum wage
A new poll says most New Hampshire residents favor raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour.



The New Hampshire Legislature will consider a bill that would raise the wage from $7.25 to $8.25 in 2015 and to $9 in 2016.



The WMUR Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center finds that 59 percent of residents strongly support the increase; 17 percent somewhat support it. Eight percent strongly oppose it; 5 percent somewhat oppose it. Eleven percent are neutral or don't know enough to say.



The poll said majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents favor the increase.



The phone poll of 568 New Hampshire adults between Jan. 28 and Feb. 2 had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
