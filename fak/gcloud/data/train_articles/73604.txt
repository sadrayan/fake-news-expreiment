Pulse Nightclub Shooting: June 13, 2016 Update
As the investigation into the tragic mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub unfolds. The men and women of the Orlando Police Department are continuing to assist in and support this operation in a number of ways.

One of the most difficult tasks for any law enforcement officer is making death notifications to next of kin. Our personnel have done that over more than 24 hours with great care and compassion for the families and loved ones who have suffered devastating losses. Those relatives and friends have been kind and gracious in a most unbearable time of grief.

OPD also would like to extend its deepest thanks to the many business owners on Orange Avenue whose livelihoods have been disrupted as we methodically care for the crime scene. And no amount of thanks is sufficient for the amazing Orlando community that has rallied around our department and supported in countless ways.

Summary of events, June 13, 2016.

Official victim count: 49 shooting victims plus suspect. Total 50.

Original Release:

“We will not be defined by this act of terror” — Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer

(This is a summary of much of the information the Orlando Police Department released throughout the day on Sunday, June 12.)

On June 12, 2016, just after 2 a.m., an Orlando Police Officer working extra duty at the Pulse Nightclub, located at 1912 S. Orange Ave., responded to shots fired. Our officer engaged in a gun battle with that suspect and the suspect went deeper into the club where more shots were fired. The incident then turned into a hostage situation.

The suspect – later identified as 29-year-old Omar Mir Seddique Mateen of Fort Pierce, Florida – continued shooting inside the club.

At 5 a.m., the decision was made to breach the club and rescue the hostages, OPD Chief John Mina said. Officers were able to rescue 30 hostages and lead them to safety. Our SWAT Officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect, killing him. The gunman, an American citizen living in Florida, legally purchased the firearms within the last week, said Trevor Velinor, Asst. Special Agent In Charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Tampa Field Office.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will conduct the Officer Involved Shooting investigation. The 11 OPD officers involved are relieved of duty, as is standard in any officer involved shooting.

A total of 50 people were killed in the shooting; an additional 53 were injured. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said Sunday afternoon: “This is probably the most difficult day in the history of Orlando.”

The FBI is the lead Federal Law Enforcement agency and is answering questions through its Main National Press Office at 202-324-3691.
