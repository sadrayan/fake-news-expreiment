Rubio meets with SWFL growers on immigration issues
As talk in Washington focuses on immigration and relations with Mexico, Sen. Marco Rubio made a stop in Immokalee on Friday to talk about those issues with citrus growers who often turn to immigrant workers.

One of the key topics growers brought up with Rubio was labor, specifically the guest worker program, which lets growers hire workers from other countries on temporary work permits. They said the way the program is set up now could put them out of business.

Employers are required to give those workers housing and transportation, and when you add all that up, it means each worker is paid around $16 an hour.

Paul Meador manages orange groves in LaBelle. He asked Rubio to take a good look at the program, which 90 percent of citrus growers participate in.

"It's critical. We would be out of business without it," he said.

Another thing worrying growers is competition from countries like Mexico, where some people are choosing to do business. Rubio said a tariff is not the answer in the situation.

"A better way to address is to make America an easier place to do business," he said.

When asked about Trump's border wall, Rubio said, "That alone isn't going to solve the problem. In Florida, 70 percent of people who are here illegally came on an airplane. They overstayed a visa. So the wall isn't going to address that."

He said he supports a physical barrier but thinks the U.S. can pay for it with better budgeting, not with a tariff.

"The relationship with Mexico is important for America and important for Mexico."

Growers who spoke with NBC2 on Friday said they thought Friday's meeting was productive and they hope Rubio will keep their industry in mind during the current session.
