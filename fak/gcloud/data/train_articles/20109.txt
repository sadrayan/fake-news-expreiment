Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage, among others, will be assisting in the coordination of sibling marches around the country. More information regarding sibling marches can be found here.

I WANT TO START A SIBLING MARCH. HOW DO I DO IT? We are so excited you want to start a march! Just note, there are already sibling marches happening all over the country. You can find more information about those here. Please RSVP and get involved with your local march if one is already being planned. If there is no march near you, get organizing! Here is a link to a toolkit to help you get started, and email Marchforourlives@everytown.org to be added to the list!

I HAVE ALREADY STARTED A MARCH! WHAT DO I DO? First, make sure your event is listed in our official event page so that people can sign up to attend: marchforourlives.com/events. If your event is not listed, please email Marchforourlives@everytown.org to let them know. Next, have you checked out the toolkit? If you have questions about running a sibling march, please reach out to marchforourlives@everytown.org. In the coming days, registered host organizers will also be invited to apply for a $5,000 grant from Everytown for Gun Safety to support their local march.

HOW DO I CHANGE DETAILS ABOUT MY SIBLING MARCH? After you create a sibling march event you will have a host link that allows you to change any of the details about the event. If you are having a problem changing details about your event you can email marchforourlives@everytown.org.

MY SIBLING CITY MARCH IS UP ON YOUR MAP, BUT I'M NOT THE HOST/CAN'T EDIT IT! If you need to be added as an event host for a sibling march, please RSVP for that event and then email marchforourlives@everytown.org. You will receive a host link in our email that will allow you to edit details and confirm attendees.

IS THERE A SIBLING MARCH IN MY CITY? You can now see if there’s a march in your area here — and if not, create your own and check out the toolkit! March on!

HOW ELSE CAN I STAY INVOLVED? March on the 24th (sign up here)! Organize a sign making party! And register to vote to continue to have your voice heard HERE!

CAN I SPEAK AT THE D.C. MARCH? We will be releasing a speaker line up closer to 3/24. We are not controlling the speaker line ups for the sibling marches. The best way you can support this movement is by showing up to march and rallying your community to do the same.

I HAVE A MEDIA INQUIRY FOR THE STUDENTS. For any media inquiries, please reach out to: mediaops@marchforourlives.com. Please note we are overwhelmed by media requests, and it might take a while for us to respond.

WHO IS COORDINATING THE WORK OF THIS MOVEMENT? This movement is for kids and by kids. March For Our Lives organizers are the kids themselves. They have brought in support to help ensure it is a success.

HOW CAN I DONATE? Donations can be made here.

WHERE DO DONATIONS TO THE MARCH FOR OUR LIVES ACTION FUND GO? Donations to the March For Our Lives Action Fund will cover all expenses associated with the march taking place in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, March 24th. The funds will also be used to fight for comprehensive gun safety legislation at the local, state, and federal level, and will also include voter education, ballot initiatives, and lobbying state legislatures and Congress to protect America’s kids.

WHERE CAN I SEND A CHECK TO DONATE? Checks can be sent to: March For Our Lives Action Fund

16130 Ventura Blvd Ste 320

Encino, CA 91435

WHERE DO GOFUNDME DONATIONS GO? Donations made via the GoFundMe will be split evenly between the Broward Education Foundation to support the families of victims and the injured and the March For Our Lives Action Fund.

CAN I MAKE TAX-DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ACTION FUND? No. March for Our Lives Action Fund is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. Unlike section 501(c)(3) charitable organizations which have restrictions on their lobbying activities, section 501(c)(4) organizations are permitted to conduct unlimited lobbying for federal tax purposes. This form of entity gives the students maximum flexibility to conduct high-impact legislative advocacy during the Day of Action and beyond. The trade-off is that contributions are not tax-deductible.

IS THERE A SECTION 501(C)(3) MARCH FOR OUR LIVES ORGANIZATION? You can make tax-deductible contributions to support the March for Our Lives movement and student-led activism by supporting the March For Our Lives Initiative at Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund. Checks should be made payable to: March For Our Lives—Everytown Support Fund Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund
