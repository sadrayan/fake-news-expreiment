A cup, water and a penny could keep your family from getting sick after a storm like Hurricane Irma, that’s threatening to knock out power in Tampa Bay.

Here’s how it works. Freeze a cup of water, put a penny on top of the frozen water and leave it in the freezer. If you evacuate, you might not know if the power goes out, so that penny will give you a good indication that it did and if the food in your freezer is safe to eat.

If the penny has moved into the ice in the cup, that could mean there was an extended power outage, causing the water to melt and refreeze. If the water ever melted, microorganisms could multiply and cause food poisoning.

You should also put some items from your refrigerator into your freezer if you evacuate. Staples like milk, fresh meats or chicken, to keep them at a safe temperature longer.

Turn refrigerator to coldest setting and crank the air conditioner - Power outage is very common with these strong storms, so make sure to keep things as cold as possible before the storm so it can remain cooler for longer.
