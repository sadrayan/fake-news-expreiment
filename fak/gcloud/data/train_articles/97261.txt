Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Armed Forces health services examined the files of 30,000 soldiers who served in Afghanistan, but we have learned that 70% of these soldiers will be released as a result of the universality of service principle.

This means that veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression will be shown the door.

When will this government stop trying to save money at our soldiers' expense?
