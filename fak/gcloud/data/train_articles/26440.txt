Coffman Statement on the DREAM Act
Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Aurora) issued the following statement regarding the House vote tonight on the DREAM Act, an act that gives amnesty to certain illegal immigrants in the United States:

"The Dream Act will be a nightmare for the American people. No doubt, we need immigration reform but the Dream Act is written far too broadly and it will only encourage more illegal immigration, promote chain migration, and will be a magnet for fraud."
