WATCH: White House Says THIS About Obama Golfing During Scalia Funeral
The big question burning up Washington these days is what is Obama doing instead of going to the Justice’s funeral. Apparently, he will be lounging around because even his Press Secretary is dodging the question!

When asked if Obama would be playing golf on Saturday, Earnest stated, “I don’t have a sense of what the President’s plans are for Saturday.” Isn’t that a little odd the man that often speaks for the President has no idea what he is doing?

I thought the President’s itinerary was pretty much set in stone days in advance unless an emergency popped up causing it to change. So, then, how does his press secretary not know where Obama will be?

Earnest only makes matters worse by chiding the press, insinuating this is not really a big deal. Well, Josh, I hate to tell you, but this is a VERY big deal!





At the very least, couldn’t he at least say the President would surely NOT be on the golf course?

It is almost as though Obama and company are taunting us. They have to know this is going to piss people off and bring him under more scrutiny, yet he simply does not care!

Maybe it is part of his master plan and he is actually going to show up so the right looks awful for making a big deal about this. Nah, that would require forward thinking, something we all know he clearly does not have!

If there was ever a time for Obama to follow his own advice and put political lines aside, this would be it. Instead, he is being petty and spiteful as well as completely disrespectful of Justice Scalia and his family.
