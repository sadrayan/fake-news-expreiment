Trump’s former butler denies groping claims against candidate
Donald Trump’s former Mar-a-Lago Butler backed up the Republican nominee for president in denying the billionaire groped a reporter from People magazine.

“No, that never happened. Come on, that’s just bull crap,” said Anthony “Tony” Senecal.

People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff wrote an essay this week about how she was groped by Trump at Mar-a-Lago during an interview in the early 2000s. She is one of four women to make accusations against Trump of unwanted sexual advances.

The issue has become central to the presidential race since a 2005 hot-mic video surfaced of Trump bragging about using his celebrity to grope women. He has downplayed the incident as “locker-room talk.”

Trump, at his rally in West Palm Beach on Thursday, said he was always in a public place with Stoynoff and denied he ever acted inappropriately.

“Look at her,” Trump said, apparently referencing the reporter’s appearance. “Look at her words. Tell me what you think. I don’t think so.”

Senecal, 85, said he never saw Trump putting the moves on any women at Mar-a-Lago — even when his boss wasn’t married.

“Everybody is just jumping on the train,” he said. “I think you’re going to see even more of it between now and the election. But these incidents never happened.”

Senecal blamed Trump’s democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for the reports surfacing as the Nov. 8 election nears.

“These guys are pushing his back against the wall. But he’s a fighter. He’ll take them on. He’ll take all of them on,” Senecal said.
