World’s Largest Swimming Pool cost nearly Two Billion Dollars to Build

Seriously, take a long and deep breath if you’re thinking of making a lap in the swimming pool at the San Alfonso del Mar resort in Algarrobo city, Chile. The 20 acres man-made saltwater lagoon measures more than one thousand yards in length, 115 feet deep and fills with 66 million gallons of water. It overwhelmed the World’s 2nd largest pool in Morocco, the Big Splash, which has a mere size of 150 x 100 yards. Yesterday, the Guinness Book of Records has officially recognized the San Alfonso lagoon as the World’s largest swimming pool.

The lagoon took five years, with an estimated cost of nearly £1billion ($1.96 Billion USD) to build and £2million ($3.91 Million USD) in annual maintenance that uses a computerized suction and filtration system to circulate the fresh seawater. Don’t tell your date to meet at the San Alfonso pool, you might get lost or worst… drown.
