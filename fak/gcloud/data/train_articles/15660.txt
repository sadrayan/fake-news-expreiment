Never heard this one before. This was a post 9/11 fear but I never saw evidence for it.

Good afternoon.

...we are trying to fact-check a statement made by Rep. Louie Gohmert today that al Qaeda has camps with drug cartels on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border. He also said radical Islamists are being trained to act like Hispanic(s).

Are you aware of factual information bearing on this? Is there any other source you’d recommend we consider or consult?

I would be happy to do an interview by phone if that appeals.

Here is precisely what Gohmert said: “We know al Qaeda has camps over with the drug cartels on the other side of the Mexican border. We know that people are now being trained to come in and act like Hispanic when they’re radical Islamists. We know these things are happening and... it’s just insane not to protect ourselves.”
