Senator Maria Elena Durazo
SACRAMENTO – California Senator María Elena Durazo (D-Los Ángeles) today issued the following statement regarding the California Legislature Conference Committee on the Budget:

“138,000 previously uncovered undocumented immigrants may now be eligible for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits,” said Senator María Elena Durazo. “I’m disappointed that our seniors are not included in the budget framework. Nevertheless, we are going to keep pushing for it because our seniors deserve our support. No low-income Californian should be denied access to affordable primary health care.”
