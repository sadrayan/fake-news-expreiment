Pro-Ted Cruz group airs ad accusing ‘Open Borders O’Rourke’ of enticing migrant caravan
Updated at 5 p.m.: Revised to include O'Rourke response, description of new attack ad by a second, pro-Cruz super PAC.

AUSTIN -- Just in time for Halloween, a wealthy donor group that supports Sen. Ted Cruz has unleashed a TV ad barrage that complains Democratic Senate hopeful Beto O'Rourke is too welcoming of a so-called caravan of Central American migrants.

"Running for Senate, pushing free health care, even lawyers for illegals. Fighting deportation," says the new ad by Texans Are, a pro-Cruz super PAC.

"Against background checks for refugees from terrorist hotbeds -- that's Open Borders O'Rourke," it says, calling the El Paso congressman "recklessly radical" and wrong to dismiss concerns over the caravan.

Brandon Rottinghaus, a University of Houston political scientist, said "it's outrageous to believe that O'Rourke would have anything to do with the caravan, aiding and abetting it."

But the ad, which began running Tuesday, stokes fears, he said.

"It turns some of O'Rourke's positives," such as his jogging and skateboarding, "into negatives," Rottinghaus said. It is designed to drive any conservative-leaning voters who haven't yet cast ballots to the polls, he said.

"This ad is the 72-ounce steak of American politics," the UH professor said. "It is a giant slab of beef designed to appeal to a very core, base voter."

Asked about the ad at an event in East Austin, O'Rourke responded that Cruz has obstructed Senate deliberations on a much-needed overhaul of federal immigration law.

"You know, perhaps no one cares more about a secure border than those of us who live on the border," he said. "Amy and I are raising our three kids" there, he said. "That's why I've made border security a priority [and] been able to work with John Cornyn, a Republican senior senator from the state ..., on common-sense, border solutions."
