She Became a Face of Family Separation at the Border. But She’s Still With Her Mother.
The photograph of a Honduran toddler, sobbing as she stares up at her mother, became a symbol of outrage this week at the Trump administration’s practice of separating children and parents detained for illegally crossing the border.

But the child’s father, reached by phone in Honduras on Friday, told The New York Times that the mother and daughter were in fact never separated after being stopped at the border, and that they remain detained together in a family residential center in Texas.

In a front-page caption published June 14 with a similar photo from a series by John Moore of Getty Images, The Times said only that the girl was crying while her mother was searched. The family’s status and whereabouts could not be determined.

It was a related image by Mr. Moore of the isolated toddler staring up at her mother and a border agent, both visible only from the waist down, that in subsequent days became a potent symbol in the angry debate over the family separation policy, along with video and pictures of children in chain-link cages and pens taken at Border Patrol sites.
