Three rearrested by ICE after local authorities fail to honor detainers
"At-large criminal alien arrests are among the most dangerous type of enforcement actions ICE officers are engaged in on a daily basis. These arrests also represent the greatest risk to the community," Thomas Decker, field office director for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations in Philadelphia, said in the release. "This level of risk can be mitigated in many instances. ICE welcomes changes to the current policy that would allow the city to cooperate with ICE toward achieving the shared goal of protecting public safety and national security while balancing important community policing needs."
