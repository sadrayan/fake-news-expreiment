8-Year Old Girl Receives Breast Implants for Her Birthday
A 8-year-old girl Juliet Manson, received a very special present from her mother for her 8th birthday: a trip to China to undergo a breast augmentation surgery.

Her mother, Dana Manson, says she tried to convince Juliet that her body would grow with time, but her daughter was “completely obsessed” with the idea of getting breast implants.

“She would ask us multiple times a day, every day,” she told NBC. “There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having implants.”

Ms Manson contacted dozens on clinics in the U.S. and Mexico, but none of them were willing to perform a surgery on such a young girl.

But she finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China, where doctors were willing to perform the operation that took less than two hours and went exactly as planned.

The young girl now has a 30C cup, and her mother says she’s “extremely happy about her about her new breasts”.

Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world, she wanted her children to be happy.

The young girl’s story caught the world’s attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery, instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media.

Despite the critics, Dana Manson says she did “what was best for her daughter” and insists that she has no regrets.
