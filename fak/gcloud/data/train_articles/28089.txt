"The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution", Richard Breitman, 250 pgs, Glossary, Notes & Index, 6" x 9".



Author or co-author of 3 prior books on socialist Germany & Jewry issues, this Yale & Harvard degreed Professor Breitman provides a scholarly analysis of Nazi Germany with especial reference to the 3 principals: - the Triumvirate of Hitler, Himmler (SS) & Heydrich (SD) & the roles each played formulating plans of re-Germanization that encompassed comprehesive plans to (1) purify Germanic Nordic blood lines by eugenic measures, (2) eliminate those designated as enemies of the Reich (Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Slavs, etc.) & (3) provide Lebensraum, especially Eastward for expansion of the Fatherland.



The book profiles Heinrich Himmler as a cradle-Catholic turning into a militant anti-Catholic & anti-Semitic who participates in Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch, & in short order becomes Reich Fuehrer SS, Chief of all Police, & confidant of Hitler. In 11 chapters we are introduced to the origin, delineation, & execution of the "Final Solution" to solve the "Jewish Question." The author attempts to demonstrate authorship of the genocide design & of its implementation was really a product more of Himmler's that Hitler's. Diverse details are provided on alternative plans including deportations to Africa or Madagascar, types of gasings, exclusions from euthanasia, labor camps, etc. All in all, the author's arguements are detailed but sufficiently conjectural as to make for good reading but truly falling short of singling out Himmler as chief architect. Of the many books on the Holocaust & Final Solution, Bretman's is the most detailed accounting of alternative plans and details unanticipated problems not forseen in ethnic cleansing & military in-fighting, etc. A good read for the student of genocide.
