Vertebral Artery Dissection: Practice Essentials, Background, Pathophysiology
Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a relatively rare but increasingly recognized cause of stroke in patients younger than 45 years. Although the term spontaneous VAD is used to describe cases that do not involve significant blunt or penetrating trauma as a precipitating factor, many patients with so-called spontaneous VAD have a history of trivial or minor injury involving some degree of cervical distortion.

Signs and symptoms

The typical patient with VAD is a young person who experiences severe occipital headache and posterior nuchal pain following a head or neck injury and subsequently develops focal neurologic signs attributable to ischemia of the brainstem or cerebellum. The focal signs may not appear until after a latent period lasting as long as three days, however, and delays of weeks and years also have been reported. Many patients present only at the onset of neurologic symptoms.

When neurologic dysfunction does occur, patients most commonly report symptoms attributable to lateral medullary dysfunction (ie, Wallenberg syndrome). Patient history may include the following:

Ipsilateral facial dysesthesia (pain and numbness) [1] - Most common symptom

Dysarthria or hoarseness (cranial nerves [CN] IX and X)

Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the trunk and limbs

Ipsilateral loss of taste (nucleus and tractus solitarius)

Hiccups

Vertigo [1]

Nausea and vomiting

Diplopia or oscillopsia (image movement experienced with head motion)

Dysphagia (CN IX and X)

Disequilibrium

Unilateral hearing loss [2]

Rarely, patients may manifest the following symptoms of a medial medullary syndrome:

Contralateral weakness or paralysis (pyramidal tract)

Contralateral numbness (medial lemniscus)

Depending upon which areas of the brainstem or cerebellum are experiencing ischemia, the following signs may be present:

Limb or truncal ataxia

Nystagmus [3]

Ipsilateral Horner syndrome [4, 5]

Ipsilateral hypogeusia or ageusia (ie, diminished or absent sense of taste)

Ipsilateral impairment of fine touch and proprioception

Contralateral impairment of pain and thermal sensation in the extremities (ie, spinothalamic tract)

Lateral medullary syndrome [6]

Cerebellar findings may include the following:

Nystagmus

Medial medullary syndrome

Tongue deviation to the side of the lesion (impairment of CN XII)

Contralateral hemiparesis

Ipsilateral impairment of fine touch and proprioception (nucleus gracilis)

Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus)

See Presentation for more detail.

Diagnosis

Imaging studies in patients with suspected VAD may include the following:

Computed tomography (CT) scanning – Identifies subarachnoid hemorrhage [3] ; CT angiography (CTA), along with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), are the imaging modalities of choice for vertebral artery dissections; however, CTA is less accurate in the presence of calcified arteries.

Magnetic resonance imaging [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] – Detects both the intramural thrombus and intimal flap that are characteristic of VAD [7] ; hyperintensity of the vessel wall seen on T1-weighted axial images is considered by some to be pathognomonic of VAD

MRA [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] – Can identify a pseudolumen and aneurysmal dilation of the artery [7]

Four-vessel cerebral angiography [7] – Once the criterion standard for diagnosis, now largely supplanted by noninvasive techniques

Vascular duplex scanning – Demonstrates abnormal flow in 95% of patients with VAD, [8] but shows signs specific to VAD (eg, segmental dilation of the vessel, eccentric channel) in only 20%

Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography – Approximately 75% sensitive to the flow abnormalities seen in VAD useful also in detecting high-intensity signals (HITS), which are characteristic of microemboli propagating distally as a result of the dissection; ultrasonography may have a role in the initial diagnosis of dissections if CT-A or MRA are unavailable.

Because VAD occurs in young, generally healthy individuals, laboratory evaluation is directed toward establishing baseline parameters in anticipation of anticoagulant therapy, as follows:

Prothrombin time (PT) with international normalized ratio (INR)

Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)

In addition, elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may suggest vasculitis involving the cerebrovascular circulation.

See Workup for more detail.

Management

Acute management of proven or suspected spontaneous VAD is as follows [13] :

Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are the drugs of choice to prevent thromboembolic disorders; the data suggest no difference between the two modalities on outcomes and adverse effects

More potent agents (eg, intra-arterial thrombolytics) have been used in selected cases; there may be a role for these medications during acute ischemic events

Endovascular and surgical treatments are reserved for patients with concomitant complications or whose maximal medical therapy is unsuccessful
