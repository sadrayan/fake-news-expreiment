Subject: Texas reporter inquiry for a fact check

Sirs:

Good evening. I write each of you at the suggestion of PolitiFact’s Lou Jacobson because I am trying to fact-check former Rep. Ron Paul’s claim that he was “censored” and “muzzled” for the year after he left the House.

Campaign for Liberty has told me this claim by Paul was based on restrictions on former members in the House’s ethics rules.

Thoughts? Are there other restrictions or laws that better apply?

Underneath my signature below, I am pasting the top of Paul’s email blast containing his claim.

Of course, I’d be happy to visit by phone if that’s easier.

Thanks for your guidance for our story, which I hope to complete Tuesday.

He was restricted for one year under the standard one year cooling off period for all Congressman and Senior Staff. Senators have a two year restriction. During that time a former Member may not appear before Congress on substantive matters but that restriction does not prohibit public appearances.

Yes, I agree with Ken's explanation of the one-year cooling off period for former members of the House.
