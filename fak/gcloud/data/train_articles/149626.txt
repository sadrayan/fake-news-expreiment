In response to a June 19, 2014, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, Judicial Watch recently received documents from the Secret Service related to Michelle Obama’s March 2014 trip to China. The total Secret Service expenses adds up to $389,931.71:

$288,662.07 in hotels

$1,010.63 in cell phone rentals

$199.17 in supplies

$11,266.38 in overtime/per diem pay

$1,265.13 in miscellaneous services by another government agency

$5,130.50 in Air/Rail

Added to the previously released flight costs from the Air Force ($362,523.53) and the total for the trip comes to $752,455.24. Obama family travel cost taxpayers at least $100,104,459.53 during his two terms.

“Presidential travel is racking up millions of dollars in expenses paid by taxpayers. The liberal media didn’t much care about Judicial Watch’s reporting on President Obama’s abusive travel but now are keenly interested in President Trump’s trips. The Trump administration should do what the Obama administration did not do – move reforms through to get these expenses under control for this and future presidents,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “In the meantime, the bureaucracies should release the travel numbers rather than requiring us to go to court to get accountability for taxpayers.”
