DELEGATE COLE FILES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF SCHOOLCHILDREN AND ADULTS

January 13, 2016



Delegate Cole has filed legislation (House Bills 663 and 781) to require public agencies, including schools, to develop policies that require males to use facilities (restrooms, showers, and dressing rooms) that are designated for males and females to use facilities designated for females. If a facility is not designated, such as unisex bathrooms, then it would not apply to them.



It is common sense legislation designed to protect the privacy of children and adults, and was requested by a group of parents in my district who are concerned about a male student who wanted to use the girls facilities. Schools have been sued for not allowing males to use female restrooms and this legislation is intended to adopt a clear policy and to pre-empt further suits.



Contrary to what has been said about the legislation, it does NOT require genital checks. That is a lie started by those who want to make all facilities, including school restrooms, dressing rooms, and showers, "gender neutral." The legislation would be enforced on a complaint basis. If needed, gender could be verified by looking up student registration information or a birth certificate.
