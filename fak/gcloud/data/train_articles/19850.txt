Gas Tax Update
Thanks to the recent gas tax increase, Californians pay the highest gas prices in the nation â€“ averaging $3.23 per gallon.

Ordinary Californians have to dig deeper in their pockets on every fill up. Even worse, practically none of the new money raised by the gas tax will build new lanes.

Enough is enough.

How do high gas prices affect you?
