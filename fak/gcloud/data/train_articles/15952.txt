Fact: The first whereas in the resolution specifically lists the benefits to obamacare.

Fact: The resolution NEVER opposes medicaid expansion or Obamacare, hence Murphy's statement is false.

Fact: The resolution discusses the benefits of obamacare and medicaid expansion and then asks the legislature to keep "ALL possible options". How is medicaid expansion not included in "all possible options"?

Are you going to politifact Craig's tweet as well? I don't read a single thing in the resolution that passed that is against Obamacare? And NONE of these documents in any way point to a single line in the resolution that is against Medicaid Expansion.
