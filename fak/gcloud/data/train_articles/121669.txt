President Obama Highway signs replace Old Dixie ones in Riviera Beach
Goodbye, Old Dixie. Hello, President Barack Obama.

The city of Riviera Beach has begun replacing Old Dixie Highway signs with ones honoring the nation’s first black president.

Many black Americans have little love for the term “Dixie,” a reference to the slave-holding South. Obama, on the other hand, is revered by most black Americans.

Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters pushed for the street sign change from Old Dixie to Obama, and his colleagues on the City Council agreed.

So, the Old Dixie Highway signs are on their way out. They will be replaced by ones reading “President Barack Obama Highway.”

One of the first signs went up at one of the city’s major intersections, at Blue Heron Boulevard. That’s where Masters held a ceremony Thursday morning in honor of what he called a “historic celebration.”

“Old Dixie was a street that symbolized racism, hatred and segregation,” said Masters, adding that Riviera Beach resident Dora Johnson, 88, was traumatized by witnessing a cross burning on Old Dixie Highway. Masters says she is being given the old Old Dixie Highway sign that was taken down.

“Now our city has two presidents,” Masters also said, noting that the John F. Kennedy bunker on Peanut Island is in Riviera Beach.

The re-named highway also means there will be a historic street-sign meeting between Obama and another figure beloved by black Americans — the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
