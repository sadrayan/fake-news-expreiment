Subject: RE: Fresh inquiry from PolitiFact Texas

Thanks. Is there a bureau chart I can review for state by state figures as well as percentage changes? Also, how would you recommend I reach a “net” population figure for each state, taking into account births, deaths and in-flow, out-flow?

The components of change data (births, deaths and migration) will not be released until Jan. 23.

The pop estimates table can be found here http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2013/index.html. You would have to calculate your own percentage changes. Texas actually ranked 5th in rate of change among states, growing by 1.49%.
