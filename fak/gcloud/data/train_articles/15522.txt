Hello again. As mentioned, we’re fact-checking a claim that since lawmakers acted, “we have 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts.” Is it more like five or six? I would be interested in your analysis for our story.

Appreciated,

Sorry for the delay, but I don’t see more than 20 outfitters around the state right now. Not sure where that number is coming from.

Thanks.

I believe, at this point, that the figure ties to the number of Aerial Wildlife Management permits issued by TPWD.

Some 110 permits were issued in 2010, before the 2011 law came to be. Some 145 were issued in 2015. Meaning?

I’m pasting a Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept chart below. At a glance, do the numbers tell anything pertinent to the claim?

I’m very confident in my number of 10-20 outfitters that fly part of or all of the year and take customers flying and shooting.

I would guess that the permits are also issued to landowners who have guys out to fly their property. Does that make sense?

Subject: Take a look at this?

Hello again.

So, the state just provided the attached spreadsheet. Could you look it over and let us know how many of these permit holders appear to be in the business of providing/vending feral hog hunts—and which ones?

If that’s not possible, that’s ok too. We’re trying to take advantage of all available help/data.

Separately, the state has told us there were 86 commercial permits issued in 2010; now there are 110 – making for a difference of 24, if I read right. This seem meaningful to what we’re checking?

We’re hoping to complete our review today. Thanks again.

I highlighted the ones I know for sure offer helicopter hog hunting. It does look like there are a bunch of private ranches that have these permits as well for their own population control of feral hogs.
