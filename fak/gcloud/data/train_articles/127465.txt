Fifty Shades of Grey is most successful 18-rated film ever
Where Fifty Shades of Grey is concerned, the record books continue to take a thorough spanking. Having already enjoyed huge box office success in the UK – opening weekend takings were the highest of any film, not a sequel or part of a franchise, in UK history – Sam Taylor-Johnson's erotic drama is now the highest-earning 18-rated film of all time in the UK.

The film, which has been adapted from EL James's bestselling book, took a further £4.5 million ($7 million) at the UK box office last weekend, taking the UK total since its February 13 opening to well in excess of £25 million ($38.7 million).

Prior to this, it was Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, which contains an astonishing 506 uses of the word "f---", which was the highest-earning 18-rated film in the UK, taking £22.5 million ($34.7 million) at the box office.

Fifty Shades of Grey has taken $350 million worldwide at the box office. According to the Hollywood Reporter, director Sam Taylor-Wood now also holds the record for biggest launch for a film by a female director, eclipsing the $69.6 million for Catherine Hardwicke's 2010 adaptation of Twilight, ironically the original basis for EL James's Fifty Shades story.

"We're all popping champagne over here," Nick Carpou, Universal's president of domestic distribution told the Los Angeles Times.
