Gas Tax Wars

The gasoline wars between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have been heating up to coincide with the Indiana and North Carolina primaries. The airwaves are full of charges and counter-charges over Clinton's plan for a three month gas holiday between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Obama says the idea is simply an election day "gimmick"; Clinton claims her plan will save hard-working American families $8 billion a year. An examination of the fine print in the latest round of TV ads shows that both sides have been stretching the facts.

The Facts

Let's begin with the Clinton TV ad airing in Indiana which you can see above. After complaints from motorists about spiraling gas prices, an announcer claims that Hillary's gas tax holiday would "save families $8 billion." He then adds derisively: "Barack Obama says that's just pennies."

According to the Bureau of Economic Statistics, total annual revenues from the federal gasoline tax came to $26 billion in 2006. Since consumption is usually higher in the summer months, it is possible that revenues for the period between Memorial Day and Labor Day might amount to $8 billion. Suspending the gasoline tax does not mean that this money will end up back in the pockets of consumers, however.

As I explained last week, most economists believe that only a portion of the 18.4 cents a gallon federal gasoline tax would revert to consumers in the event of a tax holiday. Prices are set by a combination of supply and demand. A gas tax holiday would boost demand, which would lead automatically to higher prices, eliminating much of the benefit to consumers of the tax moratorium. According to a study by Jeffrey Perloff of UC-Berkeley, the net benefit to consumers would be between 9 and 12 cents per gallon. Some other economists say the benefit would be even less.

The average American family of four consumes 2000 gallons of gasoline a year, or 5.4 gallons a day. According to the Perloff study, Clinton's proposal would save such a family between 48 and 64 cents a day. This figure is comparable with the estimate of 30 cents per day per driver that Obama used on the Tim Russert's "Meet the Press" show on NBC on Sunday.

The Clinton TV ad is contrasting a grossly inflated estimate for the savings to all American families ($8 billion) to Obama's claim that each driver will only save 30 cents per day on average. That's not even an apples-to-oranges comparison. The Clinton camp is comparing an entire apple orchard with an individual apple, which is a flawed and rather dishonest way of conducting an argument.

Now take a look at this Obama ad that has been running in Indiana, slamming Hillary's "bogus tax cut" plan.

The Obama ad quotes from a Paul Krugman column in the New York Times on April 28 to support the claim that Clinton's tax holiday will merely "boost the profits" of the oil company. The trouble is, Krugman was not attacking the Clinton plan in his column, he was critiquing a proposal by Republican candidate John McCain. While the two plans have a lot in common, they are different in one respect: Clinton has also called for a tax on the windfall profits of oil companies.

Krugman has criticized the Clinton plan on his blog. But the Princeton economist did not address the Clinton gas tax proposal in his newspaper column. The Obama camp is wrong to imply that he did.

The Obama campaign is using a different version of the ad in North Carolina, replacing the quote from Krugman with a quote from Governor Mike Easley, a Hillary supporter. Take a look.

The Pinocchio Test

Neither Democratic candidate comes out of this dispute particularly well. The Obama campaign has misquoted the New York Times. The Clinton campaign is inflating the benefits of the New York senator's proposed gas tax holiday, and using a ridiculous comparison to attack Obama.
