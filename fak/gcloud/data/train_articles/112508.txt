electric cable mishap: Monkey injured in electric cable mishap back on its feet
THANE: Six-year-old monkey Fighter , who was on his death bed after being electrocuted in January, was given a new lease of life by Chembur-based veterinarian Dr Deepa Katyal and Society for Protection of Cruetly to Animals (SPCA), Thane, and will be returned to the wild soon.On January 10, the Wildlife NGO RAWW received a call from Mulund Colony, informing about a monkey which had been electrocuted by a high voltage tower in the area and is severely injured "Our team immediately rushed to the spot and saw that the monkey was thrown a little away from the tower. He was severely injured with a large part of its body and face burned and bleeding, and maggots eating into its wounds. While we took him to the Thane SPCA first for basic treatment, we shifted him to Dr Katyal's Clinic on the very next day," said Pawan Sharma, founder of RAWW.Dr Katyal, who is also a part of the board of directors for International Veterinary Academy for Pain Management (IVAPM), not only helped manage Fighter's pain through medication but also cleaned and dressed his wounds till he was back to his feisty active self."When he was brought to me he was in a terrible condition and literally on his death bed. His chest, face and hands were severely burnt. But the worst part was the maggot infection around his wounds as these worms were chewing into his flesh to an extent that a part of his rib cage was visible," Dr Katyal said."It took me an hour-and-a-half to clean the wound and then an hour a day to sedate him, apply medicines and treat him. Once the pain reduced, he began eating well which was the first sign of recovery. Considering the amount of pain he went through and his will to stay alive, we decided to name him Fighter," she added.However, as the monkey got stronger, he became more aggressive and had to be taken back to the Thane SPCA where further recovered quickly.
