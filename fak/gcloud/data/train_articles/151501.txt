Senate Tax Plan Includes Exemption for Private Jet Management
It may look like a giveaway to rich people who own their own private jets. But the aviation industry and legislators, including a liberal Democratic senator who helped inspire the provision, said it only reinforces the status quo.

And the provision, part of the Senate Republicansâ€™ tax plan under consideration this week, is expected by one tally to cost federal coffers $500,000 over 10 years, an infinitesimally small amount in congressional bookkeeping.

The measure exempts private plane management fees from taxation, and relates to a 7.5 percent excise tax paid by commercial airlines on each seat they sell.

Until several years ago, owners of private aircraft using planes for personal or business travel were free from this so-called ticket tax. They did, however, pay management companies to store and fuel their jets, hire crew, train pilots, schedule flights and comply with safety standards.
