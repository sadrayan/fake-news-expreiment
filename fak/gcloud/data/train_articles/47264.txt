With Death Toll at 30, Storm Makes 2nd Landfall
Emergency workers rescued many more soaked and frightened people in southeast Texas on Tuesday as floodwaters continued to rise and officials counseled patience, warning that conditions would not improve soon.

The slow-moving, record-shattering tropical storm Harvey battered the region for a sixth straight day and began to move into southwest Louisiana, where it made its second landfall early Wednesday morning. With hundreds of thousands of people under evacuation orders, shelters in Houston filled to bursting with people who craved some news about the safety of their loved ones and the state of their homes.

For now, the city’s focus “will continue to be on rescue,” and not on damage assessment — much less recovery — Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, said at a news conference.

Here is the latest:

• The storm made its second landfall just west of Cameron, La., the National Hurricane Center said at 4 a.m. Wednesday. Harvey was expected to move northeast, gradually weakening and becoming a tropical depression by Wednesday night.

• Local officials in Texas have reported at least 30 confirmed and suspected flood-related deaths.

• Mr. Turner imposed a curfew in Houston from midnight to 5 a.m. until further notice.

• Parts of the Houston area set a record for rainfall from a single storm anywhere in the continental United States, with a top reading on Tuesday afternoon, since the storm began, of 51.88 inches. Jeffrey Lindner, a meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, said 25 to 30 percent of Harris County’s 1,800 square miles of land was flooded.

• The Houston Police Department has rescued more than 3,500 people from flooding, Chief Art Acevedo said. The city fire chief, Samuel Peña, said his department had performed more than 400 rescues. The Harris County Sheriff’s Office did not have an updated figure, but said it was considerably higher than the roughly 2,200 rescues it reported on Monday.

• President Trump visited Texas, arriving in Corpus Christi before traveling to Austin.
