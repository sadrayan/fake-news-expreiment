Rep. Bera Statement on Court Hearing

ELK GROVE, CA - In response to today's sentencing hearing for Babulal Bera, Rep. Ami Bera issued the following statement:

"This is one of the most difficult moments my family has ever experienced. My dad is 83 years old and my mom is 82, and Janine and I are worried about both of my parents. Of course I’m absolutely devastated and heartbroken for how today’s decision will impact our entire family. But my father’s accepted what he did was wrong, he’s taken responsibility, and I love him more than words can express.”

Prior to today's hearing, acting U.S. Atty. Phillip A. Talbert stated that neither Rep. Bera nor his campaign know about Babulal Bera's activities:

"Congressman Bera and his campaign staff have been fully cooperative in this investigation. To date, there is no indication from what we’ve learned in the investigation that either the congressman or his campaign staff knew of, or participated in, the reimbursements of contributions."
