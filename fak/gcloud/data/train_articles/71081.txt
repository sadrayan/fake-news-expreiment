Trump blasts De Niro: 'He's not the brightest bulb on the planet'
It's Monday morning, so you know what that means: It's time for Donald Trump to say outrageous things on "Fox & Friends"!

Once again, he did not disappoint. In between calling President Barack Obama "this guy," Trump managed to take on OPEC ("There's never a word of criticism"), drilling for oil ("I think we should just drill"), his voting record in which he missed voting in primaries for 21 years ("Generally speaking, I like to vote"), and his environmental record ("I've received many, many environmental awards.").

But he saved his harshest comments for Robert De Niro, who recently criticized Trump's (fake?) presidential bid.

“Well, he’s not the brightest bulb on the planet," Trump said of the actor. "... When I watch him doing interviews and various other things, we’re not dealing with Albert Einstein."

Honestly, I think Trump's novelty as a candidate is wearing a little thin, but he's leading the other GOP candidates in most of the polls. As long as he can keep saying entertaining stuff, I suspect he will remain popular.
