If DeWine Can't Find DeVos to Collect $5.3M Owed Ohioans, He Should Try Looking in D.C.
After Delay, Senate to Consider DeVos’s Nomination as Education Secretary Today

COLUMBUS — Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine has failed for six years to collect $5.3 million in fines and fees owed to Ohio taxpayers by billionaire Betsy DeVos’s political action committee — but he can surely track her down at her Senate committee hearing today.

“If Mike DeWine is unsure where to find Betsy DeVos, we have a hot tip — today she’ll be in Washington, the same place he was last week, when he took time off work to support his old buddy, Jeff Sessions,” said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. “Why has DeWine refused to collect on billionaire Betsy’s debt? The Ohio Elections Commission turned over collection of the fine to DeWine’s office six years ago, but he hasn’t managed to track down one thin dime. Maybe if DeWine spent less time doing political favors for his friends, he might find more time to do his job.”

DeVos’s hearing was postponed from last week because she had not completed an ethics review. On Friday the Washington Post revealed that DeVos failed to disclose $125,000 in campaign contributions from 2012.

In 2008, the Ohio Elections Commission found that DeVos used her All Children Matter political action committee illegally to launder campaign contributions from Ohio charter school magnate David Brennan to Ohio Republicans including Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, Secretary of State Jon Husted and former Senate President Keith Faber.

Those aren’t the only Ohio Republicans to benefit from DeVos’s largesse. DeVos has personally given $7,700 to Gov. John Kasich’s political efforts — $5,000 to his gubernatorial campaign in 2010 and $2,700 to his presidential race in 2015. DeVos attended the 2016 Republican National Convention as an at-large delegate for Kasich.
