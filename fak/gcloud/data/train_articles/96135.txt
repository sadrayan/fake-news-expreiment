Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund
An assessment is imposed on firms that sell telecommunications services to end users.

The Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund was repealed by the 80th legislature. The effective date of the repeal is September 1, 2008. Accordingly, revenue from sales of telecommunications services occurring after August 31, 2008, will not be subject to the TIF assessment.
