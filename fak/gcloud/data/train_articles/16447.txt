The Nazis were NOT "democratic socialists", whatever that means. The Nazis were never democrats and never real socialists either. There was a long-standing and distinguished Social Democratic Party in Germany from the 1870 to the 1920s -- the Nazis fought against it, and after 1933 imprisoned its leaders. The Nazis opposed all traditional socialism, wanting to substitute something they called "German socialism" or "Aryan socialism". This meant citizenship and privileges only for "Aryans" (meaning non-Jews), concentration camps for others.
