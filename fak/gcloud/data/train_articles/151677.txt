Super Bowl 2015 Live Coverage
It was a wild day, with no one knowing who would win the Super Bowl until the final moments. There were lead changes, dramatic plays, and a touch of controversy about a big hit just to keep things interesting. A week spent in Arizona ends as the University of Phoenix Stadium has closed its roof and the throngs of Seahawks fans have gone home disappointed.

The Patriots, with a fourth Super Bowl win, have taken another step up the dynasty ladder, and Tom Brady has forced his way back into the conversation for best quarterback to play the game.

With sustained success in the N.F.L. proving difficult for many teams, Seattle will now face an offseason answering questions about a strange play call that sealed their fate. And a defense that is bordering on legendary will have to try for a second Super Bowl win next year.

And with that, we wish you a good night.
