Fundraiser for James Holt by Brittany Zins : In Loving Memory Of Alec Raeshawn
on behalf of James Holt Memorials MINNEAPOLIS, MN Brittany Zins

Dear Family,Friends, Strangers and Everyone reading,



Recently one of my best friends and her family have suffered a horrible loss, privacy has been asked and I'm respecting that. We all have been in horrible situations and suffered extreme losses. I'm asking for help from anyone and everyone who can relate to the death of a family member, friend, or someone close to them. Donations are going to be used to help give Alec a proper burial and help the family be able to grieve and recover from this unexpected loss and not have to worry about being in debt. Please if you have anything to donate doesn't matter the amount every little bit helps and every donation is appreciated. We have all been down. But we are never out, and together we can help shed some light in this dark situation.
