UPDATE: Attorney general wants positions for officer-involved de - WREX.com – Rockford’s News Leader
MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel wants the Legislature's budget committee to give the state Justice Department more positions in the state budget to deal with officer-involved death investigations.

Lawmakers signed a bill last year that requires outside agencies to lead investigations of officer-involved deaths. Schimel told the Joint Finance Committee on Monday that more agencies are turning to the DOJ to handle such investigations even when they involve use of force.

The agency asked Gov. Scott Walker to include funding for five new positions -- three agents and two records specialists -- to help with the workload. Walker didn't include the request in his budget proposal.

Schimel told the committee that officer-involved death investigations are time-consuming and asked the panel to reinstate the positions request.

********MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The Legislature's finance committee is about to kick off a months-long push to revise Gov. Scott Walker's 2015-17 state budget proposal.

The committee is set to begin Monday with briefings from a number of state agencies on how the budget would affect them. First up are the Administration, Justice and Corrections departments.

Additional agencies are expected to address the committee through Wednesday.

The committee likely will then hold a number of public hearings on the budget around the state before returning to Madison and beginning revisions. That work is expected to take months.

When the committee is done it will forward the spending plan to the full Senate and Assembly for votes. From there it goes back to Walker, who has the power to veto changes.
