Why did the text ultimately say the ad was rated a lie?

Text excerpt: "He has spent over $1 million on airing a TV ad he knows is a lie. PolitiFact Texas gave the television ad a 'Pants-on-Fire' rating as an outrageous lie."

3:29 p.m.

You have reviewed Dewhurst's hypocritical hit piece and judged one attack as a pants-on-fire lie and the other attack as only half true. On the whole, it is completely accurate to say that the ad is a lie because it intentionally distorts the truth.
