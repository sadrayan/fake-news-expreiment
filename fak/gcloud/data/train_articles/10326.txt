New Hampshire Democratic Party
New Hampshire Democratic Chairman Ray Buckley released the following statement today on Huntsman's visit to the Granite State.



"Jon Huntsman on the campaign trail in New Hampshire continues to run away from his record as the health care mandate-supporting, cap and trade-pushing governor of Utah. To beef up his right wing credentials he has even signed on to the GOP's extreme proposal to end Medicare as we know it, which would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 Granite Staters. As Huntsman continues to run to the far right he will leave the centrist majority of Granite State voters in the dust."
