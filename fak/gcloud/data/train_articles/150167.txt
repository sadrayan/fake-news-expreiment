Ascaris suum in Pigs
Adults of the large roundworm, Ascaris suum, are found in the small intestine and transitorily in the large intestine during expulsion of the worms. Males are up to 25 cm and females up to 40 cm long, whitish, and quite thick. Large numbers of eggs are produced (as many as 200,000 to 1 million/day/female) although shed intermittently; they can develop to the infective stage (eggs containing L 3 larva) in 3–4 wk under optimal conditions. In temperate regions, the eggs stay dormant in winter (<15°C) and resume development when temperature rises in the spring. The eggs are highly resistant to chemical agents, but conditions with low humidity, heat, or direct sunlight reduce their survival significantly. Under optimal conditions, eggs may survive for 5–11 yr. When the eggs are ingested, the larvae hatch in the intestine, penetrate the wall, and enter the portal circulation. After a short period in the liver, they are carried by the circulation to the lungs, where they pass through the capillaries into the alveolar spaces. Approximately 9–10 days after ingestion, the larvae pass up the bronchial tree, are swallowed, and return to the small intestine by ~10–15 days after infection, where they mature into adult worms. The first eggs are passed ~6–7 wk after infection. Lifespan is ~6–9 mo. Earthworms and dung beetles can serve as paratenic hosts.
