About us
PRAAG (the Pro-Afrikaans Action Group) was founded in February 2000 to fight for the rights of all Afrikaners and other people of European descent in South Africa who find themselves at the receiving end of what has been variously termed “reverse discrimination”, “ethnic cleansing” and even “white genocide”.

We cooperate and exchange ideas with other pro-European groups and invididuals all over the world and appreciate all support, moral, financial and otherwise that we may receive in our difficult struggle for survival in South Africa which is a democracy in name only, and where we are actively excluded from all decision-making processes while our taxes and assets are being looted by a corrupt, rapacious, anti-white government.

At the same time, we publish news and opinions of interest to everyone in the world-wide pro-European movement.
