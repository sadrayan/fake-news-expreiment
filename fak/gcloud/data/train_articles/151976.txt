CONROE, Texas — Employees at the College Park Chick-fil-A wore "Back the Blue" shirts to show support to law enforcement, Independent Journal reported.

"We’re supporting those everyday heroes that protect us," location manager Eli Advincula told the publication. "There are [police officer] regulars that eat here all the time, and we just want them to know that.”

The blue also symbolizes the local high school football team.

Photos posted on Facebook Oct. 21 show patrons and staff participating to voice support.

The support comes amidst several officers being denied service at Arby's, Hardee's and controversial service at Dunkin' Donuts.
