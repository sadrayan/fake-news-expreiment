Flag-waving demonstrators from the National Front and the right-wing South East Alliance marched through the seaside town to protest against the arrival of immigrants. They clashed with anti-racism activists including the Kent Anti-Racism Network, who organised a counter-demonstration.

Kent Police described the protest as a "fast-moving and ongoing incident" but were unable to say whether there had been any arrests. Several roads were closed in the area and police said 'stop and search' tactics were used 'to ensure a peaceful protest'.
