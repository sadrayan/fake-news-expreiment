The partial shutdown of the federal government creates the possibility that a walk in the country could start on a perfectly legal trail in a state park and end with a citation on adjacent federal land.

Even among federal agencies that control land - including the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service - there are different access rules under the partial shutdown.

The crazy quilt of land jurisdiction and regulations has caused widespread confusion about what is a national park and therefore closed. Alcatraz Island, for example, is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and is off-limits. Nearby Angel Island is a state park and unaffected by the partial shutdown.

Many people think it's fine to hike the trails at Point Reyes National Seashore. It's not - Point Reyes is an outpost of the National Park Service, and people can't even drive on Limantour Road, let alone take a hike.

"We are picking up messages on social media where people are saying it's OK to go on the trails," said John Dell'Osso, chief of interpretation at Point Reyes. "As much as I hate to tell you, Point Reyes and Golden Gate's trails are closed."

Here are examples of what is closed, what is not, and how easy it is to get confused:

-- Point Reyes: Gates are locked on roads, all trails are closed, and there's no parking or camping allowed. Even the short, paved walk to the Point Reyes Lighthouse is closed.

-- Islands: Angel Island is open, ferries are running, and concessions such as bike rentals and food services are up and running. Camping is allowed.

-- Redwoods: Muir Woods National Monument is closed. Big Basin Redwoods, Butano and Samuel P. Taylor state parks are open.

-- Beaches: Stinson Beach and Muir Beach in Marin County are closed. Nearby beaches operated by Marin County Parks, such as Upton Beach and Agate Beach, are open.

-- Trail confusion, Part 1: Some trails cross lands managed by different agencies. Hikers have to be wary of boundaries. In Marin, for instance, you could hike out of Samuel P. Taylor State Park west and hit the Cross Marin Trail en route to Bolinas Ridge - which is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and therefore closed. Trespassers can be cited.

-- Trail confusion, Part 2: You can hike in national forests - the Pacific Crest Trail or John Muir Trail, for instance - but cannot walk on stretches that are managed by the National Park Service, such as Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. It's the same trail, but walking on Park Service land can earn you a citation.

-- National forests: Dedicated parking areas, campgrounds, developed recreation facilities and ranger stations are closed. But trails and hike-in campgrounds are open.

-- National parks: Closed parkland includes the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Lassen Volcanic National Park, Lava Beds National Monument, Pinnacles National Park, Redwood National Park, Smith River National Recreation Area, Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, and Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia.

-- Wildlife preserves: Those managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are closed. State wildlife areas managed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife are open.

-- Bureau of Land Management: All developed sites are closed.
