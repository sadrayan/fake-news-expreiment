Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - HealthCare.gov Glossary
The first part of the comprehensive health care reform law enacted on March 23, 2010.

The law was amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act on March 30, 2010. The name “Affordable Care Act” is usually used to refer to the final, amended version of the law. (It’s sometimes known as “PPACA,” “ACA,” or “Obamacare.”)

The law provides numerous rights and protections that make health coverage more fair and easy to understand, along with subsidies (through “premium tax credits” and “cost-sharing reductions”) to make it more affordable.

The law also expands the Medicaid program to cover more people with low incomes.
