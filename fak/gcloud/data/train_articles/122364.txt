Blood Rave organizers to spray synthetic blood: real blood claim “a joke”

The organizers of the Blood Rave scheduled for Amsterdam on Halloween have released a statement to make one thing very clear: rave attendees will be sprayed with synthetic blood, not real blood.

News of the Blood Rave, inspired by 1998 vampire movie Blade, hit Dutch newspapers on August 20th and quickly spread all over the world. According to the organizers, they have seen so many reports on Gothic and vampire blogs of people buying tickets and plane tickets to attend the event because of the misconception that real blood will be used, that they felt it necessary to release this statement.

“Halloween is traditionally a day on which people frighten each other in a fun way, and that was also the intention of the organization. The use of real blood is dangerous for the health as well as unethical, we would never do anything that puts health at risk. Although most ticket holders understood the joke, we found it necessary to release a statement.” the organizers write on the Blood Rave Facebook page. “The organization will with ‘synthetic blood’ in its sprinkler system ensure the ultimate Halloween-experience.”

More than 5 thousand people have indicated on Facebook that they will be attending the Rave, resulting in the party having to be moved to a larger location. There are still a few tickets left for the party on October 31st. Tickets can be bought here.
