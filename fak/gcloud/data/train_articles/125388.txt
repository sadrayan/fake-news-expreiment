FALSE: Bernie Sanders Calls for Chemtrail Reform
On 15 February 2016, the web site Nevada County Scooper published an article claiming that presidential candidate Bernie Sanders called for “chemtrail reform”:

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made a surprise campaign stop in Nevada County on Monday afternoon. Sanders visited the area to announce his plan for a more environmentally friendly chemtrails program.

“I needed to be here in Nevada County,” Sanders began his speech which was held in the parking lot behind the Sierra Super Stop, “where so many have voiced concerns about chemtrails.”

“Our government continues to spray artificial chemicals on its own citizens to poison the population and geoengineer the climate,” Sanders said, “we know there are organic, sustainable alternatives that will accomplish the same objectives without damaging the Earth.”

“For example, deadly Cobra venom,” Sanders continued, “which the government can purchase directly from snake charmer collectives in India using fair trade guidelines.”

“The soil ruining nano-aluminum coated fiberglass particles have got to go,” Sanders said. “We need a more biodegradable chemtrail future.”
