Comaneci`s Actions After Escape Concern Gymnast Thomas

Thomas, 33, the former gymnastics world champion from Indiana State University, recently announced he was attempting a comeback after nearly a decade out of amateur competition-about the time he was touring with Comaneci, star of the 1976 Olympics.

It is both ironic and coincidental Kurt Thomas and Nadia Comaneci have been back in the news lately, even if the reasons are rather different.

That U.S. tour in 1981 was the first time she seriously considered defecting. He recalled their having talked frequently during the tour of her desire to leave.

Thomas knew how upset the former Romanian gymnast was over being controlled totally by her government. She reportedly tried to kill herself by taking liquid detergent and also tried to eat herself out of the sport.

Now that Comaneci has defected, though, Thomas wonders if she hasn`t traded one kind of control for another.

``This guy she is with is causing her a lot of problems,`` Thomas said.

``If nothing else, it seems like he was brainwashing her: `You do anything I say if I get you to America,` that sort of thing.``

This guy is Constantin Panait, the Romanian exile who helped Comaneci out of her homeland 12 days ago and now is arranging her new life in South Florida, where the two plan to live together.

The problem is Panait, 36, is married with four children, aged 6, 5, 4 and 2. Comaneci`s unconcern for that situation, as expressed in a press conference, has turned her image ``from hero to bitch,`` as her former Romanian choreographer, Geza Pozsar, put it.

Comaneci`s reaction to questions about her relationship with Panait was as odd as her apparent estrangement from former coach Bela Karolyi. The gymnast has said she has ``nothing further to do`` with the sport and the man who helped her become the first Olympic gymnast to earn a perfect score.

Thomas thinks some of the problems between Comaneci and Karolyi date to the coach`s defection in 1981. He went on to settle in Houston, open a gym, coach Mary Lou Retton to Olympic stardom and become a U.S. citizen.

``Nadia wanted to defect with him, but Bela discouraged her by saying he wasn`t ready, either,`` Thomas said. ``Then Bela didn`t show up at the airport for the plane (to Romania), and the rest is history.

``I can understand Bela`s point. He didn`t want to be responsible for taking an 18-year-old national hero with him.

``I`m sure that has a little to do with her not wanting to see Bela, but I think it has more to do with this guy she is with. I know Bela and I could help her if she would call.``

Karolyi said he was not hurt by Comaneci`s rebuff and ``there will be time enough later for a reunion. If she does not need my support now, that means she is in good shape.``
