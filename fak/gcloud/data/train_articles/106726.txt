JonBenet Ramsey Autopsy Details Clothes, Weapon
BOULDER, Colo. â€” JonBenet Ramsey's body was sprawled on the living room floor, covered with a blanket when the coroner arrived. Around her neck was a cord attached to a stick that was believed to have been used as a garrote.

Wednesday's court-ordered release of the complete autopsy report on the 6-year-old beauty queen provided grisly new details but didn't give the time of death, which could help investigators pinpoint who was around her.

JonBenet's body was discovered in the basement of her family's house Dec. 26 by her father, John Ramsey, about eight hours after his wife, Patricia, said she found a ransom note demanding $118,000. Police have said Ramsey was unaccompanied by officers during a search when he found the body and carried it upstairs. The Ramseys are a focus of the investigation, but no one has been charged.

The report included details about the cord that had been wrapped around her neck and one wrist. It also described the clothing she was wearing, including a white knit shirt with a sequin-decorated star on its chest and underwear stained with urine and a red color.
