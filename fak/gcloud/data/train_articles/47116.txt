Fact Check: Spicer’s Pre-emptive Attack on the Nonpartisan C.B.O.
WASHINGTON — President Trump’s spokesman on Wednesday deflected concerns that a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act had yet to be scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office by questioning the agency’s track record.

“If you’re looking at the C.B.O. for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said. “I mean, they were way, way off the last time in every aspect of how they scored and projected Obamacare.”

“If you look at the number of people that they projected that would be on Obamacare, they are off by millions,” he added. “But, the idea that that is any kind of authority based on the track record that occurred last time is a little far-fetched.”

Mr. Spicer has a point that the C.B.O.’s projections for how many people would gain insurance under the health law were “off by millions.” But imprecision in Affordable Care Act projections does not give an accurate impression of the C.B.O.’s overall track record.
