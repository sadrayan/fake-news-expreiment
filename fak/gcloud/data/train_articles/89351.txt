Supporter Organizations
Project ChildSafe is coordinating with organizational supporters, such as retailers, gun clubs and shooting ranges, to help spread the message about safe and responsible gun ownership.

Do you represent an organization that is interested in becoming a Project ChildSafe supporter? If so, fill out our Supporter Organization Form. Supporter organizations will receive a “welcome packet” with campaign materials and information to help us spread the Project ChildSafe message. Note that the welcome packets don’t come with firearm safety kits containing gun locks, as those are available for law enforcement agencies only.

Project ChildSafe also partners with local law enforcement agencies to distribute firearm safety kits. If you are a law enforcement representative looking to safety kits, please visit our Law Enforcement Request Form.

If you are interested in finding a law enforcement agency that is a partner with Project ChildSafe to provide free safety kits in your area, please visit our Safety Kit page.

If you are a firearms industry member interested in accessing marketing materials and templates to support the Own It? Respect It. Secure it. Initiative please visit: www.nssf.org/safety/ors.
