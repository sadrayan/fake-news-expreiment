Billions from military projects could fund Trump's border wall
After weeks of delay, the Defense Department on Monday provided Congress with a list of military construction projects that could see their funding diverted — about $12.9 billion in total — to pay for a border wall under Trump's declared national emergency.

Why it matters: The 400 construction projects affected are spread across 40 states and nearly 30 countries with a U.S. presence around the world, and they're often vitally important for local economies. That — along with the power of local news sources in their communities — could force lawmakers to rethink their position on how to move forward with overriding Trump's national security veto.
