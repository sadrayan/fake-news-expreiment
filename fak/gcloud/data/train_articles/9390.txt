Another non-answer from Gov. Rick Scott about GOP health care plan
via @adamsmithtimes

The question from the Miami Herald's Amy Sherman this afternoon was concise and clear: "Should the House approve the Affordable Health Care Act as it is written?

The answer from Gov. Rick Scott was not: "Here's the way I look at it. It's...I'm...I'm encouraged the conversations that are going on. I know there's things we have to continue to improve.

"I know I grew up in a family that struggled to pay for health care. I remember my mom crying when she couldn't pay for health care for my brother. I worked in the hospital industry. I ran the biggest company in that industry.

"We've got to figure out how to get this, how to make healthcare more affordable. That's what I focused on when I was in business. So I'm going to continue to work to make sure that happens.

"I think Trump inherited an absolute mess. Barack Obama left in the nick of time. Prices were going up. My biggest concern is we've got to keep focusing on how to get costs down, because if we can't get costs down, you as an individual can't pay for it, or your employer can't pay for health care, or the government can't.

"So I'm encouraged but I know there's more work that needs to be done."

Scott spoke with reporters briefly after he attended an event in Pompano Beach with Ben Carson, Secretary of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
