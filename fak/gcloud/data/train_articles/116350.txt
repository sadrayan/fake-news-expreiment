10 Richest US Presidential Candidates
Current estimated net worth: $250 million



Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts from 2002 to 2006 and became a candidate for the presidency in 2007. He ran a tough campaign but other than winning the Wyoming caucus and the Michigan and Nevada primaries, he was unable to gain frontrunner status, particularly after Sen. John McCain’s victories on Super Tuesday in 2008.



Romney dropped out and endorsed McCain, but his return in the next presidential election cycle was already a foregone conclusion. In 2011, he entered the race as the presumed GOP frontrunner.



Romney’s estimated net worth is $250 million, making him one of the 3,140 richest people in the U.S., according to Wealth-X. Much of this wealth comes from investments in banks, credit corporations and real estate, according to financial information released by his 2008 campaign.
