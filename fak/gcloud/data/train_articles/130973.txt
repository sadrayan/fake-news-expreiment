Media on Trial
Frome Stop War will be hosting its third 'Media on Trial' event this May. Our venue on this occasion will be the City of Leeds at the historic Leeds City Museum.

We will be hosting our expert panel Former UK Ambassador to Syria, Peter Ford , independent investigative journalist Vanessa Beeley , Professor of Politics Society and Political Journalism at Sheffield University, Piers Robinson , Tim Hayward , Professor of Environmental Political Theory at Edinburgh University, Media Analyst and Blogger, Robert Stuart , and Independent Journalist, Broadcaster and Radio Show host Patrick Henningsen .

We will also have a special guest speaker to be announced shortly.

The panel of experts will this time focus on the media's propensity to either embed its journalists directly with terrorist forces, most notably Channel 4's Krishnan Guru-Murthy embedded with Nour Al Zinki in Syria, or disseminate material directly from terrorist sources. In Syria, the White Helmets have been overwhelmingly the source from which establishment and corporate media have taken their information. Previous reporting from Libya in 2011 followed a similar pattern when the BBC's Ian Pannell was embedded with Islamic extremist, anti-government forces, while the overwhelming media narrative complied with information from those same sources.

The question therefore arises, by aligning itself to terrorist organisations, by gaining entry into sovereign nations by way of these forces and by reporting their line while misleading the general public that they are merely 'Activists' or 'Opposition forces', has the mainstream print and broadcast media acted in contravention of the UK Terrorism Act?

This is a question our experts will analyse and hope to provide some clarification for audience members and those who, given the dubious regime change reporting of the 21st Century so far, would like to see the 'Media on Trial' .
