I've attached 2 short-term outcomes papers, and a previous paper from the Neonatal Research Network about predicting outcomes. This one resulted in an "outcomes predictor" - link at http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/ppb/programs/epbo/Pages/epbo_case.aspx?start=21:55:37.

It's very difficult to get a good handle on long term outcomes for large populations of extremely preterm infants - there aren't that many at 22 - 23 weeks, they have a high mortality rate, and follow up studies are limited. There is a wide variability in reported outcomes by center and by country, also.

One statement in the discussion section of the Stoll paper: "During the 5-year study period, there was no substantial improvement in rates of survival to discharge for extremely low gestation infants born at NRN centers"
