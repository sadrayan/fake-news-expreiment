Introduction

Shropshire is a large county, at some 50 miles north to south and 20 miles east to west. It is situated in the English Midlands and borders Wales. The county is geologically rich, apparently featuring rocks from virtually all the geological periods.

There are a few outcrops of Carboniferous Limestone in Shropshire such as Titterstone Clee Hill and at Little Wenlock. It is a sedimentary rock made of calcium carbonate. It is generally light-grey in colour, and is hard. It was formed in warm, shallow tropical seas teeming with life.

The county is not generally known as a caving area as such, but due to its diverse geology is well known to mine explorers. There are a number of hand cut caves, mainly in sandstone, in and around Bridgnorth. Some of these caves may have been created as far back as Neolithic times using rudimentary tools.

Limestone also outcrops In the north west of the county, along the Welsh border near Oswestry. Sites in this outcrop are included in the North East Wales section of this wiki. The sites are:
