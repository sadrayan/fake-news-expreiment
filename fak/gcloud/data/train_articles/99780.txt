PHOTOS: Kenyan Politician Disgracefully Commissions Mud House He Built For A Widow

African politicians make it seem like the construction of roads, the building of hospitals and providing basic things needed by the ordinary African to survive are some sort of achievements looking at how they boast about such things when they appear on national television or radio.

This is the worst thing an African politician has done in 2019 ─why do you have to commission a mud house built for a widow? ─I mean is that an achievement?
