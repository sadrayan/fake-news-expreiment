BREAKING! Brawl Over Kneeling Players in Locker Room Delays Buffalo Bills Game!
A massive bare-knuckle fight broke out just minutes ago in the locker room of the Buffalo Bills, halting their game against the Washington Redskins at the 35-minute mark. Coach Sean McDermott was seen scrambling inside to control the chaos, and relayed details of the conflagaration via cell phone to his Assistant Coach, Leonard Snart. As of this time, several injuries have been reported, and multiple ambulances are incoming to New Era Field, while fans await any news.

Correspondent Sean Guluv received a statement from the Assistant Coach just moments ago :

“What happened is that many of the black players, led by Sammy Watkins, were planning to kneel earlier during the national anthem as a protest. They did not, however, because Quarterback Josh Allen threatened to beat them into paste if they did, and some of the other white players got behind him on that plan. Well, during the game one word led to another word, which led to another, and Watkins and Allen decided to settle it in the locker room. The rest of the guys followed, and now it’s world war goddamn three in there.”

Watkins and Allen, currently at war.

Police and medical vehicles are arriving en masse as you read this, and at least six unidentified players have been evacuated via stretcher. More details as they come in.
