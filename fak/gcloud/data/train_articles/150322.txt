A rare sexually transmitted disease, which causes flesh eating ulcers to develop on a patient's genitalia, is reportedly making the rounds.

The Lancashire Post is reporting a female patient between the ages of 15 and 25 was allegedly diagnosed with donovanosis in Southport, England.

The disease is spread through sexual intercourse with an infected patient or by coming into contact with a patient's infected ulcer. It's typically seen in India, New Guinea, parts of the Caribbean, Central Asia and Southern Africa.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the painless disease causes progressive ulcerative lesions on the genitals or perineum, which are prone to heavy bleeding.

Patients are at risk of extragenital infections that can occur in the pelvic regions, or in intra-abdominal organs, bones or mouth. The lesions may also develop secondary bacterial infections.

While antibiotic treatment may stop the progression of lesions, patients are at risk of relapse for 6-18 months post-treatment.

According to the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), there have been no prior cases reported in the U.K.
