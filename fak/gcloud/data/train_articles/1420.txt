Woman in Clinton affair gets $90,000 The former official at West Chester Friends filed suit, charging bias over her firing in 2003.
Attorneys for the school offered the settlement judgment on Oct. 27. Negotiations had been conducted since August.

Miller, also known by her former married name of Sally Perdue, said in a deposition that her 1983 affair with Clinton was "one of the main reasons" she was harassed, "but I do not hold to that being exclusively the reason . . . I was told over and over that I was unQuakerly. I was referred to as the older woman. My age came up many times."

A spokesman for Clinton's office has declined to comment on Miller's statements. Miller, the 1958 Miss Arkansas, made her allegations in 1992.

Miller's attorney, Timothy M. Kolman, said the school's offer of judgment constituted an "admission of liability" by the school. It did not include additional money to pay legal bills.

"We are satisfied that it is a judgment, that the $90,000 is there for everyone to see," he said. "It represents a clear vindication in public that she was wronged."

Miller worked at the 135-student school for 23 months and was paid between $40,000 and $50,000 a year.

"After several previous attempts by the school to settle this suit, I am pleased it has come to an amicable resolution," Matthew Bradley, head of school, said in a statement. "This has been an unfortunate matter, from any perspective, and we are pleased to now be able to move forward."

Miller now lives in Alexandria, Va., where she is a special-education teacher.
