NSC 5520 "Draft Statement of Policy on U.S. Scientific Satellite Program," recommended the creation of a scientific satellite program as part of the International Geophysical Year as well as the development of satellites for reconnaissance purposes. Based upon this report, the National Security Council approved the IGY satellite on May 26, 1955. However, it was not until July 28 that a public announcement was made during an oral briefing at the White House. The formal statement was dated July 29. This statement emphasized that the satellite program was intended to be the U.S. contribution to the IGY and that the scientific data was to benefit scientists of all nations.
