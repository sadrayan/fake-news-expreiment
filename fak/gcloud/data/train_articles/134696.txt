In the 43-second video, the priest is shown holding the child’s tear-filled face as the boy sits in a woman’s arms. He appeared to attempt to comfort the child and, in the middle of the video, is shown slapping the child across his cheek.

A man and woman, who appear to be the boy’s parents, are shown with shocked expressions as the child immediately began to scream. The priest is shown pulling the child closer as a woman, who appeared to be a church official, briefly approached him.

The baby appeared to struggle in the priest’s arms, attempting to free himself. Soon, the man nearby forcibly removes the child from the priest’s arms.
