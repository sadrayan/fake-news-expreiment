That would be all true, except, In Feb. the NCES said we were second (http://tea.texas.gov/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=25769820368) But then in March the number was readjusted to third - Note that NCES updated its Class of 2013 data (now including percentages to the first decimal point) which has adjusted Texasâ€™ overall national ranking to third. Figures released earlier this year had initially indicated Texas ranked second tied with four other states for the Class of 2013.

But the statement about the African-Americans and Hispanics is definitely true: http://tea.texas.gov/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=25769820614

March: http://tea.texas.gov/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=25769820614
