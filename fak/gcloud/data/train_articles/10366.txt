Ask the Governor With Chris Christie
Gov. Chris Christie again addressed the ongoing Bridgegate scandal during the Feb. 26 edition of Ask the Governor, saying he's too busy running the state to "give in to the hysteria of questions that are given from folks that have information today that I didn’t have earlier.”

The governor also discussed his newly-presented state budget, which is the largest in NJ history. He also answered questions about the need to borrow money to fund the Transportation Trust Fund , the pot of money the state uses for road, bridge, and tunnel projects. Christie, joined in the studio by his daughter Bridget, also discussed extending the length of the school day and said all snow days must be made up this year -- neither of which seemed to go over well with his 10-year-old.
