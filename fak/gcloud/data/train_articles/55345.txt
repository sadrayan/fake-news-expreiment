Rep. Beto O’Rourke's Reckless Call to Impeach Pres. Trump - Ted Cruz for Senate
HOUSTON, TX— Rep. Robert “Beto” O’Rourke (D-Texas) continued today his reckless and radical Senate campaign based on impeaching Pres. Donald Trump. He is the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for impeachment.

The most recent incident was at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. In response to a question by the Dallas Morning News, O’Rourke said: “…if I were asked to vote on this, I would vote to impeach the president.” O’Rourke explained that, “Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed.”

O’Rourke has been consistent throughout his campaign for U.S. Senate that he would vote to impeach Pres. Trump, such as on KFYO radio on April 10, on Showtime’s “The Circus” in May — and as far back as an interview with Reuters in November 2017.

“Rep. Beto O’Rourke is so radical and reckless that he is unfit to serve in the U.S. Senate,” said Sen. Ted Cruz campaign spokesman Emily Miller. “O’Rourke’s extremist views on impeaching the President of the United States put him in the fringe of the liberal movement — even to the left of Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. His calls for impeachment may win him big donors in Hollywood, but it doesn’t reflect the reasonable views of the vast majority of Texans.”
