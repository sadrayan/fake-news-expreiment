Mitch McConnell voted today, and all we got was this perfect photobomb
In a particularly well-executed photobomb, a man at a polling station in Louisville, Kentucky, gave a thumbs down as Senate Minority Leader and Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell cast his ballot in the race to keep his Senate seat.

Even better: The disapproving gesture made it into the frame of the Getty photographer's shot.

McConnell is defending his seat against Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, who would be the first female senator in the state's history. Polls indicate that McConnell has a clear lead in the state; according to FiveThirtyEight's forecast, McConnell has a 98% chance of winning, but at the time of writing, Kentucky voters still have a few hours left before polls close.

Grimes seized the opportunity to poke fun at her opponent by posting the photo to Twitter, accompanied by a message to vote. (She later deleted the tweet.)
