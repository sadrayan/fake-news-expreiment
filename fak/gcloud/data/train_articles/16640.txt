Steve:

Hello again. I write now because we’re fact-checking this recent claim by a candidate: “There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting.”

Is the agency aware of Texas school districts or individual schools that shut down because residents are going hunting?

What are the hunting seasons during school years?

Other research recommendations?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks,

g.

Dove season opens Saturday, Sept. 1

Deer season opens Saturday, Nov. 3

Our Commission supports providing opportunities to get youth involved in Texas rich hunting traditions, and sets aside youth-only weekends for that reason. I checked with staff who would know and they are unaware of schools or districts that close in recognition of hunting season.
