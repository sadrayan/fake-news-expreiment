DC police approve ‘March For Our Lives’ rally permit
WASHINGTON — D.C. police have approved the permit for the March For Our Lives event in downtown D.C. on March 24.

The event calling for an end to gun violence is being organized by survivors of the Parkland High School shooting in Florida.

Rallies are being held around the globe, including in cities such as Tel Aviv, Stockholm, Paris, Buenos Aires, Mumbai and Tokyo.

Hundreds of thousands are expected to descend upon the nation’s capital. The permit covers Pennsylvania Avenue between Third and 18th streets in Northwest.

A police spokeswoman told WTOP detailed information about street closures will be released “soon.” Also, even though the event is being called a “march,” it’s actually a rally.

Indications are that the main stage will be set up at Pennsylvania Avenue and Third Street with the U.S. Capitol as a backdrop.

The Episcopal Diocese of Washington is helping to coordinate housing and meals for out-of-town visitors. Visitors looking for housing or people in D.C. wiling to provide places for people to stay can sign up on this website.
