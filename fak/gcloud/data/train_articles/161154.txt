Libby's Pumpkin comes from the Pumpkin Capital of the World
Founded in 1867, The Libby McNeill & Libby Company (LM&L) specialized in canned meats before branching out into canned condiments, fruits and salmon. In 1929, LM&L purchased Dickinson & Company, a successful canner of vegetable items in Morton, Washington and Eureka, Illinois. Known for having the most modern factory and richest farmland, Morton was chosen for expansion of the Libby’s pumpkin business, leading to the official claim to fame as the “Pumpkin Capital of the World.”

Proudly owned by Nestlé for over 40 years, the LIBBY’S® Pumpkin factory in Morton, Illinois, has remained number one in the nation for pumpkin packaging and is recognized as the world’s largest pumpkin factory. Utilizing rich farmland around Morton, we plant, grow, harvest and process more than 85% of the world’s canned pumpkin. Using our own proprietary seed of Dickinson pumpkins, consumers trust LIBBY’S® Pumpkin for their appealing color and moist, creamy consistency.
