School for Advanced Studies
Why SAS?

Jump Start on College:

Each semester, students are enrolled in a minimum of three (3) college dual-enrollment courses, taught by MDC faculty, and four (4) high school courses, taught by SAS faculty. After two years at SAS, students will earn a minimum of 36 college credits. Many students graduate with both an Associate in Arts degree and a high school diploma as a result of success on the AP exams, CLEP exams, and summer school at MDC.

Academic Advantage:

One hundred percent (100%) of our students graduate and continue their academic studies at colleges and universities in Florida, throughout the nation, or at foreign universities. (Some have been accepted at such prestigious universities as Cornell, NYU, Yale, University of Chicago, Harvard, Emory, Georgetown, Stanford, University of Edinburgh, and all the universities in the state of Florida.)

Personal Attention:

The school population reflects the religious, ethnic, and cultural diversity of the community. The school prides itself on its family-like environment, small school setting, and its focus on the humanities and a traditional education. The small high school environment affords the opportunity for individual student tutoring, counseling, and mentoring by faculty and staff. Students and faculty are supported by parental and community involvement. The environment provides a unique transition between secondary and post-secondary education.

Financial Advantage:

Students admitted to SAS receive free tuition and fees, free textbooks and materials, and, if eligible, school bus and metro-rail transportation funded by MDCPS.
