Congressman Issa's Statement Cancelled American Health Care Act Vote
Congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) released the following statement after the House of Representatives canceled a vote on the American Health Care Act:

"Californians who had their insurance plans canceled, lost access to their doctors, suffered premium increases and sky-high deductible hikes are depending on us to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all,” said Congressman Darrell Issa. “We must deliver relief from this law and return choice back to the people. However, the AHCA was an imperfect approach and I believe that we can do better. We will go back to the drawing board and get this right for each and every American concerned with high costs in their health care and ever-dwindling choices and access to care. As part of that discussion, we should consider plans, like mine, to give all Americans access the same high-quality coverage as federal employees and their families, as well as other good ideas, from both sides of the aisle, to deliver solutions to these problems. I remain committed to advancing the reforms necessary to increase access and affordability to our health care."
