Ritch Workman
Common Core is the federal government’s effort to nationalize our public schools. The Constitution doesn’t give that authority to the federal government and Florida has a responsibility to push back on the efforts by the federal government to do so. Ritch worked with Governor Rick Scott to issue executive orders severing ties and funding from the Federal education takeover.

While common core has been written out of the state budget and out of the state standards, it continues to be used in our classrooms. Ritch is dedicated to ensuring that parents have a voice in their child’s education. Local school boards need to take action to ensure common core is eradicated from the classroom. If school boards are unwilling or unable to rid their classrooms of common core than Ritch favors more state preemption allowing parents to take that control.

Just as Ritch fights against a federal takeover of our states education, Ritch will also protect our classrooms from a Tallahassee takeover. Classroom decisions have always been a school board responsibility and it remains their responsibility to repeal what remains of common core. Those school boards unwilling to keep common core from the classroom should be forced to allow parents to make that decision and move their child to a non-common core teacher. Ritch will continue to fight for students and parents and against common core.
