SFPD Releases 2016 Year End Crime Statistics (17-065)
The San Francisco Police Department today released its 2016 crime data report as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, which is coordinated by the FBI. The 2016 crime data report shows that overall Part 1 crimes in San Francisco decreased 10.27 percent in 2016 when compared to 2015 data. Part 1 crimes as defined by the FBI include homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, larceny-theft and arson.

Contributing agencies submit data to the UCR program in order to measure the level and scope of crime occurring throughout the nation, with each state having its own reporting requirements. In addition to the FBI standard reporting data, the California Attorney General requires additional reports which are due on the 10th of each month.

UCR data is a snapshot of crime reported to a law enforcement agency during the previous month. Due to the late reporting of some crimes, there may be a variance in figures reported as part of the UCR program when compared to ongoing crime statistics.

The 2016 crime statistics accompanies this news release.
