Russian lies part 133: ‚Äúwe do not use BUK missiles produced in 1986‚Äù.
by

The Joint Investigation Team at its press conference at May 24, 2018 show a part of a BUK missile which was found in Eastern Ukraine. The part, called a casing, showed on the outside a number. This number is a code showing the type of missile and when it was produced, which was 1986.

The Russian Ministry of Defense responded by saying ‚Äù Missiles Shown By MH17 Investigators Were Decommissioned After 2011‚Ä≥

However photos prove this is a lie. A lie in a long series of lies.I wrote various blogposts about the many lies told by Kremlin. For example here, here, here , here and here.

The evidence for another lie by Kremlin

Reuters published an interesting photo at August 16, 2014. The photo shows two interesting details.

First, a truck carrying containers for BUK missiles. Each container has a number printed on it.

The second interesting detail is the truck which has a crane on it. Mind the metal piece on the back which is slanted.

Russian military vehicles loaded with shipping containers for missiles of BUK-M1 air defense missile system drive along the road outside Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, Rostov Region, August 16, 2014

When zoomed in towards the truck transporting the containers we see the one of the numbers. It is 9M38M188661436?

This number is split up as

xxxxxx| a | bb | ccc | ddd

XXXXXX = The 9M38M1 part shows the type of missile.

A= On most of the missiles the next number seems always to be the digit 8. This is the code for the manufacturer of the missile. 8 = Dolgoprudny Research Production Enterprise located near Moscow.

BB = the year of the missile was build.

CCC= The next three digits show the batchnumber of the missile. What characteristics are shared by missiles sharing the same batch number is unknown. It could be used to identify the factory, the metal used, the month produced.

DDD= The last three numbers is a code for the missile. Combined with the batchnumer this is a unique number.

One of the containers carried by the truck clearly shows a production year of 86.

Russia debunked: the photo proves Russia in August 2014 did use missiles produced in 1986.

Reuters published two photos in the same article of a Russian army convoy travelling on a road near outside Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, Rostov Region.

The photo here has some EXIF info. It shows the pic was made at August 16, 2014 at 10:53. Mind this is the time and date setting on the camera.

The first truck has license plate 8564HC. The second truck has license plate 8568HC. Here the numbers on the containers are clearly visible.

A closeup showing all three containers shows various years of production. 2 containers showing 86 and 1 container showing 92.

The production date is seen on the BUK engine casing as displayed by JIT. It shows 15 12 86. Likely December 15, 1986.

The code on the left, is a different code. It has the type of engine, a batch code and a serialnumber. The same code is encraved in the engine nozzle.

At the JIT press conference the code written at the casing is explained in the video here. (at 26 minutes 55 seconds)

The Russian MoD confirmed the number 86 printed on the casing shown by JIT is the production date as reported by Sputnik:

No new anti-aircraft missiles were supplied to Ukraine, which has about 20 battalions of BUK missiles systems since 1991, the ministry said, adding that a special number of the missile allegedly used to down the aircraft shows that it was produced in the Soviet Union in 1986

The Russian Embassy in South Africa confirmed the missile shown by JIT was produced in 1986. Disregard the other nonsense in the same Tweet

Russian MoD: Serial code on Buk missile fragments shown by JIT indicate it was made in 1986. All such missiles used by @mod_russia were destroyed in 2011 (max 25y service). Meanwhile Ukraine, which has 20 Buk divisions, has NO Buk missiles produced after 1991, only old ones #MH17 pic.twitter.com/qOZlWqRSZh ‚Äî Russia in RSA üá∑üá∫ (@EmbassyofRussia) May 26, 2018

Truck links to the 53rd brigade in Kursk

Another interesting detail of the Reuters photo is the truck with a crane installed on it. A video showing trucks of the 53rd brigade from Kursk, shows an identical looking truck. The license plate seems to match as well as the slanted piece of metal at the back.

If the two trucks are the same, this is a match between the 53rd brigade using missiles produced in 1986. (source screenshot)

Bellingcat in a report about the 53rd brigade convoy included two photos of the Ural 4320 truck with KS-2573 crane with license plate 0502 HC 50

Another indication the missile casing shown by JIT was in use by Russian army

If the BUK missile casing shown by JIT was an Ukrainian used missile , Russia would have pulled out the sales slip and proven that BUK with this number was sold/transferred to Ukraine. Instead, Russia told nonsense on the year of production. It is another indication Russia shot down MH17.
