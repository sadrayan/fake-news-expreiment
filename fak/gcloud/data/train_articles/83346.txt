Medicaid in Florida will be hit hard by Obamacare repeal bill
House Republicansâ€™ bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would cap spending for Medicaid, which covers an estimated 4.3 million Floridians. A cap per Medicaid beneficiary as proposed under the legislation could force Florida hospitals and counties to spend more to cover low-income and uninsured residents, experts say.
