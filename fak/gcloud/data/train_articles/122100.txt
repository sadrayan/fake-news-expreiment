Crabs are building homes out of human trash
LITTLE do these crabs know, they’re substituting their shells for human garbage.

The beaches of the Okinawa islands, a group of 150 islands that sit south of Japan in the East China Sea, are home to Blueberry hermit crabs that have started to use beach trash to create their permanent homes.

With an influx of pollution entering our waterways worldwide, the effect it has on animals is undeniably troubling.

Photographer Shawn Miller noticed the strange problem wasn’t a one off, and in a bid to highlight the effects of pollution on the Okinawa coastline, has decided to create a photo series called ‘Crabs with beach trash homes.’

Quite simply, these crabs are taking human waste and turning them into a makeshift shell.

“At first glance, I was amazed to see this animal adapting it’s housing to a plastic bottle cap. I couldn’t believe it and had to take a second look,’ said Miller.

Small lids such as toothpaste caps seemingly make the most desired real estate for these resourceful crustaceans.

“I noticed more trash piling up on our shorelines searching for hermit crabs and realised it was a serious problem.”

Miller says his goal is “to bring awareness to our pollution problems on our shorelines.”

“Hopefully these images will inspire people to care more about nature.”

So let this be a lesson to you to dispose of your waste carefully, you don’t want a crab to make your trash their treasure.
