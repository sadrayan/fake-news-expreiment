Daughter of the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton has seemingly admitted that t ‘Pizzagate‘ - the conspiracy theory born out of the Wikileaks emails allegedly exposing politicians running pedophile rings - is real on her Twitter on Thursday.

In a strange rant, Chelsea Clinton Tweeted “of course there’s a #Pizzagate 2.0. Of course, there is,” in a sarcastic reference to the recent child trafficking bust in Arizona.

Not long after the Tweet was sent out, Twitter users discovered that National Human Trafficking Hotline that Chelsea mentioned in her Tweet is actually the organization run by her mother Hillary, one of the many high profile people accused of being involved in the child sex ring in Washington D.C.

This is not the first time Clinton has posted strange tweets.

Back im January this year, she boasted to fans that Satanism is a “religion” and “deserves our respect” before publically wishing the Chruch Of Satan a Happy New Year.

In November 2017, Clinton let slip that she supported Sharia Law, praising plans to introduce a new hijab-waring Barbie.

Maybe its time for Chelsea to retire from Twitter before reveals any more dark and disturbing secrets from the Clinton cabal.
