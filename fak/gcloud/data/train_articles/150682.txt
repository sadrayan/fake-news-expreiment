South Africa has seen a recent increase in the number of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) maintained in reserves and parks and managed in free contact, where they may spend a significant amount of time in close proximity to humans. This study investigates how individual elephants choose to initiate interactions with humans by examining whether interaction types and frequencies vary both between elephants and with regards to the category of human involved in the interaction. Observations were made on a herd of seven captive African elephants frequently exposed to elephant handlers (guides), volunteers (who carry out general observations for the park’s research unit), and tourists. The elephants differed in the frequencies with which they initiated interactions with each category of human and in the types of behaviors they used to initiate interactions. However, all of the elephants interacted most frequently with guides. Certain individual elephants showed preferences in interacting with specific guides, indicating particular elephant-guide bonds. This study provides evidence for elephant-handler bonds as well as information on the extent of interactions between humans and African elephants managed in free contact.

Introduction

As wild elephant populations decline, many African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are maintained in reserves and parks across Southern Africa, where they may spend a significant amount of time in close proximity to humans. There are currently 129 captive elephants in South Africa, which is approximately a 30% increase in the last decade (D. Young, personal communication, 18 February 2016). Captive elephants are maintained in parks and zoos where management techniques range from protected contact to free contact, a method where elephant handlers work alongside elephants with no physical barrier. Despite the large number of elephants living in captive facilities, there is little information on the interactions that take place between captive African elephants and the humans with whom they are in contact.

The effects of human–animal interactions (HAIs) have been studied extensively across a variety of species. Interactions with humans may have the effect of reducing stress in dogs, a quality that interaction with other dogs lacks (1). Dogs also preferred to initiate interactions with humans to kennelmates (2). HAIs have been successful as enrichment for both captive chimpanzees (3) and gorillas (4). Both studies found that increased interaction with humans led to an increase in affiliative behaviors between conspecifics and a decrease in abnormal behaviors or stereotypies. Interactions that are initiated by the animal have further implications. Human-directed behaviors such as approaching or seeking out can be related to how friendly a particular animal is (5). These types of behaviors may be indicators of attachment (6) or even indicators of positive relationships between humans and animals (7).

The human–animal relationship (HAR) and its subset, the human–animal bond (HAB), are two additional concepts that are becoming increasingly important in the field of animal behavior. HABs have been defined as “reciprocal and persistent” relationships that benefit both parties involved (8, 9). The potential for animals to develop HABs has been evidenced in multiple species, including dogs and horses (1), farm animals (10), and various zoo animals (5, 8). A positive relationship has been shown between the frequency of HAIs and the subsequent development of a HAB (1). The implications of the HAB in a captive facility include increased ease of management and potential increase in quality of life for the animals (8).

Personality and temperament play a role in HARs, as the extent to which an animal is willing to interact with humans varies depending on the individual. Personality and temperament are often treated as synonyms and have been defined as the consistent, specific behavior patterns of an individual (11). Elephants specifically have been shown to differ individually in temperament traits relating to social integration, leadership, aggression, and exploratory behaviors (12). The different temperaments of individuals can also be important in determining how animals will interact with humans (6, 13). Individual behavioral variations in response to the presence of a stranger, more specifically exploratory behavior versus fearful behavior, have been demonstrated by house cats (14) and deer (15). Human personality traits may also have an effect on HAIs, as chimpanzees have been shown to differ in their response to humans based on whether the experimenter acted shy or bold (16).

The information on the interactions and relationships between elephants and humans is limited and consists mainly of data concerning Asian elephants. HABs between Asian elephants and their individual handlers, or mahouts, are discussed at length in Ref. (17). Through interviews with mahouts, it was shown that HABs allowed the mahouts to work more safely and productively with their elephants due to the high level of “trust” that had developed over time. Mahouts also specified that their elephants would not necessarily respond to the commands of others, which reinforces the idea that HABs are highly individual. In a separate study, boys as young as 12 were able to work safely with female Asian elephants and even indicated preferences for certain elephants, indicating that the development of HARs with captive elephants is not necessarily limited to trainers who exert control over their animals (18). Following their time spent working with elephants, Lehnhardt and Galloway (19) described the ability of HABs between trainers and elephants to contribute to the safety of training and handling elephants and indicated that the formation of the HAB may be more important than any formal training on how to handle elephants. This study also acknowledges the lack of information on HAIs between humans and young, male African elephants.

Elephants are cognitively advanced creatures with the largest brain of any land mammal and a remarkable capacity for long-term social memory (20). From their reactions to injured conspecifics (21) to their ability to recognize the calls of an estimated 100 other individuals (22), it is clear that interactions and relationships with conspecifics play an important role in the day-to-day life of the African elephant. Positive interactions occur frequently between females and calves in a herd (23) and families often function cohesively (12).

In a captive setting, African elephants have been shown to vary in their individual personalities, and various methods of rating temperament traits in elephants have proven successful (24, 25). These studies also discuss how recognizing an individual elephant’s unique set of characteristics can help direct management practices that cater to an elephant’s particular needs. For Asian elephants, mahouts similarly identified specific traits that they found either preferable or undesirable concerning the handling of a working elephant (17). The variability in an individual elephant’s personality may then inform the frequency and types of interactions that they exhibit toward humans, as previously discussed regarding other species.

The purpose of this study is to provide an in-depth look at how individual captive African elephants in a free contact environment choose to initiate interactions with humans, and whether interaction types and frequencies vary both between elephants and with regards to the type of human involved in the interaction. At the study site, it is anecdotally accepted that certain elephants maintain unique bonds with certain handlers, and that some elephants are friendlier overall than others. Past observations at this site provided further indications that the focal elephants may differ in when and how they interact with humans, and with which humans they choose to interact. This study attempts to use detailed information collected on elephant-initiated interactions in order to address the following:
