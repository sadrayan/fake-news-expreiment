NEO CANDO Visit the NEO CANDO home page and also the Facebook page. NEO CANDO, Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing, is a free and publicly accessible social and economic data system of the Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development, a research institute housed at Case Western Reserve Universityâ€™s Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences. NEO CANDO allows users to access data for the entire 17 county Northeast Ohio region, or for specific neighborhoods within the region. Academic researchers, community and economic development professionals, public officials, neighborhood activists, business leaders and concerned citizens of all types can easily use this system to explore aspects of the area such as population trends, poverty, employment, educational attainment, housing and crime. NEO CANDO users can generate data tables, maps, and charts, and either print them or export them into Word and Excel files. NEO CANDO represents a long-term collaboration between various non-profit organizations, foundations and government agencies, including the absorption of CleveInfo, the parcel-based data system jointly organized by the Cleveland Housing Network, the Enterprise Foundation and Neighborhood Progress, Inc. Efforts to enhance the property data tools located within NEO CANDO are underway as recommended by the

National Vacant Properties Campaign report, Cleveland at the Crossroads (PDF) as well as by the Vacant Properties Steering Committee, an interagency task-force consisting of several Cleveland City departments, Cleveland City Council, the Northeast Ohio First Suburbs Consortium, numerous departments within Cuyahoga County, community development organizations, and research interests. NEO CANDO will be a one-stop-shop for identifying vacant and abandoned properties as well as serve as an early warning system to provide a means for preventing more abandonment. NEO CANDO compiles data from many different sources and links to data provided by public agencies in order to have the most recent data available. Before using NEO CANDO, users should read the legal disclaimer and the general information about using the system.
