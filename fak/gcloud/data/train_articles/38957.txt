Fundraising for Super PACs by federal candidates
Federal candidates and officeholders may raise funds on behalf of Super PACs so long as they only solicit funds subject to the Federal Election Campaign Act’s (the Act) amount limitations and source prohibitions—i.e., up to $5,000 from individuals (and any other source not prohibited by the Act from making a contribution to a political committee). Additionally, federal candidates and officeholders may attend, speak at and be featured guests at fundraisers for Super PACs at which unlimited individual, corporate and labor organization contributions are solicited, so long as they restrict any solicitation they make to funds subject to the limitations, prohibitions and reporting requirements of the Act.
