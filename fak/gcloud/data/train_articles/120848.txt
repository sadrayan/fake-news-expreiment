What are the eligibility requirements for applying to the Harvard Law School J.D. program?

You are eligible to apply if you will have a bachelor's degree by August of the year you intend to enroll at HLS. You must also take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) before the February 1 application deadline (no later than the December LSAT administration) in order for your application to be guaranteed consideration.



The J.D. degree requires three years of full-time study, and new students begin their studies only in the fall semester each year. Apart from continuing legal education for practicing lawyers, we have no part-time, distance / on-line or summer programs.

What are the range of LSAT scores and GPAs of last year's admitted applicants?

Admission decisions are based on the Admission Committee's experienced judgment applied to individual cases, and many factors are taken into account. Each application is given a thorough review, taking account of all available information. Because GPA and LSAT alone do not fully or adequately summarize information about individuals that is important to admission decisions, these "numbers" often prove poor predictors of admission decisions on individual applications. At no point on the GPA or LSAT scales are the chances of admission to Harvard Law School 0 or 100 percent. As reported to the ABA, the 75/25 percentile GPAs for the class entering in 2013 were 3.95/3.77 and the 75/25 percentile LSATs were 175/170.

What is tuition at Harvard Law School? Is financial aid available?

All students who demonstrate financial need according to a combination of federal and institutional guidelines receive adequate financial assistance to complete their course of study. For more information about financial aid, visit the HLS Student Financial Services Office web site.

The Low Income Protection Plan (LIPP), is one of the most generous loan forgiveness programs in the nation. This program helps relieve the burden of repayment of educational loans for J.D. graduates in qualifying jobs. Qualifying jobs include all full-time jobs in non-profits, government, or academia and law-related jobs in the private sector. Click here for more information on LIPP.

2013-2014 Expenses:

Tuition: $54,000

Harvard Law School does not have a separate budget for married students or for students with dependants. The same standard budget is used for all students. However, married students and students with dependents are afforded higher living allowances against income in the calculation of their student contribution from income. For more detailed information about this you can refer to the JD Student Financial Services website at the Married Students and Students with Dependent Children Resources page.

What is the best "pre-law" curriculum? How does one prepare for law school?

The Harvard Law School faculty prescribes no fixed requirements with respect to the content of pre-legal education. The nature of candidates' college work, as well as the quality of academic performance, is taken into account in the selection process. As preparation for law school, a broad college education is usually preferable to one that is narrowly specialized. The Admissions Committee looks for a showing of thorough learning in a field of your choice, such as history, economics, government, philosophy, mathematics, science, literature or the classics (and many others), rather than a concentration in courses given primarily as vocational training. The Admissions Committee considers that those programs approaching their subjects on a more theoretical level, with attention to educational breadth, are better preparatory training for the legal profession than those emphasizing the practical.

Does Harvard Law School offer concurrent or joint degree programs?

Harvard Law School offers joint degree programs, with the Harvard Business School (JD/MBA), the Harvard School of Public Health (JD/MPH), the Harvard Kennedy School of Government (JD/ MPP or MPA/ID), the Harvard Graduate School of Design (JD/MUP), and the Cambridge University Faculty of Law (JD/LLM). The Law School also offers coordinated programs with the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (JD/PhD and JD/MA) in many fields.

Applicants admitted to both the JD program and a PhD program at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will qualify for consideration for our JD/PhD tuition funding program if their intention is to pursue a career in academia. A limited number of students receive full-tuition funding for the JD portion of their joint program. Contact the admissions office for more information on this program.

For those interested in combining a legal education with advanced training in a field in which a joint degree is not offered, we offer a number of concurrent degree opportunities with other graduate schools.

Click here for more information on joint and concurrent degree programs, and the coordinated J.D./Ph.D. program, as well as cross-registration and study abroad.

Can I visit the Law School?



Prospective applicants are welcome to visit the Law School at any time to take a self-guided tour, although you may wish to consult the academic calendar to plan your visit at a time when classes are in session to see the campus activity. You may wish to stop by the Admissions Office when you arrive for information on where to go and what you can do while in Cambridge. No individual meetings are availble. The Admissions Office is open between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday.

Are campus tours offered?

Information sessions with an admissions officer and student-guided tours are offered from mid-September through mid-November on select Friday afternoons. These sessions begin at 2:00 pm and last approximately 45 minutes to an hour. Back to Top

LSAT and LSAC's Credential Assembly Service

How important is the Law School Admission Test (LSAT)?

Designed to measure some of the acquired skills that are important to successful law study, the LSAT, within broad limits, provides a reasonable assessment of these skills. Standing alone, however, the LSAT provides only a partial measure of an individual's promise for law study. In the context of the broader range of information contained in a complete application for admission, the LSAT is helpful in assessing individual promise and in making meaningful comparisons among those who apply for admission.

Quantitative factors, while informative, do not play a decisive role in our selection process. We have no computational methods for making admission decisions, no mechanical shortcuts, no substitutes for careful assessment and good judgment. All completed applications are reviewed in their entirety with the LSAT as one factor in an overall assessment of academic promise, personal achievement, and potential contribution to the vitality of the student body.

Back to Top

Should I retake the LSAT?

The LSAT need be taken only once. If you take the test more than once, all scores will be received but we will use the highest score in our evaluation.

Back to Top

How long are LSAT scores useful?

An LSAT score taken within the past 5 years is considered valid. Back to Top

When should I take the LSAT?

We recommend that you take the LSAT at the June, October or December administration in the calendar year prior to the year the class to which you are applying will enter (e.g., the June, October, or December 2013 LSAT administration for the class entering HLS in 2014). Results of the February LSAT normally will not be considered in the current application cycle (e.g., results of the February 2014 LSAT will normally not be considered for applicants to the class entering in 2014).

Must I register with the LSAC's Credential Assembly Service?

You must register for LSAC's Credential Assembly Service and have all undergraduate and graduate transcripts sent to Law Services. When we receive and process your application, we will request your LSAC's Credential Assembly Service report, and Law Services will send it directly to us. The LSAC's Credential Assembly Service report includes your LSAT scores, copies of your academic transcripts, LSAT writing sample, and a summary of undergraduate grades. All applicants must be currently registered with LSAC's Credential Assembly Service except those who are not eligible to register. Applicants who received their undergraduate degrees outside the United States, Puerto Rico, or Canada may not be eligible for LSAC's Credential Assembly Service. Please check with the LSAC's Credential Assembly Service/LSAT Information Book in the LSAC's Credential Assembly Service section. If you are not eligible for LSAC's Credential Assembly Service you must have your official university transcripts sent directly to us and identify yourself as a foreign-educated applicant when registering for the LSAT and when completing the "Date(s) Registered with LSAC's Credential Assembly Service" question on the Harvard Law School J.D. Application. Those who did their undergraduate work at Canadian institutions must register with LSAC's Credential Assembly Service.

What if I applied to HLS in a previous year?

We keep applications on file for three years. If you applied more than three years ago, you must submit an entirely new application. If you applied in the last three years, you must be currently registered with LSAC's Credential Assembly Service, complete a new application form, submit a new personal statement and pay the application fee. You may submit new recommendations or rely on those in your previous application.

The Application Process

When do application materials become available?

You must electronically submit your application to our office through the LSAC. Our electronic application becomes available mid-September.

Back to Top

When does Harvard Law School begin accepting applications?

We encourage you to submit your application as soon as possible after the application goes live in September. Decisions are made on a rolling basis, which means you can expect a decision anytime between December and May.

Back to Top

What is the deadline to submit an application?

The deadline for submitting applications is February 1. We can guarantee full consideration for all applications received by that date. Back to Top

Does Harvard Law School have an "early admission" or an "early decision" process?

No. We have a rolling admission process. We review applications roughly in the order that they become complete (when all required materials have been received and processed), and decisions are usually sent about two months after the date they are submitted for review. We expect to begin submitting applications for review in October, so while a few applicants may receive decisions before December, responses to applications submitted for review before November are most likely to be sent during January.

Back to Top

Are application fee waivers available?

If payment of the application fee would pose a severe financial hardship, you should first apply for a fee waiver through LSAC.

If you were denied an LSAT/CAS fee waiver on the basis of financial need in the twelve months prior to applying to the J.D. Program at Harvard Law School, you may complete the Harvard Law School Fee Waiver Request Form. Please request a Fee Waiver Request Form by email at jdadmiss@law.harvard.edu with the subject line of "Fee Waiver Request Form".

Application fees are waived on the basis of financial need as demonstrated by information on this form. No application for admission will be considered before the application fee has been paid or a fee waiver has been granted. If LSAC has granted you an LSAT/LSAC's Credential Assembly Service fee waiver and you apply electronically to Harvard, your Harvard application fee will be waived. Back to Top

Do you require a College Certification?

While we do not require the College Certification as part of the application process, it will be required for all enrolling students. If you believe information on the College Certification would have a positive or negative impact on your admissibility, please submit it with your application.

Back to Top

Whom should I ask to write my recommendations?

Recommendations should come from those who have had an opportunity to evaluate you carefully and individually over a sufficient period of time to make a reasonable evaluation. At least one of the letters should deal with your academic and scholarly abilities. We realize that some applicants, particularly those who have been out of school for a number of years, may have difficulty finding even one academic recommender. If that is the case, letters from employers who have worked closely with you will be helpful.

Back to Top

How many letters of recommendations does Harvard require? Can I submit more?

Two recommendations are required. Although two thoughtfully selected recommenders are likely to be more effective than several chosen less carefully, we will accept three.

Back to Top

Does Harvard Law School grant interviews?

Evaluative interviews are available by invitation only. All interviews are conducted via Skype. We will, however, be happy to answer your questions. Group information sessions and tours offered during the fall semester are an effective way to learn about the School. You may also call us with questions during regular business hours at 617-495-3109.

Back to Top

How should I approach my personal statement?

The personal statement is an opportunity for you to present yourself, your background, ideas, and accomplishments to the Admissions Committee. It is for you to decide what information you would like to convey and the best way for you to convey it. Whatever you write about, readers will be seeking to get a sense of you as a person and as a potential student and graduate of Harvard Law School.

Back to Top

What length should my personal statement be?

We ask that you limit your statement to two pages, double spaced, using a font size that is comfortable to read (not less than 11 point).

Back to Top

Are all applications read?

Yes. Each application is reviewed thoroughly.

Back to Top

Are there "cut-off" GPAs or LSATs below which applications are not considered?

No. There are no "cut-off" GPAs or LSATs below which an application will not be considered in its entirety. We have no computational methods for making admission decisions, no mechanical shortcuts, no substitutes for careful assessment and good judgment. Our review process seeks to assess a number of characteristics that have few direct or precise measures by looking for evidence of these characteristics throughout an application.

Back to Top

Can I find out my status via email or over the phone?

The Admissions Office cannot respond to inquiries regarding the status of an application or an admissions decision via the telephone or email. As described in the application materials, we provide periodic status updates to applicants via email and an online status check and admissions decisions are provided via email. If you are a current applicant, please refer to the "application acknowledgment" or "application complete" emails for details.

Back to Top

What if I have a disciplinary record?

It is always best to answer questions concerning your disciplinary record fully and openly, and to provide an explanation. Disciplinary records are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are not necessarily viewed as negative.

Back to Top

Do you accept application materials or any correspondence by email?

Please send your materials through LSAC.

When should I apply for Financial Aid?

You cannot begin to apply for financial aid at HLS until you receive an offer of admissions. Once admitted, you will receive an HLS email account and instructions on how to apply for aid will be sent to you immediately via this email account. The specific documents required to complete the application process for financial aid are highly individualized and based on each student’s particular circumstances. For admitted students there is no specific deadline to complete an application for aid, but the sooner you complete your file by submitting all of your required documents, the sooner you will have your preliminary HLS financial aid award offer from us. Throughout the spring we generally have a two week (10 business days) turnaround time from the point your last document is received to the point you will receive your award notification. For an broad overview of the entire application process, please read over the Apply For Aid section of the Student Financial Services website.

What is your deferral policy?



At Harvard Law School, we expect that all applicants fully intend to enroll in the J.D. program in the fall of the year in which they apply. We also understand that individual circumstances related to enrollment can change after submitting an application.

Each cycle we allow a number of admitted applicants to defer enrollment, for one or two years, with an agreement not to apply to other law schools. While deferrals are not guaranteed, we are typically able to grant them without difficulty if they are requested in a timely fashion. We grant deferrals for many different reasons, but most commonly, deferring students wish to earn or finish another degree, or take advantage of an employment or service opportunity.

Admitted applicants will receive more detailed information about the procedures for applying for a deferral.
