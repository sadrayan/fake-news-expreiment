A comprehensive timeline of the Iran nuclear deal
Does all this talk of centrifuges and snap-back sanctions have your head spinning? You’re not alone. The details of the Iran nuclear deal are a bit complex, and figuring out just what is supposed to happen when can be tricky, even for those who do this for a living.

Luckily, Staley Smith and Quinta Jurecic, two bright minds over at the Brookings-affiliated blog Lawfare, have put together a detailed summary of the timing of obligations and activities triggered at each step of the Iran deal, including exactly when various sanctions will be relaxed or terminated and when the various restrictions on the Iranian nuclear program are slated to end.

We’ve reprinted it here for you, but be sure to check out all the commentary on Iran and the full array of issues related to national security law and policy over at Lawfare, whose editor-in-chief, Benjamin Wittes, and managing editor, Wells Bennett, are scholars in Brookings Governance Studies program.

Finalization Day (July 14, 2015)

The day the agreement was reached and endorsed by Iran and the P5+1

The deal will be “promptly” submitted to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for endorsement

The United Nations Security Council endorses the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) (July 20, 2015)

UNSC votes unanimously to:

endorse the JCPOA

“terminate” all prior UN sanctions, beginning on Implementation Day (and subject to re-imposition through snapback mechanism)

President Submits Agreement to Congress & 60-Day Congressional Review Period (July 20-September 17, 2015)

After all relevant documents are submitted to Congress (July 19, 2015), both houses of the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to vote on the deal, as required by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, sponsored by Senator Bob Corker (R-TN)

During this time, President Obama is prohibited from lifting sanctions on Iran

Adoption Day (October 2015)

90 days after the UNSC endorses the JCPOA, OR an earlier date mutually agreed upon by participants in the JCPOA.

The “JCPOA and the commitments in the JCPOA” come into effect

Participants in the JCPOA will begin making “necessary arrangements and preparations” to implement their commitments under the JCPOA

Implementation Day (Early 2016)

The day on which the IAEA report verifies that Iran has done the following:

Arak Heavy Water Research Reactor

that Iran has ceased pursuing construction at the existing Arak Heavy Water Reactor based on its original design

that Iran has removed existing calandria from Arak, and that the calandria have been made inoperable

that Iran is not producing or testing natural uranium pellets, fuel pins or fuel assemblies designed for the original Arak reactor

IAEA will monitor all existing uranium pellets, until the modernized Arak reactor becomes operational at which point the natural uranium pellets and IR-40 fuel assemblies will be converted to UNH

that Iran has made necessary technical modifications to the existing natural uranium fuel production process line for the modernized Arak reactor

Heavy Water Production Plant

that all excess heavy water beyond Iran’s needs for the modernized Arak research reactor are being made available for export (for 15 years)

that Iran has informed the IAEA about the inventory and production of the Heavy Water Production Plant and allows for monitoring

Enrichment Capacity

that Iran is keeping its enrichment capacity at under 5060 IR-1 centrifuges, in no more than 30 cascades in their current configuration at Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant (for 10 years)

that Iran is keeping its level of uranium enrichment below 3.67 percent (for 15 years)

that Iran has removed all additional centrifuges and infrastructure (not associated with the 5060 IR-1 centrifuges in FEP) and placed them in Natanz under continuous monitoring

Centrifuges Research and Development

that ongoing enrichment R&D does not accumulate enriched uranium

that enrichment R&D with uranium includes only IR-4, IR-5, IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges. Mechanical testing is carried out only on the IR-2m, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, IR-6s, IR-7 and IR-8, and only one or two of each type. Iran is building or testing only those gas centrifuges specified in this JCPOA (10 years)

that all testing of centrifuges with uranium is taking place only at the PFEP, and all mechanical testing of centrifuges is only at its Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (at Natanz) and The Tehran Research Center (15 years)

that Iran has adapting PFEP to the its long-term R&D plan, by removing and modifying all excess infrastructure and equipment in specified ways of Annex IIG

Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant

that Iran is not conducting any uranium enrichment or related R&D and has no nuclear material at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (for 15 years)

that Iran is maintaining no more than 1044 IR-1 centrifuge machines, that they are in one wing of the FFEP, and that have been structured in specific ways: two cascades modified for production of stable isotopes and four cascades remaining idle (for 15 years)

that Iran has removed the remaining cascades and infrastructure

(All of these will be placed in Natanz under IAEA continuous monitoring, but the IAEA is not required to certify that at this stage)

Other Aspects of Enrichment

that Iran is abiding by its voluntary commitments under its long-term R&D plan

The IAEA will monitor and approve annually for the duration of the plan that the nature, scope and scale of Iran’s enrichment program.

that a template for describing different centrifuge types and associated definitions, and a procedure for measuring centrifuge performance data has been agreed on.

that all enriched uranium hexafluoride in excess of 300 kg of up to 3.67% enriched UF6 (or the equivalent in different chemical forms) will be down blended to natural uranium level or be sold and delivered on the international market

that all uranium oxide enriched to between 5% and 20% has been fabricated into fuel plates for the Tehran Research Reactor or transferred outside of Iran or diluted to an enrichment level of 3.67% or less

that Iran is not building or operating facilities for converting fuel plates or scrap back to UF6 (for 15 years)

Centrifuge Manufacturing

that Iran is replacing broken or damaged active IR-1 centrifuges only from its stock of monitored stock of machines, and that the only centrifuges Iran is producing are to keep the store of IR-1s from dipping below 500

Additional Protocol and Modified Code 3.1

that Iran has notified the IAEA of its provisional implementation of the Additional Protocol and full implementation Modified Code 3.1

Centrifuge Component Manufacturing Transparency

that Iran has provided the IAEA with an initial inventory of all existing centrifuge rotor tubes and bellows is providing reports (and allowing verification) on changes in inventory

that Iran has declared all locations and equipment that are used for the production of centrifuge rotor tubes or bellows and permitted continuous IAEA monitoring

May also occur earlier, if the IAEA reaches the “Broader Conclusion” that “all nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful activities”

Transition Day, 8 years after Adoption Day (October 2023)

UNSC sanctions on ballistic missiles are lifted

May also occur earlier, if the IAEA reaches the “Broader Conclusion” that “all nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful activities”

Iran must seek ratification of the Additional Protocol on Nuclear Safeguards, which it signed in 2003 but has never formally “concluded.” (According to Iran, ratification by the Majlis is necessary for the Iranian government to conclude the Additional Protocol.)

The EU must lift the following sanctions:

prohibiting the supply of financial messaging services to, and freezing the assets of, designated individuals “involved in nuclear or ballistic missiles activities,” and “owned, controlled, or acting on behalf of” the Revolutionary Guard and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines.”

(The JCPOA references Article 20(12) of Council Decision (EU) 2010/413/CFSP. Strangely, there is no Article 20(12); perhaps this is referencing Article 20(1-2), which would make the most sense contextually.)

requiring inspection of cargo traveling to and from Iran; prohibiting the provision of maintenance services to cargo aircraft until suspect cargo is inspected and/or seized.

prohibiting the sale or transfer or financing of nuclear related materials to Iran

Materials listed in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (one, two) and Missile Technology Control Regime lists



Materials determined by the Security Council, the UNSC-established Sanctions Committee, or the IAEA to contribute to nuclear enrichment or the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems



Dual-use technology as listed in Annex I to EU Regulations

prohibiting loans, credits or joint ventures with Iranian individuals or entities involved in the manufacture of materials listed in the Common Military List of the EU or technology that could contribute to nuclear enrichment or nuclear weapons delivery systems

prohibiting investments in Iran that involve uranium mining, uranium enrichment, or the manufacture of materials listed in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (one, two) and Missile Technology Control Regime lists

prohibiting buying and selling precious metals to and from the Iranian government.

(Many of these seem to be misnumbered: for instance, there are no “Articles 4e and 4f” of Council Decision 2010/413/CFSP, and “Articles 15a, 15b and 15c” of Council Regulation (EU) No 267/2012 should be 15(1)a, b, and c)

prohibiting the sale of software and “associated services” to Iran (these also appear to be misnumbered)

prohibiting the sale or transfer of “arms and related materiel,” including military or paramilitary equipment, to Iran, and the import of arms from Iran

prohibiting technical or financial assistance related to designated materials and loans or financial relationships with any Iranian individual involved in the manufacture of such goods

freezing assets and banning visas for Iranian banks, financial institutions, individuals and entities related to “oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors,” shipping and transport, “proliferation-sensitive” activities, and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles

The United States must seek legislative action to effect the complete termination of:

those sanctions suspended since Implementation Day, including those targeting Iran’s financial, energy, shipping, automotive sectors and petrochemical measures

sanctions on the acquisition of nuclear-related commodities and services (under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act)
