I was unable to locate a Gatti’s delivery area map from around the 2000 mark. We only seem to have more recent versions here in the office so I imagine they’re probably rolled up and filed away in tubes somewhere deep in our offsite storage.

I did confirm that Gatti’s Pizza restaurant #160 on W 6th St. and Rio Grande was opened in September of 1998 and closed March of 2014. During that time our delivery area extended west to the lake in the Terry Town area and all the way east to Pleasant Valley, easily encompassing the area in question. In addition, the Oltorf location we had at the time picked up any delivery needs that fell south of the #160 delivery area.

We’ve been serving pizza to people all throughout this great city for going on 46 years and we’ve certainly witnessed and marveled at the rapid change happening on the East side. That said, had Council Member Renteria called 459-2222, Gatti’s would have gladly delivered the best pizza in town right to his doorstep.

Hello again. I came across the phone book entry for Mr. Gatti’s in 2000 and it doesn’t list the store on West Sixth. I tried to send a photo of that entry to your cell phone a moment ago.

Thoughts?

Well thanks for challenging the facts here, Gardner. My investigation shows a slight revision to the information I provided below. We actually began construction and finish out on the 6th St. location in September of 1998 but our first week of business there was actually in June of 1999.

That said, we were most definitely delivering pizza to the area in question from June 1999 to this day. I’m looking at a print out of the first week’s sales leger here on my desk. Obviously we just hadn’t updated that phone book listing you found.

Hope that helps.
