Hurley, Burish & Stanton :: Profiles
Marcus J. Berghahn defends individuals and businesses accused of criminal misconduct. He appears regularly in state and federal courts where he handles all types of criminal cases at all stages of criminal proceedings—from investigation to pre-charging negotiation, to practice before a Grand Jury or a John Doe magistrate, to motion hearings, to jury trial and through appeal. Because of the depth of his experience, Marcus also counsels witnesses and victims when they are involved in criminal proceedings.



Marcus regularly handles cases involving allegations of bribery, fraud, tax offenses, computer crimes, sex crimes, wildlife and hunting violations and university-related misconduct. He has obtained positive results for many of his clients.



Marcus’ skills have been recognized by his inclusion in Best Lawyers in America® (Criminal Defense: White-Collar), his designation as a Super Lawyer® (Criminal Defense), as well as his AV rating from Martindale Hubbell® (signifying the highest level of legal ability and very high adherence to standards of professional conduct). The skills of Marcus and his colleagues are noted in Hurley, Burish & Stanton’s recognition as a Tier 1 Best Law Firm, according to U.S. News & World Reports in the areas of non-white-collar criminal defense, white-collar governmental investigations, white-collar litigation and DUI/DWI defense.



Marcus lectures regularly on topics of criminal law at continuing legal education seminars and is also an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, where he teaches a seminar on constitutional and criminal law.



Marcus takes pride in helping clients through a very difficult time in their lives and delivers on what he believes are three core client needs:



— Helping a client understand exactly what will happen at each stage of their case and what that means for them.

— Having compassion for the stress and anxiety attendant to criminal cases.

— Listening to a client's concerns and priorities in order to deliver the best advice possible, leading to the best result possible.
