House Speaker John Boehner is sticking to his position: The House will not vote on the Senate-passed immigration bill.

“I’ve made it clear and I’ll make it clear again, the House does not intend to take up the Senate bill,” Boehner said Monday. “The House is going to do its own job in developing an immigration bill.”

He added, “It is time for Congress to act. But I believe the House has its job to do, and we will do our job.”

On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pushed at Boehner’s insistence that he will obey by the “Hastert rule,” which requires a majority of the Republican caucus support any legislation before it moves to the floor.

“Eventually he’ll be forced to take the bill that we passed here, or the country will be left with no immigration reform at all. Which is a bad, bad outcome,” Reid said on the Senate floor.

Boehner, asked about Reid’s specific comments, didn’t answer the senator directly.

“The American people expect that we’ll have strong border security in place before we begin the process of legalizing and fixing our legal immigration system,” Boehner said. “We’re going to have a conversation with our members on Wednesday on how we would move ahead. We have a broken immigration system, we have undocumented workers here in record numbers. We just can’t turn a blind eye to this problem and think it’s going to go away.”

At the press conference, where Boehner spoke about rising student loan rates, a group of “Dreamers,” students who were brought illegally into the country as small children and are seeking legal status after completing school, stood across the plaza. As Boehner finished his remarks the small crowd began chanting, “education not deportation.”
