By Nchee, 13 August 2014

Two live mermaids were allegedly discovered in a pool near South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma’s home in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal.

The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema, accused the President of witchcraft after a supposedly leaked picture showing the mermaids had circulated on social networks. Malema has accused President Zuma of using the mermaids to prevent him from losing his place in leadership.

A spokesperson for the Presidency, Mac Maharaj, said the mermaids were real and that Zuma was not aware of their existence. Hear him:

“The president of the republic, Jacob Zuma, would like to set on record that although the two mermaids were discovered in a pool situated inside his Nkandla homestead, he was not aware of their existence. The Office of the Presidency will be in a better position to comment once an investigation by the security cluster has been concluded.”

Reports also indicate that the mermaids were killed and taken to a research facility in Durban.
