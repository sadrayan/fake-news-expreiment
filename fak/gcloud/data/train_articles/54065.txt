Gov. Walker Response to Hillary Clinton's Baseless Attacks On His College Tuition Record
Wausau, Wis. -- Today, Governor Walker made the following statement in response to Hillary Clinton's false attacks on his record on college affordability:

"Hillary Clinton is offering the same bait and switch as President Obama, making promises to students while delivering higher tuition costs and tax increases. As governor, I froze college tuition at Wisconsin colleges four years in a row. Americans need a leader who delivers results not empty promises."

Additionally, see Governor Walker's tweet below as well as background information from the campaign.

Background from Walker campaign:

· We need real reforms in higher education including putting in place true incentives to keep costs low, confronting the accreditation cartels that limit options, and improving federal government data so students and families have the information they need to make the best decisions possible.

· We need to make sure students are getting the skills they need to fill jobs open jobs in our economy.

· We need a thriving economy providing good-paying jobs for graduates.

· Hillary Clinton's Washington-focused tax and spend plan is certainly not a step toward a thriving economy and job creation.
