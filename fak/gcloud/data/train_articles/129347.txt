What is Condensation? (with pictures)
The process of condensation is the physical change of state of a gas to a liquid. It is the opposite of evaporation, which is the process of a liquid changing into a gas due to it being heated. Most often, condensation is caused by a drop in temperature, although it can also be brought on by compressing the gas. When the gas has condensed, the resulting liquid is referred to as the condensate.

This process causes a physical change, not a chemical one, as the resulting substance is the same as the initial except for its state. Cooling or compressing a vapor causes it to shrink in volume, which causes a reduction in the velocity of the molecules that make up the gas. As the molecules slow down and get closer together, they are more likely to join together. Eventually, enough molecules join together to form droplets of the liquid state of the substance and condense.

Condensation is an important phase of distillation, which is used in laboratories and chemical applications to separate substances within a mixture from one another. Distillation is based on the premise that different substances evaporate and condense at different temperatures. During distillation, the mixture is heated to a specific temperature, causing one of the liquids to boil and evaporate off. Once it is in its gaseous form, it moves through a condenser.
