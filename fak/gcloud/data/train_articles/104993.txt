TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to the intersection of the fields of immunology and protein engineering, and particularly to an immunogen and vaccine useful in prevention of influenza infection by influenza A virus.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The family hepadnaviridae are enveloped DNA-containing animal viruses that can cause hepatitis B in humans (HBV). The hepadnavirus family includes hepatitis B viruses of other mammals, e.g., woodchuck (WHV), and ground squirrel (GSHV), and avian viruses found in ducks (DHV) and herons (HeHV). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) used herein refers to a member of the family hepadnaviridae that infects mammals, as compared to a virus that infects an avian host, unless the discussion refers to a specific example of a non-mammalian virus.

The nucleocapsid or core of the mammalian hepatitis B virus (HBV or hepadnavirus) contains a sequence of 183 or 185 amino acid residues, depending on viral subtype, whereas the duck virus capsid contains 262 amino acid residues. Hepatitis B core protein monomers of the several hepadnaviridae self-assemble in infected cells into stable aggregates known as hepatitis B core protein particles (HBc particles). Two three-dimensional structures are reported for C-terminally truncated HBc particles. A first that comprises a minor population contains 90 copies of the HBc subunit protein as dimers or 180 individual monomeric proteins, and a second, major population that contains 120 copies of the HBc subunit protein as dimers or 240 individual monomeric proteins. These particles are referred to as T=4 or T=3 particles, respectively, wherein “T” is the triangulation number. These HBc particles of the human-infecting virus (human virus) are about are about 30 or 34 nm in diameter, respectively. Pumpens et al. (1995) Intervirology, 38:63-74; and Metzger et al. (1998) J. Gen. Viol., 79:587-590.

Conway et al., (1997) Nature, 386:91-94, describe the structure of human HBc particles at 9 ÅAngstrom resolution, as determined from cryo-electron micrographs. Bottcher et al. (1997), Nature, 386:88-91, describe the polypeptide folding for the human HBc monomers, and provide an approximate numbering scheme for the amino acid residues at which alpha-helical regions and their linking loop regions form. Zheng et al., (1992) J. Biol. Chem., 267(13):9422-9429 report that core particle formation is not dependent upon the arginine-rich C-terminal domain, the binding of nucleic acids or the formation of disulfide bonds based on their study of mutant proteins lacking one or more cysteines and others' work with C-terminal-truncated proteins [Birnbaum et al., (1990) J. Virol. 64, 3319-3330]. The low resolution structure of HBc particles reported by Conway et al., (1997) and Bottcher et al.,(1997) has been confirmed by a 3.3 Å resolution crystal structure of the T=4 particles reported by Wynne at al., (1999) Mol. Cell, 3(6):70-80.

The hepatitis B nucleocapsid or viral core protein (HBc) has been disclosed as an immunogenic carrier moiety that stimulates the T cell response of an immunized host animal. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,527, U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,145 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,726. A particularly useful application of this carrier is its ability to present foreign or heterologous B cell epitopes at the site of the immunodominant loop that is present at about residue positions 70-90, and more usually recited as about positions 75 through 85 from the amino-terminus (N-terminus) of the protein. Clarke et al. (1991) F. Brown et al. eds., Vaccines 91, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., pp. 313-318.

During viral replication, HBV nucleocapsids associate with the viral RNA pre-genome, the viral reverse transcriptase (Pol), and the terminal protein (derived from Pol) to form replication competent cores. The association between the nucleocapsid and the viral RNA pre-genome is mediated by an arginine-rich domain at the carboxyl-terminus (C-terminus). When expressed in heterologous expression systems, such as E.coli where viral RNA pre-genome is absent, the protamine-like C-terminus; i.e., residues at positions 150 through 183, can bind E.coli RNA. Zhang et al. (1992) JBC, 267(13) 9422-29.

HBcAg is a particulate protein derived from the hepatitis B virus that has been proposed as a carrier for heterologous epitopes. The relative immunogenicity of HBsAg (HBs) has been compared with HBcAg (HBc), and the ability of each to evoke immune responses in different genetic backgrounds [Milich et al., Science, (1986) 234(4782): p. 1398-1401]. These data emphasize the higher immunogenicity of HBc relative to HBs, and the universal responsiveness to HBc, irrespective of genetic background.

For example, HBc is more than 300 times more immunogenic than HBs in BALB/c mice; and, although both B10.S and B10.M mice are non-responders to HBs, every strain tested is responsive to HBc. These results re-emphasize the suitability of HBc as a vaccine carrier and specifically, its superiority over HBs, hence the selection of HBc as opposed to HBs to carry heterologous epitopes. These facets of HBc are thought to be important in influenza vaccine development, because they address issues of genetic restriction and inadequate antibody titers.

Another advantage of the HBc carrier is the fact that may not require complex adjuvants for efficacy. This is due to the high inherent immunogenicity of the particle. A comparison of the immunogenicity of HBc-P. berghei particles showed that alum, which is approved for human use, was more effective than either IFA or CFA [Schodel et al., J. Exp. Med., (1994) 180(3): p. 1037-46]. The importance of this observation is highlighted by toxicity problems associated with newer, more complex adjuvants as was recently noted in clinical trials of SKB's candidate malaria vaccine [Stoute et al., N. Engl. J. Med., [1997] 336(2): p. 86-91].

In an application as a vaccine carrier moiety, it may be preferable that the HBV nucleocapsids not bind nucleic acid derived from the host. Birnbaum et al. (1990) J. Virol., 64:3319-3330 showed that the protamine-like C-terminal domain of HBV nucleocapsids could be deleted without interfering with the protein's ability to assemble into virus-like particles. It is thus reported that proteins truncated to about position 144; i.e., containing the HBc sequence from position one through about 144, can self-assemble, whereas deletions beyond residue 139 abrogate capsid assembly [Birnbaum et al., (1990) J. Virl., 64:3319-30).

Zlotnick et al., (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 94:9556-9561 studied the assembly of full length and truncated HBc proteins in to particles. In addition to discussing full length molecules, those authors reported the preparation of a truncated protein that contained the HBc sequence from position 1 through 149 in which the cysteines at positions 48, 61 and 107 were each replaced by alanines and in which a cysteine residue was added at the C-terminus (position 150). That C-terminal mercaptan was used for linkage to a gold atom cluster for labeling in electron microscopy.

More recently, Metzger et al. (1998) J. Gen. Viol., 79:587-590 reported that the proline at position 138 (Pro-138 or P138) of the human viral sequence is required for particle formation. Those authors also reported that assembly capability of particles truncated at the carboxy-terminus to lengths of 142 and 140 residues was affected, with assembly capability being completely lost with truncations resulting in lengths of 139 and 137 residues.

Several groups have shown that truncated particles exhibit reduced stability relative to standard hepatitis B core particles [Gallina et al. (1989) J. Virol., 63:4645-4652; Inada, et al. (1989) Virus Res., 14:27-48], evident by variability in particle sizes and the presence of particle fragments in purified preparations [Maassen et al., (1994) Arch. Virol., 135:131-142]. Thus, prior to the report of Metzger et al., above, Pumpens et al., (1995) Intervirology, 38:63-74 summarized the literature reports by stating that the carboxy-terminal border for HBc sequences required for self-assembly was located between amino acid residues 139 and 144, and that the first two or three amino-terminal residues could be replaced by other sequences, but elimination of four or eleven amino-terminal residues resulted in the complete disappearance of chimeric protein in transformed E. coli cells.

Recombinantly-produced hybrid HBc particles bearing internal insertions (referred to in the art as HBc chimeric particles or HBc chimers) containing various inserted polypeptide sequences have been prepared by heterologous expression in a wide variety of organisms, including E.coli, B.subtilis, Vaccinia, Salmonella typhimurium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. See, for example Pumpens et al. (1995) Intervirology, 38:63-74, and the citations therein that note the work of several research groups. Native HBc particles have also been produced in plants (Tsuda et al., 1998) Vox Sang, 74(3):148-155.

Such HBc chimers often appear to have a less ordered structure, when analyzed by electron microscopy, compared to particles that lack heterologous epitopes [Schodel et al., (1994) J. Exp. Med., 180:1037-1046]. In some cases the insertion of heterologous epitopes into C-terminally truncated HBc particles has such a dramatic destabilizing affect that hybrid particles cannot be recovered following heterologous expression [Schodel et al. (1994) Infect. Immunol., 62:1669-1676]. Thus, many chimeric HBc particles are so unstable that they fall apart during purification to such an extent that they are unrecoverable or they show very poor stability characteristics, making them problematic for vaccine development.

The above Pumpens et al. (1995) Intervirology, 38:63-74 report lists particle-forming chimers in which the inserted polypeptide sequence is at the N-terminus, the C-terminus and between the termini. Insert lengths reported in that article are 24 to 50 residues at the N-terminus, 7 to 43 residues internally, and 11 to 741 residues at the C-terminus.

Kratz et al., (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 96:1915-1920 recently described the E. coli expression of chimeric HBc particles comprised of a truncated HBc sequence internally fused to the 238-residue green fluorescent protein (GFP). This chimer contained the inserted GFP sequence flanked by a pair of glycine-rich flexible linker arms replacing amino acid residues 79 and 80 of HBc. Those particles were said to effectively elicit antibodies against native GFP in rabbits as host animals.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,085 describes two fusion proteins formed from an antigenic bovine inhibin peptide fused into (i) the immunogenic loop between residues 78 and 79 and (ii) after residue 144 of carboxy-terminal truncated HBc. Expressed fusion proteins were said to induce the production of anti-inhibin antibodies when administered in a host animal. The titers thirty days after immunization reported in that patent are relatively low, being 1:3000-15,000 for the fusion protein with the loop insertion and 1:100-125 for the insertion after residue 144.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,864 teaches the preparation and use of a strategically modified hepatitis B core protein that is linked to a hapten. The modified core protein contains an insert of one to about 40 residues in length that contains a chemically-reactive amino acid residue to which the hapten is pendently linked.

Recently published WO 01/27281 teaches that the immune response to HBc can be changed from a Th1 response to a Th2 response by the presence or absence, respectively, of the C-terminal cysteine-containing sequence of the native molecule. That disclosure also opines that disulfide formation by C-terminal cysteines could help to stabilize the particles. The presence of several residues of the native HBc sequence immediately upstream of the C-terminal cysteine was said to be preferred, but not required. One such alternative that might be used to replace a truncated C-terminal HBc sequence was said to include a C-terminal cysteine and an optional sequence that defines an epitope from other than HBc.

Published PCT application WO 01/98333 teaches the deletion of one or more of the four arginine repeats present at the C-terminus of native HBc, while maintaining the C-terminal cysteine residue. That application also teaches that the deleted region can be replaced by an epitope from a protein other than HBc so that the HBc portion of the molecule so formed acts as a carrier for the added epitope.

Published PCT applications corresponding to WO 02/13765 A2 and WO 02/14478 A2 teach that stabilization of C-terminally truncated HBc particles can be achieved through the use of one or more added cysteine residues in the chimer proteins from which the particles are assembled. Those added cysteine residues are taught to be at or near the C-terminus of the chimeric protein.

A structural feature whereby the stability of full-length HBc particles could be retained, while abrogating the nucleic acid binding ability of full-length HBc particles, would be highly beneficial in vaccine development using the hepadnaviral nucleocapsid delivery system. Indeed, Ulrich et al. in their recent review of the use of HBc chimers as carriers for foreign epitopes [Adv. Virus Res., 50: 141-182 (1998) Academic Press] note three potential problems to be solved for use of those chimers in human vaccines. A first potential problem is the inadvertent transfer of nucleic acids in a chimer vaccine to an immunized host. A second potential problem is interference from preexisting immunity to HBc. A third possible problem relates to the requirement of reproducible preparation of intact chimer particles that can also withstand long-term storage.

The above four published PCT applications appear to contain teachings that can be used to overcome over come the potential problems disclosed by Ulrich et al. As disclosed hereinafter, the present invention provides another HBc chimer that provides unexpectedly high titers of antibodies against influenza, and in one aspect also provides a solution to the problems of HBc chimer stability as well as the substantial absence of nucleic acid binding ability of the construct. In addition, a contemplated recombinant chimer exhibits reduced antigenicity toward preexisting anti-HBc antibodies.

The above particle instability findings related to N-terminal truncated HBc chimer molecules notwithstanding, Neirynck et al., (October 1999) Nature Med., 5(10):1157-1163 reported that particle formation occurred on E. coli expression of a HBc chimer that contained the N-terminal 24-residue portion of the influenza M2 protein (M2e), including the initiating methionine, fused at residue 5 to full length HBc.

Bachmann and co-workers [Jegerlehner et al., (2002) Vaccine, 20:3104-3112] compared a fusion construct substantially identical to that of Neirynck et al. above, with a coupled construct similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,864 in which the external 23-residues (after in vivo removal of the methionine residue) of the M2 protein of influenza A was coupled via a linker to a lysine residue engineered into the loop in a C-terminally truncated HBc (1-149) that also had the cysteine residues at positions 48 and 107 replaced by serine residues. Their results indicated an increase in anti-M2 titers and enhanced survival (6/6 vs. 0/3) for the coupled construct over the N-terminal fusion protein.

The previously discussed use of hybrid HBc proteins with truncated C-termini for vaccine applications offers several advantages over their full-length counterparts, including enhanced expression levels and lack of bound E.coli RNA. However, C-terminally truncated particles engineered to display heterologous epitopes are often unstable, resulting in particles that either fail to associate into stable particulate structures following expression, or that readily dissociate into non-particulate structures during and/or following purification. Such a lack of stability is exhibited by particles comprised of chimeric HBc molecules that are C-terminally truncated to HBc position 149 and also contain the above residues 2-24 of the influenza A M2 protein.

Others have reported that in wild type hepadnaviral core antigens a cysteine residue upstream of the HBcAg start codon is directly involved in the prevention of particle formation [Schodel et al. (Jan. 15, 1993) J. Biol. Chem., 268(2):1332-1337; Wasenauer et al. (March 1993) J. Virol., 67(3):1315-1322; and Nassal et al. (July 1993) J. Virol., 67(7):4307-4315]. All three groups reported that in wild type HBeAg, the cysteine residue at position −7 of the pre-core sequence, which is present when the core gene is translated from an upstream initiator methionine at position −30, is responsible for preventing particle formation and therefore facilitating the transition from particulate HBcAg to secreted, non-particulate HBeAg.

Based upon the above three publications, one would expect the inclusion of one or more cysteine residues at a position prior to the initiator methionine of HBc; i.e., at a residue position of less than one relative to the N-terminus of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, to actually destabilize C-terminal truncated hybrid particles rather than stabilize them. As will be seen from the discussion that follows, the present invention provides results that are contrary to those expectations.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention contemplates an hepadna virus-based immunogen for inducing antibodies to the extracellular domain of the influenza A M2 protein (M2e), and an inoculum and a vaccine comprising that immunogen dispersed in a physiologically tolerable diluent. Hereinafter, the designations “M2” and “M2e” are used interchangeably. A contemplated immunogen is a self-assembled particle comprised of recombinant hepatitis B virus core (HBc) chimer protein molecules. Each of those molecules has a length of about 150 to about 375 amino acid residues, includes a sequence of 6 to about 24 residues of SEQ ID NO: 9 and contains four peptide-linked amino acid residue sequence domains from the N-terminus that are denominated Domains I, II, III and IV.

The first domain, Domain I, comprises about 75 to about 160 amino acid residues. The sequence of this Domain includes at least the sequence of the residues of position 4 through about position 75 of HBc. One to three cysteine residues are also present at a position in the chimer molecule of about one to −55, preferably to about −30 and more preferably to about −20, relative to the N-terminus of HBc of SEQ ID NO:1 [N-terminal cysteine residue(s)]. The N-terminal cysteine residues are present within a sequence other than that of the pre-core sequence of HBc. A cysteine residue of Domain I can also be present in the two to four sequences of about 6 to about 24 residues of an influenza A M2 polypeptide X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 X 7 X 8 TX 10 X 11 X 12 X 13 X 14 X 15 X 16 X 17 X 18 X 19 X 20 X 21 X 22 X 23 X 24 of SEQ ID NO:9 such as a preferred polypeptide X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 X 7 X 8 -TPIRNE-X 15 X 16 X 17 X 18 X 19 X 20 X 21 X 22 X 23 X 24 of SEQ ID NO:10 that are peptide-bonded to or within about 15 residues of the N-terminus of the HBc sequence, and whose subscripted X residues are defined hereinafter, as well as one or more or HBc residues 1-4.

The second domain, Domain II, comprises about zero to about 60 amino acid residues peptide-bonded to about residue 75 of Domain I of which (i) zero to all ten residues in the sequence of HBc positions 76 through 85 are present peptide-bonded to (ii) an optional sequence of about 6 to about 48 residues that constitute one or more repeats of the above influenza A M2 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:9.

The third domain, Domain III, is an HBc sequence from about position 86 through about position 135 peptide-bonded to about residue 85.

The fourth domain, Domain IV, comprises (i) the residues of positions 136 through 140 plus up to nine residues of an HBc amino acid residue sequence from position 141 through 149 peptide-bonded to the residue of about position 135 of Domain III, (ii) zero to three cysteine residues, (iii) fewer than four arginine or lysine residues, or mixtures thereof adjacent to each other, and (iv) up to about 100 amino acid residues in a sequence heterologous to HBc from position 164 to the C-terminus, and preferably a sequence heterologous to HBc from position 156 to the C-terminus.

A contemplated chimer molecule (i) contains no more than 10 percent conservatively substituted amino acid residues in the HBc sequence, (ii) self-assembles into particles that are substantially free of binding to nucleic acids on expression in a host cell, and those particles are more stable on formation than are particles formed from an otherwise identical HBc chimer that lacks said N-terminal cysteine residue(s) or in which an N-terminal cysteine residue present in the chimer molecule is replaced by another residue.

It is preferred that the HBc sequence of Domain I include the residues of position 4 through position 75 alone plus at least an N-terminal cysteine residue. It is further preferred that a contemplated immunogen contain one cysteine residue within Domain IV alone or in an amino acid residue sequence heterologous to that of HBc from position 164 to the C-terminus. It is particularly preferred that that heterologous sequence comprise a T cell epitope of influenza A.

Another embodiment comprises an inoculum or vaccine that comprises an above HBc chimer particle that is dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent composition that typically also contains water. When administered in an immunogenic effective amount to an animal such as a mammal or bird, an inoculum induces antibodies that immunoreact specifically with the chimer particle. The antibodies so induced also immunoreact specifically with (bind to) the N-terminal portion of the M2 protein.

The present invention has several benefits and advantages.

A particular benefit of the invention is that its use as a vaccine provides extraordinary antibody titers against influenza A.

An advantage of the invention is that those very high antibody titers have been produced with the aid of an adjuvant approved for use in humans.

Another benefit of the invention is that the recombinant immunogen can be prepared easily and in large quantities using well-known cell culture techniques to grow transformed host cells.

Another advantage of the invention is that the immunogen is easily prepared using well-known recombinant techniques.

Yet another benefit of the invention is that a preferred immunogen exhibits greater stability at elevated temperatures than to other HBc chimers.

Yet another advantage of the invention is that a contemplated immunogen is substantially free of nucleic acids.

Still further benefits and advantages will be apparent to the worker of ordinary skill from the disclosure that follows.

DEFINITIONS

Numerals utilized in conjunction with HBc chimers indicate the position in the HBc ayw amino acid residue sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 at which one or more residues has been added to or deleted from the sequence, regardless of whether additions or deletions to the amino acid residue sequence are present. Thus, HBc149 indicates that the chimer ends at residue 149, whereas HBc149+C150 indicates that that same chimer contains a cysteine residue at HBc position 150 relative to the sequence numbers of SEQ ID NO:1.

The term “antibody” refers to a molecule that is a member of a family of glycosylated proteins called immunoglobulins, which can specifically bind to an antigen.

The word “antigen” has been used historically to designate an entity that is bound by an antibody or receptor, and also to designate the entity that induces the production of the antibody. More current usage limits the meaning of antigen to that entity bound by an antibody or receptor, whereas the word “immunogen” is used for the entity that induces antibody production or binds to the receptor. Where an entity discussed herein is both immunogenic and antigenic, reference to it as either an immunogen or antigen is typically made according to its intended utility.

“Antigenic determinant” refers to the actual structural portion of the antigen that is immunologically bound by an antibody combining site or T-cell receptor. The term is also used interchangeably with “epitope”.

The word “conjugate” as used herein refers to a hapten operatively linked to a carrier protein, as through an amino acid residue side chain.

The term “conservative substitution” as used herein denotes that one amino acid residue has been replaced by another, biologically similar residue. Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of one hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another such as between arginine and lysine, between glutamic and aspartic acids or between glutamine and asparagine and the like.

The term “corresponds” in its various grammatical forms as used in relation to peptide sequences means the peptide sequence described plus or minus up to three amino acid residues at either or both of the amino- and carboxy-termini and containing only conservative substitutions in particular amino acid residues along the polypeptide sequence.

The term “Domain” is used herein to mean a portion of a recombinant HBc chimer molecule that is identified by (i) residue position numbering relative to the position numbers of HBcAg subtype ayw as reported by Galibert et al., (1979) Nature, 281:646-650 (SEQ ID NO:1). The polypeptide portions of at least chimer Domains I, II and III are believed to exist in a similar tertiary form to the corresponding sequences of naturally occurring HBcAg.

As used herein, the term “fusion protein” designates a polypeptide that contains at least two amino acid residue sequences not normally found linked together in nature that are operatively linked together end-to-end (head-to-tail) by a peptide bond between their respective carboxy- and amino-terminal amino acid residues. The fusion proteins of the present invention are HBc chimer molecules that induce the production of antibodies that immunoreact with a polypeptide that corresponds in amino acid residue sequence to the polypeptide portion of the fusion protein.

The phrase “hepatitis B” as used here refers in its broadest context to any member of the family of mammalian hepadnaviridae, as discussed before.

The words “polypeptide” and “peptide” are used interchangeably throughout the specification and designate a linear series of amino acid residues connected one to the other by peptide bonds between the alpha-amino and carboxy groups of adjacent amino acids. Polypeptides can be a variety of lengths, either in their neutral (uncharged) forms or in forms that are salts. It is well understood in the art that amino acid residue sequences contain acidic and basic groups, and that the particular ionization state exhibited by the peptide is dependent on the pH value of the surrounding medium when the peptide is in solution, or that of the medium from which it was obtained if the peptide is in solid form. Thus, “polypeptide” or its equivalent terms is intended to include the appropriate amino acid residue sequence referenced. A peptide or polypeptide is always shown herein from left to right and in the direction from amino-terminus (N-terminus) to carboxy-terminus (C-terminus).

The term “residue” is used interchangeably with the phrase amino acid residue. All amino acid residues identified herein are in the natural or L-configuration. In keeping with standard polypeptide nomenclature, [J. Biol. Chem., 243, 3557-59 (1969)], abbreviations for amino acid residues are as shown in the following Table of Correspondence.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The present invention contemplates an immunogen and a vaccine or inoculum comprising that immunogen against the influenza A virus. A contemplated immunogen is a particle comprised of recombinant hepatitis B virus core (HBc) protein chimer molecules with a length of about 150 to about 375 and preferably about 150 to 235 amino acid residues that contains four peptide-linked amino acid residue sequence domains from the N-terminus that are denominated Domains I, II, III and IV. One to three cysteine residues are present at or near the N-terminus of the chimer and two to four polypeptides containing 6 to about 24 residues of the influenza A M2 extracellular domain (or M2e) polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:9 such as that of SEQ ID NO:10, as defined hereinbelow, are present peptide-bonded (fused) to the chimer molecule.

It is to be noted that the M2e sequences of human, avian and swine influenza A viruses are very similar. Thus, residues 1-9 of the human and avian viruses are identical, as are residues 1-7 and 9-10 of the human and swine viruses. All three viruses share the positions of the two cysteines (17 and 19) and have identical residues at positions 22-24. Even though the other positions can contain different residues at the other positions of M2e, the residues of the human sequence have been found present in different isolates such that the human sequence represents a consensus sequence for all three viruses.

In a contemplated immunogenic chime particle, (a) Domain I comprises about 75 to about 160 amino acid residues whose sequence includes at least the sequence of the residues of position 4 through about position 75 of HBc. One to three cysteine residues is(are) also present at a position in the chimer molecule of about one to about −55, preferably to about −30 and more preferably to about −20, relative to the N-terminus of HBc of SEQ ID NO:1 [N-terminal cysteine residue(s)]. The N-terminal cysteine residues is(are) present within a sequence other than that of the pre-core sequence of HBc.

A cysteine residue of Domain I can also be present in an optionally, but preferably, present (i) two to four sequences of 6 to about 24 residues of an above-noted influenza A M2 polypeptide such as X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 X 7 X 8 TX 10 X 11 X 12 X 13 X 14 X 15 X 16 X 17 X 18 X 19 X 20 X 21 X 22 X 23 X 24 of SEQ ID NO:9 or a preferred polypeptide such as X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 X 7 X 8 TPIRNEX 15 X 16 X 17 X 18 X 19 X 20 X 21 X 22 X 23 X 24 of SEQ ID NO:10 that are peptide-bonded to or within about 15 residues of the N-terminus of the HBc sequence (See, Table 4), as well as (ii) one or more of HBc residues 1-4. In such an influenza A M2 polypeptide sequence,

residues X 1 through X 8 are absent or present, and when present are the residues naturally present in the M2e protein sequence that are methionine, serine, leucine, leucine, threonine or proline, glutamic acid, valine, and glutamic acid or aspartic acid, respectively, with the proviso that when one subscripted X residue is present, any remaining subscripted X with a higher subscript number up to 8 is also present,

X 10 is present and is proline, leucine or histidine,

X 11 is present and is isoleucine or threonine,

X 12 is present and is arginine or lysine,

X 13 is present and is asparagine or serine,

X 14 is present and is glutamic acid or glycine,

residues X 15 and X 16 are present or absent, and when present are tryptophan and glycine or glutamic acid, respectively,

residues X 17 and X 19 are present or absent, and when present are independently cysteine, serine, or alanine,

residue X 18 is present or absent, and when present is arginine or lysine, and

residues X 20 through X 24 are present or absent, and when present are the residues naturally present in the M2 protein sequence that are asparagine, glycine or serine, aspartic acid or glycine, serine, serine and aspartic acid respectively, with the proviso that when one subscripted X residue is present, any remaining subscripted X residue with a lower subscript number down to 15 is also present.

(b) Domain II comprises about zero to about 60 amino acid residues peptide-bonded to about residue 75. This sequence includes (i) zero to all 10 of the residues of a sequence of HBc from HBc position 76 through 85 peptide-bonded to (ii) an optional sequence of about 6 to about 48 residues that constitute one or more repeats of 6 to about 24 residues of an above influenza A M2 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:9.

(c) Domain III is an HBc sequence from about position 86 through about position 135 that is peptide-bonded to about residue 85.

d) Domain IV comprises (i) the residues of positions 136 through 140 plus up to sixteen residues of an HBc amino acid residue sequence from position 141 through 156 peptide-bonded to the residue of position 135 of Domain III, (ii) zero to three cysteine residues, (iii) fewer than four arginine or lysine residues, or mixtures thereof adjacent to each other, and (iv) up to about 100 amino acid residues in a sequence heterologous to HBc from position 156 to the C-terminus. Thus, Domain IV contains at least the 5 residues of positions 136-140.

A contemplated chimer molecule (i) contains up to about 10 percent conservatively substituted amino acid residues in the HBc sequence, (ii) self-assembles into particles that are substantially free of binding to nucleic acids on expression in a host cell, and those particles are more stable on formation than are particles formed from an otherwise identical HBc chimer that lacks said N-terminal cysteine residue(s) or in which an N-terminal cysteine residue present in the chimer molecule is replaced by another residue.

A preferred chimer molecule contains a cysteine residue that is present at a position of about −50 to about +1 relative to the N-terminus of HBc as is illustrated in FIG. 1 and SEQ ID NO:1. The concept of a negative amino acid position is usually associated with a leader sequence such as the pre-core sequence of HBc. That concept is used similarly here in that one can simply align a given chimer molecule sequence with that of SEQ ID NO:1 to determine the position of the chimer that corresponds to that of the starting methionine residue of position +1 of HBc. Inasmuch as amino acid residue sequences are normally shown from left to right and in the direction from N-terminus to C-terminus, any aligned chimer molecule residue to the left of the position occupied by the HBc start methionine has a negative position. A contemplated cysteine residue can occur at a position about twenty residues to the left of the aligned start methionine of HBc to the position corresponding to that start methionine.

In examining the length of a contemplated HBc chimer, such a recombinant protein can have a length of about 150 to about 325 amino acid residues. Preferably, that length is about 150 to about 235 residues. More preferably, the length is about 170 to about 215 residues. These differences in length arise from changes in the length of Domains I, II and IV, and particularly the number of M2 polypeptides present and whether a C-terminal sequence heterologous to HBc is present.

HBc chimers having a Domain I that contains more than a deletion of the first three amino-terminal (N-terminal) residues have been reported to result in the complete disappearance of HBc chimer protein in E. coli cells. Pumpens et al., (1995) Intervirology, 38:63-74. On the other hand, a recent study in which an immunogenic 23-mer polypeptide from the influenza M2 protein was fused to the HBc N-terminal sequence reported that the resultant fusion protein formed particles when residues 1-4 of the native HBc sequence were replaced. Neirynck et al. (October 1999) Nature Med., 5(10):1157-1163 and patent application WO9907839. Thus, the art teaches that particles can form when an added amino acid sequence is present peptide-bonded the one of residues 1-5 of HBc, whereas particles do not form if no additional sequence is present and more than residues 1-3 are deleted from the N-terminus of HBc.

An N-terminal sequence peptide-bonded to one of the first five N-terminal residues of HBc can contain a sequence of up to about 40 residues that are heterologous to HBc; i.e., a portion of a pre-core sequence can be present in a contemplated chimer molecule. Exemplary sequences include an influenza A B cell or T cell epitopes such as are discussed hereinafter, a sequence of another (heterologous) protein such as β-galactosidase as can occur in fusion proteins as a result of the expression system used.

Domain I preferably has the sequence of residues of positions 2-, 3- or 4- through position 75 of HBc. Domain I also contains one to three, preferably one, added cysteine residue(s) and also preferably includes two to four sequences of about 6 to about 24 residues of the sequence of the extracellular region of the influenza A M2e protein peptide-bonded at the amino-terminus as discussed herein below. Domain I therefore typically contains a deletion of at least the methionine residue of position 1 of HBc and can include deletions of the residues at HBc positions 2, 3 and 4.

The one to three cysteine residues is(are) present at a position in the chimer molecule of about one to about −55, preferably to about −30 and more preferably to about −20, relative to the N-terminus of HBc of SEQ ID NO:1 [N-terminal cysteine residue(s)]. Thus, using the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 as a reference point, the N-terminal cysteine residue(s) is located in the chimer molecule at a position that corresponds to the methionine at position 1 of SEQ ID NO:1 ( FIG. 1 ), or at a position up to about 50 residues upstream from that position. Most preferably, an N-terminal cysteine is located at a position of about one to about minus 14 relative to position 1 of SEQ ID NO:1.

The one or more N-terminal cysteine residues are present within a sequence other than that of the pre-core sequence of HBc. As was noted previously, the HBeAg molecule contains the pre-core sequence that includes a cysteine residue. That molecule does not form particles, whereas particles are desired herein. Thus, although an N-terminal cysteine residue can be adjacent to a pre-core sequence, such a residue is not present within a pre-core sequence or a contemplated chimer molecule.

Domain I can have a length of about 160 residues. Preferably, Domain I has a length of about 95 to about 145 amino acid residues, and includes two to four, and preferably three influenza A M2 polypeptide epitope sequences of SEQ ID NO:9 such as a sequence of SEQ ID NO:10, that preferably includes the C-terminal 19 residues of the M2 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:9.

Recent studies have indicated that the N-terminal residues upstream from the first glutamic acid residue (between residues X 5 and X 6 in the above sequence) are or can be cleaved during preparation and expression by one or more hitherto unknown proteases that are thought to include a serine protease [whose activity can be inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)] or a metalloprotease [whose activity can be inhibited by ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA)]. Thus, some preferred embodiments utilize one or more 19-mer or shorter M2 sequences whose N-terminal residue is the glutamic acid at X 6 in SEQ ID NO: 9.

More preferably, it has been found that the activity of the protease can be minimized and likely eliminated by heating a buffer solution of the chimer particles to a temperature of about 50° to about 70° C. for a time period of about 1.5 to about 3 hours. The effect of the protease can also be minimized or eliminated by maintaining the particles in an aqueous composition that also contains a protease-inhibiting amount of EDTA (e.g. about 1-10 mM) or a similar sequestrant. An exemplary group of other useful metalloprotease-inhibiting sequestrants (chelators) include 2,2′-bipyridyl, dimercaptopropanol, ethyleneglycol-bis-(2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N′N″-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), ortho-phenanthroline, salicylic acid, triethanolamine (TEA), bestatin, and phosphoramidon. The sequestrant and protease can be removed from the composition by passage of the otherwise purified particles over a size-exclusion or similar column followed by dialysis or similar treatment. The protease can also be dealt with by similar heating of a sequestrant-containing aqueous composition of the chimer particles.

Where two or three M2e sequences are peptide-bonded together and thereby joined serially, the cysteine residues present at one or both of positions 17 and 19 of a native M2 sequence can be absent and a contemplated N-terminal cysteine residue can be present between an added M2 sequence and the N-terminus of the HBc sequence. Preferably, a contemplated N-terminal cysteine is present in one or more of the M2 sequences at one or both of positions 17 and 19 of the native sequence. A cysteine can be present in each of two or three M2 sequences, in the N-terminal M2 sequence (at about position −52 or −54), in a middle sequence of three (at about position −30 or −32) or in the sequence joined to the HBc sequence (at about position −6 or −8). When two or three M2 sequences are present, it is preferred that one or two cysteines, preferably two cysteines, be present in the M2 sequence peptide bonded to the HBc sequence; i.e., the M2 sequence that is bonded directly to the HBc sequence or that is distal from the N-terminus of the molecule.

Domain II, which is peptide-bonded to about residue 75, contains about zero to about 60 amino acid residues. This Domain includes zero (none), and preferably at least 4 residues, and more preferably at least 8, through all 10 of the HBc sequence residues of about positions 76 through about position 85. Domain II also optionally includes a sequence of about 6 to about 48 residues that constitute one or more repeats of the before-mentioned influenza A M2 polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:9. The influenza A M2 polypeptide sequence, when present, is preferably peptide-bonded between HBc residues 78 and 79, and all of the HBc sequence from position 76 through 85 is present.

Preferred influenza A M2 polypeptide sequences for insertion into Domains I or II, or both, of a contemplated recombinant HBc chimer are enumerated in Table A, below. A sequence beginning with a methionine residue (M) is designed to be N-terminal sequence for insertion into the N-terminus of Domain I, whereas a sequence free of an N-terminal M residue is designed for insertion into Domain II.

In the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:9,

residues X 1 through X 8 are absent or present, and when present are the residues naturally present in the M2 protein sequence that are methionine, serine, leucine, leucine, threonine or proline, glutamic acid, valine, and glutamic acid or aspartic acid, respectively, with the proviso that when one subscripted X residue is present, any remaining subscripted X with a higher subscript number up to 8 is also present,

X 10 is present and is proline, leucine or histidine,

X 11 is present and is isoleucine or threonine,

X 12 is present and is arginine or lysine,

X 13 is present and is asparagine or serine,

X 14 is present and is glutamic acid or glycine,

residues X 15 and X 16 are present or absent, and when present are tryptophan and glycine or glutamic acid, respectively,

residues X 17 and X 19 are present or absent, and when present are independently cysteine, serine, or alanine,

residue X 18 is present or absent, and when present is arginine or lysine, and

residues X 20 through X 24 are present or absent, and when present are the residues naturally present in the M2 protein sequence that are asparagine, glycine or serine, aspartic acid or glycine, serine, serine and aspartic acid respectively, with the proviso that when one subscripted X residue is present, any remaining subscripted X residue with a lower subscript number down to 15 is also present.

In the similar polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:10, X 1 through X 8 are absent or present, and when present are the residues naturally present in the reported M2 protein sequence; i.e., methionine, serine, leucine, leucine, threonine, glutamic acid or aspartic acid, valine, and glutamic acid, respectively, with the proviso that when one subscripted X is present, any remaining subscripted X residue with a higher subscript number up to 8 is also present. Thus, when X 1 is present, each of X 2 through X 8 is also present. Similarly, when X 3 is present, each of X 4 through X 8 is also present, and the like. On the other hand, X 8 can be present without any other of the remaining X residues having a lower valued subscript number being present. The residues X 15 and X 16 are present or absent, and when present are tryptophan and glycine or glutamic acid, respectively. Residues X 17 and X 19 are present or absent, and when present are independently cysteine, serine, or alanine. It is preferred that at least one of X 17 and X 19 be cysteine, particularly when an M2 polypeptide epitope is present at the N-terminus of the chimer molecule. It is more preferred that two cysteines be present when a plurality of M2e sequences are present, and that those two cysteines be present in the M2 sequence nearest to the N-terminal residue of the HBc sequence portion. Residue X 18 is present or absent, and when present is arginine or lysine. Residues X 20 through X 24 are present or absent, and when present are the residues naturally present in the reported M2 protein sequence; i.e., asparagine, glycine or serine, aspartic acid or glycine, serine, serine and aspartic acid respectively, with the proviso that when one subscripted X is present, any remaining X residue with a lower subscript number through 15 is also present. Thus, for example, when X 23 is present, so are each of residues X 15 through X 22 .

Domain III contains the sequence of HBc about position 86 through about position 135 peptide-bonded at its N-terminus to about residue 85.

The fourth domain, Domain IV, comprises (i) the residues of positions 136 through 140 plus up to sixteen residues of an HBc amino acid residue sequence from position 141 through position 156, and preferably nine residues through 149 peptide-bonded to the residue of about position 135 of Domain III, (ii) zero to three cysteine residues, and preferably one cysteine residue, (iii) fewer than four arginine or lysine residues, or mixtures thereof adjacent to each other, and (iv) up to about 100 amino acid residues, preferably up to 50 amino acid residues, and more preferably up to about 25 residues, in a sequence heterologous to HBc from position 164, or preferably from position 156, to the C-terminus.

It is preferred that Domain IV contain up to fourteen residues of an HBc sequence from position 136 through position 149 peptide-bonded to residue 135; i.e., an HBc sequence that begins with the residue of position 136 that can continue through position 149. Thus, if the residue of position 148 is present, so is the sequence of residues of positions 136 through 147, or if residue 141 is present, so is the sequence of residues of positions 136 through 140.

Domain IV can also contain zero to three cysteine residues and those Cys residues are present within about 30 residues of the carboxy-terminus (C-terminus) of the chimer molecule. Preferably, one cysteine (Cys) residue is present, and that Cys is preferably present as the carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) residue, unless an influenza T cell epitope is present as part of Domain IV. When such a T cell epitope is present, the preferred Cys is preferably within the C-terminal last five residues of the HBc chimer.

The presence of the above-discussed N-terminal cysteine residue(s) provides an unexpected enhancement of the ability of the chimer molecules to form stable immunogenic particles (discussed hereinafter). Thus, a contemplated HBc chimer immunogen tends to form particles that stay together upon collection and initial purification as measured by analytical size exclusion chromatography, whose details are discussed hereinafter.

The contemplated particles can also be more stable to decomposition at 37° C. after aging than are similar chimer particles lacking that cysteine residue. This latter type of enhanced stability can be measured using 15 percent SDS-PAGE gels with particles dispersed in sample buffer (reducing). Gels are stained using Coomassie Blue, and then analyzed. This type of stability is believed to be exhibited against hydrolysis, whereas the stability determined by size exclusion chromatography is that of initial particle formation.

Particles that additionally contain one or more C-terminal cysteine residues exhibit enhanced stability in formation and also toward decomposition on aging, with some particles containing both N- and C-terminal cysteines usually exhibiting greater stability in either measure than those particles having only an added cysteine at either the N- or C-terminus.

Domain IV contains fewer than four arginine or lysine residues, or mixtures thereof adjacent to each other. Arginine and lysines are present in the C-terminal region of HBc that extends from position 156 through the C-terminus of the native molecule. That region is sometimes referred to as the “protamine” or “arginine-rich” region of the molecule and binds nucleic acids. A contemplated HBc chimer molecule and particle are substantially free of bound nucleic acids.

The substantial freedom of nucleic acid binding can be readily determined by a comparison of the absorbance of the particles in aqueous solution measured at both 280 and 260 nm; i.e., a 280/260 absorbance ratio. The contemplated particles do not bind substantially to nucleic acids that are oligomeric and/or polymeric DNA and RNA species originally present in the cells of the organism used to express the protein. Such nucleic acids exhibit an absorbance at 260 nm and relatively less absorbance at 280 nm, whereas a protein such as a contemplated chimer absorbs relatively less at 260 nm and has a greater absorbance at 280 nm.

Thus, recombinantly expressed HBc particles or chimeric HBc particles that contain the arginine-rich sequence at residue positions 150-183 (or 150-185) exhibit a ratio of absorbance at 280 nm to absorbance at 260 nm (280:260 absorbance ratio) of about 0.8, whereas particles free of the arginine-rich nucleic acid binding region of naturally occurring HBc such as those that contain fewer than four arginine or lysine residues or mixtures thereof adjacent to each other, or those having a native or chimeric sequence that ends at about HBc residue position 140 to position 149, exhibit a 280:260 absorbance ratio of about 1.2 to about 1.6.

Chimeric HBc particles of the present invention are substantially free of nucleic acid binding and exhibit a 280:260 absorbance ratio of about 1.2 to about 1.7, and more typically, about 1.4 to about 1.6. This range is due in large part to the number of aromatic amino acid residues present in Domains II and IV of a given chimeric HBc particle. That range is also in part due to the presence of the Cys in Domain IV of a contemplated chimer, whose presence can diminish the observed ratio by about 0.1 for a reason that is presently unknown.

The contemplated chimer HBc particles are more stable in aqueous buffer at 37° C. over a time period of about two weeks to about one month than are particles formed from a HBc chimer containing the same peptide-linked Domain II, III and IV sequences and an otherwise same Domain I sequence in which the one to three cysteine residues [N-terminal cysteine residue(s)] are absent or a single N-terminal residue present is replaced by another residue such as an alanine residue.

Thus, for example, particles containing an influenza A M2e polypeptide in Domain I [e.g. ICC-1590 particles] that include two cysteine residues are more stable than otherwise identical particles [ICC-1603 particles] assembled from chimer molecules whose N-terminal M2 variant sequence contains serine residues in place of the cysteines. Similarly, particles containing the above serine-containing influenza B cell epitopes in Domain I and a single cysteine at the C-terminus [ICC-1605 particles] are more stable than are otherwise identical particles in which that cysteine is absent, but are less stable than are the particles containing the two N-terminal cysteines, ICC-1590 particles or those particles that contained both N-terminal and C-terminal cysteines [ICC-1604 particles].

It is noted that particles and the chimer molecules of which they are constituted are interchangeably referred to by the prefix “ICC-”, or the prefix-“CV-” followed by a four-digit number, or by just a four-digit number without a prefix. Thus, the above ICC-1590 particles could also be referred to as CV-1590 particles or just as 1590 particles. Each designation has the same meaning.

A contemplated particle containing a N-terminal cysteine residue is also typically prepared in greater yield than is a particle assembled from a chimer molecule lacking a N-terminal cysteine.

Although the T cell help afforded by HBc is highly effective in enhancing antibody responses (i.e. B cell-mediated) to ‘carried’ immunogenic sequences following vaccination, HBc does not activate influenza-specific T cells, except in restricted individuals for whom a B cell epitope containing sequence also contains a T cell epitope. To help ensure universal priming of influenza-specific T helper cells, in addition to B cells, one or more influenza-specific T helper epitopes is preferably incorporated into a contemplated immunogen and is located in Domain IV of the immunogen.

A plurality of the above or another T cell epitopes can be present in Domain IV or another B cell epitope can be present. In preferred practice, Domain IV has up to about 50 residues in a sequence heterologous to HBc. More preferably, that sequence is up to about 25 residues and includes a T cell epitope.

Because M2 is expressed abundantly by infected cells, it has the potential to serve as a target for influenza-specific CTL activity. The extracellular domain is a possible attachment site for antibody, which may function to immobilize the function of M2, in an analogous manner to the therapeutic drug amantadine, or via the activation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).

Indeed, the extracellular domain of M2 has been shown to contain at least two distinct human CTL epitopes, one at 7-15 [Jameson et al., (1998) J. Virol., 72(11):8682-8689] and another at 3-11 [Gianfrani er al., (2000) Hum. Immunol., 61(5):438-352]. Anti-M2e mediated lysis of influenza-infected cells via ADCC and/or CDC may be the preferred mechanisms of target cell lysis, compared with CTL, because, unlike CTL, they are not subject to MHC restriction. Therefore, an ability to evoke sufficient titers of anti-M2 antibodies displaying a required IgG subclass profile, and M2e specificity, should evoke broad protection across diverse populations.

The capacity of antibodies to the extracellular domain of M2 to have a biological effect was first described by Zebedee and Lamb, who showed-that the monoclonal anti-M2 antibody 14C2 slows the growth of the virus in culture [Zebedee et al, (1988) J Virol, 62(8):2762-2772]. In 1990, Treanor and colleagues showed that the same monoclonal antibody successfully inhibited influenza A virus replication in mice [Treanor et al., (1990) J. Virol., 64(3):1375-1377]. Palladino et al. determined that 14C2 was not virus neutralizing in vivo, but did bind infected cells and inhibited virus growth in vitro; however, it failed to cure the infection [Palladino et al., (1995) J. Virol., 69(4):2075-2081]. The authors of the latter paper duly noted that 14C2 is an IgG1 subclass antibody, and that IgG2a and IgG2b are most effective at fixing complement; they are also superior to IgG1 for binding to FcγRIII receptors on NK cells. Indeed, as is shown hereinafter, high titers of IgG2a antibodies in the mouse, which are typical of a TH1 immune response, appear to correlate with protection. An immune response that can provide anti-M2e mediated lysis of influenza-infected cells via ADCC and/or CDC is thus a preferred response.

Anamnestic anti-M2 responses have repeatedly been observed following challenge of mice previously immunized with HBc-M2 particles, which is indicative of M2e-HBc particles priming M2-specific T cells. To investigate this, preliminary studies were conducted to investigate whether lymphocytes from immunized mice can be recalled by M2e peptide, in vitro. Significant increases in the number of interferon-gamma secreting cells was observed following recall with peptides derived from M2, HBc p85-100, and recombinant HBcAg, but not p100-120 from HBc. The recall with HBcAg was most prominent, which is expected since this is a potent T cell immunogen containing many functional T cell epitopes for BALB/c mice [Saito et al., (2001) Vaccine, 20(1-2):125-133].

Recall with all antigens appeared to be stronger for lymphocytes isolated from mice immunized with ICC-1604 particles versus ICC-1569 particles. This result indicates that ICC-1604 particles may be a superior T cell immunogen compared with to ICC-1569 particles. However, it is important to note that the M2 recall antigen for these studies was M2e (2-24), which contains cysteine residues at 17 and 19, and was therefore only truly homologous for ICC-1604 particles and not ICC-1569 particles, because the latter contains serine residues in place of the two cysteines residues.

The reduced level of restimulation with M2e for ICC-1569 particles versus ICC-1604 particle-immunized mice could be explained if the cysteine residues at positions 17 and/or 19 are components of one or more T cell epitope(s). However, the presence of cysteine residue-containing T cell epitopes does not explain the reduced level of restimulation with HBc-derived antigens.

The observation of an anamnestic response, with regard to anti-M2e titers, following viral challenge of M2e-HBc-immunized mice, appears to indicate the presence of at least one T-helper cell epitope in the M2e domain (positions 2-24).

Th epitopes derived from the influenza nucleoprotein (NP 206-229), which is broadly reactive in humans (HLA-DR1, HLA-DR2, HLA-DRw13) [Brett et al., (1991) J. Immunol., 147(3):984-991] and also functional in BALB/c mice are contemplated for use as T cell epitopes herein. Particles with this epitope fused to the C-terminus of HBc particles have been expressed and purified. Additional influenza Th epitopes are also considered, such as NP 341-362, NP 297-318 and NP 182-205 [Brett et al., (1991) J. Immunol., 147(3):984-991]; these sequences can ultimately be linked in series at the C-terminus of the M2e-expressing particle. These illustrative sequences are provided below.

A contemplated recombinant HBc chimer molecule is typically present and is used in an immunogen or vaccine as a self-assembled particle. These particles are comprised of 180 to 240 chimer molecules that separate into protein molecules in the presence of disulfide reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol and denaturing reagents such as SDS. The individual molecules are bound together into the particle by protein-protein interactions, and these interactions are stabilized by the presence of disulfide bonds. These particles are similar to the particles observed in patients infected with HBV, but these particles are non-infectious. Upon expression in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts, the individual recombinant HBc chimer molecules assemble in the host into particles that can be readily harvested from the host cells.

In addition to the before-discussed N- and C-truncations and insertion of influenza M2 polypeptide epitopes, a contemplated chimer molecule can also contain conservative substitutions in the amino acid residues that constitute HBc Domains I, II, III and IV. Conservative substitutions are as defined before.

More rarely, a “nonconservative” change, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan is contemplated. Analogous minor variations can also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues can be substituted, inserted, or deleted without abolishing biological activity can be found using computer programs well known in the art, for example LASERGENE software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, Wis.)

The HBc portion of a chimer molecule of the present invention [the portion having the HBc sequence that has other than a sequence of an added epitope, or heterologous residue(s) that are a restriction enzyme artifact] most preferably has the amino acid residue sequence at positions 2 through 149 of subtype ayw that is shown in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO:1), when present. Somewhat less preferred are the corresponding amino acid residue sequences of subtypes adw, adw2 and adyw that are also shown in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NOs:2, 3 and 4). Less preferred still are the sequences of woodchuck and ground squirrel at aligned positions 2 through 149 that are the last two sequences of FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NOs:5 and 6). As noted elsewhere, portions of different sequences from different mammalian HBc proteins can be used together in a single chimer.

When the HBC portion of a chimer molecule of the present invention has other than a sequence of a mammalian HBc molecule at positions 2 through 156 or through position 149, when present, because one or more conservative substitutions has been made, it is preferred that no more than 10 percent, and more preferably no more than 5 percent, and most preferably no more than 3 percent of the amino acid residues are substituted as compared to SEQ ID NO:1 from position 2 through 149 or 156. A contemplated chimer of 149 HBc residues can therefore contain up to about 15 or 16 residues that are different from those of SEQ ID NO:1 at positions 2 through 149, and preferably about 7 or 8 residues. More preferably, up to about 5 residues are different from the ayw sequence (SEQ ID NO:1) at residue positions 2-149. Where an HBc sequence is truncated further at one or both termini, the number of substituted residues is proportionally different. Deletions elsewhere in the molecule are considered conservative substitutions for purposes of calculation so that if, for example, Domain I were to have a C-terminus at position 133 instead of 135, two residues (134 and 135) would be presumed to be present for purposes of calculation.

Chimer Preparation

A contemplated chimeric immunogen is prepared using the well-known techniques of recombinant DNA technology. Thus, sequences of nucleic acid that encode particular polypeptide sequences are added and deleted from the precursor sequence that encodes HBV.

A contemplated chimeric immunogen typically utilizes a cysteine residue present in the M2 sequence as the N-terminal cysteine. Primers for the preparation of such chimer molecules by in vitro mutagenesis of a polynucleotide encoding an HBc molecule are discussed hereinafter. When a cysteine-containing M2 polypeptide epitope is not present at the N-terminus, the N-terminal cysteine can be provided by in vitro mutagenesis using a primer that encodes just a cysteine-containing portion of the M2 polypeptide or a simple N-terminal start sequence such as Met-Cys- or Met-Gly-Cys-.

As was noted previously, the HBc immunodominant loop is usually recited as being located at about positions 75 through 85 from the amino-terminus (N-terminus) of the intact protein. The influenza A M2 B cell epitope-containing sequence can be placed into that immunodominant loop sequence of Domain II. That placement substantially eliminates the HBc immunogenicity and antigenicity of the HBc loop sequence, while presenting the influenza A M2 B cell epitope in an extremely immunogenic position in the assembled chimer particles.

One of two well-known strategies is particularly useful for placing the influenza A M2 B cell sequence into the loop sequence at a desired location such as between residues 78 and 79. A first, less successful strategy is referred to as replacement in which DNA that codes for a portion of the loop is excised and replaced with DNA that encodes an influenza A M2 B cell sequence. The second strategy is referred to as insertion in which an influenza A M2 B cell sequence is inserted between adjacent residues in the loop.

Site-directed mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used in one exemplary replacement approach to provide a chimeric HBc DNA sequence that encodes a pair of different restriction sites, e.g. EcoRI and SacI, one near each end of the immunodominant loop-encoding DNA. Exemplary residues replaced are 76 through 81. The loop-encoding section is excised, an influenza A M2 B cell epitope-encoding sequence flanked on each side by appropriate HBc sequence residues is ligated into the restriction sites and the resulting DNA is used to express the HBc chimer. See, for example, Table 2 of Pumpens et al., (1995) Intervirology, 38:63-74 for exemplary uses of a similar technique.

Alternatively, a single restriction site or two sites can be encoded into the region, the DNA cut with a restriction enzyme(s) to provide “sticky” or ends, and an appropriate sticky- or blunt-ended heterologous DNA segment ligated into the cut region. Examples of this type of sequence replacement into HBc can be found in the work reported in Schodel et al., (1991) F. Brown et al. eds., Vaccines 91, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., pp. 319-325, Schodel et al., Behring Inst. Mitt., 1997(98):114-119 and Schodel et al., J. Exp. Med., (1994) 180(3): p. 1037-4, the latter two papers discussing the preparation of vaccines against malarial pathogens P. yoelii and P. berghei, respectively. A replacement strategy that results in a net removal of residues from the immunodominant loop is usually not used herein.

Insertion is preferred. In an illustrative example of the insertion strategy, site-directed mutagenesis is used to create two restriction sites adjacent to each other and between codons encoding adjacent amino acid residues, such as those at residue positions 78 and 79. This technique adds twelve base pairs that encode four amino acid residues (two for each restriction site) between formerly adjacent residues in the HBc loop.

Upon cleavage with the restriction enzymes, ligation of the DNA coding for the illustrative influenza A M2 sequence and expression of the DNA to form HBc chimers, the HBc loop amino acid sequence is seen to be interrupted on its N-terminal side by the two residues encoded by the 5′ restriction site, followed toward the C-terminus by the influenza A M2 B-cell epitope sequence, followed by two more heterologous, non-loop residues encoded by the 3′ restriction site and then the rest of the loop sequence. This same strategy is also preferably used for insertion into Domain IV of a T cell epitope or one or more cysteine residues that are not a part of a T cell epitope. A similar strategy using an insertion between residues 82 and 83 is reported in Schoedel et al., (1990) F. Brown et al. eds., Vaccines 90, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., pp. 193-198.

For example, a DNA sequence that encodes a C-terminal truncated HBc sequence (HBc149) is engineered to contain adjacent EcoRI and SacI sites between residues 78 and 79. Cleavage of that DNA with both enzymes provides one fragment that encodes HBc positions 1-78 3′-terminated with an EcoRI sticky end, whereas the other fragment has a 5′-terminal SacI sticky end and encodes residues of positions 79-149. Ligation of a synthetic nucleic acid having a 5′ AATT overhang followed by a sequence that encodes a desired influenza A M2 B cell epitope and a AGCT 3′overhang provides a HBc chimer sequence that encodes that B cell epitope flanked on each side by two heterologous residues (GI and EL, respectively) between residues 78 and 79, while destroying the EcoRI site and preserving the SacI site.

A similar strategy can be used for insertion of a C-terminal cysteine-containing sequence. Here, EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites are engineered in to the HBc DNA sequence after amino acid residue position 149. After digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, a synthetic DNA having the above AATT 5′overhang followed by a T cell epitope-encoding sequence, a stop codon and a 3′ AGCT overhang were ligated into the digested sequence to form a sequence that encoded HBc residues 1-149 followed by two heterologous residues (GI), the stop codon and the HindIII site.

PCR amplification using a forward primer having a SacI restriction site followed by a sequence encoding HBc beginning at residue position 79, followed by digestion with SacI and HindIII provided a sequence encoding HBc positions 79-149 plus the two added residues and the T cell epitope at the C-terminus. Digestion of that construct with SacI and ligation provides the complete gene encoding a desired recombinant HBc chimer immunogen having the sequence, from the N-terminus, of HBc positions 1-78, two added residues, the influenza A M2-sequence containing B cell epitopes, two added residues, HBc positions 79-149, two added residues, and the T cell epitope.

It is noted that the preferred use of two heterologous residues on either side of (flanking) a heterologous immunogenic sequence containing B cell or T cell epitopes is a matter of convenience. As a consequence, one can also use zero to three or more added residues that are not part of the HBc sequence on either or both sides of an inserted sequence. One or both ends of the insert and HBc nucleic acid can be “chewed back” with an appropriate nuclease (e.g. S1 nuclease) to provide blunt ends that can be ligated together. Added heterologous residues that are neither part of the inserted B cell or T cell epitopes nor a part of the HBc sequence are not counted in the number of residues present in a recited Domain.

It is also noted that one can also synthesize all or a part of a desired recombinant HBc chimer nucleic acid using well-known synthetic methods as is discussed and illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,472 for the synthesis of the 177 base pair DNA that encodes the 59 residue ribulose bis-phosphate carboxylase-oxygenase signal peptide of Nicotiana tabacum. For example, one can synthesize Domains I and II with a blunt or “sticky” end that can be ligated to Domains III and IV to provide a construct that expresses a contemplated HBc chimer that contains zero added residues to the N-terminal side of the B cell epitope and zero to three added residues on the C-terminal side or at the Domain II/III junction or at some other desired location.

A nucleic acid sequence (segment) that encodes a previously described HBc chimer molecule or a complement of that coding sequence is also contemplated herein. Such a nucleic acid segment is present in isolated and purified form in some preferred embodiments.

In living organisms, the amino acid residue sequence of a protein or polypeptide is directly related via the genetic code to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence of the gene that codes for the protein. Thus, through the well-known degeneracy of the genetic code additional DNAs and corresponding RNA sequences (nucleic acids) can be prepared as desired that encode the same chimer amino acid residue sequences, but are sufficiently different from a before-discussed gene sequence that the two sequences do not hybridize at high stringency, but do hybridize at moderate stringency.

High stringency conditions can be defined as comprising hybridization at a temperature of about 50°-55° C. in 6×SSC and a final wash at a temperature of 68° C. in 1-3×SSC. Moderate stringency conditions comprise hybridization at a temperature of about 50° C. to about 65° C. in 0.2 to 0.3 M NaCl, followed by washing at about 50° C. to about 55° C. in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate).

A nucleic sequence (DNA sequence or an RNA sequence) that (1) itself encodes, or its complement encodes, a chimer molecule whose HBc portion from residue position 1 through 136, when present, is that of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and (2) hybridizes with a DNA sequence of SEQ ID NOs:43, 44, 45, 46, 47 or 48 at least at moderate stringency (discussed above); and (3) whose HBc sequence shares at least 80 percent, and more preferably at least 90 percent, and even more preferably at least 95 percent, and most preferably 100 percent identity with a DNA sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 and 48, is defined as a DNA variant sequence. As is well-known, a nucleic acid sequence such as a contemplated nucleic acid sequence is expressed when operatively linked to an appropriate promoter in an appropriate expression system as discussed elsewhere herein.

An analog or analogous nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) sequence that encodes a contemplated chimer molecule is also contemplated as part of this invention. A chimer analog nucleic acid sequence or its complementary nucleic acid sequence encodes a HBc amino acid residue sequence that is at least 80 percent, and more preferably at least 90 percent, and most preferably is at least 95 percent identical to the HBc sequence portion from residue position 1 through residue position 136 shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. This DNA or RNA is referred to herein as an “analog of” or “analogous to” a sequence of a nucleic acid of SEQ ID NOs: 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 and 48, and hybridizes with the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 and 48 or their complements herein under moderate stringency hybridization conditions. A nucleic acid that encodes an analogous sequence, upon suitable transfection and expression, also produces a contemplated chimer.

Different hosts often have preferences for a particular codon to be used for encoding a particular amino acid residue. Such codon preferences are well known and a DNA sequence encoding a desired chimer sequence can be altered, using in vitro mutagenesis for example, so that host-preferred codons are utilized for a particular host in which the enzyme is to be expressed. In addition, one can also use the degeneracy of the genetic code to encode the HBc portion of a sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 that avoids substantial identity with a DNA of SEQ ID Nos: 43, 44, 45,46, 47 or 48 or their complements. Thus, a useful analogous DNA sequence need not hybridize with the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 or 48 or a complement under conditions of moderate stringency, but can still provide a contemplated chimer molecule.

A recombinant nucleic acid molecule such as a DNA molecule, comprising a vector operatively linked to an exogenous nucleic acid segment (e.g., a DNA segment or sequence) that defines a gene that encodes a contemplated chimer, as discussed above, and a promoter suitable for driving the expression of the gene in a compatible host organism, is also contemplated in this invention. More particularly, also contemplated is a recombinant DNA molecule that comprises a vector comprising a promoter for driving the expression of the chimer in host organism cells operatively linked to a DNA segment that defines a gene for the HBc portion of a chimer or a DNA variant that has at least 90 percent identity to the chimer gene of SEQ ID NOs: 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 or 48 and hybridizes with that gene under moderate stringency conditions.

Further contemplated is a recombinant DNA molecule that comprises a vector containing a promoter for driving the expression of a chimer in host organism cells operatively linked to a DNA segment that is an analog nucleic acid sequence that encodes an amino acid residue sequence of a HBc chimer portion that is at least 80 percent identical, more preferably 90 percent identical, and most preferably 95 percent identical to the HBc portion of a sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. That recombinant DNA molecule, upon suitable transfection and expression in a host cell, provides a contemplated chimer molecule.

It is noted that because of the 30 amino acid residue N-terminal sequence of ground squirrel HBc does not align with any of the other HBc sequences, that sequence and its encoding nucleic acid sequences and their complements are not included in the above percentages of identity, nor are the portions of nucleic acid that encode that 30-residue sequence or its complement used in hybridization determinations. Similarly, sequences that are truncated at either or both of the HBc N- and C-termini are not included in identity calculations, nor are those sequences in which residues of the immunodominant loop are removed for insertion of a heterologous epitope. Thus, only those HBc-encoding bases or HBc sequence residues that are present in a chimer molecule are included and compared to an aligned nucleic acid or amino acid residue sequence in the identity percentage calculations.

Inasmuch as the coding sequences for the gene disclosed herein is illustrated in SEQ ID NOs: 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 and 48, isolated nucleic acid segments, preferably DNA sequences, variants and analogs thereof can be prepared by in vitro mutagenesis, as is well known in the art and discussed in Current Protocols In Molecular Biology, Ausabel et al. eds., John Wiley & Sons (New York: 1987) p. 8.1.1-8.1.6, that begin at the initial ATG codon for a gene and end at or just downstream of the stop codon for each gene. Thus, a desired restriction site can be engineered at or upstream of the initiation codon, and at or downstream of the stop codon so that other genes can be prepared, excised and isolated.

As is well known in the art, so long as the required nucleic acid, illustratively DNA sequence, is present, (including start and stop signals), additional base pairs can usually be present at either end of the segment and that segment can still be utilized to express the protein. This, of course, presumes the absence in the segment of an operatively linked DNA sequence that represses expression, expresses a further product that consumes the enzyme desired to be expressed, expresses a product that consumes a wanted reaction product produced by that desired enzyme, or otherwise interferes with expression of the gene of the DNA segment.

Thus, so long as the DNA segment is free of such interfering DNA sequences, a DNA segment of the invention can be about 500 to about 15,000 base pairs in length. The maximum size of a recombinant DNA molecule, particularly an expression vector, is governed mostly by convenience and the vector size that can be accommodated by a host cell, once all of the minimal DNA sequences required for replication and expression, when desired, are present. Minimal vector sizes are well known. Such long DNA segments are not preferred, but can be used.

DNA segments that encode the before-described chimer can be synthesized by chemical techniques, for example, the phosphotriester method of Matteucci et al. (1981) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 103:3185. of course, by chemically synthesizing the coding sequence, any desired modifications can be made simply by substituting the appropriate bases for those encoding the native amino acid residue sequence. However, DNA segments including sequences discussed previously are preferred.

A contemplated HBc chimer can be produced (expressed) in a number of transformed host systems, typically host cells although expression in acellular, in vitro, systems is also contemplated. These host cellular systems include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage, plasmid, or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeast transformed with yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems infected with virus expression vectors (e.g. baculovirus); plant cell systems transformed with virus expression vectors (e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus; tobacco mosaic virus) or with bacterial expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid); or appropriately transformed animal cell systems such as CHO or COS cells. The invention is not limited by the host cell employed.

DNA segments containing a gene encoding the HBc chimer are preferably obtained from recombinant DNA molecules (plasmid vectors) containing that gene. Vectors capable of directing the expression of a chimer gene into the protein of a HBc chimer is referred to herein as an “expression vector”.

An expression vector contains expression control elements including the promoter. The chimer-coding gene is operatively linked to the expression vector to permit the promoter sequence to direct RNA polymerase binding and expression of the chimer-encoding gene. Useful in expressing the polypeptide coding gene are promoters that are inducible, viral, synthetic, constitutive as described by Poszkowski et al. (1989) EMBO J., 3:2719 and Odell et al. (1985) Nature, 313:810, as well as temporally regulated, spatially regulated, and spatiotemporally regulated as given in Chua et al. (1989) Science, 244:174-181.

One preferred promoter for use in prokaryotic cells such as E. coli is the Rec 7 promoter that is inducible by exogenously supplied nalidixic acid. A more preferred promoter is present in plasmid vector JHEX25 (available from Promega) that is inducible by exogenously supplied isopropyl-β-D-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG). A still more preferred promoter, the tac promoter, is present in plasmid vector pKK223-3 and is also inducible by exogenously supplied IPTG. The pKK223-3 plasmid can be successfully expressed in a number of E. coli strains, such as XL-1, TB1, BL21 and BLR, using about 25 to about 100 μM IPTG for induction. Surprisingly, concentrations of about 25 to about 50 μM IPTG have been found to provide optimal results in 2 L shaker flasks and fermentors.

Expression of a contemplated chimer molecule in other microbes such as Salmonella like S. typhi and S. typhimurium and S. typhimurium-E. coli hybrids, yeasts such as S. cerivisiae or Pichia pastoris, in mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, in both monocot and dicot plant cells generally and particularly in dicot plant storage organs such as a root, seed or fruit as where an oral vaccine or inoculum is desired, and in insect cells such as those of S. Frugiperda cells or Trichoplusia by use of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) or baculovirus are discussed in detail in the before-noted parental application as well as in published WO 02/14478 A2. These modes of expression, although contemplated, will therefore not be discussed further herein.

A variety of methods have been developed to operatively link DNA to vectors via complementary cohesive termini or blunt ends. For instance, complementary homopolymer tracts can be added to the DNA segment to be inserted into the vector DNA. The vector and DNA segment are then joined by hydrogen bonding between the complementary homopolymeric tails to form recombinant DNA molecules.

Alternatively, synthetic linkers containing one or more restriction endonuclease sites can be used to join the DNA segment to the expression vector, as noted before. The synthetic linkers are attached to blunt-ended DNA segments by incubating the blunt-ended DNA segments with a large excess of synthetic linker molecules in the presence of an enzyme that is able to catalyze the ligation of blunt-ended DNA molecules, such as bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase.

Thus, the products of the reaction are DNA segments carrying synthetic linker sequences at their ends. These DNA segments are then cleaved with the appropriate restriction endonuclease and ligated into an expression vector that has been cleaved with an enzyme that produces termini compatible with those of the synthetic linker. Synthetic linkers containing a variety of restriction endonuclease sites are commercially available from a number of sources including New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass. A desired DNA segment can also be obtained using PCR technology in which the forward and reverse primers contain desired restriction sites that can be cut after amplification so that the gene can be inserted into the vector. Alternatively PCR products can be directly cloned into vectors containing T-overhangs (Promega Corp., A3600, Madison, Wis.) as is well known in the art.

The expressed chimeric protein self-assembles into particles within the host cells, whether in single cells or in cells within a multicelled host. The particle-containing cells are harvested using standard procedures, and the cells are lysed using a French pressure cell, lysozyme, sonicator, bead beater or a microfluidizer (Microfluidics International Corp., Newton Mass.). After clarification of the lysate, particles are precipitated with 45% ammonium sulfate, resuspended in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8 and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed material is clarified by brief centrifugation and the supernatant subjected to gel filtration chromatography using Sepharose® CL-4B. Particle-containing fractions are identified, subjected to hydroxyapatite chromatography, and reprecipitated with ammonium sulfate prior to resuspension, dialysis and sterile filtration and storage at −70° C.

Inocula and Vaccines

A before-described recombinant HBc chimer immunogen preferably in particulate form is dissolved or dispersed in an immunogenic effective amount in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle composition that is preferably aqueous to form an inoculum or vaccine. When administered to a host animal in need of immunization or in which antibodies are desired to be induced such as a mammal (e.g., a mouse, dog, goat, sheep, horse, bovine, monkey, ape, or human) or bird (e.g., a chicken, turkey, duck or goose), an inoculum induces antibodies that immunoreact with an influenza A M2 B cell epitope present in the immunogen. In a vaccine, those induced antibodies also believed to immunoreact in vivo with (bind to) the virus or virally-infected cells and protect the host from a pathogenic influenza infection. A composition that is a vaccine in one animal can be an inoculum for another host, as where the antibodies are induced in a second host that is not infected by influenza A.

The amount of recombinant HBc chimer immunogen utilized in each immunization is referred to as an immunogenic effective amount and can vary widely, depending inter alia, upon the recombinant HBc chimer immunogen, animal host immunized, and the presence of an adjuvant in the v
