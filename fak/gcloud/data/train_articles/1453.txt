Crist says he wants a third special session
TALLAHASSEE â€” Legislators are likely to be called into their third special session of the year in September to revisit two insurance issues that didn't get fixed this spring and make emergency repairs to the state budget, Gov. Charlie Crist said Wednesday.

Crist isn't ready to say when he would call legislators back to Tallahassee, but he emphasized that he would "view favorably a special session before Oct. 1" - the expiration day for a state law that requires Florida drivers to buy personal injury protection insurance policies.

Besides tackling auto insurance, Crist said the Legislature may need to upgrade the state's KidCare health insurance program and revamp Florida's $70 billion budget. The budget work is needed because tax revenues, in the midst of an economic slowdown, have slumped drastically beneath expectations.

``We may have some lower estimates coming to us related to the budget," Crist said. ``We're trying to kick start the economy. ... But until we get there, it's a little tight right now."

Legislators have worked 70 days in Tallahassee this year, including a January special session on homeowner insurance and an early-June special session on property taxes.

And while special sessions costs taxpayers roughly $40,000 a day, Crist and legislative leaders hope to minimize costs by scheduling the next session when legislators would otherwise be at the Capitol attending committee meetings. Crist can call a special session on his own or legislative leaders can agree to do so.

A host of issues could surface, South Florida lawmakers say. But Crist said that as far as he's concerned, the No.1 issue for a special session deals with keeping alive Florida's decades-old personal injury protection law. The law requires drivers to carry $10,000 in personal injury protection insurance. It also restricts a person's right to sue, in many circumstances, if injured in an accident.
