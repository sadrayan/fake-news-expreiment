Adolf Hitler: Hitler’s Orders
Why is it unlikely that Hitler ever signed an order for the extermination of the Jews?

Secrecy and destruction of documents:

Hitler and the Nazi regime were secretive about the murder of the Jews. Hitler didn’t want to leave a trail of evidence that would inflame his own population or the leadership of other countries. On October 4, 1943, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, gave a speech at Poznan (Posen, Poland) to a meeting of SS Major Generals. Here, he acknowledged how secret the ‘Final Solution’ was: “We will never speak of it publicly . . . I mean the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish race. The Jewish race is being exterminated—that is clear, it’s in our program–elimination of the Jews and we’re doing it, exterminating them . . . This is a page of glory in our history which has never been written and is never to be written . . .”[4]

Aside from the secrecy, Nazi officials ordered that any evidence of the Final Solution be destroyed as the Allies marched toward the German heartland. Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz-Birkenau, wrote after the war that Adolf Eichmann (and his deputy Günther), “were the only ones who had the necessary information to calculate the total number of Jews annihilated. According to the orders given by Himmler, all information concerning the number of victims involved was to be burned after each action at Auschwitz . . . I personally destroyed every bit of evidence which could be found in my office. The other department heads did the same.”[5]
