Obama funneled $350,000 federal funds to anti-Likud One Voice Movement and Victory 15
Obama has been sending tax payer dollars, at least $350,000 to fund anti-LIkud, anti Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election. Obama has sent the money and resoures to One Voice Movement and Victory 15 groups in Israel. If the Israelis are stupid enough to go left in the election, then that’s their own fault. The fact that the election is even supposed to be close is pathetic. Hey Israel, Never Again?
