Listen to the The Trevor Carey Show Episode - John Cox, California Gubernatorial Candidate, Answers Questions from Callers on iHeartRadio
My Dad had me in radio production rooms starting at age ten, so being on-air has always come natural to me. I've been a music DJ all over the U.S. including Phoenix, Denver, Kansas City, San Jose and Buffalo. I even ran some of the top Billboard artists as a record rep with Sony Music, but I realized being on the radio as a talk show host is what I was created to do. Conservatives, liberals, atheists, vegetarians, vegans, gay, straight, sideways; even Giant fans, born and raised as a Dodgers fan, you will have a voice on the Trevor Carey Show and will never be shouted down. Let's get together and continue this great experiment called the United States of America. God bless you, and God bless America.
