Ghost pepper burns a 1-inch hole in man’s esophagus
A man who ate ghost peppers in a contest was left with a 1-inch hole in his esophagus, spent weeks in the hospital and required a feeding tube, according to a research report.

The unlucky 47-year-old began retching and vomiting after eating a hamburger topped with “ghost pepper puree,” according to a report by the Journal of Emergency Medicine.

After six large glasses of water didn’t help, the man experience chest and abdominal pain and decided to call for help, according to the report.

The man was hospitalized with a spontaneous esophageal rupture, known as Boerhaave syndrome.

He spent 23 days in the hospital — and only began tolerating liquids on the 17th day of his hospital stay.

Ghost peppers, also known as the bhut jolokia pepper, have a Scoville heat unit rating of more than one million, more than twice the strength of a habanero pepper.

The report’s authors noted the popularity of food challenges on social media, including the “cinnamon challenge.”

“This case serves as an important reminder of a potentially life-threatening surgical emergency that was initially interpreted as discomfort after a large spicy meal,” the researchers wrote.
