Trump doubles down on inflammatory comments
Washington (CNN) Presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled-down on the idea that Mexican "rapists" are crossing the United States' southern border -- and that "terrorists" could soon follow.

In an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, Trump -- suddenly surging in the Republican race in New Hampshire -- said that Mexicans were sending its worst citizens over the border and that the U.S. was becoming a "dumping ground" for these discards.

"Some are good and some are rapists and some are killers. We don't even know what we're getting," Trump said when asked if he regretted his comments at his announcement event in New York last week.

"The United States is like a dumping ground for the world's problems," he said. "You're probably going to have terrorists coming from the Middle East. Somebody said 'Oh, we don't have terrorists.' They don't even know, because they don't know who's coming because we have this open border."
