Ancaster home vandalized after city-owned tree chopped down
An Ancaster woman says she feels threatened after she woke up to find her home covered in "disturbing" graffiti.

Workers had been at her Lover's Lane property Thursday to cut down a city-owned tree that was old and rotting, said Ann Marie, who doesn't want her last name used out of fear of retaliation.

"The branches were breaking, and it was clearly a safety issue," she said Friday.

Now, pink-glitter spray paint is plastered all over the front of her home, reading, "I should burn this house" and "This tree is worth 10,000 of you," among other profanities. Hearts were also spray-painted on pieces of the tree trunk that were collected Friday, Ann Marie said.

"It's everywhere," she said. "They didn't miss a spot. The stone, the concrete, the stucco, my door. Everything."

At this point, Ann Marie said she hadn't thought about whether she plans to hire someone to remove the spray paint or do so herself.

The process to remove the tree, which was on the left side of the home's driveway, began about six months ago when the city said it was looking at taking it down, Ann Marie said.

Last week, crews came to remove some branches, before cutting it all down Thursday, she said.

"It wasn't us that took that tree down," said Ann Marie, who moved into the house a few months ago with her husband. "I love trees. I don't want to take trees down, but if there's a safety issue, you have to look at risk-benefit."

City spokesperson Jasmine Graham confirmed the tree was city-owned and that it was cut down after being deemed a hazard.
