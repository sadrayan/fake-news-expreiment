Vero Beach resident Kris Mister looked past the price tag as he carted two sheets of plywood away from a long line of empty shelves Tuesday at the Home Depot in Vero Beach.

The only plywood he could find, for shuttering his windows, were furniture grade, costing $50 a sheet.

He took what he could get. It's much the same across the Treasure Coast, as people prepare for the possible strike of Hurricane Irma, which was a Category 5 storm Tuesday.

As he left, others searched for plywood and more. ​​​​​​

Flashlights and batteries, water, gasoline cans, outdoor grills and plywood are in strong demand, along with propane.

About 30 people on Tuesday afternoon stood in front of the B&A Flea Market in Martin County waiting for propane.

At 4 p.m., the last person in line was informed he would be the last person that day to fill his tank.

Robert Pettinato, the second to last in line, said he’d been watching the line all day, waiting for it to die down before he joined — though it never really did.

“I do this before every hurricane,” said Pettinato, of Palm City.

Nearly two hours later, the tent in the parking lot next to U.S. 1 still was still swamped.

Dutch Coker, who runs the establishment, seemed stressed trying to keep up with demand, saying that he “might have time to talk after the storm.”

Meanwhile, Publix, Walmart and other grocery stores are having a hard time keeping bottled water on hand. In Vero Beach, one Publix store saw almost 40 pallets of water taken away since Sunday. More is on order.

Jennifer Critchfield looked at the close-to-empty shelves that housed water at a Publix at the Miracle Mile shopping center.

"Don't panic," she said. Shoppers are out in force well ahead of the hurricane's possible approach to Florida during the weekend. "There is time."

Angela Nelson, of Vero Beach, finished filling a gasoline container she keeps on hand for hurricanes since back-to-back hurricanes hit here in 2004.

"Don't be scared, be prepared," she said at a gas station on U.S. 1.

At an Exxon station on State Road 60, signs on the pumps said the station was out of regular gasoline.

People are out early, getting ready. Nelson's neighbors on Orchid Island are already moving lawn furniture and "tidying up their yards" of loose items wind could blow around, she said.

Tony Hodge stood waiting for more plywood to be shipped into the Home Depot west of Vero Beach. He needed four sheets for his house. He said he was out early before there is really a rush.

"I'm trying to get stuff now," he said.

As they worked to take care of their supply needs, people in Martin County also rushed to reschedule plans.

For the past year, Pettinato, a finance manager with Wallace Auto Group, has been looking forward to going on a cruise, but it looks like Hurricane Irma could ruin his vacation.

"If I'd just left a little earlier," he lamented Tuesday, adding that he's not sure yet if he'll be able to reschedule the trip.
