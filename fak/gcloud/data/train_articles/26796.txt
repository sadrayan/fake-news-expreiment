Supreme Court Decides The Fate Of Islam Taught In Public Schools
The full panel of nine Supreme Court justices met Monday to decide the fate of a case with very close ties to Barack Obama and the Democrats.

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4, with Justice Gorsuch casting the tie-breaker, reports Trenddify. They decided that the only part of the Islam history taught to our children in public schools will be the one of Radical Islam and what they can do to help stop it.

Judge Gorsuch, in his first opinion for the high court, wrote:

“THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY HAS NO BUSINESS BEING INVOLVED IN RELIGION, BUT THIS ISN’T A GOVERNMENT ISSUE OR A RELIGIOUS ISSUE. THIS IS ABOUT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH INTERPRETING THE LAWS AS THEY APPLY TO THE TEACHING OF RELIGION. WE SHOULD BE TEACHING ANY RELIGIONS IN THIS COUNTRY BESIDES STANDARD JUDEO-CHRITIANITY, AS OUR FOUNDERS WANTED, AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULDN’T BE FILLING THE CHILDREN WITH LIES ABOUT ISLAM BEING A “RELIGION OF PEACE” WHEN THEY SEE THE CARNAGE ON THE NEWS ALMOST EVERY DAY.”

He added,

“IT IS OUR DUTY AS AMERICANS FIRST AND JUDGES SECOND TO SAFEGUARD THE WAY OUR CHILDREN ARE INDOCTRINATED.”

The Obama administration, after winning this case on appeal in the 17th district court, has remained with no power or any influence and friends in the judiciary. With this ruling ends the teaching of Islam in public schools, which is a major hit to Obama’s beloved Muslims. This is an addition to the ruling from just a week or so ago that forbids the teaching of Islamic tenets or Sharia as a part of world history as well.

This is major win for our country and Christianity. Thank God for our president and his new appointee. Now we can get back to respecting our true values and the normal, everyday worshiping of the only real God.
