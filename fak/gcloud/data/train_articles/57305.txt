VoteVets Launches Massive $4 Million Ad Blitz in Florida Senate Race, Taking On Rick Scott's Record....and That Hat
Ad features Florida Navy Veteran, highlighting Scott's defrauding of the military medical system

TALLAHASSEE, FL - The largest progressive group of veterans in America is today launching a massive $4 million television ad blitz across Florida, challenging Governor Rick Scott's record on taking care of our troops... and the Navy hat he always is seen wearing.

The ad will run across all television markets in the state, and on satellite TV.

In the ad, Florida Navy Veteran Alan Madison says, "I see Rick Scott wearing that Navy hat everywhere he goes. But let me tell you what he did to veterans. His hospital company stole millions defrauding the military’s healthcare program. Scott plead the fifth and walked away with a fortune. And today he’s worth over two hundred million bucks. But veterans like me, we got cheated. Governor, this hat represents what the Navy stands for - honor and integrity. My question for you sir, is where’s yours?"
