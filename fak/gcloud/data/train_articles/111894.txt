Australian discovers spider burrowed UNDER his skin while on holiday in Bali
A trip to Bali has turned Dylan Thomas into a real-life Spiderman.

The 21-year-old was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach.

Doctors told Mr Thomas he had just been bitten by a small insect when he fronted Bali International Medical Centre on Sunday morning after the red mark started to grow in length, the NT News reports.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Doctors at Bali International Medical Centre initially thought he had just been bitten by a small insect and gave him an antihistamine. When it started to blister the next day, he knew some was wrong

So imagine his surprise when doctors discovered a tropical spider burrowing just below his skin a day later.

Mr Thomas, who recently returned to his Bunbury home in Western Australia, was initially given an antihistamine cream to treat the mark.

But the next morning when he found it had started to blister, Mr Thomas went to see a dermatologist.

Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed

The 21-year-old has since returned to his Bunbury home in WA but is yet to find out what kind of spider it was

Doctors retrieved the spider from his abdomen, which had burrowed its way through a small scar from a previous operation where he had his appendix removed.

'It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,' Mr Thomas told the newspaper.

'It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days.'
