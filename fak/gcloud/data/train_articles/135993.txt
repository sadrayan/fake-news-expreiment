NEW: Yeti Coolers drops the NRA, retains ironic front page imagery
The NRA sent an email out to staff on Saturday notifying everyone that Yeti Coolers has cut ties and will no longer do business with the organization.

Yeti’s coolers are popular among hunters, outdoors and camping enthusiasts, and sports fans (read: not poindexter anti-gun dorks) so the company has wisely severed ties with the National Rifle Association in order to please a bunch of high school jerks and some liberal Hollywood wimps.







By the way? The part of the org they were doing business with was the charitable foundation.

For years YETI Coolers have been a hot item for sportsmen at the Friends of NRA Foundation Banquet and Auction events around the country. These Foundation events raise money to support youth programs and educational programs nationwide. The youth of America who benefit from these programs are the future hunters, hikers, fishermen/women, bikers, campers, wildlife photographers, mountain climbers, sportsmen/women and conservationists who will protect our natural resources and recreational lands. Suddenly, without prior notice, YETI has declined to do business with The NRA Foundation saying they no longer wish to be an NRA vendor, and refused to say why. They will only say they will no longer sell products to The NRA Foundation. That certainly isn’t sportsmanlike. In fact, YETI should be ashamed. They have declined to continue helping America’s young people enjoy outdoor recreational activities. These activities enable them to appreciate America and enjoy our natural resources with wholesome and healthy

outdoor recreational and educational programs.

I guess Yeti coolers hates kids, education and sports. Good to know about a company that makes coolers people take to sporting events.

This is a screenshot of their home page from a few seconds ago, featuring people they just decided to cut ties with. Hey, maybe they’re being ironic?

Brilliant marketing, guys. Really.
