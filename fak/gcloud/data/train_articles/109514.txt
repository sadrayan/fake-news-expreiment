Catholic Priest Claims God Is Female After Clinically Dead Experience
After being officially dead for 48 minutes and having his heart restarted, a 71 year-old Massachusetts Catholic Priest woke up and shared that he went to heaven and met God.

Who he claimed to be a warm and Motherly figure.

Father John Micheal O’neal was rushed to a hospital after suffering a massive heart attack: and was declared clinically dead before he was revived.

Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, The Archbishop of Boston, has said that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience…and that God clearly isn’t a female.

The full story is here.

It might sound odd, but I don’t have a problem picturing God as a female.

And, no, it has nothing to do with the fact that my wife is a United Methodist Pastor.

But am I the only one picturing Alanis Morissette a la Dogma?
