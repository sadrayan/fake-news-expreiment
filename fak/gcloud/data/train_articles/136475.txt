Is Cummins VP Pence’s Motive for Ignoring US Congressman Cummings’ Warning Re Flynn? Cummins Literally Moves Russia, Including Military; Partners With KAMAZ Owned By Russian Gov Owned-Sanctioned Entities Rostec & Sberbank

Pence gives Putin brophile a new meaning and takes Russiaphilia to a whole new level. It gives VP Pence MOTIVE for ignoring US Congressman Cummings’ warning, last November, re Flynn. Cummins is deeply involved in Russia through sales and joint ventures.

Up until at least last year, Cummins engines have been used in the GAZ Tiger vehicles, used by Russian, Syrian and other military.

Cummins has apparently been hit by sanctions against Russia. Russia’s Sputnik news reported on June 2, 2016, in “This Tigr’s Got a New Heart: Infantry Vehicle Gets Russian-Made Engine“, that because of sanctions and the partially related decline of the ruble (exchange rate) that they would be changing away from US made Cummins engines to Russian engines, apparently made at the Yaroslavl Motor Plant rather than the Cummins joint venture with Russia’s KAMAZ: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslavl_Motor_Plant Shortly thereafter Mike Pence became Trump VP pick. Currently, VP Mike Pence’s brother Ed is VP and General Manager of the High-Horsepower Engine Business which is used in mining, rail, oil and gas, marine, power generation and industrial applications, and hence surely impacted by sanctions.

Cummins is located in VP Pence’s home town, and Cummins workers-Cummins PAC were the second largest campaign donors in his Congressional career, according to the Center for Responsive Politics-OpenSecrets.org.

Additionally, his brother Ed has worked at Cummins since 1981 and has long been a top manager with sectors that literally move Russia: military, mining, oil and gas, farming. Their engines are also being used by the Syrian military.

Cummins is a long-time joint venture partner of Russian Government owned KAMAZ. Currently the Russian government owns 73.4% of KAMAZ via Rostec at 49.9%, 51% Russian government owned Sberbank at 23.5%; Daimler 15%, KAMAZ PTC 3.72%. (4-traders. com). [Trump advisor; corporate raider, purchaser of Trump Taj casino, Carl Icahn also has a joint venture with KAMAZ, FEDERAL-MOGUL Naberezhnye Chelny. Icahn owns 81.99% of Federal Mogul shares https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1419581/000162828016011881/fdml-2015123110xk.htm US Sec.gov raised concerns to Icahn enterprises re KAMAZ dealings with “terrorist” states: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/813762/000081376214000048/filename1.htm ]

VP Pence’s brother Ed appears deeply dependent upon Russia for some time – from 2005 as VP and General Manager of the Heavy Duty Engine Business of Cummins and starting in Feb 1, 2013 as VP and General Manager of the High Horsepower Engine Business of Cummins. Pence became Governor of Indiana in Jan. 2013. Cummins VP Pence appears the probable reason that US VP Pence ignored Congressman Cummings warnings about Flynn and Russia. It provides motive.

In January 2006, Cummins “signed a joint venture agreement with KAMAZ Inc., the largest vehicle manufacturer in Russia, to produce B Series engines under the name ZAO Cummins Kama“. In their end 2007 submittal to the US SEC, Cummins states that “The joint venture will build on the Cummins and KAMAZ relationship that dates back to the early 1980s. Among the customers of the new company are KAMAZ trucks and buses, as well as trucks, buses and agricultural equipment produced by other manufacturers in Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine.” https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/26172/000104746908001743/a2182909z10-k.htm http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-09-29/news/9309300155_1_engines-ind-based-cummins-kamaz

Cummins motors entered the Russian mining sector in the mid 1970s through exports, prior to the fall of the Soviet Union. Ed Pence started working for Cummins shortly thereafter, in 1981. They first signed a joint venture with Russian State owned Kamaz in 1987. In 1993 the Chicago Tribune reported: “Cummins To Team Up With Russia’s Kamaz To Produce Engines” September 29, 1993 http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-09-29/news/9309300155_1_engines-ind-based-cummins-kamaz As soon as joint ventures were allowed, they signed on in 1987: “Corporate Diplomacy

Joint Ventures in Eastern Europe” by Jonathan Dunn, NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 1987 – VOLUME 8 – NUMBERS 11 & 12, http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1987/11/dunn.html

Cummins and Kamaz appear to have great faith in the future under Trump-Pence since Bloomberg reported in March: “CUMMINS KAMA Launches Manufacturing of L-Series Engines” Mar 28 17, “A new Cummins L-Series engine assembly line has been launched at CUMMINS KAMA Russian-American Joint Venture set up by KAMAZ (part of Rostec State Corporation) and Cummins Inc. in Naberezhnye Chelny“. https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=42148450

KAMAZ is part of Rostec State Corporatiin, one of a handful of Russian companies directly owned by the Russian Federation and who answer more directly to Putin, than some Russian state owned entities: “State Corporations are not obliged to submit to public authorities documents accounting for activities (except for a number of documents submitted to the Russian government) and, as a rule, are subordinate not to the government, but to the Russian president,…” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise#Russia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_corporation_(Russia) KAMAZ makes trucks and diesel engines and has over half of the market share of Russian trucks. https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostec#KAMAZ The market share is 56% as of 2016, according to their web site.

While KAMAZ is majority 49.9% Russian gov Rostec-owned, currently the Russian government owns 73.4% of KAMAZ via Rostec at 49.9%, 51% Russian government owned Sberbank at 23.5%; Daimler 15%, Kamaz PTC at 3.72%. (4-traders.com). In short, it is Russia gov controlled.

According to Globe Newswire, on Oct. 13, 2015 Cummins Inc. “celebrated the completion of construction of the Seymour Technical Center, a global engineering center office for the High-Horsepower Engine Business in Seymour, Indiana. The center is co-located with the Seymour Engine Plant in close proximity to 22 test cells dedicated to engine research and development work for mining, rail, oil and gas, marine, power generation and industrial applications.”

In 2013, then Governor Pence gave the Seymour branch an award. “The Seymour branch of Cummins, Inc., employs approximately 550 employees. The site manufactures a wide variety of diesel and natural gas engines. These engines are used for government, mining, marine, construction, locomotive, power generation and a wide variety of other applications. ” http://in.gov/dol/2833.htm His brother appears to have been already working there at this time, so he appears to have essentially awarded his brother, which is strange.

The expansion completed in 2015 was the site of a shooting: “Abbott explained that the engine plant was Cummins’ original facility located at 3rd St. The Tech Center, where the shooting occurred, was an expansion completed in late 2015.” “Police identify men killed in shooting at Cummins plant in Seymour” By WTHR Channel 13 Mar 10, 2016 http://www.greensburgdailynews. com/news/police-identify-men-killed-in-shooting-at-cummins-plant-in/article_3f09730f-31bf-521f-b8a8-70670ec03446.html

Can you spell Sakhalin? Tillerson can, and Pence (Ed and/or Mike) probably can too. Despite so-called sanctions, Exxon is the operator and part owner (along with Rosneft and others) of the Sakhalin 1 project.

According to the Cummins Russia web site LLC “NG-Energo”, located at Sedova Str., 12 St. Petersburg, Leningradskaya oblast’ 192019, Russia is a dealer authorized for repair. The Engine Series/Applications are “Power generating sets” and ” G-drive engines sold to end user”. Andrey Rudskoy is Director General of LLC NG-Energo. https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=117584427&privcapId=51326617 According to the NG-Energo web site, they have a long-term business relationship with Surgutneftegas Ltd. St. Petersburg is Putin’s hometown and where he started his political career and some allege corruption. Surgutneftegas Chairman is Vladimir Erokhin and CEO is Vladimir Bogdanov. “From the beginning Surgutneftegas has been led by president and director general Vladimir Bogdanov, who had run the Surgut oil fields since 1983… The company is believed to have still close ties to the Kremlin under Vladimir Putin.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgutneftegas The NG-Energo web site says that they work to supply “gas power plants based on Cummins engines to West-Sakhalin, East-Surgut, North-Seliyar and Yaun-Lor fields“. The power stations are for “extraction and utilization of associated gas at oilfields.” And that since 2005 NG-Energo supplied more than 70 diesel power station units to the Directorate of Prospecting and Exploration Works. The power stations operate in Western Siberia, Eastern Siberia and Yakutiya. (See http://www.ngenergo. ru)

Mining Awareness blog continues to suspect a VP Mike Pence connection to sanctioned Russian Orthodox “oligarch” (aka robber baron) Konstantin Malofeev thru the World Congress of Families (WCF), which doesn’t want women in universities and opposes birth control – promoting large families in an overpopulated world.

However, the reality may be more mundanely economic, rather than ideological.

Malofeev’s Marshall Capital Partners shares the floor of a building in Russia with Exxon’s Russian subsidiary, meaning there may be a WCF-Malofeev-Exxon connection. Recall that US Sec of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon CEO.
