The curious case of Lyudmyla Kozlovska
Liberal media and politicians fiercely defend Lyudmyla Kozlovska after her expulsion from the European Union. She was expelled at the request of the Polish Internal Security Agency (ABW) as posing a security threat following allegations that she works for Russian interests.

These same individuals, including former president Lech Wałęsa and members of the Polish opposition demand that Kozlovska’s ban on EU entry be repealed. Together they have created an online petition in which there is a demand to give Kozlovska any EU citizenship to bypass the expulsion.

When Kozlovska arrived in Brussels last week, she was denied entry on the grounds of being entered into the Schengen Information System (SIS) with the highest alert by Polish authorities. She was compelled to return to Kiev.

We are dealing with a person who is deemed by our security services as someone who should not have the ability to function in Poland and the EU

Earlier, Kozlovska had requested long-term resident status in the European Union. Stanisław Żaryn, spokesman for the security service minister, explained that the negative opinion is due to “serious doubts” as to the sources of funding for Kozlovska’s organization.

“We are dealing with a person who is deemed by our security services as someone who should not have the ability to function in Poland and the EU," said Jacek Sasin, chief of The Permanent Committee of the Council of Ministers.

Connections to Soros

Lyudmyla Kozlovska holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenships and is the chairman of the “Open Dialogue” foundation, and NGO connected to George Soros’ liberal think tanks. Kozlovska and her Polish husband Bartosz Kramek actively supported anti-government opposition in Poland. Kramek also instructed the opposition on how to carry out acts of disobedience against the functioning of the Polish state.
