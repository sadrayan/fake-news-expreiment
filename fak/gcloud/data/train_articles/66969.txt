“It’s not about closing down mosques,” Rubio said on Fox News’s “The Kelly File” on Thursday. “It’s about closing down any place — whether it’s a café, diner, an Internet site — any place where radicals are being inspired.”

“So whatever facility is being used — it’s not just a mosque — any facility that’s being used to radicalize and inspire attacks against the United States, should be a place that we look at,” he added.

Rubio said leaker Edward Snowden has “crippled” the U.S.’s ability to track terrorist plots.



“The bigger problem we have is our inability to find out where these places are, because we’ve crippled our intelligence programs, both through unauthorized disclosures by a traitor, Edward Snowden, or by some of the things this president has put in place with the support even of some from my own party to diminish our intelligence capabilities,” he said.

“A lot of it is actually happening online, not simply in mosques.”

Trump, the Republican primary front-runner, has said the U.S. will have “absolutely no choice” but to close mosques in the aftermath of the Paris terror attack last week.

He has also said that he would “absolutely” use a database to track Muslims in the country.

Politicians on both the left and right have criticized Trump’s remarks.
