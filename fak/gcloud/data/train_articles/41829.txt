Understanding Your Letter 5600C
The IRS is sending you this letter because it appears that you may have reported owing too much Health Care Shared Responsibility Payment (SRP) on your 2014 income tax return. Under the law, individuals are required to either have health coverage for each month, qualify for an exemption, or make an SRP with their tax return. You reported an SRP either on Line 61 of your Form 1040, Line 38 of your Form 1040A, or Line 11 of your Form 1040EZ.

What you need to do

Read your letter carefully.

Review the situation to see if you agree with the information in the letter.

You may want to

File a Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, if you want to correct the SRP that you reported on your 2014 tax return. Attach Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions, if you want to claim an exemption. If you donâ€™t currently have an outstanding balance for taxes due to the IRS, you can choose to apply any excess SRP amount that was paid to your estimated tax payments for a future year, or you can receive a refund. If you have an outstanding balance, we will apply the excess SRP to your oldest balance due.
