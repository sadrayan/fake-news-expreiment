Pat McCrory: HB2 wasn't repealed | News & Observer
With House Bill 2 back in the headlines, former N.C. Gov. Pat McCrory made a bold statement about the law's compromise replacement during his daily radio appearance recently: "House Bill 2 was really never repealed," he told WBT radio in Charlotte.

The issue resurfaced last week when Gov. Roy Cooper, the Democrat who unseated Republican McCrory, announced a proposed settlement in a lawsuit challenging the law that replaced HB2 in March. The settlement would allow transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity while in state government facilities controlled by Cooper's Cabinet agencies, such as state parks and highway rest stops.

McCrory told WBT he agrees with legislative leaders who oppose the deal. "He brings up bathrooms again without even defining what transgender is, and is making things extremely confusing," McCrory said. "He seems to like controversial social issues. But when a liberal does it, the media gives him a free pass. When a conservative does it, it's a bad thing to do."

The former governor, who signed HB2 and faced immediate backlash from corporations, advocacy groups and sports organizations, is also making the case that the HB2 compromise legislation signed by Cooper didn't really change anything. He noted that the new law keeps a ban on local government nondiscrimination ordinances in place until 2020.

"All of the restrictions that were in place last October are in place this October," he told WBT. "Nothing's changed, but it is one of the best kept secrets in the media and in politics. Everyone's pretending the problem's solved and we're going to move on.

â€œIt was a fake issue in many ways all along, and this is one issue where it's fake news that a bill was signed and very little changed except for the public perception."
