REAL: Research for Equitable Access and Learning : Faculty of Education
Education is at the heart of social transformation. It is a fundamental human right and has the potential to reduce poverty, empower women, improve health and drive economic growth.

However, in some of the poorest parts of the world many children and young people are deprived of access to good quality education and denied the chance to learn and fulfill their potential.

The Research for Equitable Access and Learning (REAL) Centre pioneers research into overcoming barriers to education, such as poverty, gender, ethnicity, language and disability, and promotes education as an engine for inclusive growth and sustainable development.
