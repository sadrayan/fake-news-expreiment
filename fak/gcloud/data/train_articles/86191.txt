Time With A Newborn: Maternity Leave Policies Around The World
Notes - In Iceland, the overall length of the combined maternity/paternity leave is nine months, divided into thirds. Three months are reserved for the mother, three months for the father, and the parents can divide another three months between them as they please.<br />- Norway has a system of paid maternity, paternity and parental leave that can total 56 weeks. Nine weeks are exclusively reserved for the mother (three weeks before birth and six weeks directly after) and 10 weeks are exclusively reserved for the father. They may divide the rest as they choose.<br />- In Sweden, parents are entitled to benefits that can cover up to 480 calendar days. Two months are reserved for the father.<br />- NPR focused on maternity leave policies because paternity leave policies are harder to pin down. In some cases, fathers can tap into the same benefits that mothers get; in other cases they have time specifically dedicated to them; and in many countries, fathers don't have any time allotted to them at all.
