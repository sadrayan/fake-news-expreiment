Catfish In The Snow – Total Fishing
The noted ‘Wels Camp’ on Italy’s River Po produced a trio of great catfish for Team Black Cat guides Stefan Seuß and Benjamin Gründer and their guests.

With snowstorms and sub zero temperatures to contend with and very low water temperatures which continually iced up the rods, the fishing was never going to be prolific.

However, they proved that the species can be caught year round by tempting nine wels catfish in seven days using deadbaits, including giants of 228cm, 233cm and 234cm in length.
