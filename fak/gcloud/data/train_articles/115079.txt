It’s Time to Stand Up and Stand Together
At Ben & Jerry’s, we strongly denounce the executive order that President Trump issued barring citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering our country. This is a direct assault on our country’s commitment to fairness, the rule of law, and religious liberty. That’s why this weekend, tens of thousands of people gathered in cities and airports to denounce this assault on our values.

The impact of this policy is to deny entry to some of the most vulnerable people in the world, people forced from their homes and fleeing unthinkable violence. It denies entry to some of the world’s best doctors, scholars, and artists, depriving our country of the diversity that makes us great. This executive order does not make us stronger or safer, in fact it does just the opposite. It’s also bad for the business community, which relies upon diverse and inclusive workplaces that make us more competitive while fostering innovation.

We recognize our human family as one and join with the millions who believe in human rights and the struggle for a dignified life for all. Our country is at its best when it stands for the principals of social inclusion based on full and equal rights.

This is a time for us all to stand up and stand together for our nation’s values. We intend to continue to speak out and take action against fear and intolerance. Consider joining us by signing this petition opposing the president’s executive order as a first step.
