Big numbers: Foxconn officials have said they would invest up to $10 billion in a campus that would occupy up to 20 million square feet, or 11 times the size of Lambeau Field. That plant and support operations in Wisconsin could employ up to 13,000 workers. Work has begun on the project at a site in Mount Pleasant in Racine County.

Wisconsin's share: Under the deal, the state would pay Foxconn up to $2.85 billion in cash over 15 years, depending on how many jobs it creates and how much it invests in the plant. The company would receive an additional sales tax break worth up to $150 million on construction material for the factory. Together with aid from local government and utility ratepayers, the total incentives are worth about $4 billion.

What's been spent so far: So far, local governments and Foxconn have spent $190 million on land acquisition and infrastructure — things like streets, water lines and sewer lines — associated with the project. Foxconn has contributed $60 million to local governments. All told, the Village of Mount Pleasant and Racine County expect to spend $912 million on Foxconn-related items. Officials say that money would eventually be repaid through property taxes on the proposed Foxconn facility and nearby development.
