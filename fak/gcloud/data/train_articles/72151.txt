Growing out of President Bush’s own outreach and the ongoing work of the George W. Bush Institute's Military Service Initiative, Portraits of Courage brings together sixty-six full-color portraits and a four-panel mural painted by President Bush of members of the United States military who have served our Nation with honor since 9/11—and whom he has come to know personally.

The Military Service Initiative helps post-9/11 veterans and their families make a successful transition to civilian life and addresses issues of veteran wellness, including post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury.

Portraits of Courage ran March 2 through October 17, 2017, at the George W. Bush Presidential Center on the SMU campus in Dallas, Texas.
