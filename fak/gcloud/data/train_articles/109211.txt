Click here to see the results.

The number of the total population has been taken from The CIA World's Facts Book which can be found at: http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook

The CIA World's Facts Book was used it to verify the total number of population in every country. But since it lacks the percentage of Muslims in each country, we used another statistic located at: http://www.flash.net/~royal/country.html

In 1986, the Muslim Education Trust organization (MET) located in the United Kingdom and directed by Ghulam Sarwar, obtained the 1971 census and information given by Embassies of the respective countries in London. The 1971 census showed the Independent Muslim countries population was around 784.5 Million and the Muslim Minorities countries had around 308 Million Muslim.

As for the U.N., the Briticana Encyclopidia for 1994 and for 1995 was used to get the growth rates. Briticana took those statistics from the U.N.
