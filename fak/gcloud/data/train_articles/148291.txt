Gainesville Police charge New York man with multiple entering auto incidents
A New York man accused of getting into multiple cars in the Riverside Drive area was arrested last week by Gainesville Police.

Collin Matthew Brown, 36, of Auburn, New York, was charged with multiple counts of entering auto with intent to steal by authorities.

“GPD will continue efforts such as utilizing unmarked vehicles and covert operations to seek out those committing these types of crimes,” Gainesville Police Sgt. Kevin Holbrook said in a news release. “Citizens will also see officers on foot and in marked vehicles patrol parking lots and taking proactive measures to educate the public.”

Holbrook said police arrested Brown around 4 p.m. on Thanksgiving. The department is reminding citizens to lock cars, keep valuables hidden and report suspicious activity.
