U.S. Olympic Star Kim Rhode Shoots Down Gun Control

Six-time Olympic shooter Kim Rhode isn’t shy about sharing her thoughts on gun control.

“We should have the right to keep and bear arms, to protect ourselves and our family,” she told Time from Rio de Janeiro this week. “The Second Amendment was put in there not just so we can go shoot skeet or go shoot trap. It was put in so we could defend our first amendment, the freedom of speech, and also to defend ourselves against our own government.”

The Californian, who won a bronze Friday in the skeet competition to medal in six straight Olympics, said she grieves for the victims of attacks like the one in San Bernardino, in which 14 people were shot dead. Such massacres “make me want to carry even more,” she said.

Rhode told The Guardian recent massacres had occurred in “some of the strictest gun law countries in the world.” “You have Paris, you have San Bernardino, which was actually in a gun-free zone, so, yeah, it’s actually something that you take into consideration,” she added.

On a competitive note, Rhode said laws recently signed in California now require her to submit to a background check every time she purchases ammo for her sport.

While some of her comments may spark debate, there’s no arguing that the 37-year-old is one of America’s most decorated Olympic shooters. She has now won three gold medals, one silver and two bronze over six Olympics.
