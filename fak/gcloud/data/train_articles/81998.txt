Judge dials back voter guide claims from pro- and anti-pot legalization groups
(Los Angeles Times)

A Sacramento Superior Court judge on Friday ordered both supporters and opponents of a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana to modify the official arguments they make to voters in November.

The changes dial back claims by both sides in state voter guides regarding the costs of legalizing marijuana, advertising exposure to children and potential health and public safety effects. Many of the changes modify language that says the measure “will” have a certain impact to saying that it “could” have that impact.

One of the hotly contested parts of the measure, Proposition 64, describes the extent to which children could be exposed to television advertisements promoting marijuana. As the Times has reported, the initiative opens the door to marijuana television ads, though there is currently a federal prohibition against them because the drug is illegal.
