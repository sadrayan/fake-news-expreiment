Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Contemplate a Debate
Asked if the offer to debate Mr. Trump was a serious one, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said it was “real.”

At a press conference in North Dakota on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested that he was serious about the debate on the condition that the networks would donate $10 million to $15 million of the proceeds to charities that support women’s health causes.

“I’d love to debate Bernie,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s a dream.”

Mr. Trump said that he had already received calls from the networks about hosting a debate with Mr. Sanders and that if something could be agreed upon, he envisioned it taking place in a big arena.

Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton had agreed to another debate before California primary, and last week Fox News extended invitations to both candidates to participate in one. While Mr. Sanders was eager to debate, Mrs. Clinton, who is trying to turn her attention toward Mr. Trump, declined the offer.

An interparty debate between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders, before the Democratic nomination is wrapped up, would create an unusual spectacle and could leave Mrs. Clinton in the dark as her two rivals soak up the political spotlight. It could also provide Mr. Trump with an opportunity to openly shop himself to Mr. Sanders’s supporters, who he has been hoping will turn to him instead of Mrs. Clinton in a general election.
