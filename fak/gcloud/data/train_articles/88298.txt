Obama: 'Steel in his spine'
Obama's up with a new ad, airing at least in the Northern Virginia market, responding to the GOP attack on Joe Biden's suggestion that hostile nations would test the new, young president and generate a crisis.

"An economic meltdown. Two wars. And John McCain's playing with audiotapes, selectively editing Joe Biden's words," says the narrator. "The next president will be tested. But here's what Biden actually said about Barack Obama:"

The Biden clip of choice: "'They're going to find this guy's got steel in his spine."

The ad then pivots to calling McCain "erratic" (against Obama's "steady hand") and linking him to Bush, painting McCain as "the risk we can't afford to take."

The ad, like the campaign's response to this in general, avoids reckoning with the plain, and reasonable, meaning of Biden's comment: that Putin or another foreign leader will likely seek to test Obama, specifically; though also, as the ad notes, that Obama would pass the test.
