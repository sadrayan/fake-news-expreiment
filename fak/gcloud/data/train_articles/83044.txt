Trump in 2012: Michele Bachmann Showed ‘Great Disloyalty’ Skipping Debate, ‘People Rejected Her’
While Republican Donald Trump is skipping Fox News’ Thursday debate, back in 2012, he tore into candidates like Michele Bachmann for doing the same.

The difference of course was that the shoe was on the other foot. At the time, Trump was trying to moderate his own debate.

Michele Bachmann just dropped out of prez race— when she didn’t do the Newsmax debate it showed great disloyalty and people rejected her. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2012

I was on a tele-townhall with @TeamBachmann and hosted her 4 times in Trump Tower yet she declined the Newsmax-@iontv debate. No loyalty. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2011

Trump went beyond just bashing Bachmann, calling out other presidential candidates for skipping the debate and telling the GOP establishment that “more debate is always better.”

Why is the GOP establishment so threatened by the Newsmax – @iontv debate? More debate is always better. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2011

@RonPaul is out of the Newsmax-@iontv debate. Now there won’t be any candidates who believe America caused 9.11 or Iran should get nukes. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2011
