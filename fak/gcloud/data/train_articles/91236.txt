Kean: All 16 GOP Senators Named “Taxpayer Champions”
“Tax Policy is Jobs Policy”

Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean issued the following statement today after the New Jersey Taxpayer Alliance (NJTA) named all 16 Republican Senators as “Taxpayer Champions.” The Alliance honored the legislators after an analysis of voting records on bills deemed crucial to the taxpayer community.

“My Republican colleagues and I understand that tax policy is jobs policy. Our goal is to make New Jersey competitive again so that we can attract new businesses and private sector jobs for New Jersey workers. This starts with making sure our tax policies are reasonable and consistent.

“Over the past 10 years, Democrats have been in control of the Legislature and have done a disservice to New Jersey workers and their families by raising taxes over 115 times, making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states. I think most taxpayers would agree that the results are hardly worth the burden: 9.1% unemployment, the highest property taxes in America, $11 billion in new state spending and a doubling of our state debt.

“Governor Christie and Senate Republicans have been working hard to reverse this decade of damage caused by Democrats by passing a budget two years in a row that does not raise taxes, enacting comprehensive public employee pension and health benefit reforms and putting forth a wide range of legislative initiatives that enhance our economy, create jobs and make New Jersey competitive again. I am optimistic that if we continue down the path we are going we can make New Jersey an economic powerhouse once again.”
