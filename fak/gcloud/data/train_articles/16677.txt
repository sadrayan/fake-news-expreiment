Jennifer:

I write afresh from Texas seeking information pertinent to Sen. Cruz’s July 17 claim here that Beto O’Rourke is the only Senate candidate to call for President Trump’s impeachment. As of that date, would this statement seem accurate? Why or why not? Any other recommended authorities on this topic?

To repeat myself, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for all our stories. I trust you saw our poll write-up.

Thank you again,

The short answer is no (see attached story). The challenge here is that literally hundreds of second and third tier candidates file to run for the Senate and get very little attention. I suspect that some of the Democrats in these categories have called for Trump's impeachment, but no one is paying attention. Richard Painter is a second-tier candidate who is notable for a couple of reasons: he used to be a Republican and he is taking on an appointed incumbent. Generally, the Senate and House Democratic leadership is dissuading their candidates from talking about impeachment because they are afraid such talk will energize Trump voters and entice them to the polls in November. O'Rourke is a break-the-mold candidate, so it doesn't surprise me that he is talking about it.
