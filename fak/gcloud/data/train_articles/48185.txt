Total Electioneering Communications: $0



By definition, electioneering communications do not explicitly advocate for or against the election of a candidate, but simply refer to a clearly identified federal candidate in a broadcast ad. Because of that, the Federal Election Commission requires that groups disclose only which federal candidate(s) were mentioned in the communications - not whether the communications supported or opposed the candidate(s).
