Buying Time – Supreme Court Advertisements
The battle over Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court could attract record amounts of spending. In addition to groups whose identities and positions are well-known, groups that do not disclose their donors will likely play an unprecedented role in the fight.

As a tool for reporters, advocates, and the public, the Brennan Center is using the chart below to track all television ad spending around the nomination, including the cost of individual ad buys, spenders’ identities, target markets, and more so you can easily see who’s wielding influence, and how, to determine the makeup of the nation’s highest court. We’ll be updating the chart each week as new data becomes available, and we’ll highlight the most noteworthy developments.

Methodology

Data on ad airings and spending on ads are calculated and prepared by Kantar Media/CMAG, which captures satellite data in the nation’s largest media markets. CMAG’s estimates do not reflect ad agency commissions or the costs of producing advertisements, nor do they reflect the cost of ad buys on local cable channels. Cost estimates are revised by Kantar Media/CMAG when it receives updated data, resulting in some fluctuations in the reported ad spending.
