Global tuberculosis report 2018

WHO has published a global TB report every year since 1997. The main aim of the report is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the TB epidemic, and of progress in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the disease at global, regional and country levels. This is done in the context of recommended global TB strategies and targets endorsed by WHOâ€™s Member States and broader development goals set by the United Nations (UN).



The 2018 edition of the global TB report was released on 18 September, in the lead up to the first-ever UN High Level Meeting on TB on 26 September 2018.



The data in this report are updated annually.

Global TB reports from previous years are available from the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) and can be found here.



Please note that direct comparisons between estimates of TB disease burden in the latest report and previous reports are not appropriate. The most recent time-series of estimates are published in the 2018 global TB report.
