Donald Trump Calls Out to 'My African-American' During Rally
Donald Trump -- who has courted controversy with race during the election season -- raised eyebrows Friday when he pointed to a black audience member and said "look at my African-American over here."

The presumptive Republican nominee had been describing to a crowd in San Jose, Calif. how he says he talks to his supporters when protesters interrupt his rallies.

"We had a case where we had an African-American guy, who is a fan of mine, great fan, great guy. In fact I want to find out what’s going on with him,” he began.

Then, spotting an audience member, an African-American, a rare sight among Trump rallygoers.

"You know what-- Oh look at my African-American over here," he exclaimed. "Look at him. Are you the greatest? You know what I’m talking about?”

He went on to exhort the “tremendous” support he says he has among black voters. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in April, Trump had an 84 percent disapproval rating among African-Americans.

Some didn’t take too kindly to the presumptive nominee’s use of the possessive, slamming it as evocative of slavery.

Trump, just in recent days, has a complicated history when discussing race. Most recently, he’s been accused of racism when discussing Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the judge presiding over a lawsuit involving his now-closed Trump University, saying that his Mexican heritage presented “an absolute conflict”.

“I’m building a wall. It’s an inherent conflict of interest,” Trump said.

"Mr. Trump was simply recognizing a supporter for whom he has great respect," the Trump campaign said in a statement.
