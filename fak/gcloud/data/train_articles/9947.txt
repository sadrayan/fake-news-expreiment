NAEP State Mapping
About the NAEP State Mapping Analyses

The state mapping studies performed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) offer several important contributions to national education analyses.

First, the mapping analyses allow each state to compare the stringency of its criteria for proficiency with that of other states. Second, they inform a state whether the rigor of its standards, as represented by the NAEP scale equivalent of the state’s standard, changed over time. Significant differences in NAEP scale equivalents might reflect changes in state assessments and standards or changes in policies or practices that occurred between the years. Finally, when key aspects of a state’s assessment or standards remain the same, these mapping analyses allow NAEP to corroborate state-reported changes in student achievement.

NCES has released six mapping reports using state data for reading and mathematics at grades 4 and 8 from 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015. This sixth report highlights results of mapping state proficiency standards onto the NAEP scales using state assessment results for public schools from the 2014–15 school year and the 2015 NAEP assessments. The report focuses on the reading and mathematics standards that states set for grades 4 and 8 for federal reporting under the 2001 and 2015 reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
