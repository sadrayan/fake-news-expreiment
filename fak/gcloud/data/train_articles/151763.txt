Obama 2009 Inauguration Donors

Like his presidential campaign, the festivities surrounding Barack Obama's swearing-in as the nation's 44th president were financed by private donations, a practice that goes back many administrations. What changes from president to president is the type and amount of money that the Presidential Inaugural Committee decides to collect. The government places no limits on these contributions, but Obama capped money for his inauguration at $50,000 per person - still, more than 10 times what individuals could give to his campaign. Contributions from corporations, labor unions, political action committees and registered lobbyists were not accepted. Donors at the $50,000 level reportedly got tickets to the official ceremony, the parade and inaugural balls. The Inaugural Committee voluntarily disclosed its donors as it raised the money but had to report its fundraising to the government following the inauguration.
