Detroit residents seek federal help

Crowds attempt to rush through an unlocked door at Cobo Center after police tried to let some people in to pick up federal housing assistance forms. The city received nearly $15.2 million in federal dollars under the Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program, which is for temporary financial assistance and housing services to individuals and families who are homeless, or who would be homeless without this help.
