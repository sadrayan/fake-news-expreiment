Sequester Starts In Impact SD's Reservations
ROSEBUD, SD -

The sequester in Washington will soon start to impact head start programs on the state's Indian reservations.

Head start is the largest tribal program on the Rosebud Reservation and serves more than 300 children.

To cope with a cut of nearly $130,000, the tribe's head start administration will take a two week furlough this summer.

Teachers in Rosebud's 16 classrooms will also be on leave for seven days during the 2013-2014 school year.

But the move won't affect the amount of time students will spend in the centers. Instead, teachers will miss in-service days.
