TransCanada Releases Detailed Keystone XL Job Creation Data
At least 1000 American companies supply goods and services to Canadian oil sands and pipeline companies - Berg Steel Pipe in Houston, Siemens Energy from California and the Michelin plant in Greenville, South Carolina are just three examples.

The $6 billion Keystone pipeline that has safely delivered over 160 million barrels of oil to the U.S. Midwest since the summer of 2010 created 9,000 construction jobs and thousands more manufacturing jobs.

Keystone XL has the capacity to deliver 830,000 barrels of oil per day to U.S. refineries in Cushing, Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico. Up to 25 per cent of that capacity has been provided for the delivery of U.S. domestic oil from the Bakken fields in Montana and North Dakota and oil from Cushing. Long-term, binding contracts for more than 150,000 barrels per day from the Bakken fields and Cushing have already been signed. This supports the desire in the United States to ultimately achieve domestic energy security.

“The fundamental issue here is that the U.S. imports 10 million barrels of oil each day – forecasts predict that will not change for decades. So the question is where will that oil come from? Will it come from U.S. and Canadian sources or will it continue to be higher priced conflict oil from the Middle East and Venezuela – regions that do not share American values,” concluded Girling.
