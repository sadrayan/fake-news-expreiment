1. What is the site about?

Whether you’re high school or college student with silly classmates, a teacher, professor, tutor, or school staff who deals with interesting students, or a parent trying to make sense of your child’s education, we’ve all dealt with people in school-related situations who are not always learning. Not Always Learning is a website that shares true, reader-submitted stories of funny & interesting students, teachers, and parents.

2. Who are you guys?

The Not Always Learning editing team comes with years of experience editing its sister humor sites, Not Always Right, Not Always Romantic, Not Always Related, and Not Always Working. Based in both the US and the UK, we are also aware how remarkably similar employees and coworkers in the wrong can be, despite an ocean of difference!

3. Who writes these stories?

All of our stories are submitted by readers just like you!

4. Who writes the titles for these stories?

The vast majority of the titles are cleverly conceived by our team of editors. Our own readers also welcome to include a suggested title when submitting a story.

5. I submitted a story. When will I see it?

While we receive many submissions, only a few can make it on to the site. That said, if your submission is genuinely funny and unusual, you should see it soon. If you really feel your submission is worthy of publishing then submit it again! It is entirely possible we just missed it the first time around.

6. My story got published, but it’s slightly different! How come?

Sometimes we will need to edit a story slightly to make it suitable for publication. Scene-setting is great, but extraneous detail may need to be cut down a little. Your submission might explain that this didn’t happen to you but to your classmate/colleague/friend, but the audience doesn’t need to know that.

If it isn’t important to the punch-line we’ll also remove reference to brand names, overly strong language and overly long sentences.

Don’t worry, we still aim to keep the spirit of the story alive and ensure it remains as hilarious as ever!

7. Are your stories real?

We endeavor to ensure stories are based on actual, real events. Submissions that are copied from literature, well-known jokes, or other pop culture sources are summarily rejected.

That said, we admit that some inappropriate stories do occasionally make it through. If you know of a story that is not based on actual events, and have clear evidence to prove it, let us know!

8. Is this site suitable for children?

No. Some situations are not suitable for younger audiences. We do our best to censor profanity and other explicit content, but there are some topics that are best discussed only amongst adults and away from the prying eyes (and ears) of children.

9. How do I contact you guys?

Quick answer? Very easily! Just fill out our contact form. We can’t promise to reply to every one but we try our best!
