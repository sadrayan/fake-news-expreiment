The Latest: DOT leader says transportation system declining
Gov. Tony Evers' pick to lead the state Department of Transportation says that "by every measure the condition" of Wisconsin's transportation system "is declining."

Craig Thompson testified Wednesday before the state Senate's transportation committee.

Republicans have been leery of Thompson's background as a lobbyist for the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin, which has advocated for raising taxes and fees to rebuild Wisconsin roads.

Thompson says Evers' budget will increase funding for roads but didn't specify where it would come from. Evers has said he will call for raising the gas tax by an unspecified amount.

Thompson says the budget will prioritize fixing current roads and infrastructure before tackling new projects.
