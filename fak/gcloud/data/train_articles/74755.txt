Keystone XL Pipeline - Passage

Senate Roll Call Vote 49 S 1

Passage of the bill that would immediately allow TransCanada to construct, connect, operate and maintain the pipeline and cross-border facilities known as the Keystone XL pipeline, including any revision to the pipeline route within Nebraska as required or authorized by the state. It also would consider the January 2014 environmental impact statement issued by the State Department sufficient to satisfy all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. It would grant the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia exclusive jurisdiction regarding legal disputes over the pipeline or the constitutionality of the bill. As amended, it would express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real.

Passed by a vote of 62-36:

Republicans 53-0 Democrats 9-34 Independents 0-2

Note: A "nay" was a vote in support of the president's position.
