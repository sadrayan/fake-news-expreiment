Responses to The Celebritization of Charity: Wow, what an insightful article by Dr. Robert Paul! Madonna's recent visit to Malawi had international press coverage while the orphanage did want a quiet, secret visit according to the local papers. Every day I see poverty all around. Because I am white I have many outstretched hands asking for money. I have to make a choice to keep beggars poor today (not giving) or help them develop a life of dependency (giving). I also see corruption on the local levels where some administrators pocket money earmarked for the poor, or chief's in villages selling clothing, maize and fertilizer that was given as charity to people of the village. Helping poor people to help themselves is the answer. Not only is Dr. Paul correct on the subject of charity, he is correct on the spiritual subject of Jesus. Jesus did not come to hand out money to the poor. He came to give them the eternal riches of heaven through his suffering, death and resurrection. Now he promises to give his children their daily bread here and the riches of heaven forever. Thanks for the insight! - Missionary Mark Johnston, Malawi, Africa



Thank you for an article that really touched on why "something about this doesn't sit right." I happened to watch the episode on charity night this past week, (though I am not a regular viewer of American Idol) and like Dr. Paul, something about it didn't sit right, however, I was happy that so many were willing to help. This article really touched on the core problem of poverty and what Jesus is really calling us to do. Thank you tothesource! - Anonymous



Thanks for this on-target editorial. Right now, our organization, Project TeamWork, continues to recruit and use volunteers - just regular men, women, and students to help rebuild after Hurricane Katrina destroyed 50% of the homes in Biloxi, Mississippi. Just in our own ministry, we've witnessed over 8,000 volunteers in the last 18 months come help rebuild. How interesting that the majority of these volunteers are just run of the mill Christians, not celebrities, most not wealthy. They give one week at a time, and give all they can. Multiply our 8,000 times all the Christian organizations that are recruiting and rebuilding; with approximately four more years to go on this project, that's a lot of regular joe's and jane's. And although you won't see them on the cover of People, they are the real heroes! - BJ Behnken President, Project TeamWork



Good God... Get a LIFE! Don't you have anything else to worry about? Just be glad someone is doing something to help these poor people! Their motives don't matter.. what matters is getting food and medicine to those who need it. By YOUR attitutude in this letter it sounds like YOU are the one who is being sanctimonious and condescending.... - A Reader



Talk about food for thought! I had never given much thought to who or how money was raised for charity, but I must say, Dr. Robert S. Paul�s article today left me thinking. I work for Mobile Loaves & Fishes, a 501(c)(3) charity based in Austin, Texas, that �provides food, clothing, and dignity� to our brothers and sisters in need.� Several times we have had individuals who have sought to �secularize� us. Our communities are Christian churches and universities, and we have withstood the onslaught of those who would have us stop mentioning God or Christ because it might �offend� someone. I am also on the School Board for Round Rock Independent School District. We were informed last week by the Administration that there would no longer be an invocation at the graduations for our 5 high schools because someone might be offended. The Board members (all except 1) objected very vocally and long, however, it is considered an administrative prerogative and we cannot change that. I am brining up the issue of having an invocation at the beginning of each Board meeting�that IS something the Board can do! Maybe we as a nation need to be more concerned with offending God than offending other people! Please keep fighting the good fight and know that there are others of us quietly but strongly fighting with you in the trenches of political correctness. God bless you. YSIC, - Vivian Sullivan



Very refreshing to read Dr Paul's well thought out commentary especially after reading the previous week's cheap shot which I found offensive and digraceful. - M M sherbrooke Que



I believe that when you give, it should be done in a private manner, not announcing to the world how much you are giving. Giving is an act of obedience to God, not a way to show the world how �good� you are. - Sonia Kuppinger



Thanks for your article on charity and the need for human input as well as dollars. When our doctor son told us he was going to Uganda as a volunteer, we (his parents) were more than a bit concerned. He said it was his obligation. I see that he is correct. Now we pray for his safety as well as his success. - Gerald Schroeder



Dr. Paul, I truly appreciated your article, as you have put your finger on something that I too was feeling but could not quite articulate. The church has, for two millennia, been suffering alongside the poor selflessly, without any public fanfare, receiving only the rewards that the Lord himself gives. This is in stark contrast with the self-congratulatory nature of the Hollywood-ization of charity. Are we now supposed to think that Madonna, who publicly and regularly mocks our Savior by posing on a mirrored cross, is now some sort of saint because she has made a few trips (I'm quite sure in lavish comfort) to Africa and adopted a couple of children (skirting their laws by the way)? While this is, as you say, all well and good, her long career of serving as the poster child for sacrilegious and blasphemous behavior has, in my opinion, will far outweigh the influence of her trifles into charity. I think if these celebrities are serious, they should, as Christians have done for centuries, deny themselves, take up a cross and die for the sake of the poor, and stop mocking those who for centuries have been, for the most part, the only one's who have truly cared for the poor. Then and only then will they have true credibility beyond the current fad. Thanks again for your excellent article. - Frank Markow PH.D.



Thank you for an outstanding article! I for one am sick and tired of egotistical celebrities who love the "blowing of trumpets" everytime they do a good deed, which is frequently a PR stunt to mask an otherwise hedonistic lifestyle. And lets not forget that when these multi-millionaire gods consult with attorney's and publicists re their donation, the actual percentage of their income donated, could probably be equated to about 50 cents out of the pocket of the average wage earner. It's a heart issue and "where your treasure is; there will your heart be also." Where is their heart truly settled? That is the real issue. - Barry Hershey, PA
