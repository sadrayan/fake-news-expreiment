OBAMA'S JUDGMENTAL NON-JUDGE



BY MICHAEL SAVAGE



OBAMA HAS APPOINTED ANOTHER BIG SIS – ELENA KAGAN – TO BE THE NEXT JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT. THIS TIME HE’S PICKED A REAL PRIZE. KAGAN TRIED TO KICK THE MILITARY OFF THE HARVARD CAMPUS WHEN SHE WAS DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE OF “DON’T ASK, DON’T TELL,” JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HER ORIENTATION ON THAT ISSUE. SHE TOOK MONEY FROM GOLDMAN SACHS JUST LIKE HER BOSS, OBAMA. NOW THE EMPTY SKIRTS IN THE MEDIA ARE SAYING THAT SHE DOESN’T HAVE MUCH OF A “PAPER TRAIL” THAT WOULD REVEAL HER VIEWS ON ISSUES. BUT HER SENIOR THESIS AT PRINCETON WAS ENTITLED “TO THE FINAL CONFLICT: SOCIALISM IN NEW YORK CITY, 1900-1933.” SHE’S A NEW YORK CITY RADICAL MARXIST LAWYER THROUGH AND THROUGH.



NOW IN SPITE OF HER MARXIST BACKGROUND, WE KNOW THAT OBAMA IS REPLACING A LIBERAL WITH ANOTHER LIBERAL. SO THIS WILL NOT CHANGE THE IDEOLOGICAL CONTENT OF THE SUPREME COURT. BUT WHAT IS EVEN MORE WORRYING IS KAGAN’S COMPLETE LACK OF JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE. SHE HAS NEVER BEEN A JUDGE. SHE IS A JUDICIAL NON-ENTITY. THE SAME WAS TRUE OF HARRIET MIERS, WHOSE NOMINATION BY GEORGE W. BUSH IN 2005 I ALSO OPPOSED. IN FACT, IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE SAVAGE NATION THAT OUTRAGED CONSERVATIVES MADE THEIR ANGER KNOWN TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND MIERS’ NOMINATION WAS WITHDRAWN. KAGAN COULD SUFFER THE SAME FATE.



OF COURSE, IF IT’S UP TO THE WEAK-KNEED REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE SHE’LL PROBABLY SAIL THROUGH. LUGAR, KYL AND COBURN – SUPPOSEDLY ALL SOLID CONSERVATIVES – ALL VOTED IN FAVOR OF HER NOMINATION AS SOLICITOR GENERAL, AS DID THE R.I.N.O.s GREGG, COLLINS AND SNOWE. SO DON’T COUNT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO SAVE YOU FROM KAGAN OR EVEN FIGHT AGAINST HER. OBAMA SEEMS TO BE SAYING THAT BECAUSE SHE’S A JUDICIAL NON-ENTITY, THAT MAKES HER A “WELL-ROUNDED” NOMINEE. BUT HE ALREADY HAD CHRISTINA ROHMER, SONYA SOTOMAYOR AND JANET NAPOLITANO. OBAMA’S ORGANIZATION IS “WELL-ROUNDED” ENOUGH.
