While there have been some accusations of funny-business with the Current Population Survey – basically that when household refused to fill out the survey and the office was under time pressure, officer workers would just fill in the numbers – I think what Perry is referring to is the fact that the most common measure of unemployment doesn’t account for the fact that a) people have given up on finding worker and so dropped out of the labor force; and b) some people are working part-time when they’d rather be working full time. Is this deliberate? No, but does it mean that the official unemployment rate doesn’t give us an accurate picture of the health of the labor market? Sure. If labor force participation were the same today as prior to the recession, I believe the unemployment rate would be around 8.3%. So the idea that the labor market is really heathy today just isn’t that true.

Best regards,

Andrew
