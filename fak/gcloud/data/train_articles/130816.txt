Report: Alabama Woman Claims Reporter Offered Her $1000s to Accuse Roâ€¦
She's pretty detailed. and some of the details are confirmed. he was where she said he was and in a position to meet her and have it all happened

as opposed to say sometimes an accuser will say "He touched me in Minnesota on July 5, 1965" and they can prove they were in Africa.

She's very detailed. Fakes are usually less like the Jackie rolling stone story. they change their story. they're vague. they over do it.

here she was pretty reasonable. she didnt say they had sex. she didn't say she blew him. Groping over clothes.

that doesnt mean it's true. Just credible. Like Juanita Broaderick. Could be a lie. but it's not obviously so.

The worst part for her, in my opinion, is he didn't newly become prominent. and she didn't work for him. so the silence for this long is odder than if he suddenly became famous or he had been in a position to really hurt her. Why not come out when he was doing the 10 Commadnments thing, etc.
