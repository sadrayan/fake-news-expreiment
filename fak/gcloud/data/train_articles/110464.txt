What, you thought they’d be silent when their life’s work was reinterpreted?

American astrologers are up in arms after a report from the Minnesota Planetarium Society stated that due to the moon’s gravitational pull on Earth, the alignment of the stars was pushed by about a month. Since the constellations moved, then, Zodiac signs would be altered.

But leading astrological experts say this won’t change things at all. That’s because Western astrology strictly adheres to the tropical zodiac, which is fixed to seasons. The sidereal zodiac, observed in the East, is the one affixed to constellations, and is thus the one that would change. The tropical zodiac has been in place since Ptolemy’s in the second century.

“Astrology is geocentric,” astrologer Jeff Jawer told CNN. “It relates life on Earth to the Earth’s environment, and seasons are the most dramatic effect, which is why we use the tropical zodiac.”

So don’t go removing that Libra tattoo just yet. Unless you prefer being a Virgo now; then you can just disregard the astrological pushback. (via CNN)
