Carlos Beruff Blasts President Obama For Misleading The American People on Disastrous Iran Deal
Today, Carlos Beruff released the following statement in response to today’s New York Times revelations that the Obama Administration misled the American people on the Iran deal:

“I’ve said all along that President Obama is a terrible negotiator who negotiated with Iran like he was playing poker with his cards face up. But today’s report shows that it was actually much worse. While telling the public that negotiations began after Iran elected a ‘moderate’ leader, today’s report shows that the negotiations started much sooner. It’s clear that President Obama went into negotiations with one goal: to get a deal that would solidify his foreign policy legacy with the liberal elites, even at the expense of the long-term safety of the American people.

“Both Congressman Grayson and Congressman Murphy supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon. Do they still support the deal now that it’s been revealed that the Administration misled the American people and Congress? The people of Florida deserve an answer.”
