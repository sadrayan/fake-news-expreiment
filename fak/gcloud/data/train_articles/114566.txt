8. SOUNDBITE: (English) John F. Kennedy Jr., son of late US President John F. Kennedy:

"...over a quarter of century ago my father stood before you to accept the nomination for the presidency of the United States. So many of you came into public service because of him. In very real sense because of you he is with us still, and for that I am grateful to all of you..

I owe a special debt to the man his nephews and nieces call Teddy not just because of what he means to me personally

but because of the causes he's carried on. He has shown that an unwavering commitment to the poor, to the elderly, to those without hope, regardless of faction or convention is the greatest reward of public service."

I'm not a political leader but I can speak for those of my age who have been inspired by Teddy to give their energy and ideas to their communities and not to just for themselves. In that ongoing effort...all of you will be guided by the honorable and unyielding example of the senior Senator from Massachusetts. He has shown that our hope is not lost idealism but a realistic possibility. America is better because of the leadership of Edward Kennedy. May he continue to guide us for many years to come. Ladies and gentleman, my uncle Ted Kennedy."
