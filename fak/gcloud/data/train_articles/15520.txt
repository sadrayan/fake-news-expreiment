Our statement:

As a father of three children in public schools, Senator Hegar believes in adequately funding our education system. Providing innovative ways to educate our children is vital to the success of our state. For over a year, Senator Hegar has been running a positive campaign about his vision for the future of Texas. To the contrary, our opponent has no vision and their entire campaign amounts to a distortion of truth and negative campaign commercials. Texans deserve better, and they want a Comptroller with honesty, integrity, and character. That person is without a doubt, Glenn Hegar.

From the statement below, I can’t tell if you’re confirming Hegar expressed pride in the 2011 cuts or saying he meant otherwise. Maybe it’s something else entirely?

If you read the news article it is clear that we feel he pulls Senator Hegar’s comments out of context.
