Welcome to PPEP.org
PPEP, Inc. was founded by Dr. John David Arnold aboard a 1957 Chevy bus named “La Tortuga (tortoise)” with a $19,000 grant from the Tucson Committee for Economic Opportunity on August 24, 1967. Its mission was to “improve the quality of rural life.” Four decades later PPEP remains dedicated to carrying out the dreams of its first Bracero migrant farm workers students for a better way of life.
