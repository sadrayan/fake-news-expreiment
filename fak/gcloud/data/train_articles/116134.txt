Abused dog from Taiwan finds a sweet home in the U.S.

TAIPEI, Taiwan -- “Once I met him, I knew it was a perfect match,” Erin Zickenberg talked of her first sight with her new dog, Adam that was rescued in Taiwan.

Zickenberg, a retired computer specialist who just lost her husband, read the story of Adam on the Web site last December. “When I found out he was coming to my area of Washington, it seemed like he was being sent for me,” said Zickenberg.

Adam was a mixed dog that was rescued after being splashed with corrosive chemicals last September in a park in Taiwan, said Antony Ni, a volunteer worker with Animal Rescue Team Taiwan (ARTT).

The puppy was found covered with blood, its ears flipped backwards and the right eye severely damaged.

The volunteer workers and netizens raised more than NT$50,000 donations online for the expenses for its two-month long medical treatment.

ARTT put Adam's story on Petfinders, a leading Web site for pet adoption in the U.S.; the post topped the most-read chart on the site for two weeks.

“I just needed something to need me; I have my heart for him regardless what scars he has,” said Zickenberg, who decided to welcome Adam into her family during the Christmas season, when she described as a particularly painful time for her to face her husband's death.

The match was not only a new form of life for Zickenberg, but also for Adam, which just got a new name, Lucky, from its foster parent, because “he is a lucky dog to have been rescued and taken care of by the rescue project in Taiwan.”

According to Zickenberg, Lucky is well trained and weights 20 pounds, 6 pounds more than he weighed a month ago.

Zickenberg appreciated all the love and help that had been given to Lucky, who is now a healthy and happy dog.
