'Trump effect' in Ohio: Democrats switched to vote in GOP primary
More than three times as many Democrats became Republicans in Ohio's primary as vice versa, newly released figures from the secretary of state's office show. It's yet another example of how Donald Trump is turning the 2016 election upside down. While no one can say why people voting with secret ballots switched parties, Ohio political leaders agree that some undoubtedly crossed over to the GOP side to help block Trump, but many others switched to cast a ballot for the billionaire.

More than three times as many Democrats became Republicans in Ohio�s primary as vice versa, newly released figures from the secretary of state�s office show.

It�s yet another example of how Donald Trump is turning the 2016 election upside down.

While no one can say why people voting with secret ballots switched parties, Ohio political leaders agree that some undoubtedly crossed over to the GOP side to help block Trump, but many others switched to cast a ballot for the billionaire.

How all those changes will shake out for the fall election will go a long way toward determining whether Trump or Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton takes must-win Ohio.

In the counties containing Youngstown and Steubenville, more than a quarter of the GOP voters in the March 15 primary had been Democrats, the new statistics show. Trump easily carried both counties, as well as several others with high Democratic crossover rates.

�This geography and the demography behind it is likely to be an asset to Trump,� said veteran political scientist John Green of the University of Akron. �The key is whether he turns off base Republican voters, such as upper status, older suburban women.�

Ohio Republican Chairman Matt Borges noted that state GOP rolls swelled by nearly a million, putting the party�s registration at more than 2.2 million. That compares with 1.4 million for Democrats � 630,000 more than before the primary � marking one of the biggest gaps in modern Ohio history. About 115,000 of the new Republicans had been Democrats while fewer than 35,000 Republicans became Democrats.

Regardless of how many of the new registrants will stick with the GOP, Borges said a key is that the party now can develop data on thousands more Ohioans and market its candidates to them.

Ohio Democratic Chairman David Pepper said he thinks most of the crossover Democratic voting represented anti-Trump ballots rather than support for the GOP or Gov. John Kasich, who won the primary by 11 points.

However, Pepper acknowledged that the Ohio River counties won by Trump will be battlegrounds in November � especially on such matters as economic issues.

�Obviously, Donald Trump is sounding more like a Democrat than a Republican on trade. That might appeal to some,� Pepper said. �As Democrats, we must talk to that part of state about plans to lift places like that ... and make it clear that Donald Trump�s plans aren�t going to help.�

Kyle Kondik, author of �The Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President,� said the primary map may prove an indicator of what�s to come in the fall.

�It is not hard to imagine Trump at least modestly improving on Mitt Romney�s 2012 performance in some economically distressed areas like Appalachian Ohio,� Kondik said.

�However, it�s also quite possible that Trump underperforms Romney in some of Ohio�s bedrock Republican counties � wealthy, well-educated areas like Delaware and Medina counties. To the extent that Trump turns off Republicans, it might be establishment-style voters in economically vibrant places. In other words, any gains Trump makes could be more than canceled out by losses in other parts of the state.�
