Nearly Twice As Many People As Live In Kansas City Attended The Royals' Parade
Kansas City mayor Sly James estimated that 800,000 people turned out to watch the Royals’ championship parade (at least one police sergeant thought it was higher), which is even more impressive when you realize that Kansas City’s population is just 470,000. But while it’s one thing to hear a number like 800,000, it’s quite another to see it.

And these are just partial shots of those that stuck around after the parade to hear players like Jonny Gomes speak. The zoomed out shot of this crowd is staggering.

The Royals’ 2.3 mile-long parade route, snaking north and then south through downtown, was packed 15-to-20 deep on both sides, as seen in this video.

Just for good measure, here are a few more great shots from the festivities.
