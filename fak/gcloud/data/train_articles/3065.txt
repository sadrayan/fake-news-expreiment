San Francisco – Kindergarten to College (K2C)

CFED helped develop the pioneering Kindergarten to College savings account program in the City of San Francisco, in partnership with San Francisco Mayor’s Office, the Office of the Treasurer, the Department of Children, Youth, & Their Families and the San Francisco Unified School District, and with support from EARN and the New America Foundation. The Kindergarten to College program was the first publicly funded universal CSA program in the United States. The program opens a savings account seeded with a $50 deposit for every child entering kindergarten in San Francisco public schools, and children eligible for free or reduced price lunch receive an extra $50. Participants can earn additional incentives for saving steadily for six months. The savings account is then coupled with a financial education component.

St. Louis -- College Kids

The Office of St. Louis Treasurer Tishaura Jones launched College Kids in fall 2015. The program automatically provides every kindergartener in St. Louis public or charter schools with an account seeded with $50 at a local credit union. The program also provides incentives to grow accounts, such as saving matches and bonuses for good attendance at school. Savings in the accounts can be used to pay for postsecondary education.
