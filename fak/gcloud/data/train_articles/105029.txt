Nikki Haley Just ACCIDENTALLY Confessed To Being “Romantically Involved” With Trump!
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley is tearing into the online rumors claiming that she is having an affair with President Trump as “disgusting” and “offensive” as well an unfair evaluation of women in powerful positions.

During a recent interview with Politico, Haley claimed that the rumors being instigated by author Micheal Wolff are “absolutely not true.”

She explained that she has never talked once to the president about her personal future and that she is never alone with Trump behind close doors.

“So the idea that these things come out, that’s a problem,” she told Politico’s Women Rule podcast.

“But it goes to a bigger issue that we need to always be conscious of: At every point in my life, I’ve noticed that if you speak your mind and you’re strong about it and you say what you believe, there is a small percentage of people that resent that and the way they deal with it is to try and throw arrows, lies or not.”

In his controversial book “Fire and Fury,” Wolff states that Trump had been spending “a notable amount of private time with Haley on Air Force One and was seen to be grooming her for a national political future.”

Wolff also informed HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” that he was “absolutely sure” Trump was involved in an affair.

Wolff has yet to respond to Politico’s request for a comment on Haley.

“I saw this as a legislator. I saw this when I was governor. I see it now. I see them do it to other women,” she said. “And the thing is, when women work, they prioritize, they focus, and they believe if you’re gonna to something, do it right.”
