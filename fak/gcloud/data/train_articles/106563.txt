First lady did not hire exorcist for White House
A spokeswoman for the first lady says multiple reports that Melania Trump had a ceremony to rid the White House of demons before moving in is false.

Stephanie Grisham said the reports that were shared widely on social media are “not true in any way.”

The stories originate from a broadcast with Indiana pastor and radio host Paul Begley, who said that Mrs. Trump said at her husband’s presidential inauguration that she would not move in to the White House until the residence was exorcised.
