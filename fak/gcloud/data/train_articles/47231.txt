Kid Rock for Senate? Hints, but Don’t Assume Anything
If Robert James Ritchie — also known by his rap-rock moniker, Kid Rock — is running for the United States Senate in Michigan, he hasn’t informed the Michigan Republican Party.

Of course, he could be running as a Democrat. But that would be a strange turn, given that Kid Rock endorsed then-candidate Donald J. Trump and then paid him a memorable visit at the White House after Mr. Trump won the election.

So what to make of Mr. Ritchie’s new website, “Kid Rock For Senate,” which he said in social media postings on Wednesday was “real” and would be followed by “a major announcement in the near future”?
