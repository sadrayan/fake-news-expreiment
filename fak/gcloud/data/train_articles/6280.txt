Congressman Davis Votes No on Wasteful Spending Package : Congressman Geoff Davis
Today, Congressman Davis voted against the Democrats’ American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (H.R. 1). The 647-page bill passed the House by a vote of 244 to 188.

Congressman Davis stated, “Once again, Speaker Pelosi has forced passage of legislation that is not in the best interest of the American people. This so-called ‘stimulus’ legislation is full of pet spending projects that will do very little to restore confidence in our economy or create jobs. My Republican colleagues and I tried to work with the Democrats to improve this bill, and even met with President Barack Obama on two occasions to discuss our ideas for reinvigorating the economy, but ultimately, we were shut out of the process. When all is said and done, this bill will cost Americans over one trillion dollars, and is only expected to reduce the unemployment rate by maybe one percent.

“President Obama has promised us a new era of bipartisanship. I hope he will encourage Speaker Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic Majority to reach across the aisle and work with Republicans so we can craft a true stimulus package that will provide relief for families, businesses and communities across the nation.”

Instead of focusing on efficient policies that will lower taxes and create jobs, H.R. 1 includes (among other things):

- $600 million for the federal government to buy new cars;

- $200 million for landscaping the National Mall;

- $50 million for The National Endowment for the Arts;

- $335 million for STD education funding;

- $400 million for global warming research;

- $1 billion for Amtrak;

- $462 million for equipment, construction, and renovation of facilities at the Centers for Disease Control; and

- $150 million for repairs to Smithsonian Institution.

“While reasonable individuals can argue the merits of some of this spending through the annual budget process, there can be little argument that it meets President Obama’s call for a stimulus plan that will ‘immediately jumpstart the economy,’” Congressman Davis added.

“Every dollar spent by this package must first be borrowed. This fact makes it even more important that the entire package be ‘timely, targeted and temporary.’ This is a standard initially advocated by Speaker Pelosi herself and one this package clearly fails to live up to.”

Between 2009 and 2019, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the interest costs related to borrowing the money needed to finance this plan will cost an additional $347 billion, bringing the total cost of the bill to well over $1 trillion dollars.

Many supporters of this legislation argue the necessity of seriously reinvesting in our nation’s infrastructure. This line of argument avoids the fact that only three percent of all the funding ($30 billion) is allocated in H.R. 1 for “shovel ready” road and highway spending.





House Republicans offered a real stimulus proposal that would create more than six million jobs over the next two years – twice as many jobs for about half the cost of the Democrat plan. Click HERE to learn more about how these numbers are derived using the research and methodology of President Obama's Senior Economic Advisor. The alternative proposal would also reduce taxes for families and small businesses, eliminate funding for thirty-two new programs created by H.R.1, expand and improve the homebuyer tax credit, and eliminate federal taxes on unemployment benefits.

The Republican substitute was defeated by a vote of 170 to 266.

Next week, Congressman Davis will release his weekly column that will examine H.R. 1 and the Republican substitute proposal in additional detail.
