Sheriff: Deputy shoots man who tried to run him over
Anderson County deputies are investigating an officer-involved shooting on Archie Street in Piedmont.

Sheriff John Skipper said deputies were investigating the report of a red truck's connection to recent four-wheeler thefts in the Piedmont area along Archie Street Thursday.

While stopped to talk to the people inside the truck, Skipper said a deputy heard someone say "go, go, go" and a separate car then tried to run the deputy over.

The deputy fired a shot, hitting the driver once, Skipper said. He said the driver was taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital while the other person in the black sedan was taken into custody on outstanding warrants.

Skipper said Jeremiah J. Holdbrooks, 29, was arrested at the scene while Billy Joe Crane, 27, was the person who was shot. He did not say what charges either man may face.



Skipper said they later learned the black car was stolen. The State Law Enforcement Division was called in to investigate, which is standard protocol with officer-involved shootings.

Holdbrooks appeared before a judge Friday morning and was denied bond on charges of reckless driving, failure to stop for blue lights and driving under suspension.

Crane was charged with attempted murder, receiving stolen goods and possession of meth or cocaine base, according to the detention center website. He is expected to appear in court later Friday.
