Left's reaction to Trump 'alarming'
A possible explanation of the political environment comes from Roger Kimball, writing in The New Criterion: "The left fears "a bogeyman of their own manufacture. At least since the Sixties, the left-liberal consensus in America has worked to undermine traditional notions of decency, order, merit and achievement. So monolithic was that consensus that a sudden reversion to normality came as a terrifying disillusionment. Hence the surreal, paranoid and tantrum-filled response of the coddled beneficiaries of our society. We think of a mot attributed to Teddy Roosevelt: 'To anger a conservative, lie to him. To anger a liberal, tell him the truth.'"
