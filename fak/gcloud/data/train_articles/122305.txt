National Hospital Insurance Fund Official WebSite
Welcome back to the National Hospital Insurance Fund site. Our mission is to support the financing of healthcare and related services in Kenya. NHIF’s core function is to collect contributions from all Kenyans earning an income of over Ksh.1000 ($12) and pay hospital benefits out of the contributions to members and their declared dependants (spouse and children).



Whilst ensuring that Kenyans of all walks of life have access to quality and affordable healthcare, NHIF operates under the social principle that ‘the rich should support the poor, the healthy should support the sick and the young should support the old. Being the only health insurance provider of its kind in the region, the team is committed to steering the Fund to greater heights of prosperity and retain its cutting edge position as a leading health insurance provider.
