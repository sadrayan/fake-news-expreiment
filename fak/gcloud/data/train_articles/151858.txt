RealDonaldTrFan is creating President Trump Parody
to the President Donald J Trump Twitter Parody account available at https://twitter.com/RealDonaldTrFan I'm just a regular guy who loves to see people smile by writing Donald Trump parody. I do this by myself (no team of writers), and during my free time; and trust me, it can be time consuming and mentally draining (imagine if you forced yourself to intentionally read about where Donald Trump is, watch videos of him, and read what he says every day). If you've gotten some value (or at least a few laughs) from @RealDonaldTrFan , I hope you'll consider buying me a beer or a cup of Covfefe to help me keep going throughIt's basically a way for patrons (that's you) to show appreciation for creators (me), and to encourage creators to keep creating (like me writing parody). Many creators like Mozart, Shakespeare, and Leonardo da Vinci (not the ninja turtle) had patrons - although all three of them have crappy Twitter accounts.The @RealDonaldTrFan Trump Parody twitter account is having great success. I started it in December 2016. It has now grown to 235,000 followers. At this growth rate of 235,000%, I figure I'll have 800 trillion followers by 2019. Katy Perry @katyperry with her measly 100 million followers will be SO jealous! My tweets have been featured in news outlets like Time, Mashable, and several international outlets. Many famous people follow me like movie stars (shout out to Mark Hamill, Chelsea Handler, and Ricky Gervais) and TV stars, news producers & reporters, famous athletes, a governor of a Northeast State, a member of congress & a porn star - (no - not Stormy)! Usually I don't want people of questionable ethics following me, but I made an exception for the member of congress.If a couple of dollars a month sounds like too much of a commitment, I created a PayPal link https://www.paypal.me/RealDonaldTrFan that you can use to send a one time amount directly to me. Or you can also buy me a coffee at https://www.buymeacoffee.com/RealDonaldTrFan Thanks! :)Now available on Facebook! www.facebook.com/RealDonaldTrumpParody Sometimes I get too many direct messages on Twitter to read before they disappear, so if you have questions, offers of full-time employment (like offering me live twittering gigs at kids' birthday parties), marriage proposals, book deal offers, etc., you can e-mail me at [email protected]
