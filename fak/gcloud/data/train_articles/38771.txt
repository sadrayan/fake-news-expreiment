Gangs — FBI
Transnational Anti-Gang (TAG) Task Forces

The Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street gangs continue to expand their influence in the United States. FBI investigations reveal these transnational gangs are present in almost every state and continue to grow their memberships, now targeting younger recruits more than ever before. To counteract this growth, the Transnational Anti-Gang (TAG) Task Force initiative. TAG Task Forces are currently located in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

The TAG Task Force program’s mission and focus is to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle transnational gangs in these three Central American countries, as well as to collect and disseminate intelligence to support related U.S.-based investigations. TAG Task Forces collaborate with host nation agencies to investigate gangs at the transnational level, including by identifying members and groups, or cliques, along with their areas of operation and their leadership structure.

Each TAG Task Force is staffed with FBI personnel and vetted law enforcement officers from the Policía Nacional Civil (PNC) of their respective countries. TAG Task Forces annually train officers in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras on gang-related issues, as well as conduct officer exchanges with FBI field offices to facilitate intelligence-sharing and best practices. In addition to providing training and guidance to PNC officers, FBI personnel assigned to TAG Task Forces also work collaboratively on national and international investigations targeting the Ms-13 and 18th Street gangs.

The TAG Task Force initiative also oversees the Central American Law Enforcement Exchange (CALEE) program, which creates opportunities for U.S. and Central American law enforcement personnel to participate in exchange programs to strengthen gang prevention and intervention techniques and to build law enforcement capacity.
