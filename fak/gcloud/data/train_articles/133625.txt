About the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program
The Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides a comprehensive system of HIV primary medical care, essential support services, and medications for low-income people living with HIV who are uninsured and underserved. The Program funds grants to states, cities/counties, and local community-based organizations to provide care and treatment services to people living with HIV to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV transmission among hard-to-reach populations.

More than half of people living with diagnosed HIV in the United States receive services through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program each year. That means more than half a million people received services through the Program.

Over the last 28 years, HRSA’s Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program has played a critical role in the United States’ public health response to HIV. The Program serves as an important source of ongoing access to HIV medication that can enable people living with HIV to live close to normal lifespans. In 2017, 85.9 percent of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients were virally suppressed, exceeding the national average of 59.8 percent.

First authorized in 1990, the Program is funded at $2.34 billion in fiscal year 2018. The Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB).
