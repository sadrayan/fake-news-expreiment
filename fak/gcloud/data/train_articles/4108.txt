Non-U.S. citizen indicted in Tarrant County for illegally voting in Dallas County
The Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office says a Grand Prairie woman who’s not a U.S. citizen has been indicted by a grand jury for illegally voting in several Dallas County elections dating back to 2004.

Dallas County Election Administrator Toni Pippins-Poole confirms: Rosa Maria Ortega has voted in five elections in Dallas, including two Republican primaries. She also voted in three general elections — in 2005, 2010 and 2012. She most recently voted in May 2014, in the GOP gubernatorial primary runoff.

Dallas County’s elections chief says Ortega’s voter registration was canceled on April 10 of this year. Pippins-Poole says that’s when Dallas County elections officials learned that Ortega had registered to vote in Tarrant County.

Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney Sharen Wilson’s office says Ortega actually tried to register there twice, but had her application rejected by the elections office.

“This is a big deal,” Wilson said in a prepared statement. “People insist this kind of thing doesn’t happen, but it’s happening right here at home. The principle of one citizen, one vote is one of our most fundamental rights as U.S. citizens, and must be protected.”

Wilson’s office has been investigating Ortega along with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office. Pippins-Poole says she sent Ortega’s voter registration and voting history to Austin in September, and found out Ortega had been indicted and arrested on Friday.

“Just like any voter she filled out an application,” says Pippins-Poole. “And there’s a question: ‘Are you a citizen?’ You check yes or no. And on her application, she checked yes.”

If convicted, Ortega’s facing two to 20 years in prison. She’s due in court again on Nov. 18.
