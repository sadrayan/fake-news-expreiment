Shaheen releases tax returns in Senate race
U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen released eight years of tax returns Tuesday showing she and her husband earned on average more than $474,000 per year.

The Democrat, elected to the Senate in 2008, is seeking re-election in November and by laws governing political candidates must disclose certain financial information.

The joint returns released also show Jeanne and William Shaheen paid an average tax rate of 23.2 percent from 2006 through 2013. William Shaheen founded the Shaheen & Gordon law firm.

"Senator Shaheen is keeping her word about releasing her tax returns and going above and beyond what is required by law in her commitment to transparency," campaign spokesman Harrell Kirstein said.

One of her possible Republican opponents in November, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, released his tax returns last week, showing he and his wife averaged about $455,000 in income over the eight years and paid an average tax rate of 23.6 percent.

The most the Shaheens earned was $676,642 in 2012; the least was $186,787 in 2010 due mostly to investment losses, primarily in JID Software LLC. Jeanne Shaheen also earned up to $29,000 each year from 2006-2008 for teaching and speaking engagements. She was elected to the Senate in November 2008.

The couple donated between 1.9 percent and 7 percent of their income to charity.

The couple made most of their money from investments, her income as a senator and his income from his law firm. They filed for an extension of the 2007 tax year in 2008, submitted an amended return and paid $564 in interest and penalties. The couple has received a refund each of the last four years.

Kirstein said the family's home in Madbury is in Jeanne Shaheen's name while the majority of the investments and business interests are in William Shaheen's name.
