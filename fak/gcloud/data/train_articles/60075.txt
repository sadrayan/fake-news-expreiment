Here’s exactly how long it has been since Hillary Clinton held a news conference

The presumptive Democratic nominee for president in 2016 has not held a news conference in 2016.

This has become a source of consternation to the media, as expressed by Washington Post colleague Margaret Sullivan earlier this week: "The candidate, famously opaque, answered a grand total of seven questions [in Iowa] on Dec. 4, 2015. Since then, although she’s given individual interviews, she hasn’t made herself available for general media questioning."

CNN's Jake Tapper asked Clinton about this at the end of May. She responded that she had "done nearly 300 interviews just in 2016" and that it was "important to continue to speak to the press as I'm doing right now."

In Sullivan's view, that's not enough. "She gets her message out in ways that are completely controlled," she wrote. "But American citizens deserve better."

Clinton's likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump, has used her failure to hold a news conference against her.

I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2016

Trump's count dates to May. So how long has it been, as of now?

Thanks to the twin magics of math and computers, we can answer that concretely.

We had a similar counter like this in the primaries, too, marking how long it had been since Clinton answered a question from the news media. She's doing a bit better now, but, as Sullivan notes, there's a distinct difference between a scheduled interview and a full news conference.

Until such time as Clinton embarks on the latter, the little clock above will continue its march to eternity.
