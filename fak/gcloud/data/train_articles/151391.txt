Key Moments in the Downfall of Anthony Weiner
The revelation that the federal authorities had found a trove of emails related to their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server appear to be the latest fallout from an unlikely source: Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who once represented New York in Congress and also ran for mayor.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating the contact by Mr. Weiner, whose political career collapsed a few years ago because of his online indiscretions, with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. On Friday, federal law enforcement officials said that emails related to the case involving Mrs. Clinton had been found on a computer belonging to Mr. Weiner, whose estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a top aide to Mrs. Clinton.

Here are key moments in Mr. Weiner’s long fall from grace.
