Kid Rock doubles down on Senate bid: 'It's not a hoax'
Kid Rock has reiterated his aspirations to run for the U.S. Senate, while also promising to release new music and bashing the news media.

A day after reporters questioned whether the “Bawitdaba” singer’s political ambitions were genuine or just a publicity stunt, he wrote on his website Thursday that he has 15 days from his announcement to file paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission.

Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, also pledged to do double duty while on the campaign trail. “Like politicians write books during their campaigns, I’m planning on putting out music during mine and IT ALL STARTS TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT,” he wrote. “It’s not a hoax, it’s a strategy and marketing 101!”

An avowed Trump supporter who visited the Oval Office in April, Kid Rock launched a “Kid Rock for U.S. Senate” website on Wednesday. Should the 46-year-old Michigan resident end up on the ballot in November 2018, he’ll be up against Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who first won the seat in 2000.

Responding to Kid Rock’s new website Wednesday, Stabenow said, “I know we both share a love of music. I concede he is better at playing the guitar, and I’ll keep doing what I do best, which is fighting for Michigan.”

Kid Rock referenced that statement Thursday, writing, “Senator Stabenow and I do share a love of music, although probably not the same kind. I concede she is better at playing politics than I am so I’ll keep doing what I do best, which is being a voice for tax paying, hardworking AMERICANS and letting politicians like her know that We the People are sick and tired of their bulls—!”
