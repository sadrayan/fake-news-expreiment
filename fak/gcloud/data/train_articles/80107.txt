Armed Conflict Survey 2017
The worldwide review of political, military and humanitarian trends in current conflicts.



The Armed Conflict Survey provides in-depth analysis of the political, military and humanitarian dimensions of all major armed conflicts, as well as data on fatalities, refugees and internally displaced persons. Compiled by the IISS, publisher of The Military Balance, it is the standard reference work on contemporary conflict.

The book assesses key developments in 37 high-, medium- and low-intensity conflicts, including those in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Israel–Palestine, Southern Thailand, Colombia and Ukraine.

The Armed Conflict Survey features essays by some of the world’s leading experts on armed conflict, including Mats Berdal, Elizabeth Jean Wood, Julia Bleckner, Nelly Lahoud, Carrie Manning and William Reno. They write on the following:

Whither UN Peacekeeping?

Conflict-related sexual violence

The Islamic State’s shifting narrative

The changing foundations of governance by armed groups

Rebel-to-party transitions

The authors’ discussion of principal thematic and cross-national trends complements the detailed analysis of each conflict at the core of the book.

The Armed Conflict Survey also includes maps, infographics and multi-year data, as well as the IISS Chart of Conflict.
