Buju Banton
One of the biggest musicians in Jamaican history, Buju Banton’s fusion of traditional roots rock, contemporary R&B and dancehall have garnered him an almost prophet-like status in his native Jamaica. This deejay and singer made a splash on the Jamaican charts with singles like “Bogle,” “Love Me Browning” and “Love Black Woman,” but he’s probably best known the controversial anti-gay song “Boom Boom Bye Bye.” Banton used his 2000 Unchained Spirit album, which delves into gospel and African highlife sounds, to expand his musical collaborations—artists such as Luciano, Morgan Heritage and Rancid are prominently featured on the release.
