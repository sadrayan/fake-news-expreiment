Guilty pleas in W. Michigan marijuana case stand
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) â€” Drug convictions will stand for two people in western Michigan who claimed the state's medical marijuana law should protect them in federal court.

An appeals court this week refused to throw out guilty pleas by John Marcinkewciz and Shelley Waldron, who were accused of growing 100 or more marijuana plants in Mecosta County, north of Grand Rapids.

They argued that federal anti-drug law is unconstitutional because it interferes with the ability of registered caregivers to grow medical marijuana in Michigan. But the appeals court says the U.S. Supreme Court made clear in 2005 that Congress can prohibit marijuana production and trump the states.

Michigan caregivers can assist five people and grow 12 plants for each.
