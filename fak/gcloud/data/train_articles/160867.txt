"Russian World" supporters fly "DPR" flag at yellow vest protest in Paris
The two men holding the flag were identified as French nationals Fabrice Sorlin and Xavier Moreau – both supporters of Russia-backed militants in the occupied Donbas.

During a yellow vest rally in Paris, two Frenchmen were photographed boasting the flag of the so-called "Donetsk People's Republic" terrorist organization.

The photo was posted on the WarGonzo Telegram channel.

The men were identified as supporters of Russia-backed Donbas militants, Fabrice Sorlin and Xavier Moreau.

According to the information published on the “Peacemaker” website, Xavier Moreau visited the occupied Donbas as an "observer" at the pseudo-elections of November 11 this year.

Fabrice Sorlin is the leader of the ultra-right organization Dies Irae ("Judgment Day") and a fan of the "Russian World." He also illegally visited the occupied territories of Donbas, after which he wrote a number of pro-Russian columns in French media.

As UNIAN reported earlier, another wave of yellow vest protests has swept through France on Saturday. Police vans and armored vehicles are seen along Paris streets. A total of 89,000 police officers have been deployed to ensure public order. Ahead of the rally, law enforcers detained more than 300 people they believed could cause trouble.
