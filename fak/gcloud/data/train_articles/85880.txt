Super Bowl 2018: Outraged Eagles fans fear game is fixed after seeing NFL ad (PHOTO)
UPDATE: Some Eagles players, feeling disrespected again, react to hearing about the controversial ad. The NFL called the ad a "regrettable mistake."

PHILADELPHIA -- An ad that appeared this week on the NFL's various social media platforms drew the ire of Eagles fans ahead of Sunday's NFC Championship Game against the Minnesota Vikings at Lincoln Financial Field, because it appears to predict the teams that will be playing in Super Bowl LII.

The advertisement, promoting a contest to win Super Bowl tickets, shows New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady opposite Vikings quarterback Case Keenum flanking the Super Bowl logo.

The ad below appears on the official, verified Facebook page of the NFL. Check out the screenshot captured Friday morning:

In addition to Eagles quarterback Nick Foles not being included in the photo, the copy for the advertisement for the contest is as follows:

Your team is headed to Super Bowl LII...and you could too! When you donate to United Way, you could score 2 club-level seats to watch the PATRIOTS vs. the VIKINGS battle it out for the coveted Super Bowl title! But...that's not all! You could also WIN pre-game sideline access + other cool perks! Don't pass up this touchdown experience - donate TODAY for your chance to WIN big

As expected, Eagles fans flooded the initial Facebook posts with angry comments and suggestions that the game is fixed:

The Vikings would be the first team to host a Super Bowl in the history of the game, but would first have to beat the Eagles on Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field to get there, and the Patriots would need to hold off the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game to make the contest's ad a reality.

NJ Advance Media has reached out to the NFL, and is awaiting comment about the ad as of Friday.
