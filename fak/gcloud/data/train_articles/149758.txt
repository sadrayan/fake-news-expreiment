Economic Survey 2018 Launched
Kenyaâ€™s economy is estimated to have expanded by 4.9 per cent in 2017 compared to a revised growth of 5.9 per cent in 2016. The slowdown in the performance of the economy was partly attributable to uncertainty associated with a prolonged electioneering period coupled with adverse effects of weather conditions. Generally, key macroeconomic indicators largely remained stable and therefore supportive of growth in 2017. Interest rates declined due to the impact of their capping that became effective in September 2016.

In the money market, the Kenyan Shilling strengthened against most of the major trading currencies but weakened against the Euro and the US Dollar in 2017. The current account deficit widened in the year under review on account of significant growth of imports against a slower growth of exports. There was a moderate build up in inflationary pressures mainly due to significant increase in oil and food prices during the year under review. Consequently, inflation rate rose from 6.3 per cent in 2016 to 8.0 per cent in 2017.

Performance across the various sectors of the economy varied widely, with Accommodation and Food services; Information and Communication Technology; Education; Wholesale and Retail trade; and Public Administration registering accelerated growths in 2017 compared to 2016. On the other hand, growths in Manufacturing; Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; and Financial and Insurance decelerated significantly over the same period and therefore dampened the overall growth in 2017.
