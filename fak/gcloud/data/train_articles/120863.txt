Club 33: Disneyland's Secret $25,000 Dining Club
Club 33 may just be Disneyland's worst kept secret. In fact, depending upon who you ask, there are staff that will give you directions to the "hidden" entrance and others that still adamantly deny its existence. Try calling Disneyland for an official comment on the club and you will be told that they are prohibited from talking about it at all.

Open since May of 1967, Club 33 was created by Walt Disney as a secret venue for entertaining important celebrities, politicians and park investors. Decorated with antiques personally chosen by Disney and his wife, it remains the only place in Disneyland that serves alcohol.

Located in New Orleans Square above The Pirates of the Caribbean ride, with no ornate signs to help you locate it, one would have to go looking for the door in order to find it. Even if you've never heard of the Club, chances are you've unknowingly walked passed it; there's just a small, simple "33" address plate marking the outside.
