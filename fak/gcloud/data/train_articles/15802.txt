Below is a response from Dr. Lyketsos. Please note that his response is to be used in its entirety.

My commentâ€”I put this out there with the understanding that it will be used as a whole. Quoting the first two sentences only would be out of context.

In my view, there is good evidence to support "a link" between playing football and long-term consequences of traumatic brain injuries such as developing CTE. The science however is still very limited in terms of the strength of the link and many other important aspects of this link. The research that would be necessary to clarify these issues is costly and will take a long time to complete.
