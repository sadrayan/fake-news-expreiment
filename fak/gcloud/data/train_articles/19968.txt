Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families
The Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families (LIHF) is a collaborative effort in Wisconsin to support African American women and their families to have healthy birth outcomes.

Wisconsin has one of the worst black-white disparities in infant mortality in the United States. The Wisconsin Partnership Program supports the Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families to advance policy, systems, and environmental changes to address the root causes of why these disparities exist.

LIHF builds multi-level strategies that support equitable birth outcomes. Infant and child well-being is a reflection of access to health care and health information, as well as the social, economic, and physical environments that support health. LIHF strives to impact all of these areas to ultimately impact infant mortality in Wisconsin.
