O’Reilly Goes Ballistic Over Denver Post Hiring Pot Editor: They’re ‘Promoting Intoxication!’
Bill O’Reilly has managed to find a non-War on Christmas™ story to be outraged about this month: The Denver Post hiring a pot editor. And despite the protestations of Juan Williams and Mary Katharine Ham, O’Reilly was beyond outraged that such a prominent paper would promote public intoxication, though he was rather insistent that no one could make a fair comparison between a pot editor and someone reviewing alcohol.

O’Reilly said that no paper would ever, ever hire a “booze editor.” Williams pointed out the obvious: that wine critics exists. And there are plenty of newspapers that have wine critics. But O’Reilly shot back that unlike the pot editor, wine critics aren’t dealing with “an intoxication deal.”

Ham joined Williams in rare agreement, telling O’Reilly it’s a “serious public policy issue” that’s become all the more important by legalization in Colorado. O’Reilly kept insisting it’s outrageous, even jumping back into the alcohol pool again. Williams again had to cry, “There are reviews of wine!”

O’Reilly shot back, “You can drink wine without being inebriated!” He found this beyond disgusting and abhorrent, predicting that the paper “promoting intoxication” will assuredly “lead to more DUIs.”
