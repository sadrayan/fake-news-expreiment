"...one naked, undergarment, invisible man, with Liberace and puffed rice for all." Actual pledge I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Strong Bad commenting on Homestar Runner 's site intro "I mean, what the crap was [Homestar] even saying there? 'Everybody, now bleed a beetle'? No! Ewww. 'Everybody, law deed will be dull'? Uhhhh, no kidding. 'Everybody, something the feed mill'?"

Mondegreens are the phenomenon of mishearing lines, normally song lyrics, but poetry is also a frequent victim. Sometimes it's lack of correct enunciation, sometimes it's the speed or pitch that a lyric is delivered at, but often, a song lyric or recited poem will become famous not for what it says, but for what it sounds like it says to the uncareful ear.

Sometimes this is caused by bad diction, or bizarre lyrics. For a more in-depth look at the history of mondegreens and how they're used in various media, please see the Analysis Page.

A Gag Sub for a music video will probably be filled with mondegreens (and mostly works best if original and sub language are different ...unless the language is homophone-rich).

Can lead to Innocent Swearing if an innocent word is misheard as a profane one. Contrast Malaproper which is a character who mixes up words on a regular basis, and Beam Me Up, Scotty! which is for when the misheard line becomes more famous than the original. See also Lady Mondegreen, which is about something similar happening with character names in other works; Something Something Leonard Bernstein, where people understand part of the song but struggle to make up actual words from the rest; and Gosh Dang It to Heck!, when made-up words are used to sound like profane words.

Advertising

An ad for Cingular used this: two men are walking down the street and mangling the chorus of "Rock the Casbah" by The Clash. One sings it as "lock the cashbox", only to be briefly stunned when his friend sings it as "stop the catbox". He then agrees with that interpretation.

A commercial for T-Mobile plays with this trope: A guy sings along with Def Leppard's "Pour Some Sugar On Me", and mondegreens it into "Pour some shook-up ramen." His girlfriend is, of course, incredulous, and uses her T-Mobile cell phone to call the public library to get the librarian to look up the correct lyrics.

One ad for Comcast's "On Demand" service, has a man mangling the lyrics to "Born to be Wild" in the shower — and having Mr. T burst through his wall and reprimand him. No, seriously.

This Volkswagen Passat commercial has several people mishearing a line from "Rocket Man".

A GEICO commercial has Maxwell the pig listening to a rave on his smartphone and singing to the beat as "boots and pants and boots and pants...", getting strange looks from the people around him. (It's actually a basic beatboxing technique  another one is "boots and cats".)

(It's actually a basic beatboxing technique  another one is "boots and cats".) As reviewed by The Nostalgia Critic, this McDonald's ad from the 90s gets this because they say the words so fast that instead of advertising "food, folks, and fun," it sounds like they're advertising "food, fucks, and fun".

McDonald's ad from the 90s gets this because they say the words so fast that instead of advertising "food, folks, and fun," it sounds like they're advertising "food, fucks, and fun". Invoked in a Kmart commercial about having store merchandise shipped to your house. It involves a male talking about how he can "ship [his] pants", obviously expecting the listener to hear "Ship" as "shit". A later ad promoting savings on gasoline from purchases in store did similarly with "big gas savings ", expecting the listener to hear "big ass savings".

Anime & Manga

In Delicious in Dungeon, Shuro is later revealed to be Japanese-like warrior whose name is Toshiro but the Western-like cast misheard it.

In Yotsuba&!, this tends to happen anytime Yotsuba sings.

Pokémon: Butch and Cassidy invoke this on Jessie and James, accusing them of corrupting the Team Rocket motto whenever their paths cross. Butch and Cassidy rattle off the following lines: To infect the world with devastation! To blight all people in every nation! To denounce the goodness of truth and love! To extend our wrath to the stars above! Compare those to what Jessie and James say: To protect the world from devastation! To unite all peoples within our nation! To denounce the evils of truth and love! To extend our reach to the stars above!

The 2003 anime of Fullmetal Alchemist has this as a running gag. Any time Ed is called short, he will react violently and interpret whatever was said as a long-winded insult, even if no harm was intended. Poor Al is constantly forced to explain to Ed what he heard wasn't even close to what was said. Examples are below: "Who are you calling a tiny bug that escapes the wrath of a shoe because he's so small that he fits in the grooves and can't get squashed??!" "Who you calling a pipsqueak midget who can't even go to the beach because he's so small, he'd sink into the sand and when the tide comes in he doesn't even sink or have to worry about drowning because he's so microscopic he can breathe all the oxygen atoms in the water??!!"

Comic Books

In one issue of the Green Arrow story arc "Quiver," we learn that Stephanie Brown originally mistook Ra's Al-Ghul's name as "Rasta Guy."

In A DC comics New Year's special, Dick Grayson teases Barbara Gordon for having once thought "Auld Lang Syne" was about an "Old Lane Sign."

In Amelia Rules! Aunt Tanner uses her own mondegreening of "Still Rock'n'Roll to Me" by Billy Joel in An Aesop about why she still believes in Santa Claus: Tanner: "You shouldn't try to be a straight-A student if you already think too much." Amelia: Heh, heh. That's pretty good. Tanner: I thought so! It was, like, my motto - for years! But the thing is, one day I read the lyrics and they were completely different! "Should I try to be a straight-A student? If you are, then you think too much." ... I was devastated! But even knowing the new lyrics, it never replaced the one I'd made up...Do you know what I'm saying? Amelia: Um...Yeah. Santa is like Billy Joel...are, and the lyrics are Rudolph, and ... actually, no.

Comic Strips

"Deck the Halls with Boughs of Holly" was perpetually mondegreened in Walt Kelly's comic strip Pogo as "Deck Us All with Boston Charlie", and then again with Beauregard the Dog claiming that the lyrics are actually "Bark Us All Bow-Wows of Folly" (though the latter song is often mistakenly appended to the end of "Boston Charlie" these days), and then again when a hungry turtle sang the lyrics as "Dunk Us All In Bowls Of Barley." Even the "Deck Us All With Boston Charlie" itself got mondegreened at one point, as "Tinkle, Salty Boss Anchovy." Which caused Churchy La Femme to lament that "The way he's singing it, it don't make no sense!"

Calvin and Hobbes has Calvin intentionally mondegreening the pledge of allegiance as "I pledge allegiance to Queen Fragg, and her mighty state of hysteria..."

Peanuts: Sally is the queen of these. One story arc has Sally preparing for a Christmas pageant in which "I come out and say, 'Hark!', then Harold Angel starts to sing." Everyone assumes that she's simply confused by the name of the song...until a kid named Harold Angel actually shows up. Sally was known for these kinds of blunders. In another Christmas strip, she recites: "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care/In hopes that Jack Nicklaus soon would be there." In yet another, she tells her class the story of "Santa Claus and his rain gear."

Bloom County: One strip had Opus the penguin mangling "The Star-Spangled Banner" when he finds himself unable to remember the lyrics ("Oh say can you see, by the dawn's early light / what so proudly we snailed, at, um, the starlight's last cleaning..."). A Sunday Strip from September 1988 had that year's Presidential candidates George H. W. Bush, Michael Dukakis and Bill D. Cat each translate the notoriously Indecipherable Lyrics of "Louie Louie" based on what they could understand, as if it would tell the public something about them all. Since the ad was sponsored by Bill's Meadow Party, it takes jabs at Bush ("Iran-Contra thing makes me phlegm") and Dukakis ("Kitty she leads me everywhere") while saying Bill's gibberish translation, half of which outright defies transcription, "reveals a simple honesty."

In John Kovalic's comic strip Wild Life, Carson the Muskrat thinks the lyrics to his favorite U2 song are "I still haven't found Walter's cookie jar" (I still haven't found what I'm looking for)

In The Flight of Dragons, the closed captioning for the official VHS releases frequently substitute the word "horn" for the actual word "hoard".

Winnie the Pooh 2011: Pooh and his friends thought that Christopher Robin was kidnapped by a monster known as the Backson because Pooh actually mistranslated Christopher's message "I'll be back soon." Not the first time it's happened. In Pooh's Grand Adventure, Pooh and friends journeyed to rescue Christopher Robin from the terrible land of Skull. Actually he'd just gone to school.

The Hunchback of Notre Dame: The gargoyles mishear Esmeralda telling Quasimodo "Looks like Frollo's wrong about the both of us." as "Frollo's nose is long, and he wears a truss." note A truss is a tricorn-like headdress worn by judges in the Middle Ages. It's also an archaic device used to treat hernias. Which is itself often Mondegreened by viewers as "Frollo's nose is long and he wears a dress".

In Flushed Away, Roddy protests to the thugs looking for Rita that he's just an innocent bystander. They now think that Roddy's name is Millicent Bystander.

The Christmas short Olive, the Other Reindeer has this set off the plot. Upon hearing on the radio that one of Santa's reindeer is injured and that they'll be counting on "all of the other reindeer," Olive decides that Santa did not say this, but the title, and that she is not a dog at all, and that she is in fact, a reindeer. So she goes to the north pole to prove it. A bus driver later tells Olive that he used to think the pledge of Allegence was about him, Richard Stands. As in, "And to the Republic, for Richard Stands." There is also a character named "Round John Virgin" a common Mondegreen for the words "Round yon virgin" in Silent Night.

Near the end of Cars 2, Mater, Finn McMissile, and Holly Shiftwell are all captured by the Lemons and are trapped inside a giant clock tower in London, England. As the Lemons proceed to drop Mater into the clock's gears to shed him alive, the tow truck immediately yells, "Dad gum!", and as a result he accidentally deploys his weapons Finn and Holly gave him and blasting away the ropes suspending them over the clock gears, therefore freeing himself and allowing them to escape.

The DVD of Yellow Submarine has a blatant subtitling error in the "Sea of Science" segment; the chorus is subtitled "It's only a normal song". Whoever did the subtitles, the significance of the accompanying track being called "Only a Northern Song" evidently escaped them. (This problem is bypassed on the Blu-Ray, by the songs not being subtitled.)

Song" evidently escaped them. (This problem is bypassed on the Blu-Ray, by the songs not being subtitled.) At the end of Despicable Me 2, the minions cover "I Swear" (specifically, the version by All-4-One; the minions that sing it are dressed up like them). Being the minions, they mondegreen the entire song ; most noticeably, they sing the line "And I swear" as "Underwear".

The term was coined by Sylvia Wright in a 1954 essay in Harper's, She describes that as a young girl, she misheard the line "They hae slain the Earl o' Moray/And laid him on the green" from the 17th-century ballad "The Bonnie Earl o' Moray" as "They hae slain the Earl o' Moray/And Lady Mondegreen".

There was an article in a 1980s Reader's Digest in which the author recounted how, as a child, she thought that the first line went of The Star-Spangled Banner, "O say can you see, by the daunserly light" and kept "daunserly" as her secret, magical word. She was eventually corrected on this by her family when she decided that it couldn't hurt to share that magical word with her sister who, of course, initially had no idea what she was referring to.

This 1997 article in Billboard magazine discusses several mondegreens that Country Music radio program directors have heard from callers.

Adventures in Odyssey

Terry Wogan was once utterly perplexed by a listener's request for Wogan to play the song about Mulligan's Tyre on his radio show. Neither he nor the production staff could work it out. Intrigued, Wogan contacted the listener and asked. After listening to the fan hum a few bars and say "You know. The one with the bagpipes", the mystery became clear. Terry Wogan was then more than pleased to play Paul McCartney and Wings performing Mull of Kintyre.

Theater

In a theatrical parody called Rudolph the Red-Hosed Reindeer about a crossdressing/gay reindeer, the Snowman-narrator sings a song about a woman named "Sylvia Gould" until the Lumberjack corrects him that it's supposed to be "Silver and Gold."
