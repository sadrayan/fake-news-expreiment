Atiku Paid $10m To 10 Generals To Overthrow President Buhari
Former Vice President and People Democratic party’s Presidential candidate in just conclusion Nigeria presidential election, Atiku Abubakar has been accused of paying as much as ten million dollars ($10m) to a group of high-ranking Generals to overthrow President Buhari before the inauguration of his second tenure.

According to the report made available to My State News, Atiku was planning to sabotage the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.

Buhari Government has also reacted to the attempt of Atiku to truncate Nigeria democracy, saying that “the Federal Government has strongly decried the increasingly unpatriotic and desperate opposition politics being played by the PDP and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, warning that such dead-end opposition could be toxic for the nation’s democracy, if left unchecked.

“Never in the history of politics in Nigeria has an opposition party and its presidential candidate exhibited the kind of desperate tactics being deployed by the duo of the PDP and its flag-bearer, especially since President Muhammadu Buhari overwhelmingly defeated Atiku to win the 2019 presidential election.
