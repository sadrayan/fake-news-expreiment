Q2 ’18 Ratings: CNN Is a Top 10 Basic Cable Network, But Posts Losses in Prime Time
CNN remains the No. 3 cable news network in total viewers, but it’s still one of the most-watched networks on cable, and continues to stack up especially well against the basic cable competition across the 24-hour day.

Per Nielsen data, CNN had its third-best 2Q since 1996 in total day among total viewers, and among adults 25-54. Only Q2 2017 and Q2 2003 (Iraq War) were better quarters for CNN across the 24-hour day.

Among all cable networks, CNN ranked No. 10 in total viewers in prime time, and ranked No. 7 in total viewers in total day this quarter. This marks the 8th straight quarter and longest quarterly streak in over 22 years (since Q4 1995) that CNN is a top 10 cable network among total viewers in total day.

CNN was crushed by MSNBC in the prime time demo last year, but the network was able to earn a tie with its rival in the demo this Q2 (302,000 A25-54 viewers). It also defeated MSNBC in total day among adults 25-54 this quarter, and has now outperformed MSNBC for 17 straight quarters in total day in the key A25-54 demo.

But compared to Q2 of 2017, which was, to be fair, the network’s most-watched quarter ever across the 24-hour day (6 a.m. – 6 a.m. ET)., CNN was down in the key dayparts. The network was -12 percent in total prime time viewers, and -18 percent in the prime time demo versus Q2 of last year. It was also -16 percent in total day viewers, and -23 percent in the total day demo from last year.

Below are CNN’s average live-plus-same-day impressions for Q2 2017 (Nielsen data):

Prime time (Mon-Sun) : 929,000 total viewers / 302,000 A25-54

: 929,000 total viewers / 302,000 A25-54 Total Day (Mon-Sun): 658,000 total viewers / 202,000 A25-54

On the programming front , CNN New Day, which underwent a significant change recently with John Berman replacing a prime time-bound Chris Cuomo, is having its second-best Q2 on record, both among total viewers and in the key A25-54 demo. Only 2017 has been better for New Day. The same is true for The Lead with Jake Tapper, Erin Burnett Outfront, the 8 p.m. edition of Anderson Cooper 360, and CNN Tonight with Don Lemon (10 p.m.).

Cuomo Prime Time launched on June 4 averaged 1.12 million total viewers and 367,000 A25-54 for the month of June. Versus the prior four weeks, the Chris Cuomo-led program is +34 percent in total viewers and +36 percent in the key demo 25-54, but still sits third behind cable news’s signature personalities Sean Hannity and Rachel Maddow.

Last, but not from least, was CNN’s original programming, led by the late Anthony Bourdain. Season 11 of Parts Unknown averaged 1.17 million total viewers and 484,000 among adults 25-54 this quarter. Every episode this season was No.1 in its time period among adults 25-54.

United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell was also No. 1 in its time period among adults 25-54.
