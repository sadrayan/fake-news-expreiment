Feinstein Statement on Latest Attack on Women’s Reproductive Health
Washington—Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today released the following statement on the Senate bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy:

“The bill we’re voting on today is the latest attack in the decades-long Republican effort to eliminate a woman’s right to control her own body. This bill failed just two years ago. The fact that it’s being brought up again to appease Republicans’ political base is beyond the pale.

“Late-term abortions are often the result of tragic pregnancy complications including fatal fetal conditions and severe threats to a woman’s health. I’ve heard from women who were elated to be pregnant, only to discover a fatal fetal anomaly. Women facing these situations experience tremendous physical and emotional pain and must be able to make difficult decisions with their families and their doctors.

“The blanket ban in this bill makes no exception for a woman’s health. A woman would need to be at risk of death or irreversible harm to receive care under this bill. Any doctor who provided care to a woman before that point would be criminalized. This bears repeating: The bill denies health care to women until they are near death and criminalizes doctors.

“This is just another example of men making decisions about women’s health care based on a political ideology. It’s long past time that a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions and control her own destiny is respected. We will fight efforts to erode those rights at every turn.”
