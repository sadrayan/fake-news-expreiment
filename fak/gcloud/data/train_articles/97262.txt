Ralph Goodale, "Employment" on Feb. 26th, 2015
Kellie Leitch Minister of Labour and Minister of Status of Women

Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister just said, we are taking action, whether that be safety programs on reserves or providing matrimonial property rights to aboriginal women. Maybe that might be just making sure they have a supportive shelter to go to when they are in their time of need.

Now is the time for action, not for another study, such as the one the NDP wants. Now is the time to stand up for these women who have experienced these violent crimes.
