OSCE has no access to nearly half of occupied part of Donbas
The militants of the Donetsk and Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic terrorist organizations completely block access of the OSCE observers to the Russian-Ukrainian border in Luhansk and Donetsk regions, reads the report.

"A total of 46% of the militant-controlled territory is practically closed to the OSCE monitors," the report says.

Earlier, Deputy Chief Monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine Alexander Hug said that the aggressive behavior of militants at checkpoints prevented nightly monitoring in Donbas.
