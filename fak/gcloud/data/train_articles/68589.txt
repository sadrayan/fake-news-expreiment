Taped Friday, June 3 in Los Angeles, CA

TRUMP ON CONTROVERSY OVER JUDGE GONZALO CURIEL'S HERITAGE:

JOHN DICKERSON: How do his Mexican parents have to do with him not--ruling for you?

DONALD TRUMP: He is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. but I say he's got bias. I want to build a wall. i'm going to build a wallâ€¦.

JOHN DICKERSON: Isn't there sort of a tradition though in America that we don't judge people by who their parents were and where they came from?

DONALD TRUMP: I'm not talking about tradition--I'm talking about common sense, okay?



TRUMP ON WHETHER A MUSLIM JUDGE WOULD BE FAIR:

JOHN DICKERSON: If it were a Muslim judge, would you also feel like they wouldn't be able to treat you fairly because of that policy of yours?

DONALD TRUMP: It's possible, yes. Yeah. That would be possible, absolutely.



TRUMP ON SPEAKER RYAN'S POLICY AGENDA:

JOHN DICKERSON: But do you see yourself as implementing Paul Ryan's agenda as president, or is Paul Ryan implementing the Donald Trump agenda?

DONALD TRUMP: I think it's going to be a compromise, honestly. I can see a compromise.

TRUMP VOWS HE WON'T BACK DOWN ON MUSLIM BAN OR DEPORTATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DESPITE WARNING FROM SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL:

DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm not backing down. We have to do something. We have a problem in this country. We have a radical Islamic terrorism problem in this country. And by the way, throughout the world, throughout the world it's a problem. And it's a temporary ban. I'm not talking permanent. It's a temporary ban. We have to find out what's going on.

TRUMP CLARIFIES HIS SUPPORT FOR INTERVENTION IN LIBYA





***FULL TRANSCRIPT BELOW***

JOHN DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, on Thursday, Hillary Clinton gave a speech very tough on you, said that you wanted to bring back water-boarding, go after the families of terrorists, allow Saudi Arabia to have a nuclear weapon. She says you've said that you know more about ISIS than the generals. What policy of yours did she mischaracterize?



DONALD TRUMP: Well, number one, it was a whole, you know, written out by professionals, and just shot after shot. It was supposed to be foreign policy and it was really Trump policy. And she got it all wrong. I mean first of all, you know, she talked about that I want to nuke all of these countries. It's ridiculous. No, I want these countries to pay for protection. We are protecting them. We have $19 trillion in debt, it's very soon going to $21 trillion, John, in debt. And I want these countries to reimburse us at least for our cost...She made many statements that she knows were wrong.



JOHN DICKERSON: Do you still feel like you know more about ISIS than the generals?



DONALD TRUMP: Well, they don't know much, because they're not winning. That I can tell you. Now, I think they're not winning for a different reason. I think Obama's hurting them.



JOHN DICKERSON: How so?



DONALD TRUMP: It's -- Well from what I hear, it's being run from the White House. It's all being run from the White House. I've spoken to certain generals, I'll keep it quiet as to who, but highly respected people they say we could knock them out fast.

JOHN DICKERSON: In-office-now generals or retired generals--



DONALD TRUMP: If we had -- In one case in office, and in one case, out of office. And they said both of them said the same thing. If we had the leadership, meaning the go ahead, you could knock them out fast. But for some reason, Obama's not doing that.



JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about Libya. You've been highly critical of Libya and Hillary Clinton. You were also for military action to oust Gaddafi and military action to take care of that humanitarian situation in Libya. You supported that.

DONALD TRUMP: When you say I supported it -- I supported Libya?



JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah, you supported intervention--



DONALD TRUMP: --the attack?



JOHN DICKERSON: -- in Libya--



DONALD TRUMP: I did? Where do you see that?



JOHN DICKERSON: In a video blog from 2011, you said, "Now we should go in. We should stop this guy," this guy being Gaddafi, "which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives."

DONALD TRUMP: That's a big difference from what we're talking about.



JOHN DICKERSON: But you were for intervention--



DONALD TRUMP: Don't forget, I'm the only one, I made a lot of money with Gaddafi, if you remember. He came to the country and he had to make a deal with me because he needed a place to stay, he paid me a fortune, never got to stay there, and it became sort of a big joke. But the fact is that Libya was a disaster from the standpoint of the way it was handled. I mean--

JOHN DICKERSON: But you were for intervention, just to clear that up? I'm confused --



DONALD TRUMP: I was for something, but I wasn't for what we have right now. And right now, ISIS has their oil, John. ISIS is selling -- that's among the finest oil in the world. ISIS has taken over the Libyan oil. And we don't do blockades, we don't do anything, they're selling it, they're making a fortune with it. So we go out, we do Libya, we do it poorly, as poorly as you can do it. You can't do worse. And then now, if you look at what's happened, I mean, the end result is ISIS is selling the oil and it's a total mess.

JOHN DICKERSON: This is one of the things that confuses some people about your positions, though because --



DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead --



JOHN DICKERSON: --you said you weren't for intervention, but you were for intervention in Libya--



DONALD TRUMP: I didn't mind surgical. And I said surgical. You do a surgical shot and you take him out. But I wasn't for what happened. Look at the way - I mean look at with Benghazi and all of the problems that we've had. It was handled horribly.



JOHN DICKERSON: --because I think since then you've said you were never for intervention so it's confusing --

DONALD TRUMP: I was never for strong intervention. I could have seen surgical where you take out Gaddafi and his group.

JOHN DICKERSON: You said Hillary Clinton should go to jail. If the F.B.I., which is investigating, if there's no indictment, will your attorney general go after--



DONALD TRUMP: Okay. So I have spoken to and I've watched and I've read many, many lawyers on the subject, you know, so-called neutral lawyers. Okay? Not even on one side or the other. Neutral lawyers. Every one of them, without a doubt, said that what she did is far worse than what other people did, like General Petraeus, who essentially got a two-year jail term. General Petraeus and others had been treated, I mean, their lives have been in a sense destroyed. She keeps campaigning. I mean, what she did is a criminal situation. She wasn't supposed to do that with the server and the emails and all of the other. Now, I rely on the lawyers. These are good lawyers. These are professional lawyers. These are lawyers that know what they're talking about and know -- are very well-versed on what she did. They say she's guilty as hell.



JOHN DICKERSON: But it sounds like you're making a promise for your attorney general that if you were elected, this is one of the things, it's a commitment you were making. Basically.



DONALD TRUMP: Sure. Yeah.



JOHN DICKERSON: It's a commitment to how--



DONALD TRUMP: I would certainly have my, very fair, but I would have my attorney general look at it.



JOHN DICKERSON: Even if the investigation goes through--



DONALD TRUMP: And as you know, you have a five, and maybe even a six-year statute of limitations.



JOHN DICKERSON: But even if the current investigations don't find anything, you'd have your attorney general go back and--

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I would. Because everyone knows that she's guilty. Now, I would say this, she's guilty, but I would let my attorney general make that determination. Maybe they would disagree. And I would let that person make the determination.

JOHN DICKERSON: And what for you exactly is she guilty of?



DONALD TRUMP: She's guilty of the server, she is guilty of, you look at confidential information, I mean, all of the information that probably has gotten out all over the world, and then you know what else she's also guilty of? Stupidity and-bad judgment --

JOHN DICKERSON: But that's not, if that were criminal, we'd all be in jail--



DONALD TRUMP: No, no. I'm not even saying that part is criminal. But she's certainly guilty of that. In terms of this country, she is guilty of having just bad, bad-- how could she do a thing like this?



JOHN DICKERSON: But what do you get -- gets her to jail though? What's the difference here between rhetoric and law?



DONALD TRUMP: What the lawyers are saying is what she did in terms of national security - they have very strict rules and regulations, she's broken all of them.



JOHN DICKERSON: So the classification issue--



DONALD TRUMP: She's broken all of them. Of course it is. I mean, she's broken so much. But she's so-you know if you look at -- from the standpoint of why did she do it, judgment, the word judgment, this isn't criminal judgment, you make bad judgment. Although, actually, under those rules and regulations, judgment is even criminal. You know, you're not supposed to do it. If you make a mistake, they don't take that into account. Why would a person and how can a person with this kind of judgment become the president of the United States? Now, think of this. We're in a cyber world. This is a cyber world. This is a very complex - we're in a world like we've never been in before. If we're in a cyber world and she can't even handle her emails, how can she be president? And we're being hacked all over the place by Russia, by China probably, I mean, to the best of everyone's knowledge, it seems to be. But listen to this. So we're in a cyber world, and she's playing around with servers and emails. How can she be running this country?



JOHN DICKERSON: Let's move-



DONALD TRUMP: She doesn't know what she's doing.



JOHN DICKERSON: I want to move onto another development this week. Paul Ryan has now come out and endorsed you. You've talked to him several times. What -- which of his ideas, the famous Ryan ideas are most appealing to you?

DONALD TRUMP: He's most appealing. He's a good man. He wants good things for the country. We will agree on many things. We're not going to agree on all things. But we're going to agree on many things.



JOHN DICKERSON: For instance --



DONALD TRUMP: Paul Ryan, I think we'll agree on, as an example, he really focuses on poverty. He wants to take people out of poverty. So do I. And we're going to come up with a plan.



JOHN DICKERSON: Why do you think people are poor, by the way?



DONALD TRUMP: They're poor because they don't have jobs. They're poor in many cases because they don't have jobs. And I will tell you, I will bring jobs back to this country like nobody's ever seen before. And people like Carrier and Ford and Nabisco leaving Chicago and moving to Mexico, they're all moving to Mexico, I will stop that very quickly.



JOHN DICKERSON: But do you see yourself as implementing Paul Ryan's agenda as president, or is Paul Ryan implementing the Donald Trump agenda?



DONALD TRUMP: I think it's going to be a compromise, honestly. I can see a compromise.



JOHN DICKERSON: Because on issues of trade, entitlements, you and he, immigration, so trade, entitlement, immigration, those are no small issues. You are on exactly the opposite end of the-



DONALD TRUMP: we have some differences--



JOHN DICKERSON: Those aren't differences, you're on the opposite end of the--



DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, I don't know. I mean, to be honest, we've spoken about it very briefly. They're big subjects. You know what my deal is on trade? I want good deals. That's what my deal. When somebody says, "What is your position on trade?" I said, "I want good deals. Whether it's free trade not free trade, I don't care what kind of trade it is, I want good deals for our country." We don't make good deals. We have a trade deficit with China that is through the roof. We have a trade deficit with Mexico, we have a trade deficit with Japan. We make bad deals whether it's the military, whether it's trade. We only make bad deals.



JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about Mitch McConnell, on the Senate side, he was asked by CNN two things: one about the deporting the 11 million undocumented immigrants, which the president, by the way, called a fantasy. He said if you asked him to do that, he would say, "No, don't do it." He also said about the temporary ban on Muslim immigration, "No, don't do it." These are two big promises--



DONALD TRUMP: Sure, sure--



JOHN DICKERSON: --you've got millions of votes based on these promises. How are you going to get past the establishment to keep those promises--



DONALD TRUMP: You're going to have to watch and you're going to have to see. I've done a lot of things that nobody thought I could do - including sitting here with you --



JOHN DICKERSON: But you're not backing down on those promises based on the no from the senate--

DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm not backing down. We have to do something. We have a problem in this country. We have a radical Islamic terrorism problem in this country. And by the way, throughout the world, throughout the world it's a problem. And it's a temporary ban. I'm not talking permanent. It's a temporary ban. We have to find out what's going on.



JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about what does the Mexican heritage of the judge in the Trump University case have to do with anything?



DONALD TRUMP: I think it has a lot to do with it. First of all, I've had terrible rulings forever. I had a judge previous to him and it would have been a very quick case. This is a case I should've won on summary judgment. This is a case, and nobody writes this, and they all know it, but they don't like to write it, the plaintiff in the case was a woman. She was so bad that under deposition it was over. I mean, she couldn't have been the--it was a disaster. They went before the judge, they said, "We don't want her to be the plaintiff. We want to put somebody else in." So we said, "Well, that's fine. Dismiss the case. You have to dismiss the case." Wait a minute, she gave letters, the most incredible reviews of the college you've ever seen, of the university. She gave the most incredible. Then on top of it, we have a tape where she's talking about it in the most glowing terms. You wouldn't speak about your college--



JOHN DICKERSON: But Mr. Trump, what does this have to do with his parents came from Mexico, how does--



DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me, I'm just saying. We're getting terrible rulings. We go to the judge, we say to the judge, "Hey, you can't let her out of the case." He let her out of the case. We said, "Well, if you're going to let her out of the case, she's the plaintiff. If you're going to let her out of the case, the case is over." No, the case isn't over. Okay? Now-



JOHN DICKERSON: Give me the thought process, though, how does this work?



DONALD TRUMP: He has given me-My thought process --



JOHN DICKERSON: No, no, for him, how do his Mexican parents have to do with him not--ruling for you?



DONALD TRUMP: He is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he's got bias. I want to build a wall. I'm going to build a wall. I'm doing very well with the Latinos, with the Hispanics, with the Mexicans, I'm doing very well with them in my opinion. And we're going to see, you're going to see, because you know what, I'm providing jobs. Nobody else is giving jobs. But just so you understand, this judge has treated me very unfairly, he's treated me in a hostile manner. And there's something going on.



When a woman can be a plaintiff in a case and then say, "I don't want to be-" and you know why they don't want to be a plaintiff? They don't want her, the lawyers asked that she not be a plaintiff because they would have lost the case immediately.



JOHN DICKERSON: So, I'm trying to, so, I'm trying to figure out your thinking here though. If his Mexican heritage, the fact that his parents were Mexican immigrants is a barrier to him doing his job, why would any Mexican voter vote for you? Wouldn't they be the same barrier -- same problem?



DONALD TRUMP: No--They're going to vote for me because I'm going to bring jobs into the country--



JOHN DICKERSON: But isn't it the same problem? Because you want this wall and all of that?



DONALD TRUMP: No not at all--



JOHN DICKERSON: But what if it was a Muslim judge?



DONALD TRUMP: By the way, I have so many Hispanics, I made a speech last night, I saw hundreds of signs, "Latinos for Trump, Latinos for Trump," all over the place. And you know what? They're here legally. They don't want their homes taken away, they don't want their job taken away. They like what I'm doing. Now people can come in, but they have to come in legally.



JOHN DICKERSON: On the Muslim, but what if he was a Muslim though? You've been very tough on temporary Muslim immigration ban. So--



DONALD TRUMP: --I've been --



JOHN DICKERSON: --would a Muslim judge be also out of the question here?



DONALD TRUMP: We are allowing tremendous numbers of people coming into this country that we know nothing about. We are -- we have a problem in this country. We are going to have big problems. You know I've been pretty good at predicting things, John. We're going to have big problems.



We have people coming into this country totally undocumented, they don't know anything about them, they don't have paperwork, I've interviewed and talked to the best law enforcement people in the business. There's no way of knowing where they come from, and we're taking them in from the so-called migration. They're being sent all over the country. We have people that don't know what they're doing.



JOHN DICKERSON: My question is if--



DONALD TRUMP: We have to stop them.



JOHN DICKERSON: --if it were a Muslim judge, would you also feel like they wouldn't be able to treat you fairly because of that policy of yours?



DONALD TRUMP: It's possible, yes. Yeah. That would be possible, absolutely.



JOHN DICKERSON: Isn't there sort of a tradition though in America that we don't judge people by who their parents were and where they came from?



DONALD TRUMP: I'm not talking about tradition--I'm talking about common sense, okay? He's somebody, he's proud of his heritage. And I think that's great that he's proud of his heritage.



JOHN DICKERSON: But you're saying it's a barrier to him doing his job.



DONALD TRUMP: Well, he's not treating me, he's not treating me fairly.



JOHN DICKERSON: And you think it's not because--



JOHN DICKERSON: You think it's because of where his parents came from?



DONALD TRUMP: I've had numerous lawyers. Look, I have a case where thousands of people have said it was a great school. They've written reviews where they say it's a great school. Not a good school, like great. They gave it the highest marks. I have thousands of these papers. It should've been a summary judgment case, meaning the case should've been dismissed.



And I had a judge who was very fair. I have a lawyer that came in when he came in. I mean, the lawyer, on the other side sort of entered the case when he entered the case, and we're trying to figure out what that's all about.



JOHN DICKERSON: Would you have your lawyers say, "Hey, throw this out because--the judge is--"



DONALD TRUMP: Well, I may do that now--We're finding things out now that we didn't know before--



JOHN DICKERSON: --Because of his Mexican heritage though--



DONALD TRUMP: No, but because of other things. I mean because of other things.



JOHN DICKERSON: You've said you want to reopen--



DONALD TRUMP: How do you allow a case to proceed when the plaintiff asks to be dismissed from the case? The plaintiff, the one that brought the suit, said, "I don't want to sue anymore. I don't want to sue anymore." They didn't want to sue. You know why they didn't want to? Because she can't win the case. Because she was a disaster. So the lawyers want her dismissed from the case. They go before the judge and he lets her out? Well, he can let her out, but you have to dismiss the case.



JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah, I guess I'm just still confused how -- what his Mexican parents have to do with that. Let me--



DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. I want to build a wall. I mean, I don't think it's very confusing.



JOHN DICKERSON: Well.



DONALD TRUMP: Has nothing to do with anything except common sense. You know, we have to stop being so politically correct in this country. And we need a little more common sense, John. And I'm not blaming. I'm proud of my heritage, we're all proud of our heritage. But I want to build a wall. Now, the Hispanics, many of them like what I'm saying. They're here legally. They don't want people coming and taking their jobs and taking their house and everything else. They don't want that.



JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about Trump University. You're going to reopen it. Anything you'd do differently when you reopen it?



DONALD TRUMP: Look, I guess in life you always do things differently. I'll tell you, the thing that we did very well is we had evaluation reports done by all of the students. I mean, without that, it would be, you know, my word against their word, I guess, or somebody's word against their word. We have evaluation reports where we have thousands of them, thousands of them.



And these reports, I mean, they're very detailed reports. What did you think of the instructions, what did you think of this, what did you think of the-- you know, one to five, mostly a five, five being excellent, right? It's from one to five, five being the best. And people circle. I'm being sued by people that have given this tremendous report.



Now, they're going to say, "Oh, but they were being forced." Who forced them? Nobody forced them. You mean they forced thousands of people to sign reports? Nobody forced them to sign a report. And many it remarks, and many have in hand writing, beautiful statements about the school. Look, it's very simple. It's called if I have a chance to get my money back, let me get my money back.



JOHN DICKERSON: Last question. Should the U.S. go to the Olympics still with the threat of Zika in Brazil?



DONALD TRUMP: The answer is yes, but certainly if an athlete wouldn't want to do it, they should have the right not to do it. But I would say yes.



JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Mr. Trump. Thank you very much.



DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.
