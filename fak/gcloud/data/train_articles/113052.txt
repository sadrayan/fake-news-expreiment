State News Staff Writer The rumor that a psychic predicted on The Oprah Winfrey Show that a mass murder might occur at MSU or Michigan is just that  a rumor. Audrey Pass, senior publicist for the show, said there was no truth to the story. That means that, as rumor has it, no one was on the show to predict a mass murder at a Michigan university in an H-shaped dorm near railroad tracks. This tale and its variations have been the buzz on campus in the last few days, sending chills down the backs of many MSU students  especially in the H-shaped dorms or halls that begin with an H. Many students have reported knowing someone who saw the show. Others said they would leave campus on Halloween to avoid any trouble. Im scared, said Adam Panter, a no-preference freshman who lives in Holden Hall, an H-shaped dorm a few hundred yards from the Grand Trunk Western Railroad tracks. Im going to the fraternity house for the weekend. I dont care if it is true or not. Im not waiting around to find out. There are several different versions of the story. One of the most widely heard at MSU goes like this: a serial killer dressed as Little Bo Peep will appear on a Big Ten campus in Michigan on Halloween. The killer will murder about 20 people in a dorm located near railroad tracks with a name beginning with an H. Variations of the story have the serial killer dressed in regular clothes or the crimes being committed in a dorm shaped like an H or near a cemetery. According to The San Fernando Valley Folklore Society, a version of this campus tale has appeared on campuses since 1968. Their Web page is: snopes.simplenet.com. English Professor Maurice Crane said these types of rumors are a common kind of phenomenon  the kind of thing that could happen to you: that theres a nut out there whos interested in you. Halloween is a time when everyone is masked, and if someone who cant normally show their face appeared, no one would be surprised, said the popular culture expert. Mary Haas, director of University Housing, said both parents and students are upset over the rumor. Students are very worried, she said. Weve had parents call. Haas said the rumor seems to emerge every year around this time in different versions. She said past variations have predicted such things as serial killers appearing in states beginning with certain letters on Halloween. This is a known rumor  please assume there is no factual evidence to support this, she said. Kate Murphy, assistant director of Residence Life for east and south campus, announced at a Residence Halls Association meeting Wednesday that University Housing was 99 percent sure the rumor was a myth. If RHA would help us extinguish what appears to be an urban myth, we would appreciate this, she said. Fred Kayne, associate director of University Housing, said one of the reasons the rumor may have surfaced is because the movie Urban Legend recently came out Sept. 25. We have communicated with resident advisers, graduate advisers and law enforcement people, he said. Theres no basis in fact in this. Case Hall RA Laura Coatta said RAs received an e-mail this week from University Housing in reference to the serial killer rumor and Urban Legend. She said the e-mails instructed the RAs to encourage people to use the same precaution they normally would on Halloween. They said to keep the residents calm, tell them not to expect any mass murderers, Coatta said. It said if anyone sees anything unusual, they should report it immediately, but that students should do everything they would normally do, take every precaution they normally would. The rumor also circulated at the University of Michigan. Kelly Damm, a U-M biomedical engineering sophomore, lives in Markley Hall, an H-shaped dorm on the U-M campus near a cemetery. She said most of her dorm had heard the rumor that the killer would be at this type of dorm. A girl on my floor said her mom heard it on Oprah, she said. A lot of people believed it. Damm said students received e-mails from their RAs telling them the psychic prediction was a rumor. They said it was not true, that someone was trying to find it on the Internet and couldnt, she said. Alan Levy, director of housing and public affairs at U-M, said the Markley Hall RAs were advised to send the e-mails to quash the rumor. We said that rather than continue and get all this hype over nothing, Residence Life should communicate that this was not anything to take seriously, he said. Levy said that if there was a serious threat, both the MSU and U-M police departments would behave like they normally do. That is, they would work with the university community and alert them to the precautions they need to take. MSU police Lt. John McCandless said the MSU police had not heard about the rumor. State News staff writer Alicia N. Ingram, contributed to this report. Other related sites:
