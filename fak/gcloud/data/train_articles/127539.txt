Two foreigners drop dead on different Italian beaches
Beachgoers were apparently unfazed by the sight of the dead bodies, which were covered up with white sheets and lay on the sand for some time until being removed by emergency services.

The foreigners both died on Monday, on beaches in different parts of the country, as a hot front descended on the country following weeks of unseasonably cold temperatures and heavy rain, finally heralding the start of summer.

At Formia, an Italian resort between Rome and Naples, a 78-year-old Russian woman named Valentina Rausman keeled over in the water after a suspected heart attack.

Two swimmers noticed her floating in the water and tried to resuscitate her, but without success.

A few yards from her body, beachgoers played with balls and racquets while others read newspapers and did cross word puzzles.

"The people who behaved like that should be ashamed of themselves," said Sandro Bartolomeo, the local mayor.

An almost identical scenario unfolded on a beach at Vibo Valentia, in the southern region of Calabria, after a 19 year-old Moroccan man, Abdur Abdurhaman, drowned in the sea.

The restaurant worker's body was covered in a white sheet, while in the background a group of youths played beach football and other day trippers sunbathed on towels and loungers.

When officers from the local fire service and harbour authority arrived on the scene, they asked holidaymakers to show more respect for the corpse.

The images were "a punch in the stomach", according to one Italian newspaper, Il Giornale. "Death on the beach whilst all around people continue to sunbathe," the national daily said. "Perhaps people will feel remorse in the evening, when they get home. Too late." A similar incident happened on a beach at Ostia, close to Rome, in 2011.

The body of a 67-year-old man remained on the beach for around three hours while holidaymakers nearby chattered, joked and sunbathed.
