Professor Olson:

I write hoping you can visit by phone or email for a fact-check we’re doing in Texas. At issue: Sen. Ted Cruz’s claim that Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke “wants to take our guns,” as described here.

Cruz’s campaign points out that O’Rourke ranks among cosponsors of this legislation banning certain firearms. I didn’t spot any provision in the measure to take guns from law-abiding owners.

Is that your read of the proposal?

If not, what provision strikes you as an indication that the measure would lead to government officials taking guns?

More broadly, how would you gauge if a member, including O’Rourke, wants to take our guns?

As ever, we count on attributable on-the-record information for our stories. If visiting by phone is best, I’m at the 445 number below.

THANK YOU,

g.

I hope this gets you to the legislation: https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr5087/BILLS-115hr5087ih.pdf

CONCLUSION: As introduced the bill "grandfathers" the 25 to 50 MILLION "evil guns" already possessed in the US and it "grandfathers" the more than half a billion "standard" capacity magazines already possessed in the US.

QUESTION 1. Not as written at the moment.

The specific language is on page 17, lines 20-23 (highlighted below).

—Section 922 of title 18, United 13 States Code, is amended— (1) by inserting after subsection (u) the following:

‘‘(v)(1) It shall be unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a semiautomatic assault weapon. ‘

‘(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession, sale, or transfer of any semiautomatic assault weapon otherwise lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date

of enactment of the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018.

QUESTION 3. Bills get amended throughout the process. A co-author knows this and anticipates its occurrence. The Chief author and many of the co-authors have made it clear repeatedly that they want to confiscate them ALL but will have to slice the salami one bit at a time. Participating in laying the foundation is participation in building the house according to the blueprints announced.

Every lawful gun owner in America remembers this quote and has heard many Democrat Congressperson make similar statement since 1989.

"If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t here." 60 minutes (1995). It is ambiguous whether she meant the firearms in her 1994 Law or a broader scope.

But in the 1990s many Congresspersons said the 1994 Ban is "a good first step". I heard them say it then.

The first step is to attack "assault weapons" but since a gun is a gun is a gun, ... the end in sight is clear. As the NY Times has made clear "Gun violence won't be cured by one set of laws. It will require years of partial measures that will gradually tighten the requirements for gun ownership, and incrementally change expectations about the firepower that should be available to ordinary citizens. (12-21-1993).

This is why lawful gun owners will FIGHT to block every intrusion on their activities, including possess of "evil black rifles".

My latest paraphrase, for your review:

You agreed the O’Rourke-cosponsored measure doesn’t call for taking guns from law-abiding residents. But, you said by email, there’s justifiable suspicion among gun rights’ advocates that once such a proposal starts making its way into law, it’ll be amended to enable or require the government to take guns.

OK.
