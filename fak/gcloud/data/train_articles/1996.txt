Copeland Says Christians Who Vote Against Trump Will Be Cursed With Poverty, Gay Children
By Hamish Balfour

Televangelist Kenneth Copeland has warned Christians that if they don’t support Donald Trump, they will be punished by God.

“If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God,” said Copeland in an appearance on Trinity Broadcasting Network. “Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty or even having a gay child.”

Copeland is not the only Christian urging other believers to support Trump.

David Barton, an author of wildly inaccurate history books, urged other Christians to overlook Trump’s rough edges, said Right Wing Watch. Barton compared Trump to flawed biblical figures such as Noah and King David.

“Maybe God’s got a different standard than what we do,” said Barton, who is a frequent guest on the Glenn Beck show. “Maybe at a national leadership level, there are people who do good things for the nation who have character flaws … What God calls great leaders wouldn’t fit your litmus test, but maybe you need to catch up with where God is rather than expecting God to catch up with where you are.”

Barton has previously called Trump “God’s guy.”
