DOJ Releases Formal Approval of Toxic Mega-Merger between Bayer and Monsanto

January 30, 2019

Department of Justice confirms approval subject to divestitures

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Department of Justice today formally announced its green light for the Bayer-Monsanto merger, conditional to further divestments from the two companies. This decision comes after DOJ received over one million public comments urging the agency to block the merger and overwhelming concern by farmers across the country.

The divestitures will do little to restore bargaining power to family farmers, ensure farmers have access to diverse seed varieties and prevent seed prices from rising. During this time of low commodity prices and struggling farm economy, DOJ failed to listen to the more than 93 percent of polled farmers and over 90 percent of Americans who are concerned about the merger.

In response to the merger’s approval, Tiffany Finck-Haynes, pesticides and pollinators program manager with Friends of the Earth, issued the following statement:

The approval of the Bayer Monsanto merger is a disaster for American farmers and families. This toxic mega-merger will only further entrench the failing model of chemical intensive agriculture, which is poisoning people and the planet. The Department of Justice failed to protect Americans from yet another toxic agricultural monopoly.

Our agricultural economy has become a game of corporate Russian Roulette, eliminating consumer choice and decimating family farms. These woefully inadequate concessions are a blatant sign that the Department of Justice cares more about protecting corporate profits than defending the interests of the American public.
