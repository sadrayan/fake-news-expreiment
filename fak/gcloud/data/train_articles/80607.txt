Jewish Family Services of Delaware
Émigré S ervices

Émigré Services , in partnership with the Department of Health and Social Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement, provide services that enable refugees, adjudicated asylees and their families to fully integrate into the community and the workplace. The goals are to promote self sufficiency (and diminish the use of state entitlements) and ensure healthy families by increasing opportunities for employment and benefits.
