Arena Profile: Martin O'Malley

Martin O’Malley has been governor of Maryland since 2006.

The Baltimore Sun credited O’Malley’s administration with “accomplishing more in one year than most administrations accomplish in four.” The Washington Post observed that Martin O’Malley is a “governor unafraid of government.”

He served as Baltimore's mayor before being elected governor.



Born in 1963, Martin spent his childhood in Bethesda and Rockville, where he learned from his parents, Tom and Barbara O’Malley, about the fundamental importance of public service. During his years at Gonzaga College High School and later Catholic University, these ideals were reinforced through various faith and community programs, and eventually the Gary Hart for President Campaign. After completing college, O’Malley attended the University of Maryland School of Law while also directing field operations for Barbara Mikulski’s senatorial campaign.



Martin and his wife Katie, a District Court Judge, have two daughters, Grace and Tara, and two sons William and Jack. They are members of St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church.
