**GILLUM FACTS** Andrew Gillum Signed Anti-Police Pledge
DAVIE, FL- Andrew Gillum is trying to conceal his support of radical, anti-law enforcement causes but his ties to groups like Dream Defenders are well-documented. Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association, recently appeared on Fox News and took Andrew Gillum to task for signing an anti-police, anti-law enforcement pledge.

During the interview on Fox & Friends, Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies Association, said:

“From a law enforcement perspective, when you have a potential candidate for the next governor whose willing to sign a pledge with an anti-law enforcement, anti-government radical group such as the Dream Defenders, he’s clearly sending a message to the voters before Election Day that he’s willing to support, defend and recognize radical groups like the Dream Defenders and he supports radicalization over the rule of law in the state of Florida and we just cannot afford that in our state…

“It’s just empty words from Andrew Gillum, he says he wants to work well with law enforcement but the proof is in the numbers. When you are the mayor of Tallahassee, a city of about 200,000 residents, and you have one of the highest crime rates in the state of Florida, you can’t say that you’re supporting law enforcement and doing everything you can to combat crime…if he’s willing to create policies to take money away from the budgets of law enforcement, I don’t think he’s realizing that the tourism industry in the state of Florida is what drives our economy…”
