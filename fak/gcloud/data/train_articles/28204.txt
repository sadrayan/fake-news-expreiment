Amazon.com: The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective (9780521527507): Robert Gellately, Ben Kiernan: Books
If you are interested in the study of genocide and theories of how a genocidal regime may rationalize its policies, then this book is a good choice for you. It's chock full of scholarly articles on theories concerning these matters, as well as how genocide should be defined, and other such intellectual material. If you're more interested in learning the details of individual genocides: how they were carried out, in-depth histories and case studies, then this is book will provide nothing for you to sink your teeth into. The articles within it frequently reference statistics from actual genocides and compare various aspects of different genocidal regimes, but never make any attempt to go beneath the surface. You'll learn nothing new from this book about any genocide that you couldn't have learned from just doing a Google search. Even the articles that are about specific events, like the killings in Guatemala, are mostly just full of heady social theory with statistics and facts concerning Guatemala as a backdrop. They never go into the specifics of how the killings were carried out, or specific incidents, or anything that might breathe just a little bit of life and humanity into the stuffy academic monologue. You may want to read this book if you're preparing to write a research paper on genocide, but it's definitely not something most people would read for pleasure.
