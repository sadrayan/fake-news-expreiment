Retiring from the US Navy
If you decide to pursue your Navy career for at least 20 years, you’ll qualify for generous retirement pay – and even more if you serve longer. Use the military retirement calculator to see what you could earn. That’s on top of any income you receive from your investments in your Thrift Savings Plan. Plus, you will continue to receive health benefits and on-base shopping privileges similar to those you enjoyed while on Active Duty.

Think about it: By age 40 you could choose to retire from the Navy with a monthly paycheck for the rest of your life – and be fully prepared to embark on an exciting new career.
