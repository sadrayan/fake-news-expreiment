Bush, who has consistently opposed the bullet train Florida voters demanded, vetoed $7.2-million the Legislature had appropriated to keep the High Speed Rail Authority moving toward construction of the first leg of the system, from Tampa to Orlando. Bush was making good on last year's threat to cut the funding if lawmakers didn't restructure the authority. The legislature didn't act. "And so, being a man of my word," Bush said, "I'm vetoing this line item." If lawmakers restructure the authority next year, Bush said he won't veto the money. Bush left $4.9-million in the budget for planning train stations that eventually could serve rail, bus and other kinds of travel. But that didn't assuage rail authority board member William Dunn. "It puts us out of business," said Dunn, a Miami consultant. "The governor has dismantled the high-speed rail system that the voters of Florida approved." In 2000, voters amended the state Constitution to mandate a bullet train linking Florida's largest metropolitan areas. But the potential cost is staggering in the current economic climate, and Bush has talked of trying to repeal the amendment. The authority still has $2.1-million in federal funds, Dunn said, but the money is restricted. "We can't spend it on the environmental studies we need to do," he said. "We can't spend it on travel, or to pay for the rooms where we hold meetings. It may be that the $4.9-million Bush left in the budget is enough to say he hasn't violated his oath of office, but I don't think he's made an honest effort to give the people of Florida what they asked for." The amendment calls for construction to begin in November. It's unclear whether Bush's veto violates that provision. "Will we be poking holes in the ground along Interstate 4? No," said state Sen. Jim Sebesta, R-St. Petersburg and chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. "But construction has many phases, including engineering studies, and we've been doing those things for the last two years." Lakeland businessman C.C. "Doc" Dockery, who spent $2.7-million of his own money to persuade voters to pass the amendment and serves on the rail authority board, could not be reached Monday. Bush used the budget signing Monday to reassure the public that Florida is far better off than other states such as California, which faces a $38-billion deficit. The budget takes effect July 1. The Republican governor praised lawmakers for keeping frills to a minimum. "This budget is as clean as a budget has been in our state in modern times," he said. Bush used his 45-minute presentation Monday to highlight how much the state is spending on education, health care and domestic security. Education spending is up 4.6 percent per student, but more than half that increase is from money lawmakers set aside to carry out the class size reduction amendment voters approved last fall. "I wish it wasn't that way," Bush said. "I hope it's repealed in some fashion," he said of the constitutional amendment. He kept the roughly $140-million in anticipated lottery dollars to reward schools that show improvement in FCAT scores. The program is controversial and the Senate originally did not want to fund it, but Bush threatened to veto any budget lawmakers gave him without the recognition money. "Any effort to undermine the school recognition money will be met by resistance. It just won't happen," Bush said. More money than ever is headed into corporate tax credit vouchers for low-income kids: $88-million for the next fiscal year. Bush noted that most parents whose children qualify for vouchers will stick with public schools, "but to promote other options is not a bad thing." He invited 8-year-old Morris Hires to speak at the podium. Morris fell behind at Gulfport Elementary School in St. Petersburg and failed the second grade. His mother applied for a voucher and he now attends Yvonne C. Reed Christian School, where he made the honor roll for two of the four quarters in the past school year. "They let me read," said Morris, who hopes to become a pediatrician. Senate President Jim King, who led the Senate in its unsuccessful fight for more revenue for education and health care, offered a lukewarm statement. "This budget is not a perfect one, and it is no secret that the Senate would have preferred to have had additional revenue for areas such as education, health care and criminal justice, but we know that we did the best we could with the dollars we had," King said.
