Zika Virus Emergency Use Authorization

On February 26, 2016, pursuant to section 564(b)(1)(C) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1)(C)), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Sylvia Burwell, determined that there is a significant potential for a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad and that involves Zika virus. Pursuant to section 564(b)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1)), and on the basis of such determination, the Secretary of HHS then declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection of Zika virus and/or diagnosis of Zika virus infection, subject to the terms of any authorization issued under 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(a).

Zika Virus Molecular Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Assays – Performance Evaluation and Key Characteristics:

Since February 26, 2016, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection of Zika virus and/or diagnosis of Zika virus infection, FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a number of molecular- and serological-based assays for Zika. In the case of the molecular-based assays, IVD developers as part of their EUA conditions are required to test an FDA Reference Material Panel that includes two different Zika virus strains from the Asian lineage (S1 and S2), using an FDA protocol that included a sensitivity evaluation. Depending on the sample type, the majority of the NAT assays have analytical sensitivities between 500 and 5000 Units/mL (or better) summarized in Table 1, along with some other performance characteristics determined during the EUA evaluation. In addition to sensitivity, the currently authorized tests offer unique characteristics with respect to sample throughput, testing environment, claimed sample types and performance, that are taken into account when considering whether to issue an EUA for an assay, summarized in Table 2. For more information about EUAs in the context of the Zika virus response, please visit FDA’s medical countermeasures website.



DPP Zika IgM Assay System (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc.) On September 27, 2017, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc.'s DPP Zika IgM Assay System for the presumptive qualitative detection of Zika virus IgM antibodies in human serum (plain or separation gel) and fingerstick whole blood, EDTA venous whole blood, or EDTA plasma (each collected alongside a patient-matched serum specimen) specimens collected from individuals meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Zika virus clinical criteria (e.g., a history of clinical signs and symptoms associated with Zika virus infection) and/or CDC Zika virus epidemiological criteria (e.g., history of residence in or travel to a geographic region with active Zika transmission at the time of travel, or other epidemiological criteria for which Zika virus testing may be indicated), by laboratories in the United States that are certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. § 263a, to perform high or moderate complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories, pursuant to section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3). Specimens from symptomatic patients or returning travelers from endemic areas should not be collected prior to 8 days after onset of symptoms or risk of exposure, respectively. Where there are reactive results from the DPP Zika IgM Assay System, confirmation of the presence of anti-Zika IgM antibodies requires additional testing, as described in the Scope of the Letter of Authorization (Section II) and in the authorized Instructions for Use document, and/or consideration alongside test results for other patient-matched specimens using the latest CDC testing algorithms for the diagnosis of Zika virus infection. In response to Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc.'s request, on February 6, 2018 FDA concurred with the modifications to the authorized Instructions for Use for the DPP Zika IgM Assay System to (1) replace the liquid form of the goat anti-human IgG antibodies and heterophilic antibody (HA) interference blocker for treatment of the specimen with the dehydrated form of the reagents placed in the DPP Zika IgM Assay System device, (2) expand the kit storage range from 2 to 8 °C to 2 to 30 °C, and (3) replace the DPP Zika IgM Sample Buffer and DPP Zika IgM Running Buffer vials by a single vial that is labeled DPP Zika IgM Buffer. In response to Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc.'s request, on August 3, 2018 FDA concurred with the modifications to the authorized Instructions for Use labeling for the DPP Zika IgM Assay System to correct some typographical and formatting errors.

The assay is intended for use with specimens collected from individuals meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Zika virus clinical criteria (e.g., clinical signs and symptoms associated with Zika virus infection) and/or CDC Zika virus epidemiological criteria (e.g., history of residence in or travel to a geographic region with active Zika transmission at the time of travel, or other epidemiological criteria for which Zika virus testing may be indicated), by laboratories in the United States (U.S.) that are certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. § 263a, to perform high complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories, pursuant to section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3). Test results are for the identification of Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile viral RNA. Viral RNA is generally detectable in serum during the acute phase of infection and, according to the updated CDC Guidance for U.S. Laboratories Testing for Zika Virus Infection, up to 14 days in serum and urine, following onset of symptoms, if present. Positive results are indicative of current infection. Letter of Authorization
