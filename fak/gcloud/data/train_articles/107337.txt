Microsoft's First Employee
Robert/Marc: Best. Video. Ever. Well, for me at least. 6502...NOP's...P-Code... Rapture! Finally, somebody else who understands the "NOP" opcode (that's "EA" in hex) and remembers the 6502. LOL. On the 8 inch floppies...hopefully you didn't store any of your early ideas on Elephant disks. Their slogan was something like "never forgets"...yet they were one of the worst disks at retaining data. Translations and lost information: I agree. I see this all the time because I deal with a legal department, management, running reports, building web sites and building databases. Things get lost between people, between layers of software, and on and on. You'd be amazed at what gets lost on the telephone, between departments, and on some people's desks. Then, comes the software loss. I've spent so much time trying to explain all this to people at work it is not even funny. So many times it isn't the software's fault. It was the way they phrased their request for information. Or, one of their staff entered something wrong into the database. It's like they can't believe people still makes typos or something. By the way, jumps and JSR commands cost three bytes on the Apple II. That's: JMP $C600 (reboots your computer): $4C 00 C6

JSR $FC58 (clears out the text screen): $20 58 FC I thought the use of space discussion was great...I remember this very clearly and not a lot of developers/end users get this nowadays. I remember writing tiny utilities in the space between $300 and $3D0. That's 208 bytes. It forces you to be incredibly resourceful. There is so much untapped potential on the PC nowadays and I guess I'm still one of those people who wants to return those roots.
