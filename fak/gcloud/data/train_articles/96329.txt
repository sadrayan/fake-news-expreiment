WEBVTT CAPTIONED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE --WWW.NCICAP.ORG-- TODAY, ON "UPFRONT," MY IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW WITH GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER -- HIS FIRST "UPFRONT" APPEARANCE IN 2014. NEXT, THE GOVERNOR ON THE STATE OF HIS RACE. DOES HE THINK THE RACE WITH DEMOCRAT MARY BURKE IS A DEAD HEAT? PLUS, THE JOHN DOE INVESTIGATION -- ARE HIS LAWYERS REALLY TRYING TO SETTLE WITH PROSECUTORS? AND HIS PROMISE OF 250,000 JOBS IN HIS FIRST TERM. WHY IS WISCONSIN CREATING JOBS AT A PACE SLOWER THAN HE EXPECTED? COVERING THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO WISCONSIN, THIS IS "UPFRONT" WITH MIKE GOUSHA. HELLO AGAIN, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO "UPFRONT." OUR GUEST TODAY IS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, WHO IS HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE DECLARING HIS BID FOR RE-ELECTION IN APRIL. THE LATEST MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL POLL SHOWED THE GOVERNOR TIED AMONG REGISTERED VOTERS WITH HIS LIKELY DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT, FORMER TREK BICYCLE EXECUTIVE MARY BURKE. HE HELD A SMALL LEAD AMONG LIKELY VOTERS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS, AND MORE TODAY, WITH GOVERNOR WALKER. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, GOVERNOR. GREAT TO BE HERE, MIKE. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN, BUT I WANT TO SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES ON THE JOHN DOE. THE LATEST PHASE SEEMS TO BE ON WHETHER YOUR CAMPAIGN COORDINATED WITH CONSERVATIVE GROUPS. LAST WEEK, A SURPRISING DEVELOPMENT, AN EDITORIAL IN "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL," A TOUGH EDITORIAL THAT SAYS "WE LEARNED THAT STEVEN BISKUPIC, WHO REPRESENTS FRIENDS OF SCOTT WALKER, HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH WISCONSIN'S SPECIAL PROSECUTOR FRANCIS SCHMITZ TO SETTLE THE STATE INVESTIGATION. THE UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERN IS THAT A DEAL WILL BE CUT THAT WILL EXONERATE MR. WALKER WHILE WRESTING CONCESSIONS FROM SOME OF MR. WALKER'S ALLIES." THE EDITORIAL GOES ON TO SAY "IT SOUNDS LIKE MR. WALKER HAS TO DECIDE WHOSE SIDE HE IS ON, HIS OWN, OR THE LARGER PRINCIPLES HE CLAIMS TO REPRESENT." NUMBER ONE, HAS AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING YOU, AND THE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE, BEEN NEGOTIATING TO SETTLE THIS CASE? AS YOU KNOW, AND AS WE HAVE POINTED OUT, THE LAW IS CLEAR IN THE STATE. ANYONE THAT KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT A JOHN DOE CANNOT TALK ABOUT IT, AND EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT, SHOULD NOT TALK ABOUT IT HERE I CANNOT COMMENT -- TALK ABOUT IT. I CANNOT COMMENT ABOUT JOHN DOE ITSELF. WE PUT OUT A STATEMENT THAT PER THE LAWSUIT, WHICH HAS BEEN THE FOCAL POINT OF THE COURT AND THE MEDIA IS NEITHER I NOR MY CAMPAIGN IS A PARTY TO THAT. WE CANNOT SETTLE. WE CANNOT BE PART OF THE DEAL. WHEN I SAW THE EDITORIAL, THE OTHER PART THAT CONCERNS ME IS I THINK MY TRACK RECORD IS CLEAR. I AM ECONOMIC AND FISCAL CONSERVATIVE. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS I HAVE SHOWN THAT I'M COMMITTED TO THOSE PARTS MOST, EVEN IN THE FACE OF EXTREME OUTSIDE PRESSURE. IT IS SURPRISING TO ME THAT I WOULD UNDERMINE ANYONE THAT SHARES THE SAME PRINCIPLES. CLEARLY, I WOULD NOT. YOU HAD A STATEMENT THURSDAY THAT TALKED ABOUT THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT. IT DID NOT MENTION THE STATE INVESTIGATION. WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MENTION, PEOPLE COULDN'T FOR THESE NEGOTIATIONS MAY BE TAKING PLACE. THE STATE LAW IS PRETTY CLEAR. EVEN THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAW, AND SOMEBODY KNOWS ABOUT A JOHN DOE INVESTIGATION OF ANY SORT, NOT JUST ON THIS ISSUE, BY LAW, THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM TALKING ABOUT IT. PEOPLE THAT DO NOT KNOW, SHOULD NOT BE TALKING ABOUT IT. WE HAVE NOT COMMENTED ON THAT. WHAT WE TALK ABOUT IS LEGALLY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF ALL WE CAN. WE TALKED ABOUT A DEAL -- WE ARE NOT PART OF THAT. COULD YOU NOT HAVE SAID WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS ON THE STATE LEVEL, JUST AS YOU DID WITH THE FEDERAL LEVEL? AGAIN, AND -- AT THAT POINT, ANYONE WHO IS COMMENTING ON THAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE LAW. A LARGER CONTEXT ABOUT THE EDITORIAL, I THINK MY RECORD IS PRETTY CLEAR. I HAVE STOOD FIRM ON CONSERVATIVE ISSUES, PARTICULARLY ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PRINCIPLES, FIGHTING FOR BUDGET REFORM AND FISCAL SANITY. YOU ARE SURPRISED BY THIS EDITORIAL. THIS WAS A NEWSPAPER THAT HAS SUPPORTED THEM -- SUPPORTED A LOTTERY THING YOU HAVE DONE AND SEEM TO IMPLY THAT IF YOU DO THINGS FOR POLITICAL REASONS THERE WOULD BE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PREMISES AND WHERE THEY AGAIN INFORMATION, BUT MY RECORD HAS BEEN CLEAR, EVEN OUTSIDE OF THIS ISSUE, AND I STAND FIRM MY PRINCIPLES, AND WITH PEOPLE THAT SHARE THOSE PRINCIPLES, AND ANYONE WHO SUGGESTS OTHERWISE IS MISTAKEN. NOBODY IS BEING THROWN UNDER THE BUS. NOPE. NO. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF THE CAMPAIGN, RECENT POLLS SHOW A CLOSE RACE IT WHEN YOU AND THE LIKELY DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER MARY BURKE. DO YOU SEE IT THAT WAY? WHEN THE LAST MARQUETTE POLL CAME OUT THAT SHOWED A LITTLE BIT OF A GAP, WE SAID AT THE TIME THAT IT WOULD TIGHTEN UP, SO OUR PREDICTION IS EXACTLY RIGHT. A MEMBER, I AM PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW GOVERNORS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AT LEAST IN RECENT HISTORY, THAT SUSTAINED ALMOST THREE YEARS OF NEARLY CONSTANT ATTACKS, MUCH OF IT FUNDED BY GROUPS LIKE THE GOOD GOVERNMENT UNIONS. THIS -- LONG BEFORE I WAS GOVERNOR, WISCONSIN WAS THE CLOSEST BLUE STATE IN AMERICA HERE WE ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A CLOSE ELECTION. WHAT I AM EXCITING -- EXCITED ABOUT IS AMONGST INDEPENDENTS I STILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE, AND I THINK THE INDEPENDENT BASE WILL DRIVE TURNOUT. THAT WILL BE A KEY PART. THE OTHER KEY PART WILL BE INDEPENDENTS. WE HAVE SEEN UNEMPLOYMENT GO DOWN. IT IS 5.8%, THE LOWEST IN FIVE YEARS. IT IS WELL BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. IF A COMPANY THAT -- IF THEY COMPARE THAT TO THE TRACK RECORD OF MY OPPONENT, THE ONLY TIME UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN HIGHER, WORST OFF IN WISCONSIN IS WHEN SHE WAS WORKING IN CHARGE OF JOBS. I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT THAT DIFFERENT, INDEPENDENTS WILL COME OUR WAY. WHY WOULD AN INDEPENDENT HAVE A DIFFERENT REACTION -- YOU PROMISED 200 50,000 JOBS, AND IT APPEARS YOU WILL FALL SIGNIFICANTLY SHORT OF THAT. WHY WOULD IT NOT MAKE COMMON SENSE FOR AN INDEPENDENT TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, I BELIEVED IN THE SKY, HE PROMISED TO ONE OF 50,000 JOBS, AND HE DID NOT DELIVER, I WOULD TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT? HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE. INDEPENDENTS ARE PRETTY SMART. THEY LOOK AT THE FULL RECORD. I THINK A LOT OF INDEPENDENT-MINDED VOTERS WILL BE ASKING IF THEY ARE BETTER THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, AND BY JUST ABOUT EVERY MEASURE -- MORE JOBS, MORE BUSINESSES, GRADUATION RATES ARE UP, BUDGET DEFICIT, A SURPLUS, PROPERTY TAXES LOWER THIS YEAR -- YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE MEASURES, IT IS BETTER OFF TODAY THAN IT WAS BEFORE. NOW, IT CAN BE MUCH BETTER, BUT THE QUESTION INDEPENDENT VOTER WILL HAVE TO ASK IS NOT ONLY ARE THEY BETTER OFF, BUT WHAT IS THE WAY TO GO FORWARD, CONTINUE WITH REFORMS THAT HAVE GOTTEN US BETTER THAN WE WERE WATER YEARS AGO, OR TO GO BACK TO THE POLICIES THAT JIM DOYLE EMBRACED AND MARY BURKE WAS PART OF THAT GOT US THE BUDGET DEFICIT, THE BUSINESSES LOST. THAT IS THE CONTRAST. WOULD YOU NOT CONCEDE THAT WAS A NATIONAL RECESSION, MANY STATES WERE BLEEDING JOBS? THE POLICIES WE SEE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO THE SOUTH IN SPRINGFIELD. VOTERS THAT SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO GO BACK IN TIME, WISCONSIN HAS COME OUT OF THAT MUCH BETTER THAN A STATE LIKE ILLINOIS THAT STILL HAS BUDGET PROBLEMS, AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT IS A COUPLE POINTS HIGHER THAN WISCONSIN AND A REAL CHALLENGES BECAUSE THEY MAKE -- THEY REFUSE TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES. PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO THE JIM DOYLE- MARY BURKE DAYS. I AM THE BETTER ALTERNATIVE. YOU CITE ILLINOIS, BUT YOUR CRITICS, AS YOU KNOW, SAY WE ARE LAGGING EIGHT OUT OF NINE WESTERN STATES IN JOB GROWTH, BETTER THAN ILLINOIS, WHY NOT BETTER THAN THE OTHER STATES? A LOT OF THE DEBT IS LOOKING AT THE PAST, BUT MORE RECENT NUMBERS, THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WE HAVE HAD AGGRESSIVE JOB GROWTH IN THE STATE. ALTHOUGH, THE THIRD YEAR WAS THE SLOWEST. BUT YOU HAVE THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, THROUGH APRIL, THE NUMBERS IN JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL OF THIS YEAR, WE HAD A REBOUND. YOU LOOK IN ANY NUMBER OF FACTORS, WE HAVE BEEN DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. WE HAD TO MAKE UP FOR SOME CHANCES. IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THINGS WERE STACKED BEFORE THE RECALL AND HOW THEY WENT UP AGAIN, THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE, IN PART BECAUSE OF EXTERNAL FACTORS OUT THERE. IN THE END, WHEN INDEPENDENTS LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE AND SAY WHERE WERE WE AT QUADRANT IS AGO, WHERE ARE WE AT TODAY, AND WHERE DO WE WANT TO BE FOUR YEARS FROM NOW, I THINK THE POLICIES WE SAW UNDER JIM DOYLE AND MARY BURKE DID NOT WORK WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY AND I THINK THEY WILL IF WE CONTINUE TO BUILD FOUR. WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. WE WILL TALK ABOUT OTHER ISSUES, SCHOOL VOUCHERS AMONG THEM, THE GOVERNOR WALKER. "UPFRONT" WITH MIKE GOUSHA BROUGHT TO MY AMERICAN TRANSMISSION
