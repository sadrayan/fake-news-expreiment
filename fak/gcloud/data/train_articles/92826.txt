Rubio: 'I'm not of the Senate'
Marco Rubio, a career politician, is trying to make the argument that he's not an insider as outsiders Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina generate buzz.

"Yes, I've worked in the Senate for four years. But I'm not of the Senate," Rubio told Sean Hannity last night. Rubio said he went to the Senate because "I didn't like the direction of this country" and that's why he's dumping the Senate and running for president.

Hannity then played a highlight reel of Donald Trump bashing Rubio. "It's very clear he's a very insecure person," Rubio said Tuesday. "You can't flip out everytime somebody says something about you."
