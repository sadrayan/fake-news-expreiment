"Huckabee Certainly Has Come Up," Thompson Admits

ABC News' Mary Bruce Reports: Reflecting on presidential rival Mike Huckabee's latest surge in the polls, Republican candidate Fred Thompson has conceded that the former Governor "certainly has come up."

In an exclusive interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Thompson admitted "there's no question about that. Others have come up, others have gone down. They change all the time. And the governor is doing better than he did and he's especially doing well -- he's put all of his resources into Iowa. And, you know, he's seeing the effect of that."

Thompson declined to offer an explanation for Huckabee's latest movement, deflecting instead to his own position in the polls. "I got news for you: There's a new Gallup poll out today that has me a strong second among likely voters," he responded. When asked if those numbers reflected his stance in Iowa, Thompson quickly clarified "no, nationwide. Just nationwide." The latest Gallup poll, released Friday, shows Rudy Giuliani leading Thompson by 9 points among Republican-leaning voters nationwide.

Thompson, however, did not refrain from criticizing Huckabee, whom he has labeled a "pro-life liberal." "That means he's pro-life, but he's liberal on everything else," Thompson explained.
