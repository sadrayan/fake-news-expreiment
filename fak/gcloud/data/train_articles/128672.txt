All rise for Judge Judy — the Supreme Court justice?

A new report from the American Council of Trustees and Alumni reveals that nearly 10 percent of college graduates think that the TV personality Judge Judy [real name: Judge Judith Sheindlin] belongs to the highest judicial body in the United States.



Sheindlin, 73, stars in the court reality show Judge Judy, which debuted in 1996 and is currently in its 19th season. Sheindlin is a retired New York City judge and reportedly earns $47 million a year for handling small claims cases on the daytime program.

College graduates aren't just confused about Judge Judy, however. The survey also revealed that 40 percent of students didn't know that Congress could declare war and nearly half didn't know that senators serve six-year terms and representatives serve two-year terms.

But it gets worse. In addition, half didn't know that the U.S. Senate handles presidential impeachments, and one third of Americans can't name one right (just one!) from the First Amendment.

The ACTA President, Anne D. Neal, released a statement following the alarming findings. "Our country depends upon an educated populace; and while civic activity and service learning are important, they simply cannot substitute for substantive learning about our history and government," she said on the council's website on January 13.

She continued: "It’s time that colleges and universities replace their anything-goes approach to the curriculum with specific subject-matter requirements that will empower America’s next generation of leaders."
