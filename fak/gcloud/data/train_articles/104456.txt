California Prepares to Throw Climate-Change Skeptics In Jail. Meanwhile, They Allow Violent Criminals to Go Free.
1:a Global warming is a natural part of earths cycles;

1b Anthropomorphic, climate change doesn’t pose significant enough input to the energy budget system of Earths atmosphere and oceans to have significant long term effect.

1c Global warming causes a rise in atmospheric co2 levels and not vise-versa.

2: Natural climate change is beyond mans ability to affect and is mainly caused by solar cycles.

Recent Supporting Data:

-Global temperature curves show a cool reversal from ~1955 to ~1980), inferring that global temperatures then were not driven by atmospheric Co2,because Co2 levels rose steadily during this period.

-Solar irradiance curves almost exactly match the global temperature curve and satellite data suggests that the earth has received increased solar radiation over the past 25 years, coinciding with the present 25–year warm cycle.

-[Historical evedence]:Temperature Charts show a spike in 1940-1941(Alaska Climate Research Center).CO2 in glacial ice cores from Greenland Sigma sites show a corresponding increase in 1943 [after the temperature spike].Solar Activity peaked in 1938.[Prior to the temperature spike].

Times of high solar activity precede and therefore drive temperature rises in the oceans; which in turn release energy into the atmosphere. The higher water temperatures off gas higher amounts of CO2, which in turn cause a synergistic effect. The amount of green house gasses released by profound warming ages in earths history exceed mans capability to match.
