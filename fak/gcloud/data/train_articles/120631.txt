Save Bernd!
You are touched by this and everybody transfers one Euro into my account. Or one of you transfers 1'000'000 Euro into my account. I don't care...

But Bernd's chances of survival increased dramatically due to the Irish Press since 30th August! Thanks to Dublin's FM104!!!

You transfer as many Euro as you want with your email address on the pay slip, so that you can take part in a raffle for this charity... ( @=at ), this is the account:

IBAN: GB43LOYD30199628336268

I wish you but also Bernd: Good Luck!

Time's against him!

Bernd, of course, would be given to a professional butcher in order to avoid any problems with animal welfare organizations.

There is also a German rescue mission for Bernd online. These people want to do a protest march in December!

Free Bernd!

There are also threats of a German, militant group coming in!!!

*Bernd's time has been extended to increase his chances of survival due to extensive pressure from the public...

*Charity:

A minimum of 80% of the donations will be transferred to an official charity organization, a maximum of 20% will go into my pocket. A receipt of the payment to the charity organization will be published here on the 3rd working day of 2006.

If you don't agree then please do not donate for Bernd's sake but contact a charity organization directly and donate your money there.

The money from any merchandising sale will be taken into account as well.

I would like to publish a donation list. So if you do transfer money, please send me a quick mail so that I can place your name on the list.
