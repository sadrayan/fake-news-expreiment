Hitler, Stalin, Ohio union-busting....not that Sherrod Brown is comparing them all
Update: Sen. Sherrod Brown has apologized for his remarks.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Ohio's Sherrod Brown created buzz this afternoon by going on the U.S. Senate floor to decry efforts in Ohio and Wisconsin to bust public union bargaining rights -- and noting tyrants in the last century who also fought the unions.

That would include Hitler.

And Stalin.

And more recently, Mubarak in Egypt.

Ohio's Democratic senator cited all three, adding, "These autocrats in history don't want independent unions."

E-mail links to the C-SPAN video of Brown's remarks are making the rounds, with Republicans eagerly hitting the "send" button. But Brown's office notes that some are missing the full context of his remarks, because Brown followed his mentions of some of the world's worst monsters and their union-busting ways with this:

"I'm not comparing what's happened to the workers in Madison or in Columbus to Hitler and Stalin but I am saying that history teaches us that unions are a very positive force in society that creates a middle class that protects our freedom."
