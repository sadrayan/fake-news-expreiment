VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis has met with Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Zuckerberg’s wife, Priscilla Chan, at the Vatican.

Vatican spokesman Greg Burke says one topic of discussion at Monday’s meeting was “how to use communication technologies to alleviate poverty, encourage a culture of encounter, and make a message of hope arrive, especially to those most in need.”

The atmosphere appeared informal, with the chat taking place in the Santa Marta residence, the guest house in Vatican City where the pope lives.

Zuckerberg wore a dark suit and tie for the occasion while Chan wore a black, knee-length dress.
