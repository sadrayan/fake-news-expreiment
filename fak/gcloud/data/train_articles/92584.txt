President's Message
Over eight thousand Texans a day buy a new or used vehicle from Texas franchised new car and truck dealers. These dealers, whether in small towns or metropolitan cities, selling import brands or domestic cars, pick-ups or heavy trucks, are principally family-owned and members of the Texas Automobile Dealers Association.Those families who serve Texas, many for several generations, welcome you to their on-line home. Here you will learn how dealers work in their communities to create a fabric of social service and volunteer commitment, while providing the transportation that is essential to 27 million Texans.TADA member dealers and their 100,550 employees are your neighbors, your childâ€™s soccer coach, school board member, church trustee or councilperson. With 1,355 dealerships in 289 Texas cities and towns, no other family owned retailer has a greater presence in our state or cares more about the quality of life of our citizens.Ours is a wonderful partnership with the assurance that you can count on TADA member dealers for reliable, safe transportation and the support that Texans deserve.Bill WoltersTADA President
