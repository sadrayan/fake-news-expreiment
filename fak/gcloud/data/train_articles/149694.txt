Kaizer Chiefs terminate Solinas’ contract
Kaizer Chiefs and coach Giovanni Solinas have mutually agreed to an amicable termination of his contract with immediate effect. The Italian coach took charge of Amakhosi in July 2018.

Assistant coach Patrick Mabedi’s contract has also been terminated.

We would like to express our gratitude to both for all the efforts during their time at Kaizer Chiefs and wish them well.

The club will make further announcements in due course.
