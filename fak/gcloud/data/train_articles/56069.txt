1991 The Incredible Shrinking PC The age of the "luggable" comes to an end as computer systems size and weight decrease. The computer industry continues to reflect Moore's law and the components used in computers grow smaller, are less costly and their overall performance improves. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are able to put almost the same power of current processor speeds, storage capacities and other features found only in desktop PC designs into portable lines of products. Most PC manufacturers introduce notebook PCs and now a wide range of model choices are available to users. A worldwide phenomenon is underway Personal computer users begin adopting Windows in large numbers -in just one year, Microsoft ships four million copies of Windows 3.0 to 24 countries in 12 languages. Hardware manufacturers include Windows as standard equipment on their computers, as part of the Windows Ready-to-Run program. And Microsoft's hardware group benefits as well, with the Microsoft Mouse selling six million units. The company also returns to its language roots with the announcement of Microsoft Visual Basic, which wins an award for technical excellence from PC Magazine. 1/9/91 Microsoft announces the availability of Microsoft Excel for Windows 3.0. It also announces Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh 3.0 and Excel for OS/2 Presentation Manager which are expected to ship in the next few months. 3/11/91 Microsoft announces the Microsoft BallPoint Mouse, designed especially for use with laptop computers.

The number of licensed users of Windows now totals more than 25 million, making Windows the most popular graphical operating system in the world. International Microsoft Windows version 3.1 now available in Japanese. 1994 Microsoft announces five new multimedia titles at the Intermedia Conference in San Jose. Shown for the first time are: Microsoft Dinosaurs; Multimedia Mozart: The Dissonant Quartet; Multimedia Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring; Microsoft Musical Instruments for the Macintosh; and Microsoft Bookshelf, 1993 Edition on CD-ROM. Microsoft reports that the number of licensed users of Microsoft Windows now totals more than 25 million, making it the most popular graphical operating system in the world. Microsoft Encarta Ships

Microsoft announces the availability of Microsoft Encarta, the first multimedia encyclopedia designed for a computer. The product contains a high-quality collection of articles, animations, sounds, illustrations, graphs, and photographs, as well as, an atlas and interactive timeline all on a single CD-ROM. Microsoft products continue to evolve to keep up with how people work and live, and with what our customers demand from the constantly changing, constantly improving possibilities of technology. As part of the continuing evolution of personal computer technology we and our industry have entered a new era of integration -in part by integrating different types of technology (e.g., sound, pictures, video, and text) in elaborate multimedia presentations as well as uniting formerly independent applications into powerful new combinations. The first version of Microsoft Word came bundled with a Microsoft Mouse, but customers were not ready to adopt the mouse. While Word offered advanced features and sophisticated output for its era, and the Mouse provided Point-and-click simplicity of use, the slow market reaction to the combination of the two products proved that this was definitely an idea ahead of its time. To help spark interest in Word, Microsoft arranged for a demonstration version of the product to be bound into PC Magazine -the first "disk insert" ever by any company. Word was the first word processor to support laser printers when they arrived on the market, and it introduced a host of new features, such as style sheets and outlines. By bringing together word processing, spreadsheets, and presentation programs, Microsoft created a new category: the office suite. The announcement of Microsoft Office for Macintosh on CD-ROM came on June 19, 1989; a Windows-based version followed in 1990. At first, some customers saw only the packaging as different. But there was a lot more going on -integrating the interface so these multiple applications really worked like one. The result? In less than two years, Microsoft Office represented more than half of the company's total office applications sales. And Office itself grew to include Microsoft Office Professional, incorporating the Microsoft Access database. With more than 60 titles available under the Microsoft Home brand, the company's push into the consumer market takes off. Microsoft announces a merger with Intuit, developer of personal finance and tax preparation packages; the merger is not completed. The company also acquires SOFTIMAGE, Inc., the leading developer of computer animation software, whose programs helped bring dinosaurs to life in Jurassic Park 1/31/94 Microsoft announces Microsoft Plus, a product support program designed to increase users' satisfaction with Microsoft and its products by offering them extended services, cost savings, and timely information. 4/18/94 Microsoft announces that Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 has become the world's best selling retail operating system, edging Windows 3.1 into the No. 2 spot. Sales totaled just over 300,000 copies worldwide in January 1994. International success has led the way, with some European markets such as Sweden and the United Kingdom (U.K.) seeing more than 70 percent of their retail volume of Windows move to Windows for Workgroups 3.11. 4/25/94 The Lexmark WinWriter 600 laser printer, the first office device based on Microsoft At Work printing software, wins the CeBIT Highlight '94 Award for the Top Product in the Printer category. Microsoft and Lexmark worked closely together to develop the WinWriter 600, which is making its European debut at CeBIT. 6/10/94 Microsoft announces the immediate availability of Microsoft Complete Baseball, a multimedia reference CD-ROM that details Baseball's history, players, teams, season summaries, and statistics. This is the first multimedia CD-ROM program with an on-line feature, Microsoft Baseball Daily, that provides integrated, up-to-date information daily. 6/28/94 Microsoft completes the acquisition of SOFTIMAGE Inc., the leading developer of high-performance 2-D and 3-D computer animation and visualization software. 9/8/94 Microsoft announces that Microsoft Windows 95 is the official name for the next version of Windows, code-named "Chicago." This name was chosen to make it easier for customers to identify the most current version of Microsoft Windows. It is a fully integrated 32-bit operating system replacing Windows 3.11, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and MS-DOS as the mainstream desktop operating system. 11/8/94 Bob Herbold joins Microsoft as a new Executive Vice President and the Chief Operating Officer. In this position, he will serve as a member of the Office of the President and report directly to Bill Gates. He will be responsible for worldwide operations including, Finance, Manufacturing, Distribution, Logistics, Information Technology (ITG), Human Resources, Corporate Services, Real Estate and Development, and Microsoft Press. He was previously with The Procter & Gamble Company. 11/14/94 Microsoft debuts its new international advertising campaign, "Where Do You Want To Go Today," at actor Robert DeNiro's trendy SoHo restaurant in New York. Microsoft plans to spend $100 million on a global campaign to build brand awareness with a non-technical audience. 11/14/94 In a dramatic multimedia presentation entitled "Information At Your Fingertips - 2005," Bill Gates calls the industry to action with a vision of how integrated technology solutions can improve the quality of life in the next decade. In his keynote address at Fall/COMDEX '94, he presents a complete framework of how continued advancements in technology will increase consumer benefits and drive industry growth during the next ten years. 12/2/94 Wal-Mart is marketing Microsoft products on "power-aisles" in its stores during the Holiday season. The stores are featuring a special fixture - dubbed the Microsoft tower - containing 46 software programs and one piece of hardware, the Microsoft Mouse. The displays are placed in areas with the highest traffic, near checkout stands and in busy aisles, instead of the electronics section of the store. This is the first time that Microsoft software is being treated as an "impulse" buy item. Stats Revenues: $4,648,981,000

June 16 The U.S. Court of Appeals reinstates a 1994 antitrust settlement between Microsoft and the Justice Department that was rejected by U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin in February 1995.

August 24 Microsoft announces the availability of Microsoft Windows 95, worldwide. To help celebrate the launch, NBC's "Tonight Show" host Jay Leno is a featured guest at an industry event hosted by Bill Gates at the Redmond Corporate Campus, and viewed by Microsoft regional offices via satellite, as well as by PC users via a special Internet World Wide Web site. August 24 Originally code-named "Chicago", Windows 95 -the latest version of Windows- features a new user interface and a "plug and play" design that makes hardware setup automatic. When a customer upgrades to Windows 95, performance will meet or exceed performance of Windows 3.1. Windows 95 meets this performance goal by implementing new technologies to better optimize the use of memory of low-end system configurations. Although Microsoft had experimented in the early 1980's with consumer products such as Typing Tutor and Olympic Decathlon, and even though Microsoft Flight Simulator found a consumer audience of more than one million people in a decade, until 1991 the company operated primarily in the business market, not the consumer market. But creation of the Consumer Division, coupled with the arrival of a new generation of content-oriented products, such as Art Gallery, Dinosaurs, and Cinemania, put the company firmly into the consumer business. August 29 More than 1 million copies of Microsoft Windows 95 were obtained by customers at retail stores during the first four days of availability in North America. Sales of Microsoft Plus! have also exceeded expectations. Approximately 20,000 retail stores nationwide took part in the sales launch, which featured a variety of consumer promotions and sales events, that kicked off at 12:01 a.m. on August 24, 1995. September 15 In honor of the company's 20th anniversary, Microsoft celebrates with a series of activities over the next month, culminating with the Company Meeting in Seattle on October 12, 1995.
