Security Council Imposes Fresh Sanctions on Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Unanimously Adopting Resolution 2270 (2016)
New Measures Cover Cargo Inspections, Prohibitions on Aviation Fuel, Rare Minerals

The Security Council today condemned in the strongest terms the nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on 6 January 2016 “in violation and flagrant disregard” of the relevant resolutions, its actions thereby constituting a challenge to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and to peace and stability in the region and beyond.

Unanimously adopting resolution 2270 (2016), the 15-member Council also condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea launch of 7 February 2016, using ballistic missile technology, and demanded that it comply immediately with its international obligations. Its previous actions on the subject included the adoption of resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013) and 2094 (2013).

By today’s resolution, the Council decided that all States should inspect cargo within or transiting through their territory — including airports, sea ports and free trade zones — that was destined for or originating from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. It also decided that Member States should prohibit that country’s nationals and those in their own territories from leasing or chartering their flagged vessels and aircraft to it, or providing it with crew services. The prohibition should apply also to any designated individuals or entities assisting in the evasion of sanctions or violation of all related resolutions.

The Council also decided that all States should prohibit their own nationals and others subject to their jurisdiction, as well as entities incorporated in their respective territories from registering vessels in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and obtaining authorization for vessels to use their respective flag. In addition, it decided that all States should deny permission for any aircraft to take off from, land at or overfly their respective territories if such aircraft contained items for supply, sale, transfer or export of which were prohibited by all related resolutions, except in cases of emergency landing.

Further by the text, the Council decided that Pyongyang should not supply, sell or transfer coal, iron, iron ore, gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, and rare earth minerals, and that all States should prohibit their nationals from procuring such materials. By other terms, it decided that all States should prevent the sale or supply of aviation fuel — including aviation gasoline, naphtha-type jet fuel, kerosene-type jet fuel, and kerosene-type rocket fuel — whether or not originating in their own territory, to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

By other terms, the Council decided that Member States should expel Pyongyang’s diplomats, governmental representatives or nationals acting in a governmental capacity who assisted in the evasion of sanctions or the violation of related resolutions. It decided further that all Member States should prevent specialized teaching or training of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nationals within their territories, or by their nationals, in disciplines that could contribute to the proliferation of sensitive nuclear activities or the development of nuclear-weapon delivery systems.

Speaking after the adoption, the representative of the United States said the resolution went further than any other sanctions regime in two decades, emphasizing that multilateral pressure could be effective in bringing Pyongyang back to the table for serious and credible negotiations on denuclearization. Describing the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as the only State that had conducted nuclear tests in the twenty-first century, routinely threatening other countries with nuclear annihilation, she noted that the chronic suffering of its people was the direct result of the choices made by their Government.

Echoing that sentiment, the Republic of Korea’s representative warned that a nuclear-armed Pyongyang would impair the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons regime and trigger an arms race in the region. Deploring the use of scarce resources for weapons development while citizens lived in abject poverty, he expressed hope that the resolution would help to alleviate the population’s plight.

The United Kingdom’s representative noted that the resolution contained some of the toughest measures ever taken by the Council, while emphasizing that it was not intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences, nor to affect those activities not prohibited by Council resolutions, nor to affect international relief efforts. New provisions on cargo inspection were consistent with obligations set out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, he added.

China’s representative stressed that the resolution should be a starting point to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, emphasizing that progress on the ground would depend on resuming peace talks and advancing denuclearization. Concurring, the Russian Federation’s representative described the new sanctions as “quite harsh” but necessary for resumption of the six-party process and for Pyongyang’s return to the negotiating table.

Also speaking today were representatives of Japan, France, Spain, Venezuela, Malaysia, New Zealand, Ukraine, Egypt, Senegal, Uruguay and Angola.

The meeting began at 10:10 a.m. and ended at 11:26 a.m.

Statements

SAMANTHA POWER ( United States ) said the chronic suffering of the people in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was the direct result of the choices made by the country’s Government, which had been spending tremendous resources to build intercontinental ballistic missiles that could strike most of the countries on the Council. “It would rather grow its nuclear weapons programme than its own children,” she added. It was the only State that had conducted nuclear tests in the twenty-first century and the only Member State that had routinely threatened other countries with nuclear annihilation. Noting that the new resolution went further than any other sanctions regime in two decades, she emphasized that its purpose was not to inflict greater hardship on the country’s people. The United States had repeatedly urged the Council to address human rights violations, she recalled, stressing that while there should be no illusion that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would now abruptly halt its pursuit of nuclear weapons, multilateral pressure could be effective in bringing Pyongyang back to the table for serious and credible negotiations on denuclearization.

MOTOHIDE YOSHIKAWA ( Japan ) said the message to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was from the international community as a whole, calling upon Member States to fulfil their obligations. In that regard, the Chair of the 1718 Committee should arrange an open briefing to go through the provisions of the new resolution with all Member States, he said. Depending on the behaviour and attitude of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Security Council was prepared to suspend or lift sanctions, which were not meant to target ordinary citizens. Welcoming the resolution’s stronger emphasis on humanitarian and human rights concerns, including abductions, he emphasized that it was essential that the Council remain seized of the situation in all relevant aspects.

FRANÇOIS DELATTRE ( France ) said the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had defied international law by conducting nuclear tests and using ballistic missile technology, undermined the non-proliferation regime, and violated resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013) and 2094 (2013). In that context, Council members had been compelled to react decisively and adopt the resolution, sending a unanimous message to Pyongyang. The ultimate goal was to achieve denuclearization and restore peace and security to the Korean Peninsula, he stressed.

LIU JIEYI ( China ) recalled that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had conducted a nuclear test on 6 January 2016, in violation of the relevant Council resolutions. As a close neighbour, China had always supported efforts to resolve that complex crisis through peaceful means. In that regard, the resolution should be a starting point to ease the tension on the Korean Peninsula, he said, emphasizing that progress on the ground would depend on resuming peace talks and advancing denuclearization.

VITALY I. CHURKIN ( Russian Federation ) said the sanctions imposed by the resolution were quite harsh, but they left the door open to a resumption of the six-party process. The idea was to ensure a return to the negotiating table. Negative trends had been seen in north-east Asia and it was a matter of concern that Pyongyang’s actions were being used to justify enhancing weapons systems such as THAAD missiles. The hasty imposition of unilateral sanctions that could have negative humanitarian consequences was also a concern. He called upon all those participating in the six-party talks to resume negotiations, saying the Russian Federation would support the talks.

MATTHEW RYCROFT ( United Kingdom ) noted that the resolution contained some of the toughest measures ever taken by the Council, adding that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had to be deterred from pursing illegal actions. However, the resolution was not intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences, nor to affect those activities not prohibited by Council resolutions, nor to affect international relief efforts, he emphasized, pointing out that the new provisions on cargo inspection were consistent with obligations set out in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Encouraging all States to implement the new resolution’s provisions in full, he urged Pyongyang to return to credible and authentic multilateral talks and permit full access by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.

RAMLAN BIN IBRAHIM ( Malaysia ) said he would have preferred ample time to consider the text so as to avoid being presented with a fait accompli. Emphasizing that the illicit development and procurement of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies by any State could not be tolerated, he said it was for that reason that he had voted in favour of the resolution. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should resume peaceful negotiations under the six-party talks framework, so that the Korean Peninsula could benefit from greater predictability of inter-State behaviour through greater engagement. “It requires a change of attitude and embracing more trust” to resolve outstanding issues, he said, expressing his delegation’s support for the resolution’s language on safeguarding humanitarian exemptions, a crucial element that would prevent possible unintended consequences against legitimate interests.

CAROLYN SCHWALGER ( New Zealand ) described Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear weapons as among the most serious threats to the international non-proliferation regime. Its actions defied international law and Council resolutions alike, she said, noting that New Zealand had co-sponsored today’s resolution “with a heavy heart”, hoping that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would choose a path that met its citizens’ basic needs. The measures outlined in the text sent a clear message that the country would not benefit from its provocative behaviour and that the best path forward was a return to negotiations on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, she said.

VOLODYMYR YELCHENKO ( Ukraine ) commended the efforts of the United States and China in drafting and tabling the resolution. Noting that expert-level meetings conducted by the United States delegation had given Member States the opportunity to raise questions, he said the text was a comprehensive and balanced document that strengthened the sanctions regime, reflecting the findings of the 1872 Committee’s Panel of Experts. Today’s collective decision was an historic step that emphasized the Council’s firm stance on countering any threat to non-proliferation, he said.

AMR ABDELLATIF ABOULATTA ( Egypt ) said the resolution reflected a message from the Council that it would not accept recent actions by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that violated Council resolutions and undermined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It was a balanced formula that took into consideration the resumption of the six-party talks and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula without aggravating the humanitarian situation. It marked a step on the long road to prevent the thwarting of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said, pointing out that in the Middle East, one State remained outside that instrument. Today’s action in adopting the resolution was an opportunity to remind the international community of that fact, he added.

GORGUI CISS ( Senegal ), calling for the total prohibition of nuclear testing and launching of ballistic missiles, welcomed the resolution’s unanimous adoption, saying that the recent activities undertaken by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea threated international peace and security. Expressing regret that previous sanctions had not prevented Pyongyang from advancing its nuclear programme, he emphasized that all goods headed to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea must be inspected to exert pressure on Pyongyang. However, sanctions were not a goal in themselves, but a way to maintain peace and security, he stressed.

ELBIO ROSSELLI ( Uruguay ) said he would not repeat the comments made by his colleagues, and called for the strict application of the resolution, stressing that it should not have a negative impact on the delivery of humanitarian assistance.

ISMAEL ABRAÃO GASPAR MARTINS ( Angola ), Council President for March, spoke in his national capacity, saying that with the resolution, the Council was sending a clear signal of the international community’s outright rejection of nuclear proliferation. The text sought to strike a balance by strengthening sanctions without punishing the people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, while also creating a window of opportunity for negotiations to resume. He called upon Pyongyang to negotiate a solution within the agreed framework, with a view to ending its violations and reaping all the benefits of being a rightful member of the international community.

OH JOON ( Republic of Korea ) said Pyongyang’s latest nuclear test and long-range missile launch were grave violations of Security Council resolutions and posed a clear threat to international peace and security. A nuclear-armed Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would impair the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regime and trigger an arms race in the region, he said, emphasizing that the international community must act quickly and decisively. The resolution tabled today introduced some of the most robust sanctions in the history of the United Nations, he noted, adding that, when fully implemented, the measures would impede Pyongyang’s activities relating to weapons of mass destruction. Deploring the use of scarce resources for weapons development while citizens lived in abject poverty, he stressed that the new sanctions targeted the regime and not the population, expressing hope that the resolution would help to alleviate their plight.
