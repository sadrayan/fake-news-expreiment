HOUSE BILL 2

AN ACT TO provide for single‑sex multiple occupancy bathroom and changing facilities in schools and public agencies and to CREATE statewide consistency in regulation of employment and public ACCOMMODATIONS.

Whereas, the General Assembly finds that laws and obligations consistent statewide for all businesses, organizations, and employers doing business in the State will improve intrastate commerce; and

Whereas, the General Assembly finds that laws and obligations consistent statewide for all businesses, organizations, and employers doing business in the State benefit the businesses, organizations, and employers seeking to do business in the State and attracts new businesses, organizations, and employers to the State; Now, therefore,
