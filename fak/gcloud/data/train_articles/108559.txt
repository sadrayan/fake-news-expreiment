Yasiel Puig has a special haircut for the All-Star game
Dodgers phenom Yasiel Puig was voted into his first All-Star team in 2014, and before he heads to Minneapolis for the big game, Puig got a special cut to commemorate the occasion. On Saturday against the Padres, Puig was ejected in the third inning for arguing balls and strikes. The Dodgers went on to win anyway, claiming the best record in the National League.
