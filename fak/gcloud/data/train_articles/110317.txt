20-stone dog is world's heaviest
Proud owner Tom Scott, of East Leake, Notts, said Kell is two years old and is expected to continue to grow for the next two years.

She needs to be fed 100lb of beef every week, and drinks gallons of goats' milk to stay healthy.





Big dog, small friend

It was only while watching a television programme on world records that Mr Scott realised he might have a world beater.

He said: "There was a dog called Murphy who was weighed at 108kg (17st) on the TV. I knew Kell was heavier than that and when we weighed her she was 118kg.

"By the time the officials from the Guinness Book of Records came she was 130kg and the vet has told me she is still growing."

Happy and healthy

Mr Scott owns 30 dogs, most of which are very large.

But he said: "Even my Great Dane looks little compared with Kell.





It is official: They do not come any bigger

Feeding such a huge dog is an expensive business and Mr Scott is hoping dog food manufacturers will step in to help.

"With Kell and the other dogs I am using about 1,200lb of beef and tripe every week. Kell's food bill alone comes to about Â£200."

But he added: "Some people are convinced she must just be fat or obese, but the vet looks at her regularly and I have a vet's certificate to say that she is not overweight - she is a happy and healthy dog."
