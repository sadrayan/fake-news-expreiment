Supreme Court Moves With Major Reversal On Illegal Immigrant ‘Rights’
(June 10, 2017) Finally, a decision today from the Supreme Court puts U.S. citizen’s rights above those of illegal aliens. It would appear that the new lineup on the SC bench will begin to have a positive impact and restore some sanity.

Today they came out with a major decision about the illegal aliens, ruling that they do not, in effect, possess the right to sue anyone in case they feel abused or mistreated. President Trump wins this decision by a simple 5-4 majority voting along partisan lines.

According to the The Politcal Tribune, the right-leaning Court one more time showed the United States that those illegal immigrants are first and foremost, illegal, hence should not have the same rights as natural born, or naturalized U.S. citizens.

That implies if somebody’s arrested, and appears to be illegal, he does not have the right to a federal nor a private attorney, nor to a speedy trial in America.

Here they have the right to be loaded onto buses and sent back to where they belong, to apply for legal citizenship like everyone else. It means that sanctuary cities have no right to tell federal agencies that they can’t come in and collect illegals for deportation.

Finally common sense, after hearing this I feel like I woke up from a nightmare. It was about a time they start taking care of us. Thank you for doing the right thing.
