The federal government ran a budget surplus of $182.4 billion in April, up $76.4 billion from the same month last year, the Treasury Department said Wednesday. This is the largest April surplus since a record set in 2001.

Total receipts were $455.6 billion, up 4% from April 2016. Receipts were boosted by a change in corporate tax filing deadlines from mid-March to mid-April.

Spending in the seventh month of the fiscal year was $273.2 billion, an 18% decrease from the same month last year.

April is usually a surplus month since the government receives tax payments from individuals ahead of the tax-filing deadline. The government’s budget year runs from October through September.

Through the first seven months of the year, the government is running a deficit of $344.4 billion, down 2.4% from the same period a year ago.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this year that the federal government would run a budget deficit of $559 billion in fiscal 2017, slightly smaller than last year’s deficit of $585.6 billion.
