The fiscal year 2018 recommendation is a decrease of $5,047,000,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. Within the funds provided, the Committee has focused increases on priority areas and reduced funding for programs that are no longer authorized, are of limited scope or effectiveness, or do not have a clear Federal role. First and foremost among these priority areas, the Committee continues to build on the investment made last year in biomedical research by increasing funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by $1,100,000,000. This increase builds on the prior $2,000,000,000 increase included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and continues funding from the 21st Century Cures Act. Within the total increase, the Committee provides an increase of $80,000,000 to the Precision Medicine Initiative, which holds the promise of designing personalized, targeted cures and treatment. The Committee also includes an increase of $400,000,000 to help find a cure for Alzheimer's disease and an increase of $76,000,000 for the BRAIN initiative to help better understand how the brain functions and learns. The Committee has also placed a high priority on combatting opioid addiction by including an additional $500,000,000 for grants to States, as outlined in the 21st Century Cures Act. The Committee also continues support for programs addressing opioid addiction as authorized in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. To protect public health and the Nation in the event of a bioterrorism or other pandemic crisis, the Committee recommendation also includes increases to the Bioshield and the Biomedical Research and Advanced Development Authority (BARDA) programs as well as a $178,000,000 increase for detecting and preventing a pandemic flu outbreak. The recommendation also increases the Strategic National Stockpile by $25,000,000 and includes language allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services greater flexibility to respond to an imminent public health threat within the public health and social services emergency fund. In the area of education, the Committee has included an increase of $200,000,000 to assist local school districts in covering the cost of ensuring all children with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate, and public education. The Committee provides a total of $500,000,000 for the new Student Support Services program created in the Every Student Succeeds Act. These funds can be used flexibly by school districts across the country to meet local challenges, whether those be in the area of counseling, special curriculum services, computer science or physical education needs as local demands may dictate. The recommendation also includes an increase of $28,000,000 for charter schools. The Committee includes robust increases for the TRIO, $60,000,000, and GEAR UP, $10,246,000, programs to ensure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds have access to a college program. The bill also provides sufficient funding to maintain the maximum Pell grant award at $5,920 in the 2018- 2019 academic year. The Head Start program is increased by $21,905,000 and the Child Care and Development Block Grant is increased by $4,000,000 to continue investments in early childhood education. The Committee has also included $250,000,000 within the Department of Health and Human Services for the Preschool Development Grants program. These increases are offset by eliminating funding for programs that do not have a clear or effective Federal role, or that have large unobligated balances that are not needed in this fiscal year. The Committee believes that public service is a public trust that requires Federal employees to place ethical principles above private gain. Federal employees are reminded that they shall not advance a personal agenda or give preferential treatment to any outside organization or individual within the government programs that they administer. Information that is received by the employee, including information from other employees, offices, or Congress should be handled in a professional and confidential manner in accordance with Code of Federal Regulations regarding the basic obligation of public service (5 CFR 2635.101). The Committee directs each of the agencies funded by this Act to continue to report any funds derived by the agency from non-Federal sources, including user charges and fines, that are authorized by law, to be retained and used by the agency or credited as an offset in annual budget submissions. Paper Reduction Efforts.--The Committee urges each agency funded by this Act to work with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to reduce printing and reproduction costs and directs each agency to inform the Committee on what steps have been taken to achieve this goal, including identifying how much money each agency expects to save by implementing these measures. TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employment and Training Administration TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES The Committee recommends $3,042,720,000 for Training and Employment Services (TES). TES provides funding for Federal government job training and employment service programs authorized primarily by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (WIOA). This recommendation is $295,979,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level, and $988,954,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Workforce Training.--The Committee continues to be concerned by the skills gap. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, employers are currently reporting over six million open positions. Employers are unable to fill many of these positions due to a lack of applicants with the required skills. The Committee believes this is an enormous missed economic opportunity. In the November 2016 Top Management and Performance Challenges Facing the U.S. Department of Labor, the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG) states that the Department has been challenged to assure that participants in its job training programs receive industry- recognized credentials and that participants obtain employment in the occupations they have been trained for. The Committee urges the Department to consider ways that job-training programs can be better targeted and improved within existing authorities in order to train participants for in-demand jobs and reduce the skills gap. Governors' Reserve Fund.--The Committee recommendation maintains the Governors' Reserve Fund at the level authorized by WIOA. The Committee supports efforts by the Department of Labor to work with States to ensure that funds are used for authorized purposes in a timely manner and to minimize the accumulation of balances. Apprenticeship.--The Committee provides $35,000,000 for the Office of Apprenticeship Services. The Committee urges the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) to continue to expand apprenticeship options through outreach and increased employer engagement in registered apprenticeships. The bill provides no new funding for the Apprenticeship Grants program. The Committee encourages ETA to work with the authorizing committees of jurisdiction to enact an appropriate apprenticeship program authorization. Licensing.--The Committee continues to support the Department's efforts to address ways in which harmonizing licensing requirements across States can reduce barriers to labor market entry and mobility, including for dislocated workers, transitioning service members, and veterans. Pay for Performance.--The Pay-for-Performance authority provided in WIOA is a promising, innovative approach that leverages data, evaluation, and evidence-based performance to improve workforce development outcomes. The Committee urges the Department to consider how this authority can be used to improve training and employment programs across the workforce development system. Formal Partnerships and Job-Placement Services.--The United States is experiencing a shortfall of workers with education and training beyond a high school education. At the same time, industry surveys show that a lack of qualified workers is a top concern for many employers. The Committee urges the Secretary of Labor to research and develop strategies for creating formal partnerships and job-placement services with industry employers and the Adult Employment and Training Activities and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities programs authorized by WIOA. Evaluation.--The Committee supports rigorous evaluation of the Department's programs, particularly the workforce training programs authorized by WIOA. The Committee provides $8,040,000 in direct appropriations for program evaluations and continues a general provision authorizing the transfer of up to 0.75 percent of appropriations from specific program accounts for purposes of evaluation. Evaluations should be targeted in ways that will allow the Department to use the findings to improve program delivery and results. The Committee urges the Department to follow through on evaluation findings with evidence-based Congressional justifications. Program Integrity.--The Committee continues to be concerned by the improper payment rate in the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program and urges the Department to use its authority and program integrity resources to help address this issue. Information Technology (IT) Consortia.--The Committee remains concerned that serious challenges threaten the viability of the UI IT modernization projects being carried out by State consortia. The Committee directs the Department to continue to provide annual reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the status of all consortia projects and to implement appropriate policies and procedures for assessing and funding projects by State consortia. In addition, the Committee directs the Department to include in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification any necessary recommendations for language or direction that would be helpful to ensure the long-term viability of the consortia projects and ensure that funds being used for IT modernization projects are achieving the intended results. Adult Employment and Training Activities.--For Adult Employment and Training Activities, the Committee recommends $776,736,000, which is $38,820,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $286,366,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Youth Employment and Training Activities.--For Youth Employment and Training Activities, the Committee recommends $831,842,000, which is $41,574,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $308,175,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities.--For Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities, the Committee recommends $1,145,530,000 which is $96,189,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $413,045,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Of the total provided for Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities, $1,015,530,000 is designated for State grants that provide core and intensive services, training, and supportive services for dislocated workers. In addition, States use these funds for rapid response assistance to help workers affected by mass layoffs and plant closures. The remaining $130,000,000 is available for the Dislocated Workers National Reserve (DWNR). The DWNR supports national emergency grants, technical assistance and demonstration projects as authorized by WIOA. The Committee recommendation eliminates advance appropriations for the DWNR by providing $130,000,000 in current year funds and rescinding the advance provided in fiscal year 2017. No advance is provided for fiscal year 2019. The Committee recommendation includes up to $66,000,000 to assist dislocated workers in the Appalachian region as requested in the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Committee appreciates the Department's efforts to address severe dislocations of workers in the coal industry. Native Americans.--For the Indian and Native American programs, the Committee recommends $50,000,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $95,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers.--For the National Farmworker Jobs program, the Committee recommends $72,000,000, which is $9,896,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level. The fiscal year 2018 budget request proposed no funding for this program. The Committee encourages the Department to consider ways that the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers program can be used to help address shortages of workers in the agricultural sector. YouthBuild.--For the YouthBuild program, the Committee recommends $84,534,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $161,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Technical Assistance.--The Committee recommends no direct funding for technical assistance, which is $2,500,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 and $5,226,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. WIOA provides the authority to use DWNR funds for technical assistance and the Committee maintains a provision allowing the set-aside of up to 10 percent of such funds for technical assistance activities. Reintegration of Ex-Offenders.--The Committee recommends $82,078,000 for ex-offender retraining and reintegration activities, which is $6,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $4,167,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Workforce Data Quality Initiative.--The Committee recommends no funding for the Workforce Data Quality Initiative, which is $6,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. JOB CORPS (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) The Committee recommends $1,688,155,000 for Job Corps, which is $16,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $239,711,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Operations.--For Job Corps Operations, the Committee recommends $1,572,886,000, which is $14,439,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $231,568,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Construction, Rehabilitation, and Acquisition.--The Committee recommends $83,000,000 for construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition activities of Job Corps centers, which is $1,500,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $8,143,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Administration.--The Committee recommends $32,269,000 for the administrative expenses of the Job Corps program, which is $61,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Job Corps is a residential education and vocational training program that helps young people ages 16 through 24 improve the quality of their lives through vocational and academic training. On March 31, 2017, the DOL-OIG issued a report entitled Review of Job Corps Center Safety and Security (Report Number 26-17-001-03-370). The DOL-OIG found that campuses audited had significant physical security weaknesses and that center management continued to underreport or misclassify incidents of student misconduct to Job Corps. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and the fiscal year 2018 Committee recommendation includes additional funds for Job Corps construction. The Committee directs the Department to use these funds to address physical security weaknesses at Job Corps centers. The Committee directs the Department to review and make any necessary changes to the collection and processing of misconduct reports. The Committee continues to be concerned about the safety and security of students in the Job Corps program. The Committee supports the Department's efforts to improve safety and urges ETA to continue to review and implement policies that will enhance safety and security on Job Corps campuses throughout the country. The Committee is concerned that a backlog in the procurement of Job Corps operations contracts has resulted in a number of unnecessary and costly bridge contracts in recent years. The Committee recognizes that fewer bridge contracts were reported in the most recent quarter and appreciates the efforts the Department has undertaken to reduce the backlog and need for such bridge contracts in the future. The Committee is aware of challenges with respect to the recruitment of women participants in the Job Corps program. The Department is directed to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 180 days of enactment of this Act providing detail on current outreach and recruitment activities, barriers to women's participation in the program, and ways that Job Corps recruitment policies can better target women. As part of the report, the Committee encourages ETA to work with HHS early childhood education programs to assess current partnerships and develop recommendations to improve or expand upon successful partnership models at Job Corps campuses to facilitate the participation of women with children. The Committee encourages the Department to consider establishing a working group of Job Corps administrators, industry leaders and other relevant parties to identify ways in which the program can be better targeted to support the goals of training young Americans for in-demand jobs that benefit their communities, the economy, and help reduce poverty. The Committee continues to support the policy of closing a limited number of chronically underperforming Job Corps centers and directs the Department to submit a comprehensive plan to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate at least 60 days prior to initiating the closure of any existing Job Corps centers. The plan should identify the centers that will be closed, provide the financial and management rationale for closing each center, and include a detailed analysis of the costs and anticipated savings that will result from the closure. Section 106(b) authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to 0.5 percent of discretionary ETA appropriations to carry out program integrity activities within those programs, the Committee directs the Department to notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate at least 15 days in advance of any such transfer with respect to funds appropriated to Job Corps. COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS The Committee recommends transferring the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program to the Administration for Community Living at the Department of Health and Human Services. FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES The Committee recommends $790,000,000 for Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances, which is $59,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA) provides assistance to workers adversely affected by international trade. TAA provides training, income support, wage subsidies for older workers, job search and relocation allowances to groups of workers who file a petition and are certified as eligible to apply for such benefits due to job losses resulting from increases in imports or foreign trade. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE OPERATIONS The Committee recommends $2,830,903,000 for State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations. The total includes $2,760,903,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account from the Unemployment Trust Fund and $70,000,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury. These funds are used to support the administration of Federal and State unemployment compensation laws. Unemployment Insurance Compensation.--For Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compensation, the Committee recommends $2,665,775,000, which is $21,825,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $30,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The total includes $2,665,775,000 for State Operations and $13,000,000 for National Activities. The recommendation for State UI Operations includes $160,000,000 to conduct in-person reemployment and eligibility assessments (REA), which is $45,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $30,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Committee supports the REA program as a means to reduce waste, fraud, abuse, to conduct eligibility assessments, and to refer beneficiaries to appropriate training options. As in previous years, the recommendation provides contingency funding for increased workloads that States may face in the administration of UI. During fiscal year 2018, for every 100,000 increase in the total average weekly insured unemployment above 2,246,000, an additional $28,600,000 shall be made available from the Unemployment Trust Fund. Employment Service.--The Committee recommends $19,818,000 for Employment Service National Activities, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $38,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Foreign Labor Certification.--The Committee recommends $62,310,000 for the Foreign Labor Certification (FLC) program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $118,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The recommendation includes $48,028,000 for Federal administration activities and $14,282,000 for grants to States. The FLC program administers temporary foreign worker programs including the H-2A and the H-2B temporary visa programs. These programs are essential to employers in industries that have cyclical peaks or that are seasonal in nature, including agriculture, tourism, and hospitality. The Committee is concerned about previous delays in the processing of labor certifications in the H-2A, H-2B, and PERM programs. The Department is directed to use all appropriate resources and authorities to prevent any backlogs of applications in Foreign Labor Certification programs in fiscal year 2018. The Committee is aware that there continues to be concern regarding the methodology for calculating H-2A wage rates prescribed in the Final Rule published by the Department of Labor on February 12, 2010. The Committee encourages the Department to review the wage methodology prescribed in the Final Rule and determine whether an alternate methodology could reduce disparate impacts on local areas. One-Stop Career Centers/Labor Market Information.--The Committee recommends $70,000,000 for One-Stop Career Centers and Labor Market Information, which is $2,347,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $2,476,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Committee expects the Department to use additional funds to ensure claimants have access to timely information on job openings and other appropriate labor market information. ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND AND OTHER FUNDS The Committee recommends such sums as necessary for Advances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds. The funds are made available to accounts authorized under Federal and State unemployment insurance laws and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund when the balances in such accounts are insufficient. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION The Committee recommends $156,348,000 for Program Administration, which is $2,308,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $2,083,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The recommendation includes $106,461,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $49,887,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Employee Benefits Security Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES The Committee recommends $175,600,000 for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA). This recommendation is $5,400,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $8,326,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The EBSA assures the security of retirement, health and other workplace-related benefits of working Americans. The Committee understands there is concern regarding the amount of time it takes to complete audits of Association Health Plans and urges the Department to review its audit policies to determine if there are ways to reduce the burdens on plan administrators and complete audits in a timely manner. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation The Committee includes an obligation limitation for administrative expenses of $424,417,000 for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The limitation is $95,089,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $98,500,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The recommendation includes bill language that defines PBGC's discretionary authority to incur additional unforeseen and emergency administrative expenses related to its multiemployer plan insurance program. Congress established the PBGC to insure the defined-benefit pension plans of working Americans. The Committee recommendation does not include $98,500,000 for expenses related to the relocation of headquarters space, which was provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Committee expects the fiscal year 2019 budget request for PBGC to return to its base funding needs and that the consolidation of headquarters space will result in lower operating costs for PBGC in the future. The Committee directs PBGC to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 180 days of enactment of this Act that includes an evidence-based review and assessment of the Smaller Asset Manager Pilot Program. The report should include performance comparisons of pilot participants and non-pilot PBGC asset managers, after fees, relative to their portfolio benchmarks, and should identify best practices and lessons learned that could be applied at PBGC and other Federal pension and retirement benefit systems. The Committee directs PBGC to submit reports required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Wage and Hour Division SALARIES AND EXPENSES The Committee recommends $217,500,000 for the Wage and Hour Division (WHD), which is $10,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $12,568,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The WHD enforces Federal minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. WHD also has enforcement and other administrative responsibilities related to the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Davis Bacon Act and the Service Contract Act. The Committee continues to be concerned that the Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors regulation published by the Department of Labor in the Federal Register on October 7, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 60634 et seq.) disproportionately affects entities operating seasonal recreational services and equipment rental to the general public on Federal property or lands. Office of Labor-Management Standards SALARIES AND EXPENSES The Committee recommends $41,129,000 for the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS), which is $2,942,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $5,505,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The recommendation does not include funding for the proposed Electronic Labor Organization Reporting System (e.LORS) modernization project. OLMS administers the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which establishes safeguards for union democracy and union financial integrity, and requires public disclosure reporting by unions, union officers, employees of unions, labor relations consultants, employers, and surety companies. Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs SALARIES AND EXPENSES The Committee recommends $94,500,000 for the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), which is $9,976,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $6,500,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The OFCCP ensures equal employment opportunity in the Federal contracting community through enforcement, regulatory work, outreach and education to workers and their advocates. In September 2016, GAO issued a report entitled, ``Equal Employment Opportunity: Strengthening Oversight Could Improve Federal Contractor Nondiscrimination Compliance'' (GAO-16-750). In the report GAO found, among other things, that OFCCP does not have reasonable assurance that the methods used for selecting contractors for compliance reviews effectively target contractors that pose the greatest risk of non-compliance, that compliance assistance activities have declined by 30 percent since 2012 ``as the agency refocused its activities on enforcement,'' and that ``many contractors told GAO they do not feel comfortable contacting OFCCP for assistance and hire third party support to help comply with federal nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements.'' The Committee has raised concerns with these issues in recent years and appreciates that the Department agreed with the six recommendations GAO made in its report. The Committee directs OFCCP to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 160 days of enactment of this Act on its efforts and the status of implementing each of the GAO recommendations. Office of Workers' Compensation Programs SALARIES AND EXPENSES The Committee recommends $116,550,000 for the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), which is $1,051,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $1,268,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The recommendation includes $114,377,000 in General Funds from the Treasury and the authority to expend $2,173,000 from the Special Fund established by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. The OWCP administers the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, and the Black Lung Benefits Act. These programs provide eligible injured and disabled workers and their survivors with compensation, medical benefits, and services including rehabilitation, supervision of medical care, and technical and advisory counseling. The Committee supports the efforts of OWCP to reduce fraud and abuse related to the prescription of compound pharmaceuticals and opioids. The Committee remains concerned about backlogs of claims in OWCP programs. The Committee directs OWCP to implement policies and consider other ways in which processing times can be brought more closely into alignment with agency goals. SPECIAL BENEFITS (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) The Committee recommends $220,000,000 for Special Benefits, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the fiscal year 2018 budget request. These funds provide mandatory benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR DISABLED COAL MINERS The Committee recommends $54,319,000 for Special Benefits for Disabled Coal Miners. This amount is in addition to the $16,000,000 appropriated in fiscal year 2017 as an advance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The total program level recommendation is $70,319,000, which is $10,000,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. These funds provide mandatory benefits to coal miners disabled by black lung disease, to their survivors and eligible dependents, and for necessary administrative costs. The Committee recommendation also provides $15,000,000 as an advance appropriation for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. These funds ensure uninterrupted payments to beneficiaries. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION FUND The Committee recommends $59,846,000 for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the fiscal year 2018 budget request. These funds provide mandatory benefits to eligible employees or survivors of employees of the Department of Energy (DOE); its contractors and subcontractors; companies that provided beryllium to DOE; atomic weapons employees who suffer from a radiation- related cancer, beryllium-related disease, or chronic silicosis as a result of their work in producing or testing nuclear weapons; and uranium workers covered under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) The Committee recommends such sums as necessary for payment of benefits and interest on advances for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The Committee recommends $414,806,000 for the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, which is $42,121,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund pays black lung compensation, medical and survivor benefits, and administrative expenses when no mine operator can be assigned liability for such benefits, or when mine employment ceased prior to 1970. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is financed by an excise tax on coal, reimbursements from responsible mine operators, and short-term advances from the Treasury. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized a restructuring of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund debt and required that annual operating surpluses be used to pay down the debt until all remaining obligations are retired. Occupational Safety and Health Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES The Committee recommends $531,470,000 for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). This recommendation is $21,317,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $11,787,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. OSHA enforces the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Committee strongly supports the mission of OSHA to promote a safe and healthy workplace and protect workers from injury, illness, and death. The Committee supports the efforts of OSHA to adopt an approach that more effectively balances enforcement with education, training, and compliance assistance. Unfortunately, overreliance on enforcement in recent years has fostered a toxic environment between the agency and employers that is undermining the agency's goals for workplace safety and is at odds with Federal policies that support economic growth and job creation. Safety and Health Standards.--The Committee recommends $18,000,000 for Safety and Health Standards. Federal Enforcement.--The Committee recommends $194,250,000 for Federal Enforcement. Whistleblower Programs.--The Committee recommends $17,500,000 for Whistleblower Programs. State Programs.--The Committee recommends $100,850,000 for State Programs. Technical Support.--The Committee recommends $24,469,000 for Technical Support. Compliance Assistance.--The Committee recommends $131,851,000 for Federal and State compliance assistance programs. The total includes $72,351,000 for Federal Assistance and $59,500,000 for State Consultation Grants. Training Grants.--No funding is provided for Training Grants. Voluntary Protection Program/Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program.--The Committee supports the Voluntary Protection Program and the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program and urges OSHA to expand these vital programs as part of a comprehensive strategy realignment that focuses more on cooperative safety efforts and less on punitive enforcement. Whistleblower Provisions.--The Committee directs OSHA to issue whistleblower citations consistent with and not to exceed the authority provided in section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Outreach Training Program.--The Committee directs OSHA to conduct a fair and open competition for any new or reissued request for proposals for the Outreach Training Program. National/Regional/Local Emphasis Programs.--The explanatory statement accompanying the fiscal year 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed OSHA to notify the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate 10 days prior to the announcement of any new National, Regional or Local Emphasis Program including the circumstances and data used to determine the need for the launch of the new program. The Committee directs OSHA to continue to provide such notices in fiscal year 2018. Mine Safety and Health Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES The Committee recommends $359,975,000 for the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), which is $13,841,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $15,197,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. MSHA enforces the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act in underground and surface coalmines and metal/non-metal mines. The Committee continues bill language designating up to $2,000,000 for mine rescue recovery activities, and provides for the retention of fees up to $2,499,000 for the testing and certification of equipment. The Committee includes $10,537,000 for State assistance training grants and provides the authority to use such funds for the purchase and maintenance of equipment required by the ```Lowering Miners' Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors'' regulation. The Committee supports the efforts of MSHA to reemphasize compliance assistance programs that help mine operators to improve safety and comply with regulations without the threat of punitive enforcement. The Committee appreciates the significant reductions in mining injury and illness rates that have been achieved in recent decades and remains a strong proponent for vigilant mine safety oversight. The Committee notes significant worker dislocations and mine closures as a result of economic conditions throughout the mining industry, and in coal mining in particular. The Committee continues to receive reports of inspectors exceeding necessary and appropriate levels of oversight to the point of significantly impeding mining operations. The Committee questions whether this strategy materially improves safety and if the costs outweigh the benefits of such additional oversight. The Committee continues to support the efforts MSHA has undertaken to realign its resources and capacity to match where mining activity is currently occurring. MSHA has made progress in recent years but must accelerate the process, including reductions in force if necessary, in order to ensure sufficient industry oversight that meets and does not exceed statutory and regulatory requirements. The Committee continues to support advances MSHA has made in mine rescue technology and communications. The Committee directs MSHA to assess its current mine rescue deployment capability and strategy and discuss ongoing operational and resource needs in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification. Bureau of Labor Statistics SALARIES AND EXPENSES The Committee recommends $609,000,000 for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $1,158,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The recommendation includes $544,000,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $65,000,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. BLS is an independent national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential economic data to the Congress, Federal agencies, State and local governments, businesses, and the public. Its principal surveys include the Consumer Price Index and the monthly unemployment series.

ODEP provides policy guidance and leadership to eliminate employment barriers to people with disabilities. Departmental Management SALARIES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) The Committee recommends $272,847,000 for Departmental Management, which is $61,997,000 less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $12,989,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 budget request. The recommendation includes $272,539,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $308,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The Departmental Management appropriation provides funds for the staff responsible for Departmental operations, management, and policy development.

Chief Financial Officer.--The Committee recommends $9,914,000 for the Chief Financial Officer. The Committee directs the Department to submit its annual Operating Plan to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate within the 45-day statutory deadline. VETERANS EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING The Committee recommends $284,051,000 for the Veterans Employment and Training (VETS) program, which is $5,010,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $4,456,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The recommendation includes $47,537,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $236,514,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The VETS program serves America's veterans and separating service members by preparing them for meaningful careers, providing employment resources and expertise, and protecting their employment rights. The Committee continues to support the VETS program and encourages the Department to pursue opportunities to cooperation with other Federal, State and private enterprises to help the country better serve its veterans. The Committee includes funding for the initiation of the HIRE Vets Medallion Program authorized by the Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employing American Military Veterans Act of 2017.

National Veterans' Employment and Training Service Institute.--The Committee recommends $3,414,000 for the National Veterans' Employment and Training Institute. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION The Committee recommends $20,769,000 for Information Technology (IT) Modernization, which is $1,991,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $8,953,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Committee directs the Department to establish a multi- year IT modernization plan consistent with the Department's capacity to oversee effectively projects, within available appropriations, and to propose the plan and required funding in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification. The Committee directs the Department to assign a qualified project manager that is a full-time employee of the Department to each modernization project to ensure the all IT modernization projects are executed effectively, according to Departmental requirements, on time, and within budget. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL The Committee recommends $89,147,000 for the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG), which is $1,426,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $3,011,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The recommendation includes $83,487,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $5,660,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The DOL-OIG conducts audits of Department programs and operations in order to determine that they comply with the applicable laws and regulations, that they use resources effectively, and that they are achieving their intended results. The Committee supports the DOL-OIG efforts to reduce improper payments in the UI program, and to reduce fraud and abuse in the Workers' Compensation programs related to the prescription of compound pharmaceuticals and opioids. General Provisions Sec. 101. The Committee continues a provision to prohibit the use of Job Corps funds for the salary of an individual at a rate in excess of Executive Level II.

TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Resources and Services Administration The Committee recommends $5,815,727,000 for health resources and services programs, which is $397,620,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $276,893,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) supports programs that provide health services to disadvantaged, medically underserved, and special populations; decrease infant mortality rates; assist in the education of health professionals; and provide technical assistance regarding the utilization of health resources and facilities. PRIMARY HEALTH CARE Health Centers The Committee recommends $1,491,422,000 for the Health Centers program, which is $900,000 above the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $2,835,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Committee includes bill language providing up to $99,893,000 for the Federal Tort Claims Act program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $190,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The program provides medical malpractice liability protection to Federally supported health centers. The Committee requests HRSA include an update in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional justification on the agency's efforts to implement the recommendations described in GAO Report (GAO- 12-546) Health Center Program: Improved Oversight Needed to Ensure Grantee Compliance with Requirements. In addition, the Committee allocates not less than $15,000,000 for the establishment of a Health Center Audit, Compliance, and Oversight Office within the Bureau of Primary Health Care. The Committee expects the office to perform periodic audits and compliance reviews of all health center access points, with a goal of conducting a compliance or audit review for every access point location every five years. The office shall oversee Federally Qualified Health Centers, Health Center Program Look-Alikes, and Health Centers receiving a grant under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. The office should provide uniform guidance to health center project officers, monitor project officer adherence to program guidance, and periodically assess whether program guidance is meeting program objectives. The office will also conduct independent compliance reviews, ensuring all health center access points have policies, procedures, and training to comply with applicable Federal laws. The office shall submit quarterly reports to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate containing the results of all audits and compliance reviews of health center access points and oversight of health center project officers. The Committees directs HRSA to provide a briefing within 45 days of enactment of this Act on efforts to establish this office. Tuberculosis.--The Committee supports the coordination between health centers and State and local Tuberculosis (TB) control programs to help ensure appropriate identification, treatment, and prevention of TB among target populations. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue to implement the recommendations of the Tuberculosis Action Plan and recommends that the agency include an update of its progress in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification. Free Clinics Medical Malpractice The Committee recommends $100,000 for carrying out responsibilities under the Federal Tort Claims Act. This amount is $900,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The program provides medical malpractice coverage to individuals involved in the operation of free clinics in order to expand access to health care services to low-income individuals in medically underserved areas. A free clinic must apply, consistent with the provisions applicable to community health centers, to have those individuals ``deemed'' an employee of the Public Health Service, and therefore eligible for coverage. HEALTH WORKFORCE Health Professions The Committee recommends $748,236,000 for the Health Professions programs, which is $90,459,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $365,605,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Health Professions programs support grants for the development of the health workforce in fields challenged by a high need and insufficient supply of health professionals. Given that colleges and universities serve the dual role of training students and carrying out a majority of Federally-funded biomedical research, the Committee believes that they serve as an ideal setting to expose future clinicians to the evidence base that underlies their intended profession. Within the total for Health Professions, the Committee recommends the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2018 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Health Professions Training for Diversity Centers of Excellence............................ $9,711,000 Faculty Loan Repayment........................... 1,190,000 Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students.......... 45,970,000 Workforce Information and Analysis................... 4,663,000 Primary Care Training and Enhancement................ 38,924,000 Oral Health Training Programs........................ 36,673,000 Interdisciplinary, Community-based Linkages Area Health Education Centers.................... 30,250,000 Geriatric Programs............................... 34,737,000 Mental and Behavioral Health..................... 9,916,000 Behavioral Health Workforce Education and 25,000,000 Training........................................ NURSE Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment........... 83,135,000 Nursing Workforce Development........................ 128,067,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Training for Diversity Centers of Excellence.--The Committee directs HRSA to provide continuation grants for activities authorized under section 736 of the Public Health Service Act. Primary Care Training and Enhancement Interprofessional Education.--The Committee is aware of the growing recognition that interprofessional clinical health programs represent the state of the art in health care. The Committee believes interprofessional clinical care teams that include physicians and physician assistants and other disciplines (such as nurses, oral health practitioners, behavioral health professionals, and allied health providers) can achieve better care, better population health, and lower costs. Further, the Committee shares HRSA's belief that health organizations and professionals should be trained for a contemporary practice environment focused on new and more efficient models of care that include interprofessional and team-based care. The Committee also believes that implementation of interprofessional practice requires health students and faculty, as well as staff at the clinic site, be prepared effectively to work side-by-side. In carrying out the various workforce programs authorized by Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act, including the Primary Care Training and Enhancement Program, the Committee supports efforts by the Bureau of Health Workforce to include interprofessional education as a component in funding announcements, particularly with respect to programs that address student and faculty learning as well as clinical site readiness. Integration of Primary Care and Oral Health Practice.--The Committee is aware that a number of medications (prescription drugs, over the counter drugs, and vitamins and minerals) can affect oral health. Many medications used to treat chronic diseases have adverse effects on oral health that patients and/ or providers might not be aware of. The most common side effect is dry mouth, which can be brought on by more than 400 different prescription medications. Dry mouth raises the risk of tooth decay and gum disease. The Committee encourages HRSA to address the impact of medication on oral health as part of its ongoing efforts to promote oral health and primary care integration across the patient lifespan, additional focus would feature diabetic patients as a population of interest for primary care integration. Rare Diseases.--The Committee encourages HRSA to examine programs to increase primary care physician's preparedness in the diagnosis of rare diseases. Oral Health Training The Committee recommends $36,673,000 for Oral Health Training programs, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $36,673,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. These programs serve to increase the number of medical graduates from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds and to encourage students and residents to choose primary care fields and practice in underserved urban and rural areas. Within the funds provided, the Committee includes not less than $10,000,000 for General Dentistry Programs and not less than $10,000,000 for Pediatric Dentistry programs. The Committee directs HRSA to provide continuation funding for pre- doctoral and postdoctoral training grants initially awarded in fiscal year 2015. Within the funds provided, the Committee provides not less than $1,675,000 for the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment program authorized by section 748 of the Public Health Service Act. The Committee directs HRSA to provide continuation funding for grants initially awarded in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Area Health Education Centers The Committee strongly supports Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) oral health projects that establish primary points of service and address the need to help patients find treatment outside of hospital emergency rooms. The Committee is aware that some State dental associations have already initiated programs to refer emergency room patients to dental networks. HRSA is encouraged to work with these programs. The Committee is pleased with the national work of the AHEC program, which has worked to educate primary care health providers on emerging public health needs. The Committee encourages HRSA to engage additional Federal partners, external stakeholders, including current and former grantees of the program, to determine how the AHEC network can be used to continually educate primary care health professionals, especially concerning infectious diseases. Mental and Behavioral Health The Committee recommendation includes $8,916,000 for the interprofessional Graduate Psychology Education (GPE) Program to increase the number of health service psychologists trained to provide integrated services to high-need, underserved populations in rural and urban communities. Recognizing the growing need for highly trained mental and behavioral health professionals to deliver evidence-based services to the rapidly aging population, the Committee encourages HRSA to invest in geropsychology training programs and to help integrate health service psychology trainees at Federally Qualified Health Centers. The GPE program is dedicated to the education and training of doctoral-level psychologists to provide supervised behavioral, mental health services to underserved populations, including older adults, children, the chronically ill, and veterans. HRSA should build on recent efforts to expand training to increase mental, behavioral health services for returning service members, veterans, and their families, with an emphasis on veterans reintegrating into rural civilian communities. Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training The Committee recommends $25,000,000 for the Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training Grant Program. Eligible entities for this program shall include accredited programs that train Master's level social workers, psychologists, counselors, marriage and family therapists, psychology doctoral interns, as well as behavioral health paraprofessionals. The Committee directs HRSA to share information concerning pending grant opportunity announcements with State licensing organizations and all the relevant professional associations. Nursing Workforce Development The Committee recognizes the need for a highly educated nursing workforce to reflect the diversity of the populations it serves. The recruitment of culturally and economically diverse individuals positively impacts the classroom and professional practice environments. Exposure to other viewpoints and perspectives serves to advance collaboration that will translate into improved care delivery. The Title VIII Nursing Workforce Development Programs directly bolster this effort by supporting students from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds in the nursing profession through recruitment and retention efforts. For example, in Academic Year 2014-2015, the Title VIII Nursing Workforce Diversity (NWD) Grants program supported 13,225 students and aspiring students, partnering with over 900 clinical training sites. Of these sites, 42 percent were located in medically-underserved areas. Title VIII programs like NWD offer a two-fold benefit: not only are the direct recipients provided financial assistance, but they also connect these clinicians with communities that vary in socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and geographic backgrounds some that experience higher rates of health disparities. The Committee requests HRSA include in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification information on the impact of Title VIII programs on workforce diversity. The Committee is aware of provider shortages and recognizes that training postgraduate Nurse Practitioners in Federally Qualified Health Centers could address aspects of the primary care provider shortage. The Committee supports efforts to train Nurse Practitioners on a model of care consistent with both Institute of Medicine principles and the needs of vulnerable populations. The Committee believes a focus of the program should be training in the integration of primary care and behavioral health, since mental health issues and opioid and other illegal drug addiction remain healthcare priorities. Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education The Committee recommends $300,000,000 for the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education Payment program helps eligible hospitals maintain graduate medical education programs, which support the training of residents to care for the pediatric population and enhance the supply of primary care and pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties. National Practitioner Data Bank The Committee assumes $18,000,000 for the National Practitioner Data Bank, which is $814,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Committee recommendation and the fiscal year 2018 budget request assume that the data bank will be self- supporting. The Committee continues to include bill language to ensure that user fee collections cover the full costs of data bank operations. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH Maternal and Child Health Block Grant The Committee recommends $641,700,000 for the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $25,287,000 below the fiscal year 2018 budget request. States use the block grant to improve access to care for mothers, children, and their families; reduce infant mortality; provide pre- and post-natal care; support screening and health assessments for children; and provide systems of care for children with special health care needs. Maternal Depression.--The Committee recognizes that over 400,000 women in the United States suffer from postpartum depression each year. Postpartum depression can affect mother- infant bonding and have longer-term effects on the development of children. The Committee supports efforts by HRSA to address the needs of mothers and children related to maternal depression. Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Effects on Maternal and Child Health.--The Committee is alarmed by the prevalence of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and the resulting health and developmental impacts on children. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification on efforts undertaken by HRSA to address NAS. Prenatal Screening Working Group.--Patient education materials related to non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) often lag behind fast-moving NIPS technological advancements and fail to reflect the most current clinical guidance. To ensure patients and providers are educated about evidence-based practices and their applications, as well as the underlying conditions for which a patient may require further diagnostic testing based on screening results, the Committee asks the Maternal and Child Health Bureau within 120 days of enactment of this Act to convene a meeting of Federal and public stakeholders representing health care professionals, industry, and patient voices to discuss the purposes and definitions of NIPS, the status of research regarding the effectiveness of various practices regarding NIPS, other factors that should be considered in implementing NIPS, provider best practices and guidance, and patient and industry needs related to information dissemination and standards for screenings. The goal of such a meeting is for stakeholders to establish consensus about next steps for provider and patient education. Within 120 days after the meeting, recommended consensus driven activities will be reported from HRSA, along with a plan and timeline for implementation of next steps. The Committee expects a report outlining consensus recommendations for education of women regarding NIPS, and possible methods/timeline for implementing an education initiative related to prenatal screening. In addition, the working group should recommend to the Secretary a process by which materials related to specific conditions are created, disseminated, and updated on a routine basis. The Committee continues bill language identifying specific amounts for Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS). The Committee provides the following within SPRANS: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2018 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Set-aside for Oral Health............................ $5,250,000 Set-aside for Epilepsy............................... 3,642,000 Set-aside for Sickle Cell Disease.................... 3,000,000 Set-aside for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome................. 477,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Set-aside for Oral Health.--The Committee has included $250,000 to continue demonstration projects to increase the implementation of integrating oral health and primary care practice. The projects should model the core clinical oral health competencies for non-dental providers that HRSA published and initially tested in its 2014 report, Integration of Oral Health and Primary Care Practice. The Committee expects the Chief Dental Officer to play a key role in the design, monitoring, oversight, and implementation of these projects. Thalassemia.--HRSA has a long history of supporting thalassemia services. The thalassemia program has been instrumental in aiding patients with this inherited blood disorder, especially as treatments and best practices have evolved over time. The Committee encourages HRSA to reconstitute this program in order to ensure the continued improvement of care and treatment options for patients with this complex and debilitating blood disorder. Maternal and Child Health Programs In addition to the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau at HRSA supports several programs to improve the health of all mothers, children, and their families. These programs support activities that develop systemic mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease; provide information and research on and promote screening of autism and other developmental disorders; provide newborn and child screening of heritable disorders; provide grants to reduce infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes; fund States to conduct newborn hearing screening; and provide grants to improve existing emergency medical services. Within the total for Maternal and Child Health Programs, the Committee recommends the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2018 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Sickle Cell Anemia Program........................... $4,455,000 Autism and Other Developmental Disorders............. 47,099,000 Heritable Disorders.................................. 13,883,000 Healthy Start........................................ 103,500,000 Universal Newborn Hearing............................ 17,818,000 Emergency Medical Services for Children.............. 20,162,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Birthplace and Seamless Systems for Transfer of Care.--The Committee continues to note the rising rates for out of hospital births in the United States, and the subsequent importance of collaboration within an integrated maternity care system in order to achieve optimal mother-baby outcomes. The Committee believes that all women and families planning a home or birth center birth have a right to respectful, safe, and seamless consultation, referral, transport and transfer of care when necessary. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with its partners, including National organizations representing professionals who attend home, birthing center, and hospital births, to develop a strategy for facilitating ongoing inter- professional dialogue and cooperation and universal adoption of the Best Practice Guidelines for Transfer from Planned Home Birth to Hospital. The goal of this effort should be to achieve optimal mother-baby outcomes in all settings and with all providers. The Committee requests HRSA include information on this effort in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification. Breastfeeding Support and Safe Sleep Promotion.--The Committee is aware that 49 jurisdictions have selected the Title V National Performance Measure 4 on Breastfeeding and encourages HRSA to ensure incorporation and coordination of breastfeeding support within and among the Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, the Healthy Start program, and the Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. The Committee further encourages the integration of breastfeeding support and safe sleep promotion activities within these programs. Vision.--One out of four children in the United States have some form of low vision and at least four million schoolchildren start the school year not being able to see clearly. Most of these cases of poor vision are due to refractive error, a condition that is easily corrected. The Committee supports efforts at HRSA to assist programs that identify and provide prescription eyeglasses to children from low-income families. Autism and Other Developmental Disorders The Committee recommends $47,099,000 for Autism and Other Developmental Disorders; this funding level is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $47,099,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. These programs seek to improve the health and well-being of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities and to advance best practices for the early identification and treatment of autism and related developmental disabilities. The Committee provides not less than $31,317,485 for the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) program to maintain the program's capacity to train professionals to screen, diagnose, and provide evidence-based interventions to individuals with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities as authorized by the Autism CARES Act. This funding will also enable the LEND network to assist in ongoing developmental monitoring, especially for children exposed to lead and other environmental toxins and for infants exposed to the Zika virus with its resulting complications. LEND programs provide a strong community link to services and support these newest members of the disability community and their families. In addition, the funding will allow these programs to develop innovative strategies to integrate and enhance existing investments, including translating research findings on interventions, development of guidelines, tools, and systems management approaches for training settings and promotion of life-course considerations, from developmental screening in early childhood, to transition to adulthood issues. Heritable Disorders The Committee provides $13,883,000 for the Heritable Disorders program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $13,883,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Newborn Screening is a complex public health system that relies on coordinated actions by stakeholders, including clinicians, hospitals, parents, labs, and public health professionals. HRSA's Heritable Disorders Program supports a number of activities that strengthen this system to ensure infants born in every State receive rapid identification, early intervention, and potentially life-saving treatment. Pediatric Hospice Care.--The Committee recognizes the importance of pediatric hospice care. The Committee understands the unique conditions surrounding pediatric hospice care and grief support for families including the need to support family members, the recognition that child death can have more intense and longer grieving periods, and the need for development of best practices for counseling, support, medication, and other factors impacting the end of life experience for children. Recommended Uniform Screening Panel.--The Committee encourages HRSA to expand the Heritable Disorders program to support States with the implementation, education, and awareness of newborn screening for new conditions recently added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel, including Pompe, Mucopolysaccharidosis I, and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. The program will also disseminate National, regional and State education and training resources for parents, families and providers. Severe Combined Immune Deficiency.--Within the amount for Heritable Disorders, the Committee provides $2,000,000 to continue efforts to support wider implementation, education, and awareness of Newborn Screening for Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID). The Committee supports HRSA's efforts to address SCID and encourages the agency to continue the program in its current form. Healthy Start The Committee recommends $103,500,000 for the Healthy Start program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $24,803,000 below the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The program provides discretionary grants to communities with high rates of infant mortality to support primary and preventive health care services for mothers and their infants. Within the total for Healthy Start, the Committee directs not less than $1,000,000 for screening and treatment for maternal depression as authorized in section 10005 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). Fetal Infant Mortality Review.--The Fetal Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) program is an important component of many Healthy Start and local health department initiatives that provide evidence-based interventions crucial to improving infant health in high-risk communities. HRSA is encouraged to continue to support the FIMR program with Healthy Start funding while educating Healthy Start Programs on the successes of FIMR. RYAN WHITE HIV/AIDS PROGRAM Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program The Committee provides $2,318,781,000 for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $58,773,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS program funds activities to address the care and treatment of persons living with HIV/AIDS who are either uninsured or underinsured and need assistance to obtain treatment. The program provides grants to States and eligible metropolitan areas to improve the quality, availability, and coordination of health care and support services to include access to HIV-related medications; grants to service providers for early intervention outpatient services; grants to organizations to provide care to HIV infected women, infants, children, and youth; and grants to organizations to support the education and training of health care providers. Within the total for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2018 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Emergency Assistance................................. $655,876,000 Comprehensive Care Programs.......................... 1,315,005,000 AIDS Drug Assistance Program......................... 900,313,000 Early Intervention Program........................... 201,079,000 Children, Youth, Women, and Families................. 75,088,000 AIDS Dental Services................................. 13,122,000 Education and Training Centers....................... 33,611,000 Special Projects of National Significance............ 25,000,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS The Committee recommends $100,518,000 for Health Care Systems, which is $3,675,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $1,167,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The programs within Health Care Systems support National activities that enhance health care delivery in the United States. Activities include maintaining a National system to allocate and distribute donor organs to individuals awaiting transplant; building an inventory of cord blood units; maintaining a National system for the recruitment of bone marrow donors; operating the 340B drug discount program; and operating a national toll-free poison control hotline. Within the total for Health Care Systems, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2018 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Organ Transplantation................................ $23,549,000 National Cord Blood Inventory........................ 12,266,000 C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program......... 22,109,000 Office of Pharmacy Affairs........................... 10,238,000 Poison Control Centers............................... 18,846,000 National Hansen's Disease Program.................... 11,653,000 Hansen's Payment to Hawaii........................... 1,857,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Organ Transplantation Organ Donation Rates.--The Committee remains aware of the insufficient supply of donated organs to meet Nationwide need and of the existing variations among local communities in donation rates and procurement practices. The Committee directs HRSA to develop a comprehensive report with recommendations and initiatives that can be pursued to ensure that local communities adopt best practices to increase the supply of donated organs. The recommendations shall place special emphasis on assisting localities with low donation and procurement rates. HRSA shall provide this report within 120 days of enactment of this Act. Organ Distribution Proposal.--The Committee understands that the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) developed the ``Redesigning Liver Distribution'' proposal and released the proposal for public comment in 2016. The Committee recognizes that OPTN expects to release for public comment an amended proposal in 2017. The Committee urges HRSA to ensure that any proposals see a robust and transparent public debate on the merits of the proposal. Furthermore, the Committee believes that an extended process will allow the transplant community and its stakeholders to assess fully the use of appropriate supply and demand metrics and the protection of programs serving rural and underserved communities. The Committee encourages HRSA to ensure that liver redistribution proposals go through a transparent process and receive support from the transplant community prior to final action. Costs of Liver Distribution Proposals.--The Committee is aware that OPTN is preparing a revised proposal for redesigning the distribution of livers for transplant in the United States. The Committee encourages the proposal to include the scope of financial costs associated with the proposal, including estimates of the direct and indirect costs imposed on the Federal government, State governments, local governments, and public and private health insurers. Positions at Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.--The Committee appreciates the valuable role played by individuals in leadership positions and other voting positions at OPTN. The Committee expects HRSA to ensure OPTN policymaking committees and subcommittees are selected in a manner that provides equal representation with unbiased selection. National Cord Blood Inventory The Committee recommends $12,266,000 for the National Cord Blood Inventory, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $1,021,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The National Cord Blood Inventory program builds a genetically and ethnically diverse inventory of high- quality umbilical cord blood for transplantation. C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program The Committee recommends $22,109,000 for the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $42,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Committee continues to support cell transplantation through the use of cord blood, bone marrow, and peripheral blood stem cells. The Committee appreciates HRSA's efforts to increase the diversity of the volunteer registry and the program's research efforts to improve the availability, efficiency, safety, and cost of transplants and the effectiveness of program operations. Office of Pharmacy Affairs The Committee provides $10,238,000 for the Office of Pharmacy Affairs (OPA), which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $19,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Office of Pharmacy Affairs oversees the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which requires drug manufacturers to provide discounts on outpatient prescription drugs to certain safety net health care providers. The Committee recognizes that the 340B Drug Pricing program was designed to help safety net providers maintain, improve, and expand patient access to healthcare services generally. Since its enactment in 1992, the 340B program has lowered the cost of outpatient drugs to Government funded health clinics, as well as nonprofit and public hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients or rural communities. The Committee is aware that the 340B statute requires HRSA to make 340B ceiling prices available to covered entities through a secure website and continues to be concerned that OPA has failed to meet deadlines to complete work on the secure website. The Committee urges OPA to complete the development of a secure website. The Committee directs OPA to include an update on the status of the secure website in the fiscal year 2019 budget request. Poison Control Centers The Committee recommends $18,846,000 for Poison Control Centers, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $36,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Committee recognizes the critical role of this proven National public health program and the value of its services to all citizens. In 2015, poison control centers managed 2.8 million calls, which is an average of approximately 8,000 calls per day. Of these calls, 47 percent related to exposures to children age five and under, and 22 percent came from health care facilities. Of the approximate 2.2 million poisonings reported in 2015, 67 percent were managed at the site of exposure, avoiding unnecessary visits to emergency departments. RURAL HEALTH The Committee recommends $156,060,000 for Rural Health programs, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $81,665,000 more than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Rural Health programs provide funding to improve access, quality, and coordination of care in rural communities; for research on rural health issues; for technical assistance and recruitment of health care providers; for screening activities for individuals affected by the mining, transport, and processing of uranium; for the outreach and treatment of coal miners and others with occupation-related respiratory and pulmonary impairments; and for the expansion of telehealth services. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification information on the best practices and strategies to attract healthcare practitioners to rural clinics and hospitals in areas with healthcare professional shortages. Within the total for Rural Health activities, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2018 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Rural Outreach Programs.............................. $65,500,000 Rural Health Research................................ 9,351,000 Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants.................... 43,609,000 State Offices of Rural Health........................ 10,000,000 Black Lung Clinics................................... 7,266,000 Radiation Exposure Screening and Education........... 1,834,000 Telehealth........................................... 18,500,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Radiation Safety.--The Committee supports efforts to ensure information regarding exposure to radiation is up-to-date on all available options to protect surgical/interventional health care personnel and patients from radiation exposure. Telehealth.--The Committee recognizes the growing importance of telehealth in delivering high-quality healthcare to medically underserved communities in both rural and urban areas. The Committee encourages the Secretary to establish a Telehealth Center of Excellence to test the efficacy of telehealth services in both urban and rural geographic locations. FAMILY PLANNING The Committee does not recommend funding for the Family Planning program, which is $286,479,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and fiscal year 2018 budget request. The Family Planning program administers Title X of the Public Health Service Act. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT The Committee recommends $151,993,000 for the cost of Federal staff and related activities to coordinate, direct, and manage the programs of HRSA, which is $2,007,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Chief Dental Officer.--The Committee is pleased that HRSA has restored the position of Chief Dental Officer (CDO) and looks forward to learning how the agency has ensured that the CDO is functioning with executive level authority with resources to oversee and lead HRSA oral health programs and initiatives. The Committee would like an update in the fiscal year 2019 Congressional Justification on how the CDO is serving as the agency representative on oral health issues to international, National, State, and/or local government agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organizations. VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM TRUST FUND The Committee estimates that $268,000,000 will be released from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, which is $28,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2018 budget request. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides a system of compensation for individuals with vaccine-associated injuries or deaths. Funds for claims from vaccines administered on or after October 1, 1988 are generated by a per-dose excise tax on the sale of selected prescribed vaccines. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund receives revenues raised by this tax. Trust funds made available will support the liability costs of vaccines administered after September 30, 1988. The Committee recommends $8,250,000 for administration of the program, which is $500,000 more than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $950,000 less than the fiscal year 2018 budget request. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The Committee recommends a program level of $7,056,811,000 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is $198,350,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $1,026,210,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. This level includes $6,010,153,000 in discretionary budget authority, $55,358,000 in mandatory funds under the terms of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), $840,600,000 in transfers from the Prevention and Public Health (PPH) Fund, and $150,700,000 in PHS Act section 241 evaluation set-aside transfers. CDC works with State, local, and Tribal health authorities and other non- governmental health-related organizations to understand, control, and reduce public health problems. IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES The Committee recommends $744,350,000 for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (IRD), which includes $470,700,000 in discretionary budget authority, and $273,650,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. This level is $50,000,000 below the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $43,522,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request level. Immunization grants are awarded to States and local agencies for planning, developing, and conducting childhood, adolescent, and adult immunization programs, including enhancement of the vaccine delivery infrastructure. CDC directly maintains a stockpile of vaccines, supports consolidated purchase of vaccines for State and local health agencies, and conducts surveillance, investigations, and research into the safety and efficacy of new and presently-used vaccines. Within the total for IRD, the Committee recommends the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2018 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Section 317 Immunization Program..................... $556,792,000 National Immunization Survey..................... 12,864,000 Influenza Planning and Response...................... 187,558,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ HIV/AIDS, VIRAL HEPATITIS, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES AND TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION The Committee recommends $1,117,278,000 for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD), and Tuberculosis (TB) Prevention, which is the same as the fiscal year 2017 enacted level and $183,278,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget request. CDC provides National leadership and support for HIV prevention research and the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based HIV prevention programs serving persons affected by, or at risk for, HIV infection. Activities include surveillance, epidemiologic and laboratory studies, and prevention activities. CDC provides funds to State, local, and Tribal health departments and community-based organizations to develop and implement integrated community prevention plans. Within the total for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and T
