FSC Standards Jollibee’s phenomenal growth owes much to its strict and committed adherence to high standards as symbolized by “F.S.C.”: Food (F) served to the public must meet the company’s excellence standards or it will not be served at all; the Service (S) must be fast and courteous; and Cleanliness (C), from kitchen to utensils, must always be maintained. Jollibee is proud of its employees who carry out their jobs. Jollibee recognizes them by providing the highest compensation and benefits packages in the fastfood industry, and modern and comprehensive training programs. Managers are regularly updated on the latest store operations systems, people-oriented management skills, among others. Service crews are trained on various store stations and food-service innovations. Jollibee also offers career opportunities for qualified and exceptional crew members to further their food-service careers as managers. Store operations are ably supported by professionals who are experts in Marketing, Computer Management and Engineering.

The Commisary Thanks to the Jollibee Commissary System, ensuring the manufacture and distribution of safe and high- quality food in the most cost-efficient manner is made possible. There are three Commissary System sites: Santolan, Pasig City; Mandaue City, Cebu; and the central site in Canlubang, Laguna. The System, which operates 24/7, manages Jollibee’s total supply chain process. The Jollibee Pasig City commissary has production lines for breads and sauces, and is the distribution center for North Manila and North Luzon. In 1996, Jollibee opened the Vismin Foods Corporation (VFC) in Mandaue City, Cebu to service the Visayas and Mindanao areas. VFC has its own bread, pie, sauce, and frozen patty lines. The Laguna commissary is the biggest and most advanced in the country and among Asia’s best. Operated by Zenith Foods Corporation (ZFC), a full subsidiary of Jollibee, the newest commissary is on a 6-hectare property in the Calmelray Industrial Park. Aided by custom-made mechanized equipment, the production lines are for the marinated Chicken Joy, frozen patties and pies, breads, sauces, hotdogs and other meat products, and dry blended goods. ZFC can service over 800 Jollibee and Greenwich stores. The chicken marination line can produce as many as 150,000 pieces a day while about 480,000 hamburger patties a day is turned out by the frozen patty line. The breadline is designed to match the volume output of patties, i.e. also about 480,000 pieces a day. The pie line can produce as much as 157,000 pocket pies in a 20-hour operating day. Currently, pies are exported to Jollibee stores in Hong Kong, Guam, Saipan, Brunei, and the USA. Various sauce products are processed in the ZFC sauceline including those for the Jollibee bestsellers, spaghetti and palabok. A professionally staffed Technical Services Team supports the maintenance of an internationally accepted quality management system that further ensures the quality and safety of the commissary manufactured food products. High caliber teams from Engineering, Human Resources, Information Management, Finance and Accounting likewise provide support to the Manufacturing and Logistics operations of the Commissary. Proof of Jollibee’s adherence to high quality standards is the various awards it garnered for the commissaries: in 1997, the commissary in Pasig earned the Outstanding Industrial Plant in the National Capital Region from the Laguna Lake Development Authority and the Most Improved Industry awarded by the Sagip Pasig Movement while Commissary Plant Engineer Romy P. Fernandez was awarded as one of the Top Ten Most Outstanding Pollution Control Officers of the Philippines. In 1998 also, the frozen patty line in the Pasig commissary was awarded an ISO 9002 certification by the SGS (Societe’ Generale Surveillance) Yarsely, an international certification body. 2004 is a banner year for Vismin Foods Corporation (VFC) who has been assessed and certified by the National Meat Inspection Commission of the Department of Agriculture, to have fully met the requirements and standards of Good Manufacturing Practice, reinforcing the commissary’s “AAA” accreditation granted by the same agency.

Set a record collection of 283,671 toys and books in 2010

Distributed over 500,000 total gifts in 2010 with Jollibee matching every donation with its own Jollibee toy, book or school item Bigger, More Ways to Share! Over the past couple of years, Maaga ang Pasko has also evolved into a campaign that mobilized the support of Jollibee customers and volunteers to address pressing needs of the community and the society at large. In 2008, in celebration of Jollibee’s 30th anniversary, the Jollibee Hug and Share dolls special novelty promo was launched in partnership with Jollibee Franchisees Association and Jollibee Foundation. Sales of the limited-edition dolls raised over P18 million pesos which were donated to eight charitable institutions engaged in programs and projects that directly benefit children. These included Cottolengo Filipino (Rizal), ERDA Tech (Manila), Families and Children for Empowerment and Development Foundation (Manila), House with No Steps (Quezon City), Marcellin Project (General Santos City), Shontoug Foundation (Baguio City), Philippine Children’s Medical Center (Quezon City), and the Busog, Lusog, Talino In-School Feeding Program of the Jollibee Foundation (Leyte). In 2009, Maaga ang Pasko decided to focus its efforts on repairing schools severely damaged by typhoons Ondoy and Pepeng. Together with Maaga ambassador Aga Muhlach, Jollibee embarked on a Christmas Caravan as it went around distributing toys and books as well as school supplies to some 36 schools from calamity-stricken areas like Taguig, Pasig, Marikina, Cainta, Zambales, Benguet, Pangasinan and Laguna. With the help of the Jollibee Foundation, eight of the most severely affected schools also received additional help by getting either a new classroom, desks, computers and other instructional materials. In 2010, the campaign sought to actively help in addressing the country’s classroom gap with another novelty promotion, the Jollibee and Friends dolls. Jollibee was able to raise a total of P12 million from the sales of the Jollibee and Friends dolls which, together with the additional P8 million donation from the Jollibee Franchisees Association and the Jollibee Foundation – will be used to build a total of 40 public school classrooms beginning 2011. It also represents Jollibee’s concrete support to the Bayanihang Pampaaralan program, being one of the first private organizations to come forward to help address the classroom gap. See the Jolly Toy Scouts in Action â€œTo see a young boy’s or girl’s face light up with a smile upon receiving a toy or a book, even a used one, never fails to tug at my heart. I guess getting a book or a toy makes them happy, knowing that there are people who remember them at Christmas. This project has given more meaning to my Christmas, and to my life, especially now that I have younger children. It has taught me the value of sharing. It has brought me the joy of giving., Aga Muhlach Masaya kasi nakakatulong kami. Alam namin na pag na-receive ng mga bata yung toys, masaya sila.
