Rishi Kapoor Mistakenly Mourns The ‘Death’ Of Eddie Murphy Instead Of His Brother Charlie
News > Entertainment

While Hollywood was mourning the death of Comedian and actor Charlie Murphy who died in his sleep at a New York hospital after suffering from leukemia, Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor mistakenly paid tribute to his younger brother Eddie Murphy by posting his picture on Twitter.

Soon after realising his gaffe, the 64-year-old actor deleted the post.

The American comedian, who was best-known for his appearances on Dave Chappelle's show, died on April 13 at the age of 57. He even co-wrote and appeared in some of his brother's films, including Norbit and Vampire in Brooklyn.

Several celebrities like Chris Rock, Kevin Hart, Zendaya, Debra Lee, Gabrielle Union and Spike Lee had paid tribute to the comedian on Twitter.
