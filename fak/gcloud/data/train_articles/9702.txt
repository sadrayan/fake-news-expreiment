Hillary Clinton Net Worth
The Hillary Clinton net worth total of $31.3 million comes from analyzing her Public Financial Disclosure Reports. Bill Clinton has an estimated net worth of $80 million. That gives a combined Bill and Hillary Clinton net worth of $111 million dollars. U.S. presidential candidates aren’t required to reveal their exact net worth, so Hillary Clinton’s is only available within a range. Clinton has reported net worth assets of at least $10,830,007 and at most $51.7 million. Mrs. Clinton did not report any real estate or debts. If the Clintons do own property or debts, it’s all in Bill Clinton’s name. Placing assets and liabilities in Bill’s name would mean they wouldn’t be reported as part of Hillary Clinton’s net worth.

Figuring Mrs. Clinton’s minimum and maximum assets gives an average Hillary Clinton net worth of $31,265,004.

The popular politician has many fans in both the public and private sector.

Hillary Clinton Net Worth: A Different Path

The chart above shows that Hillary Clinton’s net worth doesn’t follow the same path as others in the U.S. Senate. As with other senators, Hillary Clinton’s net worth rose in the 2006/2007 period, then dropped with the stock market in 2008. However, Mrs. Clinton’s net worth then skyrocketed by about 30% in 2009. What caused this sudden jump?

2009: A Sudden Jump in Hillary Clinton’s Net Worth

In January of 2009 Mrs. Clinton left the senate to become the U.S. Secretary of State. Her salary in that job was $186,600. While that’s not exactly small, It’s only $12,600 more per year than the salary of a U.S. senator at $174,000. It hardly accounts for a $10 million hike in the Hillary Clinton net worth total the same year. Also in 2009, Clinton reported buying $5 million to $26 million in money market funds and real estate.

It’s unclear where the sudden jump in the Hillary Clinton net worth amount came from. In 2009, Mrs. Clinton wasn’t paid any of her famous six-figure speaking fees. Those payouts didn’t start until 2014. Her last book, Living History, was published in 2003. She received a record advance of $8 million for the memoir, bit that didn’t enter into 2009 Hillary Clinton net worth calculations. Her next book, Hard Choices didn’t come out until 2014. Finally, the 2008/2009 financial crisis should have decreased Clinton’s wealth. So where did the $10 million dollar jump in Hillary Clinton’s net worth in 2009 come from? It’s very difficult to say.

2011: A Sudden Drop in Hillary Clinton Net Worth

Another curious change to the Hillary Clinton net worth total came in 2011. In that year, Mrs. Clinton’s wealth suddenly dropped from $30 million to $13 million. That’s over 50%. There was no drop in the stock market to account for the $17 million fall in Hillary Clinton’s net worth. However, Clinton’s public reports show that in 2011, she “exchanged” $5-$25 million in investments. It’s not clear if the exchange left the money in her name or transferred it to another person. It’s common practice for politicians to place assets in a spouse’s name. Whether that’s to hide the money from public view or for some other reason isn’t openly discussed. If Mrs. Clinton transferred the money to husband Bill, it would account for $17 million disappearing from Hillary Clinton’s net worth.

The Clintons reportedly have some of their money in blind trusts that prevent even them from knowing their exact net worth. If those trusts were created in 2011, they may account for the $17 million drop in Hillary Clinton net worth figures also.

2014: Speaking Fees Raise Hillary Clinton’s Net Worth

Hillary Clinton’s net worth jumped again in 2014 from over $12 million in speaking fees. The fees were for speeches to tech firms, legal firms and other companies. The biggest boost to the Hillary Clinton net worth story from those speeches was a $335,000 payout for a single speech. That came from the Biotechnology Industry Association in California. To learn more about how speaking fees boosted Hillary Clinton’s net worth, see the section on speeches below.

Hillary Clinton Net Worth: Financial Disclosure Forms

On May 15 of 2015, reports on Hillary Clinton’s net worth were released to the public. Since presidential candidates don’t have to disclose the value of many types of assets, the forms give an incomplete picture of Hillary Clinton’s net worth.

For instance, candidates don’t have to disclose the value of personal, private residences. They also don’t have to share the value of most assets held in a spouse’s name.

In fact, Clinton does not list any property at all. The Clintons probably do own some real estate. If so, it’s all in Bill Clinton’s name. Since Mr. Clinton is no longer a public employee, any such assets in his name would not affect Hillary Clinton net worth calculations.

Hillary Clinton Net Worth Liabilities

One major question in Hillary Clinton net worth figures is, where are the debts? Mrs. Clinton doesn’t list any. If the Clintons have any liabilities, they’re all in Bill’s name. As such, any liabilities wouldn’t figure into Hillary Clinton net worth calculations.

Speaking Fees: A Big Boost to Hillary Clinton’s Net Worth

The biggest boost to Hillary Clinton’s net worth in 2015 came from speaking fees. Clinton was routinely paid anywhere from $100,000 to $335,000 for a single speech, sometimes packing in two speeches in a single day. We’ve included a list of speaking fees that add to Hillary Clinton’s net worth below.

Hillary Clinton Earns as Much As…

for the 52 speeches she gave in 2014 and 2015, Mrs. Clinton earned an average of $231,337. Assuming each speech took 2 hours, that would mean $115,616 added per hour to Hillary Clinton’s net worth. The infographic below compares that impressive hourly rate to several other professions and personages in the United States.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Doctors in the U.S. earn an average $90 an hour. Nurses earn $31 per hour. High school teachers make $26 per hour. To see how these professionals could match Mrs. Clinton’s net worth, we compared their pay to Hillary Clinton’s average estimated hourly rate for speeches. We also compared minimum wage earners to Hillary Clinton. By the figures above, it would be nearly impossible for any of these U.S. laborers to amass wealth anywhere near Hillary Clinton’s net worth.

List of Speaking Fees That Add to Hillary Clinton’s Net Worth

Below is a list of the speaking fees Mrs. Clinton reported in her financial disclosure forms in 2015.

The table shows that speeches given in 2014 and 2015 contributed over $12 million to Mrs. Clinton’s net worth. Not listed are speeches with proceeds donated to charity. Those speeches don’t contribute to Hillary Clinton net worth calculations.

Hillary Clinton Net Worth: Where it Comes From

Hillary Clinton’s net worth comes from various sources. Clinton began building her net worth as a lawyer in the early 1970s. In that time, she earned as much as $200,000 in one year. She has also received income as a U.S. State Senator and U.S. Secretary of State. Revenue from the sales of two books adds to the Hillary Clinton net worth story. Finally, speaking fees of up to $335,000 per appearance and income from investments complete the Hillary Clinton net worth picture.

Bill Clinton once said he was one of the poorest U.S. presidents. Although this was true while he was in office, he is now one of the top ten richest. That’s thanks to a $15 million book advance and over $100 million in speaking fees. Estimates place combined figures for Bill and Hillary Clinton’s net worth at $111 million dollars.

Hillary Clinton Net Worth Before the White House

By the time Bill Clinton was elected president, Hillary Clinton’s net worth was estimated at $700,000. She earned most of this money personally from her career as a lawyer and from positions on the boards of several corporations.

Hillary Clinton’s net worth started building in 1973 when she received her law degree from Yale Law School. She worked as an attorney for the Children’s Defense Fund in Massachusetts. She also worked as a member of the House Impeachment Inquiry Staff during the Watergate scandal. She married Bill Clinton in 1975 and joined the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas in 1977. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families that same year.

Hillary Clinton became first lady of Arkansas in 1979. She was the first woman to be accepted as a full partner in the Rose Law Firm. From then until the White House, she made more money annually than her husband.

In 1978 and 1979, Hillary Clinton’s net worth grew rapidly. She turned a $1,000 investment in Cattle futures into $100,000 in just ten months. In 1991, her last year working for the Rose Law Firm, she made over $200,000.

Also contributing to Hillary Clinton’s net worth during her pre White House days were several corporate positions. These include seats on the board of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital, as chair of the Children’s Defense Fund, on the board of directors of TCBY, Lafarge and Walmart.

The White House Years

By the time Bill Clinton left office in 2000, Hillary Clinton’s net worth was estimated at minus $8,000,000. Mrs. Clinton famously told ABC’s Diane Sawyer that when she and her husband left the White House, they were “dead broke.”

Hillary Clinton’s net worth took a big drop during her years as first lady of the nation. Although her assets continued to grow, she and husband Bill took on a huge amount of legal debt. The debt was the result of battling the Whitewater and Lewinsky investigations.

The Whitewater Scandal began in 1993, when former Clinton business partner David Hale claimed the Clintons engaged in massive real estate fraud. The Clintons were never convicted, and sought reimbursement for $3.5 million in legal fees. Their request was denied by the United States Court of Appeals.

Legal fees from the Lewinsky scandal of well into the millions of dollars further lowered Hillary Clinton’s net worth.

During Bill Clinton’s White House years, Hillary Clinton’s net worth was aided by a $2.6 million donation from the Clinton Legal Expense Trust. The gift was intended to help with legal fees. She also continued to earn money from investments.

Hillary Clinton Net Worth After the White House

Since Bill Clinton left office, Hillary Clinton’s net worth has grown to an estimated $31.2 million.

Clinton donated the proceeds from her book, It Takes a Village to charity. However, she did receive income from sales of Living History. The book paid Mrs. Clinton an $8 million dollar advance and sold over a million copies. It likely lifted Hillary Clinton’s net worth by well over $10 million.

Clinton earned $186,600 per year as Secretary of State. In the years since 2000, speaking fees of up to $335,000 per appearance also jacked up Hillary Clinton’s net worth. Payouts for speeches in that time added up to over $12 million. One speech paid between $500,000 and $1,000,000. However, since the proceeds of that speech were donated to charity, they don’t factor into Hillary Clinton net worth calculations.

In 1999, the Clintons bought a home in Chappaqua, New York for $1.7 million. They bought another home for $2.85 million one year later in Washington, D.C. The homes are apparently kept in Bill’s name, because they don’t show up in any public Hillary Clinton net worth disclosures.

Hillary Clinton Net Worth in the News

As with many presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton’s wealth is good fodder for the media. The video below is just one example of the candidate’s net worth in the news. The video, from Celebrity Net Worth & Biographies, places Clinton’s worth at $21.5 million, about $10 million shy of our detailed estimates. Also in the news, Sanders defeated the 64 times wealthier Clinton in the Wisconsin primary on 4/5/16.

Clinton stirred up a real TwitStorm on 12/26/15 with her internet meme comparing her to an Abuela (Latina grandmother). Many thought the candidate was pandering to Latinos, which didn’t jibe with some because of her status of power and wealth.

Charity and Hillary Clinton Net Worth

According to the Clintons’ tax returns, Bill and Hillary Clinton donated $3 million to charity in 2014. In the years from 2007 to 2014, the Clintons gave about $15 million to charity. That’s about 11% of their total income or 14% of the total Bill and Hillary Clinton net worth sum. 98% of that money was donated to the Clinton Family Foundation.

The Clintons have come under fire from some in the media about donations to the Clinton Family Foundation. The Clintons use money from the foundation for travel and to pay staffers. That means there’s some question whether all the contributed money can really be classified as charity. Either way, the donations don’t figure in to the Hillary Clinton net worth total.

Hillary Clinton Net Worth in the Future

If Hillary Clinton is elected president, her net worth will certainly grow. Stock and bond investments alone will likely grow Clinton’s wealth by about 6% per year or $2 million. The salary of a U.S. President is $400,000, so that figure would also add to Clinton’s net worth. A Hillary presidency would likely keep Bill Clinton on the speaking circuit, earning him additional millions in speaking fees. Finally, post-presidency, Hillary would likely command the highest speaking fees and book contracts in history. The first woman president every could quite possibly command fees of over $1 million dollars per speech.
