They Didn't Exist. But Could They Have?
It is probably no accident that Patrick Stewart, narrating Animal Planet's "Dragons: A Fantasy Made Real," sounds so much like Orson Welles. Tuning in to this film at any point tomorrow night between 8 and 9:30 could be a "War of the Worlds" experience.

Like Welles's "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast in 1938, a long fantasy news bulletin that convinced some Americans that Martians had actually landed in New Jersey, "Dragons" takes a fictional premise, announces it at the beginning of the show and then runs with it, with no further disclaimers.

So when viewers hear "Half of all young males are killed in territorial battles" and "Their wings soak up heat like solar panels, another adaptation for life in this forbidding climate," it's easy to forget that this isn't a serious documentary about a known species.

But maybe that's unfair. "Dragons" is quite serious, with its conclusions drawn from animal-kingdom realities; it just isn't reality, as far as anyone knows. "If dragons were real, then what were they really like?" Mr. Stewart asks at the beginning. After all, they turn up in the art of civilizations as far apart as the Aztecs, the Chinese and the Inuit. Then he asks, "What if we found a body?"

The answer is a live-action dramatization of the discovery, in the Carpathian Mountains in Romania, of "a dragon carcass, completely intact," preserved in ice, near the similarly preserved bodies of some 15th-century would-be slayers. When the film returns to this scene, near the end, viewers learn that the dragon was a young female, left alone while her mother went out to hunt and too immature to protect herself by breathing fire.
