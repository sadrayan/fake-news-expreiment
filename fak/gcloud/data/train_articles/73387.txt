How many times have you believed the NYTs and WaPo—no matter how many stories they've had to retract? Quite a bit it seems.



I can observe and see most things Pope Francis has said like alluding to global govt for climate change, climate change etc. Some even on video. He's definitely, openly and brazenly acting in a highly political manner. It is discussed among Catholics as I know many of them and have many in my family.



It is a fact, that some Catholic leaders have written to president Trump to investigate this unusual abdication of a pope, replacing a very short run of the previous pope, during the Obama/Clinton years and the influence of Soros. I posted a link to that exact letter.



Now again, I am willing to concede this may not be true, but so far, ALL of you using this line, are coming up far short.

So based on this Pope's previous actions and comments, I don't find this implausible.





Oh, and I am not a "bro'". So this is all you got? Can't contend anything regarding the points?How many times have you believed the NYTs and WaPo—no matter how many stories they've had to retract?
