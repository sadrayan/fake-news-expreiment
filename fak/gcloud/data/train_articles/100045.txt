A Christian librarian from Conway has drawn looks, praise and negativity for her decision to hear a hijab in support of Muslim women, and publicity around her has reached all the way to the Middle East, according to a profile in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette River Valley & Ozark edition.

Nancy Allen, a member of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Conway, began wearing a traditional Muslim headscarf late last year in response to attention surrounding the Syrian refugee crisis and anti-Muslim statements made by presidential candidate Donald Trump, Allen told writer Tammy Keith.

Allen also shared the story about how a friend returned from Turkey having met a vendor who had heard of Allen through a sermon at a local mosque.
