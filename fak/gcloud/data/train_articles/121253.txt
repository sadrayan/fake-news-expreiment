‘He’s Alive!’ ABC Captures Moment Ebola Victim, Presumed Dead, Moves His Arm
When one man in Monrovia, Liberia, was presumed dead after days of suffering from the Ebola virus, a burial team showed up with an hour. ABC News captured the stunning moment when those workers noticed the man was not deceased, immediately taking him away for hospital treatment instead.

ABC’s chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser was reporting from the virus-stricken country when his crew came upon a burial team removing a dead man along the side of the road. A large crowd of angry locals had gathered, telling Besser that the man had needed help for days, but it never came. Once he was assumed dead, however, a removal team showed up soon after.

As the suited team worked to move the body from the ground to a black bag, spraying it with bleach, the man began to move his arm. “He’s alive,” someone shouted. “He’s not dead!” Besser echoed.

The team hesitated for a moment before unwrapping the man’s body. An ambulance showed up ten minutes later to take him away for treatment.
