01/19/2011 -- H.R. 2, sponsored by pro-life House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), is a bill to completely repeal the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act" (PPACA), the massive healthcare restructuring law that was enacted in March, 2010 (Public Law 111-148), sometimes referred to as "ObamaCare."

For these reasons, the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) strongly supports repeal of the PPACA, as explained in a letter sent to U.S. House members endorsing this repealer bill, H.R. 2, posted here .

8. Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act (PRENDA) (ban on sex-selection abortions) (05/31/2012, Roll Call No. 299)

05/31/2012 --





The Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act (PRENDA), H.R. 3541, sponsored by pro-life Rep. Trent Franks (R-Az.), would make it a federal offense, punishable by up to five years imprisonment, to knowingly do any one of the following four things: (1) perform an abortion “knowing that such abortion is sought based on the sex or gender of the child”; (2) use “force or the threat of force . . . for the purpose of coercing a sex-selection abortion”; (3) solicit or accept funds to perform a sex-selection abortion; or (4) transport a woman into the U.S. or across state lines for this purpose. The bill explicitly provides, “A woman upon whom a sex-selection abortion is performed may not be prosecuted or held civilly liable for any violation of this section, or for a conspiracy to violate this section.” The bill also explicitly provides that healthcare providers do not have any “affirmative duty to inquire as to the motivation for the abortion, absent the healthcare provider having knowledge or information that the abortion is being sought based on the sex or gender of the child.” The National Right to Life Committee strongly supports the PRENDA. President Obama opposes the PRENDA . On May 31, 2012, the House of Representatives considered H.R. 3541 under a fast-track procedure called "Suspension of the Rules." The tally was 246-168 in favor of the bill -- a solid majority, although short of the two-thirds majority required for passage under the fast-track procedure. The bill remains alive and available for further consideration by the House. (Detailed information on sex-selection abortion and the bill is available on the NRLC website .) On this roll call, 226 Republicans and 20 Democrats voted to pass the bill, while seven Republicans and 161 Democrats voted against the bill. House roll call no. 299, May 31, 2012.
