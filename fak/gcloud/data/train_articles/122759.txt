Rights Group Says NATO Bombing in Yugoslavia Violated Law
In an extensive report that infuriated NATO leaders, Amnesty International said today that NATO violated international law in its bombing war over Yugoslavia by hitting targets where civilians were sure to be killed.

In particular, the human rights group said that NATO's bombing of the Belgrade headquarters of Radio Television Serbia, on April 23, 1999, ''was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime.'' Sixteen people died in the predawn attack, nearly all of them technicians, security workers and makeup artists.

NATO has defended the bombing as an attack on the ''propaganda machine'' of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.

International law forbids direct attacks on civilians and civilian targets and requires all feasible precautions to prevent civilian deaths. In some cases, Amnesty said, NATO failed to take sufficient precautions to minimize civilian casualties. The number of civilian deaths from NATO air strikes ''could have been significantly reduced if NATO forces had fully adhered to the laws of war,'' the report said.

Amnesty also condemned a NATO attack on a bridge at Varvarin on May 30, 1999, in which at least 11 civilians died. ''NATO forces failed to suspend their attack after it was evident that they had struck civilians,'' the report said, and it criticized NATO for ordering its pilots to fly so high that they could not take proper precautions against bombing civilians. In particular, the report criticized the bombing of convoys of Albanian refugees near Djakovica on April 14 and Korisa on May 13.
