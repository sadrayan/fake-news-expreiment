CLIENT MEMO: Key Findings from the Alabama Senate Run-Off
Our friends at 0ptimus monitored the electorate in the Alabama Republican Senate Runoff with four separate opinion reads (polls) for two weeks leading into this election. Firehouse Strategies worked with 0ptimus to review data and learn lessons for next year’s midterms. During that time, voters’ awareness of President Trump’s endorsement of Senator Strange increased dramatically. However, in a trend that could have dramatic impacts on the midterm elections, Trump’s endorsement and campaigning for Strange did not move voters.

Key takeaway: We can concretely say that Donald Trump’s endorsement, and active campaigning for Sen. Strange, had absolutely no impact on the ballot.

Over time in this race, we saw that voters became more and more aware that Trump was backing Strange: Question: “As far as you know, which candidate has Donald Trump endorsed?” Answers by opinion read date: 9/13/17: 64% 9/18/17: 75% 9/22/17: 80% 9/24/17: 80%



Yet over the same period, and despite a Trump rally, there was no similar uptick-in Moore’s support Question: “In the upcoming primary runoff for Senate, do you plan to support Roy Moore, Luther Strange, or are you not planning to vote?” Answers by opinion read date: 9/13/17: 35% (Moore 42%, Undecided 23%) 9/18/17: 36% (Moore 43%, Undecided 22%) 9/22/17: 35% (Moore 46%, Undecided 19%) 9/24/17: 36% (Moore 46%, Undecided 18%) *note: totals may be off by 1% due to rounding



Over the time we were monitoring during the last two weeks of the campaign, as knowledge of Trump’s endorsement grew, Strange support did not. In fact, Moore was solidifying support through Trump’s visit, and Trump was unable to reverse this momentum. This suggests that while Trump may be good at translating his supporters’ sentiments, he is unable to persuade them.

If the Alabama example holds nationwide, Republicans running in the midterm elections cannot expect a polling jump from an endorsement or campaign rally by President Trump.

Methodology on opinion reads: Optimus conducted 4 separate automated interview opinion reads of likely voters ending on the dates above, each lasting two nights and with sample sizes above 1,500. Likely voters were targeted for interview based on voter history and 0ptimus modeling for who would turnout in the runoff election.
