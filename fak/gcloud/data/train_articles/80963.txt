David Clarke to put armed guards at courthouse entrances

Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. says he wants to put armed deputies at visitor checkpoints at the courthouse complex, a move he said was prompted by the mass shootings this week at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.

"The days of innocence in believing that what happened at the Navy Shipyard can't happen here in Milwaukee are over," Clarke said in a statement. "It is a different world today, a dangerous world and unlike some elected officials, I refuse to stick my head in the sand or cross my fingers that it won't happen."

Clarke similarly ordered deputies to staff the checkpoints at the courthouse in March, following a courthouse shooting in Delaware. He said at the time an undercover deputy with a gun hidden in his waistband had foiled security checkpoints at the courthouse complex at all six entrances.

He pulled deputies from that duty earlier this summer and said in his statement that he discontinued the staffing because of lack of funding. Unarmed security guards now staff the checkpoints.

Clarke said he'll make a formal request for the deputy staffing next week to County Executive Chris Abele and the County Board. Clarke has already requested an additional 100 deputy positions in his 2014 budget request.

Brendan Conway, a spokesman for Abele, said the sheriff was welcome to add the armed deputies at the courthouse entrances "if he feels the need to."
