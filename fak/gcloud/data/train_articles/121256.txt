Neil DeGrasse Tyson Criticizes Liberals for Anti-Science Beliefs on Maher
Neil DeGrasse Tyson chatted with Bill Maher tonight about (what else?) science, but this time Maher asked him to expound on anti-scientific views held by liberals.

Tyson pointed to anti-vaccine liberals (Maher isn’t quite there, but he’s raised questions) and the obsession in some far-left circles with alternative medicines.

Matt Welch also threw out the “anti-scientific” resistance to GMOs, which Tyson agreed with.

But as both Maher and Eddie Huang pointed out, it’s unfair to embrace a “false equivalency,” because “size matters, Republicans are worse” on matters of science.
