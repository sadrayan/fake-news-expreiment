Text of Senator Schumer's Speech
I want to speak to you today about our most recent Supreme Court appointees, Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito. I had the privilege to take part in their confirmation hearings, and I did my best to perform my solemn constitutional duty to assess their fitness to take their seats on the high court.

I did my best to ascertain their legal philosophies and judicial ideologies with careful questioning, as did my colleagues. Neither of them was particularly forthright in answering my questions, and I therefore could not in good conscience vote to confirm either of them.

This afternoon, I want to address three questions that arise from the experience of the Roberts and Alito confirmations:

Question One: Were we duped?

Question Two : What lessons should we draw from the process that led to the confirmation of Roberts and Alito?

Question Three : How should we apply those lessons to the next nomination to the High Court?
