Almost one month removed from the election, the channel is more than tripling CNN and MSNBC in total viewers in primetime, with Fox averaging 2.9 million viewers to CNN’s 960,000 and MSNBC’s 959,000, according to Nielsen Research.

In total day, Fox is beating CNN and MSNBC combined with 1.82 million viewers in the category versus 765,000 for CNN and 559,000 for MSNBC.

Fox is the only cable news network to increase viewership from before the campaign season ended.

21st Century CEO James Murdoch told Business Insider’s Ignition conference on Tuesday that the network won't change course much after a turbulent 2016 that included the resignation of former Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes amid sexual harassment claims by several women, including former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson.

“I don’t think it’s about a pivot from a political bias one way or another, it’s about attracting the best talent," Murdoch said.

“The goal for anyone in the news business is to make sure that you’re presenting the news, breaking news, but also providing different perspectives, consistently putting the best product on the air and investing in that product and that’s something we’ll continue to do.”
