Guy Fawkes Mask
About Guy Fawkes Masks

Remember, remember the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. The now-iconic Guy Fawkes mask was made famous by gonzo cartoonist Alan Moore's comic book "V for Vendetta" and the film adaptation, both of which feature a protagonist who goes by the enigmatic moniker of V and wears a mask at all times. The mustachioed white mask with its stylized, jester-like features has also become a fixture of the Anonymous online group. Resin or plastic are common components used to make these masks, which are an essential component of any V costume or a getup geared toward his understudy, Evie Hammond, who eventually dons the mask on her own terms. Ceramic masks are also available, and most fasten behind the head with a strap or, in some cases, a ribbon or durable string. You can find a Guy Fawkes mask on eBay where sellers offer reasonable shipping options on an extensive inventory of costumes and dress-up accessories. Channel your inner V, and bring a little revolutionary spirit to your next costume or cosplay.
