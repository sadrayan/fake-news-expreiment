Black Elected Officials To Meet

Indicted state lawmaker Tyrone Brooks kicked off a conference of Georgia black elected officials this afternoon with a promise not to campaign for his defense.

The Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials President says he'll be deflecting talk this weekend about his legal troubles.

Last month, federal prosecutors charged the Atlanta Democrat with mail fraud, wire fraud and filing false tax returns.

Brooks has led GABEO for 20 years.

This weekend's annual association conference in Savannah will focus on voting rights.

But Brooks acknowledges his troubles are on the minds of many of GABEO's 1,000-plus members.

"I think the accusations against me have been on the minds of my colleagues and friends for a long time," Brooks says. "And it won't surprise me if people will have a lot to say. I don't have anything to say. I've said enough."

Brooks has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.

The Atlanta Democrat says the association won't be discussing his future as GABEO's leader.

"Even if the organization felt that there should be some changes I would support whatever decision the organization suggests," Brooks says. "It's never been about me."

The conference continues through Sunday.

A panel appointed by the Governor has until next Friday to decide whether Brooks will remain in elected office.
