MADE FOR YOUR RIDE - | Mark Scott | 6/11/19

Durability, versatility, or mobility? As one of the only riders to complete every stage of the Enduro World Series since its inception, Mark Scott knows a thing or two about mountain bike gear. In the latest Made for Your Ride video, Mark builds a kit to ride the beautiful hills around Edinburgh, Scotland.

“Flexair is my all-time favorite summer riding jersey; it’s been my go-to over the last few years as it’s very light feeling and dries out super quick. It makes it perfect for my longer endurance rides and EWS racing."

- Mark Scott – Pro Enduro Racer

MARK SCOTT’S MTB GEAR

With breathtaking landscapes, Scotland was made for mountain biking. With its nearly limitless flexibility, Flexair was made to move. Scott put both of these statements to the test in our latest episode in the Made for Your Ride video series. The ultra-lightweight Flexair jersey and Flexair shorts are not only exceptionally breathable, but they stretch to match your every move. It’s just the gear he needs to navigate tight singletrack and switchbacks. He completed his kit with a Proframe helmet. This breathable full-faced helmet provides the ideal level of coverage for fast, aggressive trail riding.

MADE FOR YOU

Mark built his mountain bike kit to maximize mobility as he zigzagged through the Scotland countryside. Now, it’s your turn. Will you choose Flexair for its unbeatable breathability and flexibility, Defend for its unmatched durability, or Ranger for its on-and-off-the-bike versatility? Better yet, will you mix and match all three to create a kit uniquely “you”?
