White House special adviser Ivanka Trump is being praised by many for her efforts to help push tax reform legislation through Congress.

Specifically, Trump was a vocal advocate for the doubling of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000.

"She was an advocate who was there to talk about how to bring the family discussion to the table," Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) told ABC News.

"[Ivanka] played a big role in all that has happened relative to tax reform. She deserves a lot of credit for what has happened," said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) Thursday morning on "Fox & Friends."

The hosts then spoke to the president's eldest daughter, who explained that when she travels across the country, she sees firsthand the "financial fragility" of many families.

"The average American family cannot come up with $400 in the event of an emergency. My father and this administration is committed to changing that," she said, adding that the child tax credit is designed for the working family.

She said the administration's goal is to create "prosperity for all Americans" through lower taxes and deregulation of businesses.

"This is just the beginning," she said.

Trump said she's looking forward to traveling throughout the U.S. in April to highlight the impact of the bill at tax filing time.
