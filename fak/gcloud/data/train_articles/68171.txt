Cruz has ‘zero interest’ in being Trump’s vice president
WASHINGTON— Sen. Ted Cruz shot down the idea of joining forces with GOP front-runner Donald Trump on a single ticket, if offered the vice presidency.

Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday that he would reject the idea flat out — although he has not been offered such an opportunity.

“I have absolutely zero interest in doing that,” Cruz said. “Donald Trump loses to Hillary … a lot of folks in the Washington establishment, they’re having fevered dreams right now of wanting a brokered convention.”

With Sen. Marco Rubio dropping out of the race after Tuesday’s primaries and Gov. John Kasich with only one win under his belt, Cruz has secured his position as the Trump alternative for conservative voters. He has noted if he loses the nomination to Trump he plans to support the nominee, unless he shoots someone.
