Wen and Hair Loss
Ok I am glad I found this thread again. I replied to this when I first started using the Wen Pom. I said I love it, my hair was bouncy, wavy, full really nice. Ok, to back up a little. I have thin, fine hair about to the top of my shoulders. Usually laid flat, but when I started using the Wen for the first time I noticed my hair seemed fuller, thicker, bouncy.

Now about 2 months later in my crown area (which is my problem area for thinness) it seems to be worse. My hair because of cow licks and growth pattern grows forward in that area anyway so I am always fighting the pattern to lay it back to cover this area better. Anyway yesterday and today after showering and washing my hair and drying it I thought it was looking a little "baldy" not super bad that I can't cover it up with back combing but just thinner in that problem area. Yesterday I used my regular shampoo and conditioner that I used before the Wen and until I notice this improving I am not using my Wen again.

Yes Wen does make your hair feel bouncy and healthy but for someone like myself who already is hair follicle challenged I am going back to my regular shampoo and conditioner. When I styled my hair this morning I really didn't notice any difference in my styled hair, it wasn't frizzy like Chaz says happens with regular shampoo. I think it is how you dry it and not to over dry it and rub to much. I do use the Living Proof thickening cream as well but that is all the styling aids I put in my hair. I also have some dry scalp and thought the Wen improved that but I'll have to find something else for that but for now I am not going to use Wen again.

Are there others like me who liked at at first and then noticed thinning?
