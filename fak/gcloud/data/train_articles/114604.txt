SAN ANGELO, Texas (AP) _ Matthew McConaughey has gotten back to his West Texas roots.

The 31-year-old actor has purchased a 1,600-acre ranch, complete with livestock, in Irion County for more than $500,000.

McConaughey’s older brother, who lives in Midland, apparently found the ranch for his sibling.

``We just moved right on in,″ said Mike ``Rooster″ McConaughey.

Owners Kay and Coleta Stewart left behind a double-cab Ford truck, a motorcycle and a dog named Purina.

``They even left all the cows out there. They didn’t hardly take anything with them,″ Mike McConaughey said.

In return, the Stewarts will be invited to the ranch for barbecues, Mike McConaughey said.

Matthew McConaughey grew up in Uvalde, about 155 miles southeast of his new ranch. His new film, ``The Wedding Planner,″ opens Friday.
