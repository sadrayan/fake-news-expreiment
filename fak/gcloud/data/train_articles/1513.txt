McAuliffe, at Silver Line station, touts support of project, says Cuccinelli fought it

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe toured a nearly complete station on Metrorail’s new Silver Line on Tuesday to highlight his support for Metro’s $6 billion expansion and contrast that with the opposition his challenger in the race, Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R), has expressed toward the project.

“Let’s be crystal clear: We were all for it. Our opponents were all against it,” McAuliffe said. “In fact, Ken Cuccinelli actually said that he would kill it. He wanted to kill it — the only statewide official of either political party who came out against this issue.”

McAuliffe, with attorney general candidate Sen. Mark R. Herring (D) of Loudoun County at his side, touted the Dulles rail project for being “on time and on budget” — an assertion at odds with the project’s managers and critics.

He declined to say whether he would support the kind of labor-friendly provision that nearly upended the second phase of Metrorail’s Silver Line to Dulles International Airport and farther into Loudoun.
