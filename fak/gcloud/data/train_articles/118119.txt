Craig lands Aston Martin driving deal
As Bond, the actor drives the sporty British cars - and Aston Martin bosses have told him he's always free to go for a spin in one of their top motors.

Craig says, "I'm lucky enough that if I desperately want to drive in an Aston Martin, the company is just fantastic to me. They'll let me go on a track and drive one all day long."

The perk has made Craig think twice about actually buying an Aston Martin: "I could drive it faster and more furiously (on the track) than anywhere on the road. I live in London (and) it doesn't make any sense to drive an Aston Martin there. I've nowhere to park it."
