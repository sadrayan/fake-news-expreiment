Following Trip to Southern Border, Pocan to Introduce Legislation that Would Abolish ICE
WASHINGTON, DC (June 25, 2018) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today announced that he will introduce legislation that would abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), following his trip to the southern border where he witnessed the nation’s immigration crisis. Pocan plans to introduce the legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives this week.

“During my trip to the southern border, it was clear that ICE, and its actions of hunting down and tearing apart families, has wreaked havoc on far too many people. From conducting raids at garden centers and meatpacking plants, to breaking up families at churches and schools, ICE is tearing apart families and ripping at the moral fabric of our nation. Unfortunately, President Trump and his team of white nationalists, including Stephen Miller, have so misused ICE that the agency can no longer accomplish its goals effectively,” said Pocan.

“I’m introducing legislation that would abolish ICE and crack down on the agency’s blanket directive to target and round up individuals and families,” continued Pocan. “The heartless actions of this abused agency do not represent the values of our nation and the U.S. must develop a more humane immigration system, one that treats every person with dignity and respect.”

Pocan’s legislation would dismantle ICE and create a commission to provide recommendations to Congress on how the U.S. government can implement a humane immigration enforcement system that upholds the dignity of all individuals, while transferring necessary functions to other agencies.
