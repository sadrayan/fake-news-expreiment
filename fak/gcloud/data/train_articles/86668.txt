Down Joe! Photo shows touchy-feely Vice President Biden
It’s the feel-good story of the holiday season.

Vice President Biden, never one to shy away from warmly schmoozing with voters and reporters, apparently got extra friendly with one member of the media, a hilarious photo taken during a recent holiday party suggests.

In the photo, posted by The Hill’s White House correspondent Amie Parnes, the famously friendly Vice President is seen tightly embracing Parnes.

Biden is seen in the shot with his paws awkwardly placed on Parnes’ waistline, where they are met by Parnes’ own hands, which appear to be blocking Biden’s from any additional touching.

The funny picture, which also includes Biden’s wife Jill and an unidentified companion of Parnes’, was first reported by the Daily Caller, which found the photo on Parnes’ Facebook page.

The image’s emergence marks the second time in as many weeks that an embarrassing photo of a White House official was taken.

Last week, an infamous selfie of President Obama, taken at Nelson Mandela's memorial service by the Danish prime minister, made waves across the globe.
