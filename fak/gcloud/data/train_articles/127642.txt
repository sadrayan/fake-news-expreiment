A TINY town in north Queensland with a population of less than 1500 is making headlines after a Facebook hoax accusing it of bowing to Christmas-light hating Muslims went viral.

The Cassowary Coast council - which includes the town of Cardwell between Cairns and Townsville - tackled the nonsense rumour head-on.

"A hoax statement has been posted on a Facebook page about Christmas lights in Cardwell. Council HAS NOT banned Christmas lights in the town," the council posted on its website.

The provocative claim appears to have been made on Facebook group "Meanwhile in Australia".

It has since been deleted but continues to be shared online.

The council is receiving no lobbying from any religious group wanting to ban Christmas lights, Cardwell has no mosque and if the town has an imam, they are not well known.

For those interested, the council is currently running a Christmas lights competition.
