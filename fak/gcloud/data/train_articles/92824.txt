Rubio digs in on climate change
Sen. Marco Rubio was on Bill O'Reilly's show tonight and delved further into his stance on climate change, tweaking it to acknowledge there is a consensus that humans have caused some change.

But he mostly argued critics are wrong.

"I’ve never denied the climate is changing. That shouldn’t surprise us. The climate is always changing," he said. "The second point on the science is, the left likes to go around saying 'There’s a consensus, there’s a consensus.' There is a majority of scientists that say that global carbon emission by humans causes some changes in the climate. But what there is no consensus on, and they conveniently ignore is, there is no consensus on the sensitivity of the climate -- how much of it is changing and how much of it is directly attributable to human carbon emission? "There’s no consensus on that.

"Which is why the models vary so greatly. Which is why despite 17 years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface temperatures in the earth have stabilized. But here’s the last point, which is indisputable: None of these proposals that liberals want us to impose on ourselves would do anything about the problem. There are 35 gigatons of carbon emitted into the atmosphere this year; we Americans are only responsible for 6 of it. By the year 2050, China and India alone will produce 50 gigatons. These laws they want us to pass would destroy our economy and have zero impact on these issues they keep raising. And that’s the part they don’t want to debate at all."
