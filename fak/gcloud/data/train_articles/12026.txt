Georgia Becomes First State To Ban Muslim Culture In Historic Move To Restore Western Values!
When Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.Whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States.

A Georgia state administrator has presented enactment that would boycott burqas and customary Muslim shroud.

State Rep. Jason Spencer (R) recorded enactment on Wednesday that would keep ladies from posturing for driver’s permit photographs while wearing a cover. The measure likewise adds burqas to a law that makes it a crime to wear a face covering openly or while driving.

Spencer contends that this bill is particularly proposed to decrease fear about Islamic psychological oppression. Spencer’s bill would keep ladies from wearing head covers while driving or while strolling down an open walkway.

“This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,” Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta.

Many people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose.
