pilots & penguins

Date: Thu, 8 Apr 93 23:50:10 PDT To: Fun_People Subject: pilots & penguins From: <pep@research.att.com> From: casey@gauss.llnl.gov (Casey Leedom) A Mexican newspaper reports that bored Royal Air Force pilots stationed on the Falkland Islands have devised what they consider a marvelous new game. Noting that the local penguins are fascinated by airplanes, the pilots search out a beach where the birds are gathered and fly slowly along it at the water edge. Perhaps ten thousand penguins turn their heads in unison watching the planes go by, and when the pilots turn around and fly back, the birds turn their heads in the opposite direction, like spectators at a slow-motion tennis match. Then, the paper reports "The pilots fly out to sea and directly to the penguin colony and overfly it. Heads go up, up, up, and ten thousand penguins fall over gently onto their backs. -Audobon Magazine ------- PILOT HARASSMENT An Argentine newspaper reports that bored penguins living on the Falkland Islands have devised what they consider a marvelous new game. Noting that the local Royal Air Force pilots are fascinated by penguins, the birds congregate on a beach where the pilots fly over, and turn their heads slowly in unison while standing at the water's edge. Perhaps ten thousand pilots fly by, and when the penguins turn their heads in the opposite direction the airplanes all fly back, like remote control toys. Then, the paper reports "The penguins look directly out to sea, where the planes follow their gaze. Heads and planes go up, up, up, and ten thousand airplanes run out of fuel and fall splashing into the ocean." -Pilot Magazine
