Four more votes needed to override Keystone veto, ND senator says
The Senate has 63 of the 67 votes needed to override a presidential veto on the Keystone XL pipeline, Sen. John Hoeven John Henry HoevenMcConnell works to salvage tax bill GOP to reduce tax relief by 0B to win over deficit hawks The Hill's Whip List: Where Republicans stand on Senate tax bill MORE (R-N.D.) said Sunday.

“Right now we’ve got about 63, but we’re going to the floor with an open amendment process,” Hoeven said on "Fox News Sunday." “We’re trying to foster more bipartisanship, getting the Senate to work the way it’s supposed to work, so we can pass this measure and other measures and either override the veto or attach the bill to other legislation that will get 67 votes.”

Last week, the House approved construction of the Keystone XL pipeline in a vote of 266 to 153. The legislation now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to pass, but the White House has warned that President Obama would veto the bill. The Senate needs 67 votes to override a presidential veto.

“What is the president doing? Actions speak louder than words,” Hoeven told Host Chris Wallace.

“He’s delayed this project for more than six years. America won World War II in less than six years, so clearly he’s trying to defeat the project with endless delays.”

On Friday, the Nebraska Supreme Court struck down a lower court’s challenge to the controversial project, removing Obama’s core argument for threatening to veto legislation to approve the project.
