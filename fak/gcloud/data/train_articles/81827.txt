Republicans call Obamacare a 'failure.' These 7 charts show they couldn't be more wrong
No one claimed, either before the passage of the Affordable Care Act or afterward, that it was perfect or that it would solve America's healthcare crisis in one swipe. What became evident in the three years since the individual insurance exchanges opened for business (on Jan. 1, 2014) is that the subsidies for premiums needed to be increased and improved. Because they're inadequate, especially as households cross the threshold of 400% of the federal poverty line at which subsidies are eliminated — at about $97,200 for a family of four — middle-class families in the individual insurance market feel overburdened. They blame Obamacare for this injustice. The real culprits are Republicans who have refused to consider any approach to the Affordable Care Act except repeal. Now the GOP is "it" on healthcare, and it's discovering that crafting a solution from scratch may be almost impossible.
