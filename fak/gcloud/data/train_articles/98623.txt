KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 — Health authorities have ordered Raj’s Banana Leaf in Bangsar to close until further notice over hygiene violations, following a video showing the restaurant’s workers washing dishes using puddled water by a road.

Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s Health and Environment deputy director Chandrakant Patel said the restaurant was not open for business when his team arrived this morning.

“We will take further action to inspect the situation and close the restaurant until further notice,” said Chandrakant.

He noted the restaurant’s representatives admitted their mistakes.

When asked for the cause of the health violation, he said the outlet did not have proper dishwashing facilities.

“They do not have proper washing facilities behind the kitchen although the cleanliness showed that the restaurant is all in the good condition.

“This restaurant is rated as A-grade as they passed the cleanliness rating which is proven in a statement,” he noted.
