FACT CHECK: President Obama Demands 'Ribs and Pussy Too?'
On 7 October 2016, the Washington Post released a 2005 recording of Donald Trump’s having made several lewd remarks about woman — including the phrase “grab them by the pussy” — to Access Hollywood’s Billy Bush. While several Republican politicians denounced the presidential candidate for these comments, some of Trump’s supporters attempted to point out the hypocrisy of this controversy by claiming that President Obama had once said something similar.

The Trump supporter’s counter-claim involved a video seemingly showing President Obama demanding “ribs and pussy too” that was circulated on social media along with several false or misleading claims. For instance, it wasn’t a “breaking” or newly released video, and it didn’t capture Barack Obama “demanding” anything:

Although the clip is real, it doesn’t document an off-the-cuff remark made by President Obama demanding “ribs and pussy too.” Rather, this footage was taken from Barack Obama’s appearance on the show “The Author Series” on 20 September 1995 (long before he ran for the presidency) in which he read excerpts from his book Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance. The full clip shows that President Obama was describing a conversation he had with someone else about Malcolm X’s beliefs, and that the “ribs and pussy too” line was spoken by another character in the book.
