Difficult family circumstances a part of Dylann Roof’s history
COLUMBIA, S.C. — Dylann Roof couldn’t find his gun.

It was one night in recent weeks, a friend remembers, when he called his mother asking if it was at her house.

“She was saying that she didn’t have his gun,” said Lindsey Fry, who said she overheard Roof’s conversation that night with his mother. Roof was staying at the home of Fry’s fiance, Joey Meek, in Red Bank.

Then, “he called his dad, and he was like, ‘Does mom have my gun?’ And his dad said she does have it — she was scared that he was going to hurt himself,” Fry said.
