More Georgians are quitting smoking every year — You can too! The American Lung Association in Georgia is proud to join state and local partners to sponsor Nobody Quits Like Georgia. This campaign will run through the week of November 16th through 20th, and will support, equip, and inspire Georgians to quit smoking.

Despite increased awareness about the dangers of tobacco, the percentage of Georgia smokers remains higher than the national average. Nearly 19 percent of adults in our state are still cigarette smokers.

Most tobacco users are aware of the dangerous health effects and have even tried to quit before. But many don’t realize that most smokers attempt to quit more than eight times before they quit for good. And, many don’t realize that help and support is available.

That’s why Georgia’s leading patient groups, nonprofits, health care delivery systems, and state and local agencies have come together to launch Nobody Quits Like Georgia.

Together, we are offering the assistance and resources that Georgians need to successfully join the Quitter’s Circle.
