The New Color of Money: Safer, Smarter, More Secure. In keeping with the strategy of maintaining the security of our currency by enhancing the designs every 7 Â– 10 years, a new series of U.S. currency is being issued, beginning with the $20 note which entered circulation on October 9, 2003, followed by the $50 note which was issued on September 28, 2004. The most recent denomination to be introduced in the series is the $10 note, which was issued on March 2, 2006. The redesigned $5 note is expected to be issued in early 2008. The $100 note is also slated to be redesigned, but a timetable for its introduction is not yet set. Please click here for more information about the new currency designs.
