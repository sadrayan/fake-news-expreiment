Fox News' Shepard Smith calls out Trump: 'That's not true'
"That's not true. It's just not factually accurate," Smith said. "There is broad-based support for raising the gun age limit. The president said to the kids at Parkland, 'I'll go strong on this, I'll work on this age thing.' He came up to the general public and said to the Congress, 'The NRA has a lot of pressure on you, but not on me so much.' And then he met with the NRA."
