No significant fiscal implication to the State is anticipated.

The bill would amend the Family Code to specify that rulings or decisions for proceedings involving marriage, a suit for dissolution of a marriage, or a suit affecting the parent-child relationship cannot be based on the judgment of a foreign court, arbitration decision, or application of a foreign law if the court finds these to violate a fundamental right guaranteed by the United State Constitution, the constitution of the state, good morals or natural justice, or be prejudicial to the general interests of the citizens of this state. Based on the analysis of the Office of Court Administration, duties and responsibilities associated with implementing the provisions of the bill could be accomplished by utilizing existing resources.
