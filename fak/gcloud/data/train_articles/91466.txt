Rick Santorum Compares Mandela's Fight to GOP Opposition to Obamacare
The clip above is from last night's O’Reilly Factor, during which Bill O'Reilly brought up the clear-cut top story of the day—the death of Nelson Mandela—in a conversation about the divisions within the Republican Party. That led Rick Santorum to make the completely natural leap between Mandela's battle against apartheid and the GOP's efforts to repeal President Obama's healthcare reform law. "[Mandela] was fighting against some great injustice, and I would make the argument that we have a great injustice going on right now in this country with an ever-increasing size of government that is taking over and controlling people’s lives — and Obamacare is front and center in that," Santorum said.
