Highlights: CNN town hall with Sen. Cory Booker
Sen. Cory Booker opened up about how his personal faith influences his politics – and his potential presidency.

“I’m a person that often says that before you tell me about your religion, show it to me in how you treat other people,” Booker said.

“I would rather hang out with a nice Atheist than a mean Christian any day of the week.”

The New Jersey senator later explained the importance of “radical love” in guiding his faith, noting how “to be strong, you don’t need to be cruel. To be tough, you don’t need to be mean.”

Booker also called out the US immigration system for “[violating] not only American values but the values of our faith traditions.”

Reflecting on President Donald Trump’s travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, Booker said: “I remember running out to the airport, where I saw the whole concourse full of Americans yelling and chanting and singing patriotic slogans as people came into this country, like Abraham welcoming strangers in the desert.”

“One of the best sights I’ve ever saw was a bunch of Jewish Americans… cheering and dancing as Muslim countries came into this community,” he added.

Booker also called for unity: “We are the United States of America. We were not formed as a theocracy. We were formed on the ideal that many of us in our diversity can come together and create one strong whole. E Pluribus Unum.”

“If I am President of the United States, I will fight every day to put more indivisible into this one nation under God,” Booker said to applause.
