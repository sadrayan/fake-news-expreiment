Anger over pig's blood bullets poster
The California National Guard is under attack for a poster promoting the execution of Islamic terrorists with bullets dipped in pig's blood to deny them entry to paradise.

The flier, at the guard's headquarters in Sacramento, attributes the practice to John J Pershing, the First World War general.

"Maybe it is time for this segment of history to repeat itself, maybe in Iraq?" it states. "The question is, where do we find another Black Jack Pershing?"

An apocryphal story that resurfaced after Sept-ember 11 claims that Pershing, then military governor of Moro province in the Philippines, captured 50 Muslim extremists and executed 49 using bullets dipped in pig's blood.

Muslim leaders and peace activists, who saw the poster during a tour of guard -headquarters, said the message raised concerns about the soldiers' attitudes to Islam.

A guard spokesman, after initially defending the poster, said it had been removed.

A spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Santa Clara, said: ''It is troubling to see a governmental organisation that is dedicated to security, promoting religiously insensitive ideas."

The tour came after peace groups and a senator raised questions about the unit, set up to oversee a range of anti-terrorism projects in the state.
