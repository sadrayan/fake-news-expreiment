Jacky Rosen Joins Nevada Seniors to Celebrate Social Security’s 83rd Anniversary, Highlight Heller’s Dangerous Record

Social Security Works PAC endorsed Rosen at Sun City Anthem

This morning, Nevada Congresswoman and candidate for U.S. Senate Jacky Rosen joined Social Security Works PAC President Jon “Bowzer” Bauman and Nevada seniors at Sun City Anthem in Henderson for a birthday party ahead of the 83rd anniversary of the Social Security Act being signed into law. Rosen rallied with seniors in support of protecting Social Security and other vital programs against attacks by Sen. Dean Heller and his Republican colleagues in Washington.

“Social Security successfully lifts millions out of poverty and helps ensure economic security for Nevada seniors when they retire after a lifetime of hard work,” said Rosen. “These are benefits our seniors have earned, and Nevadans deserve another Senator who is committed to protecting and strengthening Social Security. Unfortunately, Senator Heller is yet another Washington politician who wants to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts for his ultra-wealthy donors.”

Sen. Heller supported President George W. Bush’s plan to partially privatize Social Security. He’s also voted multiple times for the Paul Ryan plan to voucherize Medicare, and he’s supported an extreme Republican budget that proposed billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare. Sen. Heller is an architect of the reckless Republican tax bill that will add nearly $2 trillion to the debt and put Medicare and Social Security at risk.
