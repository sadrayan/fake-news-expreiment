Bing Energy, Inc
Bing Energy has an exclusive commercialization agreement to use Florida State University professor Dr. Jim P. Zhengâ€™s patented breakthrough nanotechnology to create a more commercially viable fuel cell. Building on the groundbreaking work of Dr. Ben Wang, inventor of buckypaper, Zheng has pioneered a fuel cell that incorporates a thin membrane composed of carbon nanotubes, reducing the need for expensive platinum that, until now, have made fuel cells too expensive to be widely marketed.
