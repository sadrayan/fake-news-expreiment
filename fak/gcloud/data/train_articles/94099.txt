SHOCKING: Obamacare Provision Will Allow “Forced” Home Inspections (Updated)

We’re from the government and we’re here to raid your home.



Here come the home raids…

A new provision tucked away in Obamacare will allow government forces to carry out forced home inspections.

Freedom Outpost reported:

According to an Obamacare provision millions of Americans will be targeted. The Health and Human Services’ website states that your family will be targeted if you fall under the “high-risk” categories below: ** Families where mom is not yet 21.

** Families where someone is a tobacco user.

** Families where children have low student achievement, developmental delays, or disabilities.

** Families with individuals who are serving or formerly served in the armed forces, including such families that have members of the armed forces who have had multiple deployments outside the United States. There is no reference to Medicaid being the determinant for a family to be “eligible.” In 2011, the HHS announced $224 million will be given to support evidence-based home visiting programs to “help parents and children.”

Update: The rumors of forced home inspections came from a non- credible blog source and have since been debunked
