Man struck, killed by Raptor roller coaster in Cedar Point
A man was struck and killed by a roller coaster inside of Ohio's Cedar Point amusement park while attempting to retrieve items he had dropped on the ride, officials said.

James A Young II, 45, was pronounced dead at the scene after being hit by the Raptor roller coaster around 5 p.m. Thursday, Sandusky Police said.

The park guest, who was visiting from Canton, Ohio, had hopped a fence to get into the restricted area where the tragedy occurred, Assistant Police Chief Phil Frost said.

Frost said Young was struck by the actual ride and not a passenger and that no other injuries were reported.

The coroner described Young as being hit in the head, according to ABC5.
