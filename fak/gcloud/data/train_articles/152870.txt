Lady Gaga Responds to PETA Criticism for Wearing Fur
In a recent post on her website, Lady Gaga responded to recent criticism from the animal rights organization PETA, who called out the pop star after she was photographed wearing various fur jackets.



The pictures elicited a statement from PETA Senior Vice President Dan Matthews, who referred to Gaga's 2010 appearance on Ellen in which she claimed, "I hate fur and I don't wear fur."



"What happened?" wrote Matthews. "Are your stylists telling you that it's fake, or are you a turncoat?" He added, "By wearing those dumb furs in a heat wave, you're making yourself a target just like the mindless Kim Kardashian," who was recently flour-bombed by a PETA suporter. "As we plan our fall campaigns, please tell us whether what you gracefully told Ellen was heartfelt or just a pose."



Gaga was quick to respond in a post on her website cheekily titled "Furgate Part 1." In it, she chose not to comment on whether her furs were real, saying, "I would think it hypercritical not to acknowledge the python, ostrich, cow hide, leather, lamb, alligator, 'kermit' and not to mention meat that I have already worn."



While Gaga did say that she has "always stayed away from skinned fur," she acknowledged that her morals aren't so rigid that she wouldn't fall for "an absolute art piece of a coat… You see a carcass, I see a museum pièce de résistance." She did apologize to fans who were upset by her fashion choices, saying she respects their views and hopes they can respect hers as well.



"And to campaigners," she added at the very end, "Save your flour to make bread for the children who are hungry. And Kim Kardashian is fabulous."
