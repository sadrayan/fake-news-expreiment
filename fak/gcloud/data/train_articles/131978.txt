Meghan Markle's beagle Guy rides with Queen Elizabeth on the way to W…
My favourite royal story of the week!

As you know, the Queen had tea with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle yesterday at Windsor Castle. Prince Charles, Camilla, Will, and Kate were also there for rehearsal. Right now it’s 230pm in England. As I’m writing this, the Queen is hosting Harry, Meghan, and Doria Ragland for tea in Windsor. The photo attached is of Harry and Meghan leaving Kensington Palace earlier. They are BEAMING. And why not? Today’s announcement of Prince Charles walking her down the aisle is a big win for everyone.

But this is not what I want to talk about right now.

So cute, right?
