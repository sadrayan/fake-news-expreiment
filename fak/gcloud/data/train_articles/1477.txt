Scott Israel: Sheriff supports change in Stand Your Ground
The Florida Legislature is holding hearings with the goal of possibly fixing serious flaws in our state's Stand Your Ground law. I am encouraged that these important discussions are taking place in Tallahassee, as this is a promising first step.

As leader of one of the nation's largest fully-accredited sheriff's offices, I support the proposed amendments to more narrowly restrict the use of the Stand Your Ground self-defense law throughout our state.

The bipartisan proposal by Sens. Chris Smith and David Simmons passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Oct. 15 by a 7-2 vote, and now heads to other committees for consideration before coming to the Senate floor for a full vote.

If adopted, this amendment could set a good example for the 22 other Stand Your Ground states, as Florida's was the nation's original Stand Your Ground statute. In fact, the original 2005 law was written by none other than Sen. Simmons.

I applaud Sen. Simmons for recognizing that the law is not perfect and reaching above partisan politics for a tremendously important public safety issue.

I also applaud the Dream Defenders, a group of young people who came together and effectively made use of their First Amendment rights by peaceably protesting Stand Your Ground with a 31-day sit-in at the state Capitol. Clearly, their voices were heard.

The Stand Your Ground law effectively tied the hands of the law enforcement investigation in George Zimmerman's fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin â€” and it will continue to do so until this law is fixed.

The proposed Simmons-Smith amendment makes clear that the statute should prohibit people from later claiming self-defense if they started or unnecessarily escalated a conflict when safe withdrawal outside the home is an option.
