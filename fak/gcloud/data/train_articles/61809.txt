Mayor Emanuel Proposes Free Preschool For Entire City
On Wednesday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced a plan to roll out free full-day preschool for all four-year-olds in Chicago within the next four years.

For many Chicago parents with a child in Pre-K, the plan could mean thousands of dollars in savings per year.

The announcement comes in the midst of a mayoral race that is heating up, with the mayor facing at least nine challengers for his seat.

Morning Shift takes a look at the mayorâ€™s plan, and the benefits and potential pitfalls of the current preschool model.
