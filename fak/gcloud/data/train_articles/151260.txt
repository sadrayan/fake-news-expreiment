Police: Mundelein woman faces drug, theft charges after meth arrest in Crystal Lake
CRYSTAL LAKE – A 39-year-old Mundelein woman faces drug charges after police said she was caught with methamphetamine and more than a quarter-pound of marijuana.

Crystal Lake police arrested Sara M. Hadsell, of the 21000 block of West Vernon Ridge Drive, Mundelein, on Monday afternoon, according to court documents.

Authorities said Hadsell had less than 5 grams of a crystal white substance suspected to be methamphetamine, more than 100 grams of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in her possession, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday in McHenry County court.

The complaint also said Hadsell intended to steal about $55 worth of merchandise from Kohl’s, 5520 Route 14 in Crystal Lake.

Crystal Lake Deputy Chief of Operations Thomas Kotlowski said he could not provide additional details surrounding the circumstances that led to Hadsell’s arrest because the report had not been completed after Monday’s arrest.

Hadsell told court officials that she “did not know” whether she had a job at the time of her arrest, but she made $800 every two weeks and previously had been employed for three months. Judge Robert A. Wilbrandt appointed a public defender to represent Hadsell on Tuesday.

Hadsell is being held at the McHenry County Jail in lieu of $20,000 bond. Hadsell would need to post $2,000, or 10 percent of the bond, to make bail, according to jail records.

If convicted of the most serious charge, Hadsell could face two to five years in prison.

She is due in court Thursday morning.
