Back in a Swing State, This Time for Sport
PALM CITY, Fla. — It was not his motivation, certainly, but President Obama is honoring his modern predecessors on this Presidents’ Day weekend by doing what many of them liked to do on breaks: chill out in Florida with the guys — including, in his case, one of golf’s most famous guys, Tiger Woods.

And chilling the president is. Northerners who begrudge Mr. Obama’s golf getaway to South Florida might take solace in knowing that Sunday started with temperatures in the low 40s, with winds making it feel like the 30s and whipping up the waves along the shore. On Saturday, the president’s first full day here, the temperature reached the 60s, still lower than usual and chilled further by the gusts.

Mr. Obama is playing a lot of golf, the unofficial game of presidents. But aside from that fact, the few reporters who followed him south were able to learn more from watching the Golf Channel, which had access to the playing grounds, than from the White House and did not expect to see Mr. Obama over the holiday weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, the deputy press secretary, Joshua R. Earnest, issued statements that Mr. Obama would not be leaving the golf club.

All told, the weekend offered another sign of a president who is freed from worry about running for election again. It is hard to imagine that a year ago Mr. Obama would have spent a three-day weekend at an exclusive resort with an all-male group, especially given recurring complaints of too few women in his innermost circle. (His wife and daughters were away skiing — not a sport favored by the Hawaii-born president.) And his retreat is effectively off-limits to ordinary Americans in the middle class or aspiring to be, who were the focus of Mr. Obama’s State of the Union address last week and his 2012 campaign.
