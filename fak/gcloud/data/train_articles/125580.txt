David Bowie Dead at 69
Rock icon David Bowie passed away from cancer on 10 January 2016, just two days after his 69th birthday.

The announcement of the legendary singer’s death was made via his Facebook page, to which the following notice was posted:

David Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous 18 month battle with cancer. While many of you will share in this loss, we ask that you respect the family’s privacy during their time of grief.

Bowie was born David Robert Jones in England on 8 January 1947 and first hit the charts at age 22 with “Space Oddity.” Throughout the 1970s and 80s, Bowie became known for pushing musical and social boundaries during the glam-rock era through such works as the album named for his androgynous alter ego, Ziggy Stardust.

During his initial rise to stardom in the 1970s, Bowie produced an amazing range of work, from cosmic folk (“Space Oddity”) and glam rock (“Ziggy Stardust”) to blue-eyed soul (“Young Americans”) and electronic experiments with Brian Eno (“Heroes”).

His stardom hit new heights in 1983 when he appeared on the cover of Time magazine with the worldwide success of the hit single “Let’s Dance.”
