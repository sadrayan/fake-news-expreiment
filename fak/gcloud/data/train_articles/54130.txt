Snapchat unredacted lawsuit

ICE S

Plaintiff Anthony Pompliano

s

latest move confirms that this litigation is just one big 2 publicity stunt for him. His lawyers filed a ho-hum opposition to a motion - something that 3 thousands

o f

lawyers

do

in thousands

o f

courthouses each da

y

ut still felt compelled to trumpet 4 that umemarka ble feat

o f

civil procedure in a press release that practically hyperventilates. 5 But the substance

o f

Pompliano ' s opposition confirms a more troubling pattern: He cares 6 more about getting attention than getting things right. Recall that Pompliano initially filed a 7 private arbitration against Snap, as his employment agreement required him to do. After many 8 months

o f

arbitration ,

he

ginned up this complaint as a way to air his grievances in open court - 9 and in the media. But his original attorneys withdrew soon after Snap noted the falsity

o f

his

10

complaint's central claim: that after firing him , Snap supposedly maligned him to the point

o f

11

making him unemployable . What Pompliano neglected to tell the Court then and now is that h e

12

not only got a

job

soon after Snap terminated him, but he was also then promptly fired from that

13

job for poor performance. He then (in his well-worn pattern) hit that company too with a

14

complaint reciting vague allegations

o f

fraud.

Pompliano now resurfaces after three months

of

inactivity with new attorneys but the same

17

publicity-hungry game plan. In his latest dramatic installment , Pompliano doubles down on the

18

main canard from his complaint - that Snap gave investors misstated user metrics back in 2015 -

19

by asserting that Snap

is

urrently

misleading investors. Both halves

o f

that remarkable claim are 20 false. And they regrettably show that the thirstier Pompliano grows for attention , the more

he

21

starves his filings

o f

truth and common sense.

22

On his first contention: Snap did not give investors misstated user metrics back in 2015;

23

nor did Snap employees commit any

of

the panoply

o f

alleged bad acts that litter Pompliano' s 24 complaint. Snap will demonstrate as much at the appropriate time in the appropriate forum. But

25

here

is

one example for the time being: Pompliano ' s centerpiece claim is that in mid-2015 Snap 26 was overs tating its daily active users ( DA Us ). He says Snap h ad solicited advertisers at that time 27

by

represent[in g ] that Snapchat had over 100 million DAUs , w h e n in fact the DAU count

28

generated by one computer program , Flurry , 'Â·showed only

97

million D A Us,'' and th e count
