Hulk Hogan Gets in a Fight?
Hulk Hogan was in Australia promoting the upcoming fight between himself and Ric Flair. During the press conference Flair started beating on Hulk Hogan and the two started fighting. Many are questioning if the fight was staged for publicity purposes to get some buzz for the upcoming fight, but apparently both camps are claiming it was the real deal. I don’t know what to believe. The pictures of the brawl are pretty intense. Real or fake? Well … that’s for you to decide.
