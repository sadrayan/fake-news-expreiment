Cristina Archer
I am an associate professor in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment with a joint appointment between the Physical Ocean Science and Engineering (POSE) program of the School of Marine Science and Policy and the Department of Geography. I am the Wind Power Associate Director of the Center for Carbon-free Power Integration (CCPI).

My research interests include: renewable energy, wind power, meteorology, climate change, air quality, numerical modeling of atmospheric processes.
