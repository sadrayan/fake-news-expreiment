Protester Flings Chicken Poop at the Red Hen
The Lexington, Virginia restaurant that kicked out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last Friday night is facing continued harassment: Yesterday the Red Hen was swarmed by protesters waving American flags and throwing chicken poop, according to local news station WSET.

Photos from outside the restaurant tweeted by the news station yesterday show a group of at least a dozen protesters, with signs bearing an ironic range of phrases such as “Trump is love,” “Red Hen needs to learn love and tolerance,” and “Homos are full of demons.”

According to WSET, police say the man armed with chicken poop yelled “Make America great again” as he threw it at the restaurant. He was reportedly arrested, and the fire department cleaned up the mess. Despite the poop-flinging, the news station described the protest as “peaceful.”

The Red Hen is facing intense online harassment in the form of a flood of negative Facebook and Yelp reviews, tweets suggesting that the restaurant employs undocumented workers, conspiracy theories involving pedophilia, and the doxxing of its owner. Other, unaffiliated restaurants with the same name have gotten swept up in the controversy, with the Red Hen in Washington, D.C. reportedly receiving death threats.
