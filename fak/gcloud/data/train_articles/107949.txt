Palin, Trump discuss 'potential candidates' over pizza in New York
New York (CNN) -- Potential presidential hopeful Sarah Palin brought her "One Nation" bus tour to Manhattan on Tuesday, splitting a pizza with Donald Trump, who recently opted not to launch a bid for the Republican nomination.

"We talked about specific candidates and potential candidates, and kind of just what our perception was of each of these folks," the former Alaska governor said without getting into specifics. "It was interesting. We're kind of on the same page there."

The stop at Trump Tower was an unusual detour for the bus, which has kept to a strict itinerary of historic sites such as Mount Vernon and Independence Hall since its launch over the weekend.

The tour, according to Palin's website, is designed "to educate and energize Americans about our nation's founding principles, in order to promote the fundamental restoration of America."

Palin and Trump have at least a few things in common, notably their starring roles in hit reality television shows and a knack for keeping the political world guessing about their presidential ambitions.

Trump recently decided not to pull the trigger on a bid for the White House, while Palin continues to say that she is seriously considering a run.

She told CNN on Monday that she plans to take her bus tour to Iowa, the state that votes first in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.

"I'm sure at some point I will be going to Iowa," Palin said.

Also on the itinerary is New Hampshire, where the first primary of the 2012 campaign is slated for early January.

"They want jobs. They want safety in their communities. They want strong national defense," Palin said of New Hampshire voters Tuesday after meeting with Trump. "They want the same things that everyone else wants."
