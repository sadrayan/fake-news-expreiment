Professor Logan:

For a PolitiFact Texas fact-check, we’re reviewing a recent claim by a local elected official that Austin has “been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country.” I am writing you to seek your expert commentary and guidance.

We are aware of Richard Florida’s analyses.

Can you otherwise speak to multiple studies showing Austin among the nation’s most economically segregated cities?

Have you personally conducted or overseen such research?

Any other recommended authorities?

If the claim we’re reviewing bears out, what’s the significance of that? If it doesn’t bear out, what’s that significance?

I would be grateful to hear back from you soon by phone or email. We rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Much appreciated,

g.

Select "sortable lists" under "income segregation." There is a choice of several different measures, of which the most comprehensive is "overall income segregation - H." Austin metro is on the high end, but not so high as to merit the characterization as "one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country."

These indices were calculated by a group headed by Sean Reardon, Stanford. One version of a report by them is here:

https://s4.ad.brown.edu/Projects/Diversity/Data/Report/report10162013.pdf

The general point is that all U.S. metro areas are highly segregated by income, and that has consequences for the lives of residents. I'm not in a position to say why Austin would be more segregated than average or what that implies for public policy.
