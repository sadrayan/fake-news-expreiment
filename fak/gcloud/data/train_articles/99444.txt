Parents Need To Know About These Drugs.

New drug in Schools…

Please pass this on even if you do not have kids in school. Parents should know about this drug.This is a new drug known as ‘strawberry quick ‘.There is a very scary thing going on in the schools right now that we all need to be aware of.

It also smells like strawberry and it is being handed out to kids in school yards. They are calling it strawberry meth or strawberry quick.Kids are ingesting this thinking that it is candy and being rushed off to the hospital in dire condition. It also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange.

Please instruct your children not to accept candy from strangers and even not to accept candy that looks like this from a friend (who may have been given it and believed it is candy) and to take any that they may have to a teacher, principal, etc. immediately.Pass this email on to as many people as you can (even if they don’t have kids) so that we can raise awareness and hopefully prevent any tragedies from occurring..!!
