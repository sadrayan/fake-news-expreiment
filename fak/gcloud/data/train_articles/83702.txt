Mitt Romney for President
Mitt and Ann Romney have released their complete 2010 tax return and an estimate of their 2011 return. (A full copy of their final 2011 return will be made public as soon as it is filed in the upcoming weeks). The Romneys have provided extensive information about their personal finances, with several hundred pages of tax returns now made public.

Governor Romney's tax returns show:

First, as a successful businessman, Governor Romney has not only added value to our economy through his investment and business activity, but he has paid millions in taxes every year to the U.S. government.

Second, the Romneys take to heart "to whom much is given, of him shall much be required." Accordingly, they have been extraordinarily generous in their charitable giving, donating over $7 million from 2010-2011 – donating even more to charity than they paid in taxes.

Third, Mitt Romney has scrupulously complied with the U.S. tax code, and his income is reported and taxed at the applicable rates, and he has paid 100 percent of what he has owed.

As the law does not require the release of any tax returns, the release of these 500+ pages of tax returns goes above and beyond what is required.

In addition, Gov. Romney has released numerous financial disclosures since 2002, as required by law – which have also been posted on this site. There are 3 federal Public Financial Disclosures (from 2007, 2011, and 2012), and 6 Massachusetts Statements of Financial Interests (from 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007).

With a decade's worth of financial disclosure documents and the Romneys' recent tax returns, the American people have an extensive view of the Governor's personal finances, above and beyond what is required by the law.

With the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney's running mate, this site has been updated with his financial information. Posted are tax returns from 2011 and 2010 for Paul and Janna Ryan, as well as 14 federal Public Financial Disclosures covering 1999-2012.

Nancy Pelosi recently said that there has been too much time spent talking about tax returns instead of the economy. We don't agree with her on very much, but she's right about that.

It's time to focus on the real issues in this campaign – turning around the economy and getting America back to work again.
