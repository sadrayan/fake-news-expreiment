Pelosi: Transaction Tax Has "Great Deal Of Merit"

Newsmax: A proposed tax on financial transactions "has a great deal of merit" and would help Congress raise needed revenue, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday.



"I believe that the transaction tax still has a great deal of merit," Pelosi said at a news conference.



The tax would have a "really minimal impact on the transaction, but a tremendous impact on helping us meet our needs," Pelosi said.
