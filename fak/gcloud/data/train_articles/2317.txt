Chair of DNC says (wrongly) jobless rate fell under Obama
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Democrat who’s chair of the Democratic National Committee, stated in an interview on Fox News Monday morning (shown above) that the unemployment rate hasn’t gone up since President Barack Obama took office.

A charitable defense may be that she was initially reacting to the word “precipitously.” But she later in the interview flat out denied that the unemployment rate rose during the Obama administration, which it has.

The jobless rate has gone up from 8.2% in February 2009, the first full month Obama was in office (it was 7.8% in Jan. 2009), to 8.6% last month, having peaked at 10.1% in October 2009, as the chart on the bottom of the story shows.

The president himself in an interview on “60 Minutes” said the unemployment rate may drop to 8.0% by the time voters get to decide whether he deserves a second term.
