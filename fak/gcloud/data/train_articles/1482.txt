Hollywood's new police chief aims to bring reform to troubled agency

HOLLYWOOD — Raquel Alves became another Hollywood crime victim on Monday when thieves smashed the windows of her car while she slept.

But for Alves – who was among more than 50 condo residents whose vehicles were vandalized that night -- the blame does not lie with Police Chief Frank Fernandez, Hollywood's top cop since August.

A banner flown by a plane over the beach and downtown Sunday said otherwise, calling Hollywood a high crime area and putting the blame squarely on the chief.

The skyhigh message, arranged and paid for by police union leader Jeff Marano, had the intended effect, creating a political headache for City Hall.

The dig — called a childish stunt by Mayor Peter Bober and some other residents — comes at a time when Hollywood is keen on cultivating an image as a popular tourist spot and safe place to live, work and play.

Fernandez says he didn't see the banner, but read about it in the paper.

"I can't speak to silly pranks," he told the Sun Sentinel. "We are focused on rebuilding the department and setting up best practices for how we do things. I'm not going to call it success. I'm going to classify it as progress. We still have a lot of work to do."

The chief touts his accomplishments during his short tenure:

• helping to negotiate a stalled union contract;

• increasing salaries to make up for previous pay cuts;

• waging an intense recruiting effort;

• and creating better work conditions by purchasing new squad cars and making physical improvements to police headquarters.
