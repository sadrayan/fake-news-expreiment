Meet the Deputy Attorney General
Jeffrey A. Rosen is the 38th Deputy Attorney General of the United States. In this role, he acts as the Department of Justice’s Chief Operating Officer and advises and assists the Attorney General in leading the Department’s more than 110,000 employees. President Trump announced his intent to nominate Mr. Rosen to this position on February 19, 2019, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on May 16, 2019.

Mr. Rosen received a B.A. with highest distinction from Northwestern University (1979) and a J.D., magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School (1982).

Though most of his career was in the private sector, Mr. Rosen has been appointed to several senior public-service positions, and was twice previously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Most recently he was the Deputy Secretary of Transportation (2017-2019), where he was the Chief Operating Officer of a Cabinet Department with more than 55,000 employees and a budget in excess of $80 billion. Mr. Rosen also served as General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor for the White House Office of Management and Budget (2006-2009) and as General Counsel at the U.S. Department of Transportation (2003-2006). He was also an appointed Public Member of the Administrative Conference of the United States (2013-2017).

During nearly thirty years of private practice, Mr. Rosen first joined the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis as an associate in 1982 and became a partner in 1988. After two public-service appointments during 2003-2009, Mr. Rosen returned to Kirkland & Ellis LLP as a partner from 2009-2017. Throughout his years in private practice, Mr. Rosen handled complex litigation across the United States, including jury trials, bench evidentiary hearings, arbitrations, and appellate arguments. Among his wide-ranging litigation practice were cases involving antitrust, securities, contracts, RICO, business torts, trade secrets, government enforcement actions, and product liability, including class actions, as well as regulatory matters.

Mr. Rosen served as the Chair of the American Bar Association’s Section of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice during 2015-2016. In addition, he previously served as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, where he taught Professional Responsibility and Legal Ethics.
