Another lawsuit: Groups sue Rick Scott, demanding he remove himself
Common Cause and the League of Women Voters of Florida filed a lawsuit Monday in federal court in Tallahassee, asking a judge to block Gov. Rick Scott from involvement in recount issues because he has a stake in the outcome of the election.

"No man should be a judge in his own cause," the groups said in a petition filed in U.S. District Court. They said Scott has misused his official powers, including asking the state law enforcement agency to investigate vote-counting in Broward.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement has declined Scott's request, saying no allegation of voter fraud has been filed with the state.

The lawsuit argues: "Defendant Scott has used the official powers of his office to interfere in the election to benefit himself and his political party and to intimidate the local officials and volunteers conducting the vote count."

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to grant a temporary restraining order to prevent Scott from exercising any influence over the election.
