Non-Citizen Registration and Voting
Voting in Person at Your Polling Place or City Hall

Learn about voting in person at your polling place on Election Day on November 5 or at the City Hall Voting Center, beginning October 7.

Vote at your Polling Place

All polling places are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day. Your assigned polling place is determined by where you live in San Francisco. Use the Department’s Polling Place and Sample Ballot Lookup Tool (available in September) to access your polling place details.

Upon arrival at your polling place, give your name and address to a poll worker. After the poll worker finds your name and address in the Roster of Voters, you will be asked to sign the roster.

The poll worker will then issue a secrecy folder and a paper ballot with only the School Board contest. The ballot and voting instructions will be printed in English, Chinese, Spanish, and Filipino.

Take your ballot to a voting booth. Be sure to read the instructions printed on the top portion of the ballot. After marking the ballot, insert the ballot into a voting machine and get your “I Voted�? sticker.

In addition to accessibility tools for paper ballots such as easy-grip pens and magnifying glasses, accessible touchscreen and audio versions of the ballot in English, Chinese (with both Cantonese and Mandarin audio), Spanish, and Filipino are available. If you prefer to vote an audio or touchscreen ballot, tell a poll worker.

If you need assistance when voting, ask a poll worker. Poll workers wear name badges that indicate what languages they speak. You may also bring up to two people with you to your polling place, as long as they are not representatives of your employer or your union.

If your name is not listed in the Roster of Voters, you might have gone to a polling place other than where you are assigned. If you registered to vote in the School Board election on or before the deadline on October 21, you have the right to cast a provisional ballot at the polling place.

If you did not register to vote in the School Board election by the deadline, you have the right to register to vote conditionally at the Department of Elections and cast a provisional ballot at the City Hall Voting Center.

Vote at the City Hall Voting Center

The City Hall Voting Center opens on October 7 and is located on the ground floor of San Francisco City Hall, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place, Room 48.

Authorize Someone to Pick up Your Ballot at City Hall
