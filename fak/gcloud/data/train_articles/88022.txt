Small-Dollar Loans
Since 2011, Pew’s small-dollar loans project has conducted extensive research on payday, auto title, and similar loans, finding that the market is plagued by unaffordable payments, deceptive business practices, and excessive prices.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—the federal agency charged with regulating these loans—finalized a rule in 2017 that will significantly curtail the harms of short-term loans. However, detrimental longer-term loans from nonbank lenders may flourish if states do not enact sensible safeguards. Federal agencies such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and the National Credit Union Administration have demonstrated increasing interest in small credit products, which could lead to lower-cost loans from banks and credit unions becoming widely available, saving millions of borrowers billions of dollars.

Pew provides research, recommendations, and technical assistance to help state and federal lawmakers craft policies for a fair, safe, and affordable small-dollar loan marketplace.
