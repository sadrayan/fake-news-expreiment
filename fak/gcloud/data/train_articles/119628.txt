Bill Clinton only needed one sentence to deftly explain why wife Hillary would be a better presidential choice than GOP nominee Donald Trump.

On Thursday night’s “Daily Show,” Clinton skewered The Donald by pointing out the difference between his supporters and Hillary’s.

“Most of her strongest supporters have either worked for her or done business with him,” he quipped.

Despite the polarization that exists in America, Clinton believes the country is in a better position than it has ever been.

“America has come so far,” he said. “We’re less racist, sexist, homophobic and anti specific religions than we used to be. We have one remaining bigotry: We don’t want to be around anyone who disagrees with us.”

The audience quietly laughed, which Clinton believed proved his point.

“The crowd’s laughing, but they didn’t laugh loud because they know I’m telling the truth,” he said.
