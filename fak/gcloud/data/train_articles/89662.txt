37% Favor Single-Payer Health Care System

A plurality of voters still opposes the national health care lawâ€™s insurance mandate and a single-payer health care system.

A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 40% of Likely U.S. Voters think the federal government should require every American to buy or obtain health insurance. Forty-five percent (45%) oppose this so-called individual mandate. Fifteen percent (15%) are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.)
