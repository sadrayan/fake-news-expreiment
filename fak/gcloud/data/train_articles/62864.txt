Remarks by President Trump After Swearing In General John Kelly as White House Chief of Staff
Oval Office

9:34 A.M. EDT

THE PRESIDENT: We just swore in General Kelly. He will do a spectacular job, I have no doubt, as Chief of Staff. What he's done in terms of Homeland Security is record-shattering -- if you look at the border, you look at the tremendous results we've had, and you look at the spirit. And with a very controversial situation, there's been very little controversy -- which is pretty amazing by itself.

So I want to congratulate you on having done a fantastic job, General. And we look forward to, if it's possible, an even better job as Chief of Staff.

GENERAL KELLY: I'll try, sir.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. We'll see you in the boardroom. We're having a Cabinet meeting.

Q Mr. President, how do you expect things will be different under General Kelly's tenure?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we've done very well. We've done very well. Lots of records. Lots of records created, John.

If you look at stock markets -- the highest it's ever been. Unemployment -- lowest in 17 years. Companies are doing tremendously well. Business spirit is the highest it's ever been according to polls -- if you look at the polls -- the highest it's ever been in the history of these polls.

We're doing very well. We have a tremendous base. We have a tremendous group of support. The country is optimistic. And I think the General would just add to it. But the country is doing very well. Strongest stock market ever. On Friday, we hit the highest in the history of the stock market. Business is very enthusiastic. And we will proceed and we will keep going.

But we have a fantastic leader, Chief of Staff. He's going to do a really great job.

Thank you very much. We'll see you in the boardroom.
