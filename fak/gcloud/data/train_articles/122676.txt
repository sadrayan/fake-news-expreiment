Couple finds long-lost ring on carrot
Sixteen years of searching for a wedding ring culminated in an unlikely discovery for a Swedish couple. Ola and Lena Paahlsson found the ring on a carrot in their garden.

"The carrot was sprouting in the middle of the ring," Ola Paahlsson told Dagens Nyheter, a daily newspaper in Sweden. "It is quite incredible."

The ring, set with seven small diamonds, went missing in her kitchen in 1995, Lena Paahlsson told the paper. The couple, who reside in central Sweden, believed Lena's ring fell into a sink and was lost in vegetable peelings that were turned into compost or fed to their sheep.

"I had given up hope," Lena Paahlsson told Dagens Nyheter.

They may have given up hope, but they never completely gave up the hunt. Many years after losing the ring, the couple even removed the tiling off the floor in the hope of finding it.

Their determination finally paid off. Recently as Lena Paahlsson was pulling out a carrot from their garden, she noticed it had something attached to it. It was the ring, relatively unscathed.

"Our daughter Anna was at home at the time and she heard an almighty scream from the garden," Ola Paahlsson told The Local website.

The couple will probably never know how this minor miracle occurred, but that won't stop them from guessing.

"We thought maybe it had fallen into the compostable food bin," Ola Paahlsson told The Local. "Perhaps it ended up in compost that was spread over the vegetable patch later. ... Maybe it had been eaten by the sheep and then ended up in the manure that we then spread over the vegetable patch."

"We're keeping it in a safe place," Lena Paahlsson tells the Dalarnas Tidningar newspaper in Sweden.
