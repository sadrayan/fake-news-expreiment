Kyle:

I’m hoping the second time is the charm. What’s the poll showing Beto O’Rourke trailing by two percentage points? I ask for a PolitiFact Texas fact-check of your claim below. I’d be happy to hear back soon by phone or email.

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks,

g.
