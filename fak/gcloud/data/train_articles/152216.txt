It was day of overwhelming emotion at the university of Maiduguri campus when students woke up to behold the horror of a new baby dumped in a toilet in one of the female hostels, witnesses said.

PREMIUM TIMES learnt from witnesses, mostly students in Murtala Hall hostel, that they were attracted on Wednesday to the toilet by the piercing cry of the baby.

When they got to the toilet, the baby was found head down in the hole of the squat toilet.

“The person that dropped the baby may have wanted to force the baby into the pit because the head of the baby was already blocking the pit,” said one of the students who did not want to be named.

“If not for the body of the baby, it would have sunk down into the toilet. It was the height of wickedness that I have never seen until now,” added the source.

The witness said female students around quickly called the attention of the hostel matron and security operatives to the scene.

“When the matron came she picked the baby and there were some injury on the face of the baby as well his nose. It was a baby boy.

No one could be identified immediately as the mother of the baby.

Baby-dumping is not new to the campus, as some few years back a baby was found abandoned in a refuge dump by an unknown mother.

When contacted, the spokesperson for the university, Ahmed Muhammed, told PREMIUM TIMES he would revert.
