July 3, 2014 - Iraq - Getting In Was Wrong; Getting Out Was Right, U.S. Voters Tell Quinnipiac University National Poll; 92 Percent Back Background Checks For All Gun Buys

PDF format



The 2003 war in Iraq was the wrong thing to do, American voters say 61 - 32 percent, and President Barack Obama's decision to withdraw all U.S. troops in 2011 was the right thing to do, voters say 58 - 37 percent in a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today.





But voters disapprove 55 - 37 percent of the way President Obama is handling the situation in Iraq and disapprove 52 - 42 percent of the way he is handling the situation in Afghanistan, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds.





The pace of U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan is "about right," 46 percent of voters say, while 26 percent say Obama is moving "too quickly" and 20 percent say "not quickly enough." Among voters in military households, 32 percent say "too quickly," as 19 percent say "not quickly enough" and 41 percent say "about right."





By a 51 - 27 percent margin, American voters blame former President George W. Bush, rather than Obama, for the situation in Iraq. Only 35 percent of voters, however, say Obama is better than Bush conducting foreign policy, while 39 percent say he is worse.





American voters oppose 63 - 29 percent, with opposition from all party, gender and age groups, sending U.S. ground troops back into Iraq. When asked about air strike options:

2 percent support the use of piloted aircraft;

20 percent support use of drones or cruise missiles, where American pilots are not at risk;

30 percent support using both options;

39 percent say there should be no U.S. airstrikes.

"By 2-1, American voters believe the Iraq War was a mistake and most say it was the fault of President George W. Bush, but President Barack Obama isn't exactly getting high marks for the way he has handled the two conflicts he inherited," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





American voters say 56 - 39 percent that it is not in the U.S. national interest to get involved in Iraq. But a total of 72 percent of voters say it is "very likely" or "somewhat likely" that if Islamic militants take over Iraq, "they would launch a terrorist attack against the U.S. in the near future."





Voters say 51 - 39 percent that the U.S. should not work with Iran to help the Iraqi government defeat Islamic militants.





The U.S. is doing too much around the world and it is time to do less internationally and focus more on domestic problems, American voters say 64 - 32 percent. Agreement is strong among all party, gender and age groups, ranging from 56 - 39 percent among Republicans to 76 - 22 percent among voters 18 to 29 years old. Gun Control





American voters support 92 - 7 percent, including 92 - 6 percent among gun owners, requiring background checks for all gun buyers. Support ranges from 86 - 11 percent among Republicans to 98 - 2 percent among Democrats.





Voters also support 89 - 9 percent laws to prevent people with mental illness from purchasing guns. Gun owners support this idea 91 - 7 percent.





But only 50 percent of voters support "stricter gun control laws," with 47 percent opposed.





"Americans are all in on stricter background checks on gun buyers and on keeping weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill," Malloy said. "But when it comes to 'stricter gun control,' three words which prompt a negative reflex, almost half of those surveyed say 'hands off.'"





Voters support 58 - 30 percent federal government actions to limit greenhouse gases from existing power plants to reduce global warming. Republicans are opposed 47 - 38 percent, while all other party, gender and age groups support such limits by wide margins.





From June 24 - 30, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,446 registered voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 2.6 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and the nation as a public service and for research.
