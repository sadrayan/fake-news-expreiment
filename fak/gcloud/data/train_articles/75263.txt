Financial interest between Donald Trump and Dakota Access pipeline goes both ways
ETP's 1,170-mile Dakota Access pipeline, a $3.8 billion project to send oil from North Dakota to Illinois, has drawn protesters from Native American tribes concerned about the environmental and historical impact on nearby Standing Rock Sioux reservation land. The federal government is involved in the pipeline's production, ceasing construction on federal land after initially approving it.

ETP's chief executive Kelcy Warren has donated $103,000 to the Trump for president campaign and $66,800 to the Republican National Committee since Trump secured its nomination, according to the report.

Though the limit for an individual contribution to a candidate is $2,700, Warren reportedly donated $3,000 to Trump's run on June 29. The other $100,000 that Warren contributed to Trump's campaign came via the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee.
