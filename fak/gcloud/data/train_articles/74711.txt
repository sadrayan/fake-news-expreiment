Republican Vice Presidential Nominee Mike Pence Delivers Remarks at Campaign Event, Cocoa Beach, Fla.

PENCE:

I'm Mike Pence. I'm from Indiana and we are just eight days away from blasting off to a great victory all across the state of Florida and all across the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

But I got to tell you, can you tell that the future Second Lady of the United States of America likes Halloween? We're so excited to be with you today -- we truly are very humbled by this wonderful turnout.

Bill and I have known each other a long time. Dave and I have known each other longer, but these guys know the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter.

I'm a Christian, a conservative and a Republican (inaudible). And I want to tell you, I joined this campaign in a heartbeat because you have nominated a man for president who never quits.

(AUDIO GAP)

PENCE:

... you know, I just think that Donald -- Donald Trump just literally embodies the spirit of America. Am I right? He's strong, freedom-loving, independent, optimistic, and willing to fight every single day for what makes America great and will make America great again.

You sure saw that in all these debates. He just wrapped one up a little bit more than a week ago in Vegas, where he beat Hillary Clinton, hands down.

(APPLAUSE)

(AUDIO GAP)

PENCE:

... Virginia and some people think I won that debate and I'm very humbled by that. I'm very humbled by that. Thank you.

But you know, from where I was sitting, Donald Trump won that debate.

(APPLAUSE)

Donald Trump's vision for America won that debate.

(AUDIO GAP)

PENCE:

... America great again is going to win all the way to the White House. Believe it. You know, and it's not like it's exactly a fair fight out there.

(LAUGHTER)

You know what I'm saying? I mean, I get up -- I get up about every morning and it's like you got to turn on the television with a stick.

(LAUGHTER)

You just never know what's going to be there, you know? It's like the media's out there, it's like two on one every single day. It's like those -- it's like if those Gators had to play every game on the road, you know, in front -- in front of a, you know, another, you know, the opposing team's crowd and hometown refs but, of course, the Gators would still be winning.

(APPLAUSE)

And Donald Trump is stilling winning hearts and minds every single day, and he's going to win all the way to Washington D.C.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, it really is amazing. You know, about a week ago, you know, if you would have been watching those stories in the media and how Hillary Clinton's allies in the media are trying to say this things all rolled up. Remember that?

(APPLAUSE)

Yeah? I mean, literally. And try to say -- Hillary was walking around talking about Cabinet appointments, you know? And getting people like -- but you know, I think, Florida, you all know. You aren't fooled. You know this race is on.

(APPLAUSE)

We're within the margin of error in one poll after another. And one poll just came out and we're leading in the state of Florida and we're going to sprint to the finish.

(APPLAUSE)

I'm telling you, it is -- we know something about racing in Indianapolis.

(LAUGHTER)

You know what I'm talking about? And I'm telling you where we are right now, we're coming -- we are coming out of the fourth turn, it is wheel to wheel, it is hammer down to the White House and Florida's going to lead the way.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, she may have the media, the money, and the special interest on her side, but Donald Trump and I got something a little more powerful. We got a basket of Americans that are saying, "enough is enough."

(APPLAUSE)

And we're going to make America great again.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, I got to tell you. You're gathered out here today because, you know, this -- this election is not so much a choice between two people, it's really a choice between two futures.

(APPLAUSE)

So let me tell you where I stand. I choose a stronger America. I choose a more prosperous America. I choose an America that cherishes and upholds our highest constitutional ideals, so I choose to stand with Donald Trump and every American who knows we can make America great again.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, it really is amazing. At a time when millions of Americans across the spectrum are longing for something new and different. Seven out of 10 Americans know our country's headed in the wrong direction.

The other part has literally nominated someone who personifies a failed status quo in Washington D.C. The people have had enough and they've especially had enough of the fast and loose ethics of the Clintons over the last 30 (ph) years.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, and no where is that more true than the -- than the avalanche of evidence that's come out. I mean, you almost got to follow on this. I've got some -- I've got some kids on the front row so I'll slow this down.

So while she was Secretary of State in charge of all of our foreign policy, Hillary Clinton and her husband had a private foundation that took tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments.

(APPLAUSE)

OK? And then in the middle of that, she had a private server, that once it was found out by the media that she had a private server -- presumably to keep communications out of the reach of public accountability -- she used high technology and hammers to try and keep it out of the public reach.

But you know, the American people aren't -- aren't putting up with it. It sounds like the Department of Justice is starting to feel that way, too.

You know, after -- after concluding last summer that -- that Hillary Clinton's having classified documents on her private server that she was just extremely careless and that they concluded the investigation -- you all know about it. Last Friday, the Director of the FBI sent a letter to Congress announcing that the FBI had learned of the existence of e-mails that appear pertinent to the investigation and the FBI has reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private server.

(APPLAUSE)

It's a serious matter. Now we commend the FBI for reopening the case and following the facts because here in America, no one is above the law.

(APPLAUSE)

And we're confident...

(AUDIO GAP)

PENCE:

... hurt by judicial watch. Diligent work quite (ph) frankly summoned the media. And the whole WikiLeaks -- it's all coming out that thousands of e-mails -- and what we found out is a few things. Let me just -- let me just touch on a couple of them.

I mean, we found out that at least a dozen companies that gave money to the Clinton Family Foundation also lobbied the State Department at the very same time that they were giving money to their private family foundation. And they actually used lobbyists who were raising money for the Clinton campaign.

(APPLAUSE)

We found out from the FBI -- the FBI confirmed that -- that officials at the State Department offered the FBI a quid pro quo if they'd allow them to change the classified status of some e-mails on that private server.

We found out that even though she said it never happened, that while the State Department -- while the State Department was administering the relief efforts for Haiti after that terrible earthquake back in 2010, that an aid to the State Department said that friends of the Clintons' businesses should be flagged for contracts to rebuild Haiti and everybody else just go to the website.

And just about a week ago, we found that top Clinton aids had created what the media called a circle of enrichment where they would raise money for the Clinton Foundation from major corporations and then they'd ask those same corporations to provide personal income to former President Clinton -- 66 million dollars in contracts over nine years.

You know, for their decades of self-dealing, conflict of interests, for the politics of personal enrichment and outright corruption -- we must decide here and now that Hillary Clinton will never be elected President of the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

That's reason enough. OK? The American people are sick and tired of pay-to-play politics benefiting the favored few. And when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, in the first 100 days, we're going to pass ethics reform in our nation's capitol and we're going to drain the swamp in Washington D.C.

(APPLAUSE)

But you know, the truth of the matter is that for all of -- all the effort that we have to make to keep up with the avalanche of scandals rolling out of all the years of the Clintons, this election is really about a lot bigger things than their small ethics.

And the rest of my time, I want to -- I want to make sure that we talk about that. Because as you go out here -- and Florida always looms large in -- in our national life and our national elections.

And I want you to leave here today and I want you to go talk to somebody. And I want you to talk to them about the issues in this election. And I believe they are our security, our prosperity, and the Supreme Court of the United States of America. We've got to talk to people about it.

(APPLAUSE)

We've got to go talk to people. Let me talk to you about security on the front end. Despite traveling millions of miles as our Secretary of State, it's undeniable, the world is more dangerous today than the day that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama took over America's foreign policy.

Seven and a half years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies have weakened America's place in the world. Our allies are less secure, our enemies are more emboldened.

And there's literally wider areas of -- of the Middle East that are virtually spinning apart. You know, history teaches us that weakness arouses evil. And Donald Trump and I believe that the weak (inaudible) foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, of leading from behind, of moving red lines, of feigning (ph) resets with Russia and paying ransom to terrorist sponsoring states, is emblematic of that kind of failed leadership.

Let me make you a promise -- when Donald Trump is President of the United States, we won't be paying ransom to terrorist (inaudible).

(APPLAUSE)

They'll be paying a price.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, it was Hillary Clinton that actually initiated that disastrous agreement with the radical mullahs in Iran. They got a $150 billion dollars, all we got was a delay. All we got was a delay in the ambitions of the leading state-sponsor of terrorism to obtain the most powerful weapons on earth.

And it was Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama who withdrew all American forces from Iraq without what's called a Status of Forces Agreement. As Secretary of State, it was her responsibility to negotiate with the sovereign government of Iraq to allow enough soldiers to remain to preserve what our soldiers have -- had secured.

It's important to -- it's important to remember men and women. By the end of the last administration, by the end of 2008, through incredible sacrifice by the American soldier, our American soldiers won the peace and security of the people of Iraq.

(APPLAUSE)

They prevailed in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, as a congressman I travel down range (ph) every year for 10 years to visit our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. More importantly, Karen and I have stood by their graveside of our fallen heroes with their families.

And it -- it breaks my heart to think of the decisions that were made by this administration to remove all American forces from Iraq without an agreement to leave a sufficient number to protect what our soldiers had won. And then to see the vacuum that was created. The vacuum that was created in which ISIS was able to rise up and overrun vast areas of Iraq.

We have right now, today, more than 5,000 special forces outside of Mosul having to go in and fight and win back what the American soldier had already won and was squandered by this administration.

You know, before I go one step further, I know there's -- I know there's men and women that have worn the uniform in these recent conflicts and in a long time past who are here. Would you -- would you just mind raising your hands so we can show how much we appreciate?

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you for your service. And it was Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton alone, leading the State Department, who left Americans in harms way in Benghazi...

(APPLAUSE)

... and never sent help. You know, sometimes you can hear about the title of the movie, "13 -- 13 Hours", you can think that in 13 hours -- they never sent help.

I was with one of the surviving warfighters who was at a rally just out West not too long ago, and the simple fact was that the call came late in the afternoon on the anniversary of September 11, and -- and the State Department had called meetings and had discussions while Americans were in harm's way.

And after four Americans fell, Hillary Clinton joined a course (ph) in this administration for days to tell the families of the fallen -- to tell the families of the fallen that it was because of a filmmaker back in the states -- when she knew. She had written an e- mail the very night of the attacks saying it was a terrorist style Al Qaida attack.

(APPLAUSE)

When she was questioned before the Senate about that, she said words that I'll never forget. She said -- she said, "of those four fallen Americans, what difference at this point does it make?"

(APPLAUSE)

Well, let me tell you, as the proud father of a United States Marine...

(APPLAUSE)

... anybody who said that, anybody who did that should be disqualified from ever serving as commander in chief of the armed forces of the United States of America. You don't leave Americans in harm's way and never send help. And after our heroes fall, you don't ask what difference does it make.

(APPLAUSE)

We cannot have four more years apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends. Most especially our most cherished ally, Israel.

(APPLAUSE)

I want to promise you -- under a Trump-Pence administration, if the world knows nothing else, the world will know this: America stands with Israel.

(APPLAUSE)

For America to be safe, for our allies to be secure, America needs to be strong and Donald Trump will lead on the world stage with American strength. We will rebuild our military, we will restore the arsenal of democracy, we will give our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines the resources and training they need to accomplish their mission and we will hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source so it can no longer threaten our people or inspire violence in the homeland.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, that's probably why more than 200 retired U.S. generals and admirals, including more than 20 Medal of Honor winners have endorsed Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

But I have to tell you today, as I stand here on the Space Coast, it is great to be back.

(APPLAUSE)

But I got to tell you, I was -- I was raised among a generation of kids sitting in front of black and white televisions watching from afar what you all were living here at Cocoa Beach.

I'm awful proud of the fact that -- I think of the Mercury Program, the Gemini Program, the Apollo Program. These are the anthems of my youth -- the inspiration Not just of America but of the world. I'm proud to say that Purdue University in Indiana has educated more astronauts than any other university in America.

(APPLAUSE)

And Gus Grissom grew up in Mitchell, Indiana.

(APPLAUSE)

Karen wanted me to point out to you, we actually vacationed in Cocoa Beach just to be near it all before I was ever even elected to Congress.

(APPLAUSE)

When I was in the Congress to the United States, one of my very first assignments was to serve on the NASA Subcommittee, at my request. And our family's had the great privilege to be here to see those launches go into space. It's been incredible to me.

And let me tell you something. Donald Trump and I have a plan to make the American space program great again.

(APPLAUSE)

Our space program needs new leadership and a new vision and we're going to work -- we're going to work with the Chairman of the NASA Subcommittee who was just on stage with me, Congressman Brian McCann (ph), and we're going to bring a new vision to America in space.

(APPLAUSE)

As Donald Trump has already said, we're going to expand public- private partnerships to make sure we're investing, using all the resources of the most powerful nation on earth. We're going to focus the mission of NASA on space exploration.

We all know that space is the final frontier...

(APPLAUSE)

... and just as we've always done before, America needs to lead the way on the final frontier.

(APPLAUSE)

We cannot afford to fall further behind in space exploration or technology, and the Trump-Pence administration space policy will also strengthen our military space mission and assets and reorient our civilian space (ph) program toward deep space and exploration.

We're going to promote increased cooperation with the commercial space industry. We're going to provide capabilities needed for our nation to maintain constant pressure in low Earth orbit and beyond.

We can be more efficient, we can be more effective. We can use space dollars wisely. But we're going to do it. We're going to make the investments and we're going to create a brighter and boundless future for America and a growing economy on the Space Coast for generations.

(APPLAUSE)

I'm especially excited about the fact that Donald Trump already announced that we're going to relaunch the National Space Policy Council headed by the vice president of the United States of America.

(APPLAUSE)

(AUDIO GAP)

PENCE:

... you in this great and historic place, to renew and reinvigorate our space program. In a word, President Donald Trump will lead America to the stars.

(APPLAUSE)

So it's about security abroad, it's about making the right investments at home. But also, it's about safety here at home, isn't it? I mean, this is a very -- this is a very challenging time in the life of those in our first responder community.

You know, last Thursday, I have to tell you, we went a little long on a runway in New York City.

(LAUGHTER)

And I saw first hand -- I mean, that --that aircraft of ours slid off the runway and I can tell you, before it even stopped rolling, we were surrounded by the finest first responders in the world...

(APPLAUSE)

... making sure we were safe. Our nation is blessed with the greatest first responders. But those that wear the uniform alone for law enforcement, it's been a challenging time.

Seems like -- seems like these days when tragedy happens, when a police officer is performing their duties, rather than just demanding a full accounting and transparency and answers -- that is the public's right -- there are too many in the media and too many on the American political left that are quick to use a broad brush to denounce law enforcement.

Hillary Clinton herself called it institutional racism. Others have called law enforcement as a force for division in our country. Well, Donald Trump and I know, men and women who serve everyday in law enforcement are not a force for division in America, they are a force for good. They're the best of us and they deserve the support of the rest of us.

There's a lot of members in law enforcement here today. Would you just mind showing them how much you appreciate the sacrifices they make for our families?

(APPLAUSE)

I'll make you a promise, when he becomes the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the United States of America, a President Donald Trump will support law enforcement at every level. We will provide the resources and the tools for them to protect our families and go home safe to theirs, and we will restore law and order to every city and every community in the land.

(APPLAUSE)

That's probably why 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police nationwide endorse Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States.

(APPLAUSE)

So it's about security at home and abroad, it's about making the right investments in the future of our country, but it's also about our prosperity. You know, despite all the happy talk on the other side, we're in the midst of the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression.

Literally, nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't working. You've got -- you've got one in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job.

Forty five million Americans on food stamps, 47 million Americans living in poverty. Hillary Clinton's plan?

(APPLAUSE)

More of the same, you're right. Some people think it's just the same -- it is more of the same. More taxes, more regulation, more of the war on American energy that's stifling American jobs and growth and more Obamacare.

I mean, they tell us this economy is the best that we can do. But I think you all in Florida know better. It's not the best that we can do, it's just the best they can do. And when Donald Trump becomes President of the United States of America, we're going to get this economy moving again for the people of Florida and people all across the United States. We're going to put America back to work.

(APPLAUSE)

Because Donald Trump's got a plan. Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes by a trillion dollars. When we re-elect Senator Marco Rubio to the United States Senate, when we re-elect Congressman Bill Posey to the United States House and renew our Republican majorities, we're going to work with those strong majorities in the House and Senate and the first hundred days we're going to cut taxes across the board.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to get rid of death taxes once and for all.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to lower business taxes in America so companies in Florida can compete with companies around the world in a competitive tax environment.

(APPLAUSE)

And because Donald Trump and I know that that avalanche of acronyms coming out of Washington D.C. is killing jobs here in Florida. You all know what I'm talking about. You've got your EPA, you've got your OSHA, you got your DOE, you got your ABCDEFG.

(LAUGHTER)

Day one of a Trump-Pence administration, we're going to sign a moratorium on new federal regulation and he's going to repeal every single Obama executive order that is stifling jobs and growth in the American economy. Every single one.

(APPLAUSE)

And Donald Trump and I believe that among our vast natural resources is the blessings of this country. So we're going to end the war on American energy on day one and we're going to develop all of the above.

We're going to develop all the resources of this land and call forth its power.

(APPLAUSE)

And when Donald Trump becomes Negotiator in Chief -- you with me on this one? We're going to have trade deals that mean American jobs first.

(APPLAUSE)

We're going to renegotiate NAFTA, we're going to get out of this TPP thing and then we're going to hold our trading partners accountable to the commitments that they make of the people of the most powerful economy on earth.

(APPLAUSE)

And lastly, Donald Trump and I are going to pry off the back of the American economy that so-called Affordable Care Act.

(APPLAUSE)

You remember the promises? Dr. -- Dr. Wellner (ph) remembers. If you like your doctor, you can keep him -- not true. If you like your health insurance, you can keep it -- not true. Health insurance costs are going to go down -- not true.

I mean, the truth of the matter is, just a week ago today, the Obama administration itself announced that the average premiums -- the average premiums under Obamacare are going to go up 25 percent. In some states around the country it's going to be multiples of that. A crushing weight on the American people and the American economy.

I mean, it really is amazing. I mean, even our opponent's husband said, "costs are going up, coverage is going down. It's the craziest thing in the world."

(LAUGHTER)

I guess even with the Clinton's, sometimes truth happens.

(LAUGHTER)

But don't be deceived by Bill Clinton's new found skepticism. Hillary Clinton said a little bit earlier this year, "before they called it," this is a quote, "before they called it Obamacare, they called Hillarycare."

Hillary Clinton's plan is actually to introduce what we call single-payer into the system -- a government run health insurance. She actually went to Canada and gave a speech and said she -- in Canada, she told these Canadians in a business group that she wanted a health care system just like there's. They got socialized medicine.

But my favorite quote came from President Obama himself. It was about a week ago. He was celebrating the third anniversary of the roll out of Obamacare. Did you hear about this? He actually compared Obamacare to the Samsung Galaxy 7 phones that spontaneously burst into flames.

(LAUGHTER)

He did. He did. Here's -- here's the quote, President Obama said, "when one of these companies goes out with a new smart phone and it has a few bugs, what do they do? They fix it. They upgrade it. Unless it catches fire and then they pull it off the market."

(LAUGHTER)

Well, what a coincidence, Mr. President, because that's exactly what we're going to do with Obamacare. We're going to pull it off the market and make it stop burning up our wallets.

(APPLAUSE)

When Donald Trump becomes President of the United States of America, we're going to repeal Obamacare and we're going to replace it with health care reform. Not the Canadian style that Hillary Clinton wants, but we're going to replace it with health care reform that lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government. We're going to give American consumers more choices to buy health insurance across state lines. We're going to reform health insurance in America with the power of the free market. That's the American way to meet our health care needs in an American future.

(APPLAUSE)

So it's about security at home and abroad, it's about the right investments, it's about our prosperity. But lastly, it's also about the fact that it seems like these days, there's no aspect of our lives too small for this present administration. No provision of the Constitution too large for them to ignore. Do you notice that?

I mean, literally. We're going to elect a president for the next four years. But make no mistake about it, the next president will likely set the course of direction to the Supreme Court of the United States for the next 40 years and you better think about that. You better think long and hard about that.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean, elect Hillary Clinton -- elect Hillary Clinton President of the United States, you better get used to more unelected judges using unaccountable power to take unconstitutional actions.

Did you hear her in that debate a week or so back? I was sitting just a little bit -- I was me to you from her. I had a good seat.

(LAUGHTER)

Right down in front. She got the first question that came out of the gate was about the Supreme Court. I got her quote right here. She actually said her "philosophy of the Supreme Court is that the Supreme Court should represent," close quote. A particular point of view.

But look, I'm -- I'm -- you know, I'm from a small town in Southern Indiana but, I mean, I was a representative in Congress. The Congress represents states and districts. The president arguably represents all the American people. Hillary Clinton, the Supreme Court is supposed to represent and uphold the Constitution of the United States of America...

(APPLAUSE)

... and settle disputes that arise under the law. So I will just (inaudible) all of you, for the sake of the rule of law, for the sake of the sanctity of life...

(APPLAUSE)

... for the sake of the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, for the sake of all of our God given liberties -- let me ask you here in Florida -- do not rest, do not relent for the next eight days until you do everything in your power to ensure that the next president to make appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States is President Donald Trump.

(APPLAUSE)

So before I slip out -- and I'm going to head down -- I'm headed West. I'm just going to stop when I hit water.

(LAUGHTER)

But it is -- it is great to be in Florida. It really is. You know, this is no ordinary time in the life of our country. I stand before you today. I said 'yes' to this invitation. Deeply humbled, deeply honored, more than I could ever tell you.

(APPLAUSE)

Because I think this is no ordinary time. I think the time has come -- I think the time has come for men and women across this country who know we can be stronger, who know we can be more prosperous, who know we can do it all by cherishing our highest constitutional traditions to come together and do all we can do. So let me give you three things to do and I'll get out of your hair.

Number one -- vote.

(APPLAUSE)

Give it up for that guy. I like that, your the first person to beat me to that punch. Nicely done. Vote.

I mean, look, I need you to vote. And vote early because I got other stuff for you to do. And early voting is underway here in Florida and it's -- I went ahead and looked it up when I landed.

Brevard Community Center, 308 Forest Avenue, Cocoa, Florida. Open Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. It's 4.8 miles from where you're standing right now. So go vote and bring a friend and bring a family member. Vote for the Trump-Pence team to the White House. Send Marco Rubio back to the Senate. Send Congressman Bill Posey back to the House of Representatives. That's how we make America great again. You go vote and you bring a friend.

(APPLAUSE)

Second thing, after you vote, I want you to go tell somebody. OK? I mean, I started out with you today telling you that it's -- it's been like two on one since we got into this deal.

But you know, as I -- as I show up with Donald Trump at his rallies with tens of thousands of people and as I'm out campaigning with him with good people, hundreds of people that come out to see me and my family and hear the story. What Donald Trump always says to me when we roll into these big rallies is he'll -- he'll point at me. He's always -- you can tell, he's always -- he just marvels and he says, "Mike, you know, this isn't about me. This isn't about us and it's not about our party." He says, "this is a movement of the American people and the American people are going to make America great again."

And it's a movement because the American people are talking to each other. Despite all -- all the bias in much of the national media -- and it's been overwhelming. The American people are talking to each other and they're telling their neighbors and friends what the stakes are in this election.

Just let me tell you what I think they are. I don't think -- I don't think this is much of a choice between Republican and Democrat or even left or right. I think it's like what Ronald Reagan said back in 1964. I think this is a choice between up and down.

(APPLAUSE)

Here it is. It' a choice between whether we're going to continue to go down the hill to a weaker America at home and abroad, to hollowing out our military, to having a foreign policy that -- that abandons our friends and emboldens our enemies and our competitors, neglecting our military, neglecting key investments, piling more and more weight on a national economy, stifling American growth and them walking farther and farther away from our most cherished constitutional ideals. Or whether here in Florida, you are going to plant your feet, turn around and march back up the hill to a stronger America at home and abroad, a more prosperous America, an America that celebrates the ideals that have made this country this great. That's the choice we have.

(APPLAUSE)

But you got to go tell somebody. And there's one group in particular I want you to go and tell. I mean, Donald -- Donald Trump has won over independence across the country. He really has. People that are sick of gridlock and sick of the corruption in Washington D.C. He's won over many Democrats across America who are sick and tired of seeing our jobs shipped overseas. Sick and tired of liberal policies flowing out of Washington.

But I'm telling you something. I think right now, my fellow Republicans who are in the room, I say it's time -- it's time to reach out to our Republican friends and say with one voice, "it's time to come home."

(APPLAUSE)

It's time for Republican voters to come home -- and come home and elect Donald Trump as the next President of the United States. To come home and elect Marco Rubio back to the United States Senate, Bill Posey back to the Congress. And it's time to come home and make sure that Hillary Clinton is never elected President of the United States of America. It's time to come home.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, the choice in this election couldn't be more clear. America has a decision to make. Florida has a decision to make. So if you're taking notes, I need you to vote early. Secondly, I need you tell somebody, especially our friends. And lastly, I -- I would just say to you -- have faith.

(APPLAUSE)

First have faith in the American people. I mean, think of all that we've accomplished in the long and storied history of this nation. It's incredible. I mean, I don't have to tell you but we're a nation that dreams great dreams here on the Space Coast.

I mean, we had a president who is a hero in my youth, still a hero to me -- who said we're going to put a man on the moon before the end of this decade and America did it.

(APPLAUSE)

Donald Trump said not long ago, "don't ever let anybody tell you you can't." That the future belongs to the dreamers, not to the cynics and to the critics. So when you go out and you talk to your neighbors and friends, have faith that what you can see in all of American history and see in the character of the American people is every time the American people are given a choice of more freedom, more strength, and a celebration of our highest ideals, the American people choose strength and freedom and American ideals every single time. So have faith when you go for it.

(APPLAUSE)

And lastly, if you're up (inaudible) exercise that other kind of faith. That's always been the wellspring of our nation, particularly in challenging times. That is, if you're inclined to -- as you are to bow the head and bend the knee, now would be a good time to do it over the next eight days.

And you know something, I'm -- I'm here advocating the team and the cause and the movement. But on this one, let me -- let me maybe just suggest in these challenging times -- unknowable threats abroad, frustrations, disappointment at home, too much division in these United States -- I just encourage you to pray for our country.

(APPLAUSE)

I rather like -- I rather like what Abraham Lincoln said in his time. He was asked if he thought God was on his side, Abraham Lincoln said, "I'd rather concern myself more with whether we're on God's side, than that God is on our side."

(APPLAUSE)

And if you're inclined to do it and pray, just pray with confidence. Because I really do believe in my heart of hearts that what's been true for (inaudible) is still true today -- to prove throughout our nation's history, from the first time those pilgrims set foot on that Mayflower and stepped off on Plymouth Rock, that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray, he'll do like he's always has done, you'll hear from him and he'll heal this land.

(APPLAUSE)

This one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

(APPLAUSE)

So Florida, we've got work to do. Time's a wasting. I'm here to tell you -- if you leave here today and get that early voting on your schedule, before the end of the day, go get it done. Go tell somebody. Leave here with faith and confidence, I'll make you a promise. OK? That man is ready. This team is ready.

(APPLAUSE)

This movement is obviously ready. If you go out and make sure that Florida is ready, we will make Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States of America and we will make America great again. Let's go get it done, Florida.

Thank you and God bless you.

(APPLAUSE)
