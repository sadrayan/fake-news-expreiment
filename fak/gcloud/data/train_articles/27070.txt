Jacksonville Shooter Was Anti-Trump Resistance warrior
We don’t know if David Katz wore a mask and participated in violent riots, but we do know he was part of the Trump resistance, who called Trump supporters “Trumptards” and “mentally ill”. Keen observation from a guy who killed three and wounded nine others because he lost a gaming tournament. Is it really any surprise that the violence of the deranged Trump resistance should manifest itself in other parts of their lives? Violence is like a cancer. If not treated, it grows and grows until it has destroyed the entire body. The lamestream press won’t tell you about Katz, though. That’s why I am here.

Sunday afternoon, police responded to a ‘mass shooting’ at Jacksonville Landing in Florida which left 3 dead and 11 wounded.

According to witnesses, the killer, David Katz, began shooting shortly after he lost the Madden NFL gaming tournament.

Footage and audio of the shooting the moment it happened during a livestream at the Madden NFL tournament was captured.

A red laser dot appeared on the player wearing the red sweatshirt the moment the shooting started (video below).

Jacksonville police confirmed three deceased individuals were located at the scene at Jacksonville Landing on Sunday evening.

So will Democrats be forced to disavow this crazed killer by the media?

I think we all know the answer to that.
