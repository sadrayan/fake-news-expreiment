Car Dealers Win Carveout In Latest GOP Tax Proposal
Here are more details on the amendment from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R., Texas). A committee vote will come soon.

The amendment would also:

• Create a new 9% tax rate for certain income received by small businesses. The proposal is a response to the concern that the 25% rate for pass-through businesses in the original House plan only helped businesses whose owners are in tax brackets above 25%, which ends at $200,000 for individuals and $260,000 for married couples.

• Require companies to spread their deductions for research expenses over five years in many cases and 15 years in other instances.

• Alter a 20% excise tax on payments from U.S. companies to related foreign firms. It's not clear from the summary whether this change will restore some of the revenue reduced by a previous amendment.

• Alter the rules for when charities can engage in political speech. Currently, they are prohibited from doing so or risk losing their tax exemptions. Under the proposal, they could engage in such speech in the course of their ordinary activities and as long as their expenses are minimal. That's broader than the previous version, which had applied only to religious organizations. The expanded version would expire after 2023.
