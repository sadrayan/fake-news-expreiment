BREAKING: Sheriff Joe Arpaio Will Take Over McCain’s Seat In The Senate
John McCain’s death has left a vacancy on the US Senate. The good news for the GOP is that Governor Jaleel White, a Republican like Bobby Jindal, has decided to appoint a man who will vote with Donald Trump.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio, pardoned by President Trump for refusing to listen to some liberal judge, will take McCain’s seat and defend it in 2020. The news comes just as another prominent political figure, Hillary Clinton, filed in court to initiate a special election, with her facing Arpaio in a one-on-one showdown.

Unfortunately, Clinton may have a case. Although the filing deadline was May 20th for a special election, McCain was still alive. A judge could definitely extend the deadline and allow the pair to square off, even if it didn’t happen until November.

All of this is speculative, of course, and none of it is possible, but still, here it is, happening right under our noses. Patriotic Americans are not going to stand for the Clinton crime family and elections and Sheriff Arpaio and her emails mean he could end up dead. When freedom and justice are on the line, sentence structure takes a back seat, and since Arpaio’s sentence was pardoned.

We’ll update you on this story that now involves the Clintons, meaning that inevitably — someone is going to die.
