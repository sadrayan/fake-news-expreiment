PHOTOS: Who Is This Woman? Mystery Surrounds 'Undercover Nurse' Seen With Hillary At Memorial.
Questions continue to swirl around the medical incident which caused Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to appear unsteady at Sunday's 9/11 memorial in lower Manhattan, forcing her to abruptly depart from the ceremony. Today, another person of interest has emerged: the woman seen accompanying and tending to Clinton throughout the memorial to whom some are referring to as an "undercover nurse."

The woman, pictured below, was seen arriving at the memorial service alongside Clinton, and remained by her side throughout:

At some point during the ceremony, the woman appears to attend to Clinton. The moment was caught by an NBC News camera:

Although it is unknown what is passing between Clinton and the unidentified woman in the above photo, Clinton appears to be squeezing the woman's fingers with her right hand. It's been noted that having a patient squeeze a physician's fingers is a common method of neurological examination.

Shortly after this photo was taken, Clinton was seen abruptly leaving the memorial. Hillary was again photographed alongside the unidentified woman:

In the above photo, Hillary can be seen walking hand in hand with the woman, who escorted Clinton to her extraction point. You can see the mystery woman in the screen grab below (indicated by the red arrow):

While the identity of the woman remains a mystery--and is something that is apparently of no interest to the mainstream media--some are speculating that Hillary's 'undercover nurse' is, in fact, Clinton's personal physician Lisa R. Bardack M.D., to whom the mystery woman bears more than a passing resemblance:

In the above photo, we see the mystery woman on the left, and a photo of Dr. Bardack from her profile page on caremountmedical.com on the right.

If the woman is Dr. Bardack, her presence at Sunday's memorial raises new question about the extent of Clinton's health issues.
