“Our message has been clear all along: Do not risk your own life or the life of your child by attempting to enter the United States illegally. Apply lawfully and wait your turn,” the officials said. “The American immigration system is the most generous in the world, but we are a nation of laws and we intend to continue enforcing those laws. Establishing the immigration system demanded of our political leaders by the American people for more than 30 years — one that serves the national interest — will allow our nation to further realize the foundation of freedom, safety, and prosperity we inherited from our founders.”
