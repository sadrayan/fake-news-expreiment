Ice Fishing for Killer Whale Tip Top
Emily from eatmail.tv sent out a link today to the classic ‘ice fishing’ video clip. Unfortunately it was a muted and shortened version of the original. This spot starts with an inuit (eskimo) fisherman on the ice reeling in a fish, with a voiceover…

“To top up your family’s Omega 3 DHA,

you could lead the life of the Inuit Eskimo.

Their Omega 3 rich diet has contributed

towards their healthy lives.”

It’s at this point that the crunch of the film happens…

Watch it to see for yourself.

And then the punch line…

“Alternatively, you could just top up your

family’s Omega 3 with Tip Top® Up™.”
