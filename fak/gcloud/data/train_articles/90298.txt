A Democratic Super PAC is launching a paid social media campaign Tuesday targeting Republican Senate candidates over Donald Trump's comments about federal judge Gonzalo Curiel, accusing them of standing behind a presidential nominee who attacked the judge's ethnicity.

Funded by American Bridge 21st Century, the ads will appear as GIFs on Twitter and Facebook. The online spots recite Trump's accusation that Curiel is biased because of his Mexican heritage.

"But Senator Mark Kirk is still supporting Donald Trump," the ad then says in one ad targeting Illinois GOP Sen. Mark Kirk .

American Bridge is using the ads against nine GOP candidates: Kirk, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, Arizona Sen. John McCain, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.

It's also targeting Nevada GOP Senate candidate Rep. Joe Heck.

The group declined to say how much its ad buy was worth.

Senate Democrats and their allies hope to win back control of the upper chamber with a strategy of linking Senate Republicans to their party's presidential nominee. Polls show Trump is the most unpopular major party presidential nominee in recent history.
