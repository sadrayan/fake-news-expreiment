WEBVTT OVER THE BALANCE OF POWER. GOVERNOR WALKER SIGNS THE LAME-DUCK SESSION BILLS, WHILE GOVERNOR ELECT EVERS VOWS TO FIGHT AGAINST THE NEW LAWS. I'LL ASK REPUBLICAN SENATE PRESIDENT ROGER ROTH WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. THEN, IS A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN JUST DAYS AWAY? CONGRESSWOMAN GWEN MOORE ON THE BATTLE OF WILLS OVER THE WALL, AND WHETHER DEMOCRATS WILL GIVE THE PRESIDENT MONEY TO BUILD IT. PLUS, THE SHERIFF, AND THE RUSSIAN AGENT. THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN AN ESPIONAGE SCANDAL TOUCHING FORMER MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF DAVID CLARKE. ANNOUNCER: COVERING THE ISSUES IMPORTANT TO WISCONSIN. THIS IS "UPFRONT" WITH MIKE GOUSHA. MIKE: HELLO AND WELCOME. HISTORY WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE JUDGE. BUT WISCONSIN'S OUTGOING AND INCOMING GOVERNORS TRIED LAST WEEK TO SHAPE THE QUESTION OF LEGACY. GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER'S LEGACY. ON FRIDAY, THE GOVERNOR WITH NO VETOES, SIGNED THE REPUBLICAN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION BILLS THAT DEMOCRATS CALLED A POWER GRAB. THE GOVERNOR SAID HYPE AND HYSTERIA SURROUNDED THE BILLS, WHICH HE SAID ARE ULTIMATELY NOT A CORE SHIFT, AND WILL KEEP SOME REPUBLICAN POLICIES AND PROGRAMS IN PLACE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNOR IN THE STATE, IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL IN THE NATION AND THAT WILL REMAIN NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS LEGISLATURE. MIKE: THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR ELECT TONY EVERS RESPONDED, SAYING WALKER DISREGARDED THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. I WILL BE REVIEWING OUR OPTIONS AND WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE ARE NOT IGNORED OR OVERLOOKED. MIKE: WALKER'S BILL SIGNING CAME ONE DAY AFTER THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY STRUCK A $28 MILLION DEAL THAT WILL KEEP KIMBERLY CLARK'S FOX CROSSING PLANT AND NEARLY 400 JOBS IN THE FOX VALLEY. APPLETON REPUBLICAN STATE SENATOR ROGER ROTH, THE SENATE PRESIDENT, WORKED FOR MONTHS TO REACH THIS AGREEMENT. HE JOINS US NOW FROM OUR GREEN BAY AFFILIATE, WBAY T.V. SENATOR, IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK. I DO NOT ONE TO RELITIGATE THE LEGISLATION BUT I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING RELEVANT, THAT IS THE FACT THAT GOVERNOR WALKER HAD THE POWER TO MAKE THIS KIND OF DEAL AND THAT TONY EVERS WILL NOT. WHY IS IT A GOOD POLICY FOR GOVERNOR WALKER BUT NOT FOR TONY EVERS? ROGER: THIS IS TERRIFIC THING FOR NORTHERN WISCONSIN AND OUR STATE. A LOT HAS BEEN OVERBLOWN IN THE TALKING ABOUT HOW GOVERNOR EVERS WILL NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS IN THE FUTURE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED THE WDC TO CREATE UP TO 30 ECONOMIC ZONES AND THE LEGISLATION ALLOWS THE INCREASE ABOVE 30 WITH THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET THAT IS COME TO JOINT FINANCE. IT EMPOWERS A FUTURE GOVERNOR TO EXCEED THE CAP THAT IS RIGHT NOW. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS GO TO JOINT FINANCE. I DO NOT THINK IT CONSTRICTS A FUTURE GOVERNOR. IT EMPOWERS THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LIKE WE SAW THE GOVERNOR UNVEIL LAST WEEK. MIKE: I WANT A SENSE OF THE FINAL DEAL AND WHETHER YOU THINK THIS WAS A BETTER DEAL FOR TAXPAYERS THAN THE ORIGINAL DEAL DISCUSSED, THE ONE THEY COULD NOT PASS AND WAS WORTH MORE THAN $100 MILLION. ROGER: IT WAS NOT THE ROAD WE STARTED OUT ON 11 MONTHS AGO. I DO NOT CARE HOW WE GOT THERE AS LONG AS WE DID AND THAT IS WHAT WE SAW. THERE ARE CHECKS PAIR, BOTH OUR CONTRACT BASED, BOTH HAD REQUIREMENTS THAT THE COMPANY HAD TO ABIDE BY. THE BILL WAS A 15 YEAR CONTRACT. THIS IS A FIVE- YEAR CONTRACT. THE BILL WAS AROUND $100 MILLION. THIS ONE IS $28 MILLION. IT IS ABOUT THE SAME. THE GREAT NEWS IS WE ARE ABLE TO GET IT DONE AND SECURE THOSE JOBS AND THE ECONOMIC SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THOSE OTHER BUSINESSES. MIKE: WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR WORKERS AND FAMILIES IN THE FOX VALLEY. THEY MAKE THE CASE FOR WHY THIS IS GOOD LEGISLATION FOR TAXPAYERS, MANY OF THEM WILL NOT SEE DIRECT BENEFITS. WHY IS IT A GOOD DEAL? ROGER: WE NEED A VIBRANT ECONOMY AND A HEALTHY ECOSYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES WE HAVE. KIMBERLY-CLARK, THIS IS AN ANCHOR BUSINESS WITHIN AN ANCHOR INDUSTRY IN WISCONSIN. WHEN THE STATE STEPS FORWARD TO HELP OUT A COMPANY LIKE KIMBERLY-CLARK, IT IS NOT JUST HELPING OUT ONE COMPANY. ON A LARGER SCALE, THIS IS KEEPING INTACT A SUPPLY CHAIN OF 237 OTHER WISCONSIN BUSINESSES, THESE ARE SMALL, MEDIUM, AND LARGE BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY THOUSANDS ACROSS THE STATE. BY DOING THINGS LIKE THIS, TARGETED THINGS LIKE THIS, AND PROTECTING THESE BUSINESSES, WE ARE PROTECTING THAT SUPPLY CHAIN AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE. MIKE: TOM NELSON, THE DEMOCRATIC COUNTY EXECUTIVE, SAID THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR THE WORKERS, BEFORE CHRISTMAS. HE HAD QUESTIONS AND ONE OF THOSE WAS WHAT HAPPENS THE NEXT TIME A COMPANY EMPLOYS WORKERS IN THE STATE AND COMES TO THE STATE AND SAYS, WE NEED FINANCIAL HELP OR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CLOSE. ROGER: THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. WE ARE GOING TO SEE IT PLAY OUT LIKE HERE. YOU WILL HAVE LEGISLATORS AND HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNOR TAKE A LOOK AT THE SITUATION, THE COMPANY, THE AMOUNT OF JOBS AND SEE IF IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN. IN THE CASE OF KIMBERLY-CLARK, THERE IS NOT ANY DEFINED THRESHOLD TO OFFER INCENTIVES. KIMBERLY-CLARK IS RETAINING ALMOST 400 JOBS AT THE FACILITY. IT IS KEEPING INTACT THE 2500 JOBS THEY HAVE IN THE STATE AND THEY ARE WILLING TO COMMIT TO PUT NEW INVESTMENT INTO THE AREA. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT THRESHOLD THEY HAVE CROSSED AND IF THERE ARE OTHER COMPANIES THAT CAN MATCH THAT IN BOTH JOBS AND RETENTION AND DOLLARS INVESTED, THE STATE SHOULD GIVE THEM CONSIDERATION. MIKE: I HAVE GOT JUST A SHORT TIME LEFT. I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION, YOU ARE THE SENATE PRESIDENT. DO YOU THINK WHAT IS HAPPENED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, THE SESSION, THE LEGISLATION, DO YOU THINK THAT HAS DONE SERIOUS DAMAGE WITH THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS OR WITH THE INCOMING GOVERNOR? ROGER: I DO NOT THINK SO. WE'RE IN A GOOD SPOT. I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH GOVERNOR-ELECT EVERS A FEW WEEKS AGO. WHAT WE SAW IS THE END RESULT IS THERE WILL BE MORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IN A LOT OF AREAS BUT NO POWER WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE GOVERNOR OR ATTORNEY GENERAL. JUST SOME COMMONSENSE OVERSIGHT MEASURES PUT INTO PLACE. WE ARE AT AN INTERESTING SPOT. I HAVE WORKED WITH A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR BEFORE AND TO MAKE THINGS WORK, WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT ON BOTH SIDES. MIKE: STATE SENATOR ROGER ROTH JOINING US TODAY. THANKS. ROGER: THANK YOU. MIKE: COMING UP NEXT, I'LL ASK A TOP MILWAUKEE DEMOCRAT ABOUT THE NEW LIMITS ON EARLY VOTING. PLUS, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS IN A SHOWDOWN OVER THE WALL. MIKE: WELCOME BACK. WE COULD BE JUST
