Pelosi Statement on Congressman Conyers’ Decision to Step Aside as Judiciary Committee Ranking Member

Washington, D.C. – Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released this statement following Congressman John Conyers’ decision to step aside as Judiciary Committee Ranking Member while the Ethics Committee reviews the sexual harassment allegations against him:

“Zero tolerance means consequences. I have asked for an ethics investigation, and as that investigation continues, Congressman Conyers has agreed to step aside as Ranking Member.

“As a woman and mother of four daughters, I particularly take any accusation of sexual harassment very seriously. Any credible accusation must be reviewed by the Ethics Committee expeditiously. We are at a watershed moment on this issue, and no matter how great an individual’s legacy, it is not a license for harassment. I commend the brave women coming forward.

“The House will act next week to mandate that all Members and staff undergo anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training. Next, Congress must move swiftly to reform the Office of Compliance and the Congressional Accountability Act to put an end to the days of secret settlements paid for by taxpayer dollars.

“We must ensure the Congress has a climate of dignity and respect with zero tolerance for sexual harassment.”
