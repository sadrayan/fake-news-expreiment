Medvedev: Georgia's attack on Tskhinvali in 2008 was gross violation of intl law
The attack on Tskhinvali that the Georgian armed forces launched on Aug. 8, 2008 was a gross violation of international law, and Russia had to give a tough but an appropriate response, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Aug. 8.

"Seven years separate us from Georgia's aggression against South Ossetia. In the early hours of August 8, 2008, the Georgian regular army, using heavy artillery, tanks, and air force, mounted a horrible strike upon residential buildings, hospitals, and schools in Tskhinvali. Thousands of people were killed and injured in several hours. Russian peacekeepers died, who, in line with a UN mandate, were called upon to ensure peace," Medvedev said on Facebook.

"Their killing was a blatant violation of international law and a grave crime. Russia responded in a tough but an appropriate way, within the framework of the norms and principles of national and international law. The main objective of Russia's actions was to prevent people's deaths and a humanitarian disaster," Medvedev said.

Russia "has always sought peace in the Caucasus," Medvedev added. "We are helping today to arrange a calm and safe life in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And the latest events have persuaded us once again that a peaceful settlement of internal conflicts is the only way to preserve nations and states," he said.
