Turkey is the only NATO country that defeated Daesh: Erdoğan
Turkey is the only country that defeated Daesh, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Monday.

Speaking at NATO's North Atlantic Council Mediterranean Dialogue Meeting in Ankara, Erdogan also said that Turkey rejected arguments claiming its deal to purchase Russian S-400 defence systems meant Ankara was looking for alternatives in its international ties.

Turkey expects NATO to support its rights in the eastern Mediterranean, Erdogan said, after the United States and European Union voiced concerns over Ankara's plans for offshore drilling in an area claimed by Cyprus as its exclusive economic zone
