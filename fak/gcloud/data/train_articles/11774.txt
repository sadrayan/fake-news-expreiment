Milwaukee Parental Choice Program 2015
The Public Policy Forum’s 17th annual census of MPCP schools was conducted from November 2014 through January 2015. Schools were mailed a survey to complete and return, and those that failed to do so after the due date were visited to attempt to ensure a survey participation rate of close to 100%. Visits and follow-up requests for information were made through April 2015.

Although we extended data collection this year, 27 of the 114 MPCP schools declined to participate in our census. However, to the extent possible, any missing survey data were imputed from responses to the prior year’s census or, in the case of enrollment, were obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) to ensure that our data set was as complete as possible. Note that all student figures (both total pupil enrollment and voucher student participation) presented here represent headcount unless otherwise noted.

This year, for the first time, we present our overall survey findings via this web page, as opposed to our usual research brief. Those who wish to review those findings can scroll through the tabs below to access information on various data elements. As in previous years, we have also produced a directory of individual MPCP schools, which can be accessed by clicking on the icon to the right.
