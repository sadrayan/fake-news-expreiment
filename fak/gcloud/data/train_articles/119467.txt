Grammys 2015: Prince Says Black Lives "Still Matter"
The musician presented the prize for best album at Sunday's awards ceremony.

Prince delivered a pointed statement while taking the stage at the 57th annual Grammy.

The music icon, decked out in an outlandish orange getup, was presenting the award for album of the year at the Staples Center on Sunday. Beck won the prize.

"Albums â€” remember those?" Prince said before handing out the Grammy. "Albums still matter. Albums, like books and black lives, still matter."

His comment is a reference to the hashtag #BlackLiveMatter, which began trending after George Zimmerman was acquitted for Trayvon Martin's murder.

Diversity has been a topic of discussion for Hollywood lately, with the Academy earning criticism for the fact that all of this year's Oscar nominees are white.
