Drinking three glasses of champagne a week could help to stave off dementia and Alzheimer's disease, health experts have claimed.

Researchers from Reading University said the grapes used to make fancy fizz contain compounds which boost memory and battle illness.

When tested on rats, the pinot noir and pinot meunier varities were shown to have significant health benefits.

Now academics want to gather together a group of lucky pensioners to see if champagne has the same effect on humans.

Professor Jeremy Spencer told the Mail on Sunday that the "the results were dramatic".

"This research is exciting because it illustrates for the first time that moderate consumption of champagne has the potential to influence cognitive functioning such as memory," he said.

However, a spokesman for the Alzheimer's Society said "a lot more" research had to be conducted before champagne was used as a medicine.

So can you afford this luxury medicine or is fizz a prescription that's just for the posh?

Well, there are about six large glasses of champagne in a bottle, which starts at about £20 for a relatively cheap brand.

This means that a dose of cham-medicine would cost at least a tenner - a few pounds more than the £8.05 Brits pay for an NHS prescription.

If you decided to use a more expensive bottle as your medicine, you could end up paying more than £50,000 per dose.

It is unclear whether cheaper fizz such as prosecco or cava have the same health-giving effects, which is bad news for drinkers on a budget.
