Sen. Bill Cassidy has responded to late night host Jimmy Kimmel’s searing indictment of his proposed health care bill in an appearance on CNN’s New Day.

Kimmel waded into the current health care debate in May when he delivered an emotional monologue about his son’s heart condition. And in response, Republican Senator Cassidy appeared on his show to promise his health care bill would pass the “the Jimmy Kimmel test.”

Then last week, Cassidy released his proposal — alongside colleague Lindsey Graham — for a Senate bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

And on Tuesday night, Kimmel tore into the bill in his opening monologue, accusing Cassidy of lying directly to his face and listing all the things Cassidy promised his bill would include — from coverage for pre-existing conditions to no lifetime caps — that his actual bill doesn’t.

“Not only did Bill Cassidy fail the Jimmy Kimmel test — he failed the Bill Cassidy test,” Kimmel said.

CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Cassidy about Kimmel’s comments on Wednesday morning, to which the senator replied: “I’m sorry he does not understand. Under Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson more people will have coverage, and we protect those with pre-existing conditions.”
