Statement on Plan to Ensure Safe and Responsible Natural Gas Production

Today, Hillary Clinton released her plan to ensure safe and responsible natural gas production, which is the latest plank of her comprehensive plan to combat climate change and build a 21st century energy system.

“Improving air quality and combatting climate change are too important to take any solution off the table. Switching to natural gas has avoided thousands of premature deaths and more than 100,000 asthma attacks by improving air quality, while creating good paying jobs and careers and helping reduce US carbon pollution to its lowest level in 20 years. With strong safeguards in place, natural gas can play an important role in our transition to a clean energy economy, complementing my plan to expand renewable energy and reduce energy costs by investing in building efficiency.

“The United States should not be deciding energy policy pipeline-by-pipeline or project-by-project. That’s not how we’re going to build a 21st century clean energy system that will create jobs, make our economy more competitive, protect our communities, and combat climate change. As President, I will ensure natural gas production is safe and responsible in those communities that choose to pursue it. And I have a comprehensive plan to modernize our energy infrastructure, ensuring new pipelines are built to the highest labor and safety standards, and repairing and replacing thousands of miles of outdated pipelines by the end of my first term. We need a comprehensive strategy to modernize our energy infrastructure, power our economy, and meet the climate challenge. My plan would do just that.”
