Muslim Brotherhood: ‘Prepare Egyptians for war with Israel'
A leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt told the Arabic-language Iranian news network Al-Alam on Monday that he would like to see the Egyptian people prepare for war against Israel, according to the Hebrew-language business newspaper Calcalist.



Muhammad Ghannem reportedly told Al- Alam that the Suez Canal should be closed immediately, and that the flow of gas from Egypt to Israel should cease “in order to bring about the downfall of the Mubarak regime.�? He added that “the people should be prepared for war against Israel,�? saying the world should understand that “the Egyptian people are prepared for anything to get rid of this regime.�?



Ghannem praised Egyptian soldiers deployed by President Hosni Mubarak to Egyptian cities, saying they “would not kill their brothers.�? He added that Washington was forced to abandon plans to help Mubarak stay in power after “seeing millions head for the streets.�?
