William Appleton Potter ( 1842-1909 )



William Appleton Potter was the son of Bishop Alonzo Potter and a half-brother of Edward Tuckerman Potter, who was also an architect. Born in Schenectady, Potter grew up in Philadelphia and attended Union College. His collegiate background distinguished him from most of the architects of the first half of the nineteenth century, who received their training through apprenticeship in the building trades 'and then sometimes in the offices of practicing architects. The apprenticeship tradition was still strong, however, and Potter received his professional training in his half-brother's office. Chancellor Green Library was Potter's first major commission. In it, he took the High Victorian Gothic vocabulary and octagonal form used by his half-brother for the Nott Memorial at Union College, and elaborated it into a complex interplay of octagons of various sizes and shapes. For the college, retaining Potter represented a shift from dependence on Philadelphia architects to a New York pract itioner. Potter would go on to design several other buildings on the campus: the John C. Green Science building (1873-1875) (demolished), Alexander Hall (1891-1894), East Pyne Building (1896-1897), and, with his partner R.H. Robertson, the University Hotel (1875-1877) (demolished), Witherspoon Hall (1875-1877), and Stuart Hall (1875-1877) at Princeton Theological Seminary. U. S.

During 1875 and 1876, Potter also served as Supervising Architect of the Treasury. Under his supervision, designs were produced for Customhouses, Courthouses, and Post Offices in Kentucky, Indiana, Massachusetts, Georgia, and Tennessee. During his partnership with Robertson, from 1875 to 1881, the firm produced summer "cottages" at Newport, Long Island, and the Jersey shore, and the Brown University Library (1875). Potter also designed several churches, including the South Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts (1871-1875), Christ Church in Poughkeepsie, New York (1887-1889), and the First Reformed Dutch church in Somerville, New Jersey (1896-1897). Charles H. Baldwin House in Newport, Rhode Island



Built in 1877-78, this early Shingle Style home was designed by the architectural firm of William Appleton Potter and Robert Anderson Robertson. According to a Historic American Building Survey report, a later 20th century owner named it "Gamir Doon", Armenian for "Red House". One wonders if the name was as much a description of house's Bordeaux wine color as it was a tribute to Philip Webb's 1859 "Red House", built for William Morris, and one of the seminal works of the English Arts and Crafts Movement. Like other Shingle Style houses, Potter and Robertson's design is an American interpretation of the Queen Anne and "Old English" styles of Richard Norman Shaw, the early American Colonial styles of New England, and the avant garde philosophy of the aforementioned English Arts and Crafts Movement. http://www.cupola.com/html/bldgstru/artscrft/slide/baldw01e.htm U.
