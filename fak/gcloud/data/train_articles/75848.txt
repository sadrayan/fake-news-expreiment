Legislative Affairs
The Department of Juvenile Justice's Legislation Office is responsible for lobbying departmental issues with the Legislature. In addition, the Department is responsible for preparing proposed bills and amendments, coordinating substantive legislative proposals and handling budget requests for the department.

Furthermore, Legislative Affairs works closely with legislative committees, assists with constituent issues, and tracks bills affecting the Department.

Legislative Affairs also coordinates legislative presentations for the Secretary and other staff and prepares legislative updates for department managers, Juvenile Justice Circuit Boards and County Councils, and other interested persons.

External Affairs seeks to create awareness and share the vision of those involved in serving the at-risk youth of Florida. The goal is to increase visibility, improve communication and build stronger partnerships between the Department of Juvenile Justice and its stakeholders, local communities, community leaders at the federal, state and local levels, schools, law enforcement, the court system and service providers to improve the lives of the young people in Florida.

It is the priority of External Affairs to raise awareness and enhance the mission, vision and priorities set forth by the Governor and the Secretary of the Florida Department Of Juvenile Justice.

External Affairs strives for excellence in an environment that is continually changing to meet the needs of youth and families in Florida.

External Affairs serves as the liaison between the Department Of Juvenile Justice and all external partners, along with coordination of events for the Secretary.
