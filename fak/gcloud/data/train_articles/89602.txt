January 22, 2014 - Economy/Jobs And Healthcare Are Top Voter Priorities, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Obama Gets Low Grades On Top Priorities

PDF format



In an open-ended question, allowing for any answer, American voters list the economy/jobs and healthcare as their top priorities, two issues for which President Barack Obama gets low job approval ratings, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today.





Naming "the top priority for President Obama and Congress in 2014," 15 percent of voters say the economy, while 16 percent list jobs or unemployment, a total of 31 percent, while 18 percent list healthcare, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. A total of 10 percent list the budget, the budget deficit, spending or other budget-related items. Another 4 percent list bi-partisanship or cooperation and 2 percent list education.





American voters give President Obama a negative 40 - 54 percent approval rating, compared to 41 - 53 percent January 8, and 38 - 57 percent December 10, indications that his plunge has leveled off.





But voters give Obama his lowest grades for their top priorities:

Negative 39 - 56 percent for his handling of the economy;

Negative 36 - 59 percent for his handling of healthcare;

Positive 48 - 41 percent for handling terrorism;

Negative 40 - 49 percent for foreign policy;

Negative 39 - 47 percent for handling Iran.

"'It's the economy, Mr. President,' say dissatisfied American voters who are not yet willing to give President Barack Obama a thumbs up on his presidency," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.





"If - and it's a big IF - the president can convince the American people that the economy is getting better and that Obamacare will be good for them, it will go a long way to rebuilding his sagging job approval ratings."





A total of 67 percent of American voters plan to watch President Obama deliver the State of the Union address January 28.





The economy is "not so good" or "poor," a total of 77 percent of voters say. Only 28 percent say the economy is getting better, while 26 percent say it is getting worse and 44 percent say it's the same.





The Obama administration is not competent running the government, voters say 53 - 42 percent. The president is paying attention to what his administration is doing, 45 percent say, while 47 percent say he is not paying attention.





The president's character measures remain low:

46 percent say he is honest and trustworthy and 49 percent say he is not;

49 percent say he is a strong leader and 48 percent say he is not;

51 percent say he cares about their needs and problems and 46 percent say he does not. Olympic Terrorism

A terrorist attack at the Winter Olympics is "very likely," 12 percent of voters say, while 38 percent say an attack is "somewhat likely." Another 26 percent say an attack is "somewhat unlikely," and 19 percent say "very unlikely."





"It's a chilling and troubling thought: half of Americans think a terror attack on the Winter Olympic Games is either likely or very likely," Malloy said.





From January 15 - 19, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,933 registered voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 2.2 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and the nation as a public service and for research.
