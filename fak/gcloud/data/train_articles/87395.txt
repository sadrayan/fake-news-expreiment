general election edition | see also: primary organization | pre-campaign organization



OVERVIEW: This page shows organization of the Trump campaign for the general election gleaned from campaign releases and news accounts. On May 3 Trump became the presumptive nominee. Starting in late April and May the campaign made important additions including Congressional Liaison Scott Mason (April 28), Policy Director John Mashburn (May 3), National Finance Director Steven Mnuchin (May 5), Vice Presidential Search Corey Lewandowski (May 10), Pollster Tony Fabrizio (May 17), Paul Manafort elevated from Delegate Process and Convention Manager to Campaign Chairman and Chief Strategist (May 19), Rick Wiley out as Political Director after six weeks (May 25). An ongoing battle in the campaign between Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski and Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort was finally settled on June 20 when Lewandowski was let go. The campaign also announced additions to its political team in July, and through the first weeks of August was growing out staff in the states.. As campaign chairman and chief strategist, Manafort led through the Convention into mid-August when the campaign announced another shake up, elevating Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager and bringing on Breitbart's Stephen K. Bannon as CEO, followed shortly thereafter by Manafort's resignation. Even in this late stage the campaign continued to add experienced operatives including Bill Stepien as national field director, Susie Wiles as senior advisor for battleground communications, and David Bossie as deputy campaign manager. Trump's family played a very central role in the campaign, particularly son in law Jared Kushner, who, as articles in Bloomberg Businessweek and Forbes have documented, led the campaign's data and social media effort from June 2016. The campaign itself was an unprecedentedly lean operation, but was bolstered by an RNC field organization (2, 3) that far surpassed what the Party did in 2012.
