NORTHBROOK, Ill. (AP) - Republican Senate candidate Mark Kirk has acknowledged twice being scolded by the Pentagon for improperly mingling politics with his military duties.

It's something his campaign had flatly denied just two weeks ago.

When a blogger disclosed a Defense Department memo referring to Kirk being "counseled" for political activity while on duty, the Kirk campaign said the memo was "off the mark" and that he had never violated Pentagon policies. His campaign called the document "a baseless political ploy."

Kirk acknowledged today that he was counseled in late 2008 after he gave interviews about former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's arrest. He also says he was counseled for a Twitter post he said his staff made in July 2009 when he was on duty.
