Ohio shale gas development supports 39,000 jobs says latest industry-sponsored study
The gas and oil industry's development of Ohio's Utica shale supported nearly 39,000 jobs in the state in 2012 and generated $1.5 billion in taxes, a new economic study commissioned by the industry estimates.

Released Wednesday as part of a multi-state analysis by IHS, Inc., a global market information and analytical company, the study noted that of the 39,000 Ohio jobs, only 4,200 were directly involved in the oil and gas industry.

The remaining 34,000 jobs were not actual counts but the result of standard economic modeling, using federally published data, principally by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The study is part of a series conducted by the company into the impact of oil and gas exploration on the nation's economy. The overall report looked at 16 states where unconventional oil and gas drilling is under way, meaning horizontal drilling into shale, sands and other dense rock where gas and oil are locked in the rock. Traditionally, oil and gas production involves vertical wells into pockets of oil and gas.

IHS analysts also looked at 32 other states, which are benefiting from the unconventional shale wells because they manufacture or supply materials and equipment to the industry. In addition to supply chain kinds of jobs, the study included estimates of unrelated jobs such as health care workers, department store employees and car salesmen supported by all of the spending the industry and its suppliers are doing.

The study estimated that for the nation, shale development in 2012, driven by $87 billion of investment, supported 1.7 million jobs. They include those involving people working directly in the industry, in companies supplying material or expertise to the industry, and others benefiting from the new spending by those employed by the industry or its suppliers.

The study also included economic impact projects for 2020 and 2035, predicting that across the nation, the industry will invest $172.5 billion in shale development by 2020 and $353 billion by 2035. That will support 3 million jobs by the end of the decade and up to 3.5 million jobs by 2035.

For Ohio, the models predict that by 2020, the industry will be supporting 143,600 jobs, including 38,700 direct jobs and 41,800 in the supply chain, and the remaining 63,000 in unrelated occupations.

Ohio projections for 2035 were even more robust: 266,600 total jobs, including 77,600 directly related to production and 77,300 in a long-standing supply chain, with about 112,000 unrelated, additional jobs buoyed by the spending of the industry and its suppliers.

The analysis concludes that in 2012, the industry directly or indirectly contributed about $4.1 billion into Ohio's economy, or gross state product. It forecasts that by 2035, the total value added to the state's economy will be more than $35 billion.

In comments about Ohio's economy, the report's authors noted the development of Utica Shale here is in the early stages but that early results "are highly encouraging" and that it appears half of the state's land sits over oil and gas shale.

In a prepared statement announcing the report's release, Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS, said "The unconventional oil and gas revolution is having a bigger impact across the country, including in non-producing states, than is generally recognized. What we found is that the economic and financial links reach out across all the states in our highly-interconnected national economy."

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Energy Institute, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Chemistry Council, America's Natural Gas Alliance and the Natural Gas Supply Association commissioned the study.
