Emails (excerpted), Scott M. Daigle, chief of staff, state Rep. Donna Howard, Aug. 23 and 29, 2016

I am writing in regard to your request for information on one of Rep. Howard's statements this morning. It is my understanding that the statement in question is: "...relief from child care costs, which in some states now exceed the price tag for college tuition."

Rep. Howard's primary source for the comment was data from an April 2016 report by the Economic Policy Institute, which showed that the annual cost of care for a 4-year-old at a full-time day-care center or school is greater than the average cost of in-state tuition at a four-year institution in 23 states.

A sampling of news articles related to the report includes:

- http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/04/11/states-where-day-care-costs-more-than-college/

- http://www.businessinsider.com/daycare-more-expensive-than-college-2016-4

- http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/04/day-care-costs-more-than-college-in-many-states.html

- http://time.com/money/4289032/pre-k-costs-more-than-college-in-23-states/

EPI had found similar results before, such as was highlighted in this October 2015 article.

A secondary resource for Rep. Howard's statement was a 2014 report by Child Care Aware America, which found that the annual cost of day care for an infant exceeds the average cost of in-state tuition and fees at public colleges in 31 states and the District of Columbia.

Some articles on that report include:

- https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/09/start-saving-now-day-care-costs-more-than-college-in-31-states/

- http://www.forbes.com/sites/annabahney/2015/01/22/does-child-care-cost-more-than-college-where-you-live/#4dc11ccb4556

A 2015 update of that report found 28 states plus the District of Columbia where the average cost for an infant in center-based child care is higher than a year's tuition and fees at a four-year public university. And they put up a nifty infographic here.

Thanks for checking!

I didnâ€™t spot a college tuition aspect to the 4/16 report you cited though it looks like the institute put out a report in 2015, here: http://www.epi.org/publication/child-care-affordability/#epi-toc-6

You are correct that the April 2016 report itself focuses on the need for investment in child care, rather than the costs of tuition vs. child care. However, the data which accompanies the report shows that the annual cost of 4-year-old care exceeds the annual cost of in-state tuition for a 4-year public college in these 23 states (plus the District of Columbia): Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
