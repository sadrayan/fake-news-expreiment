Q&A: Gov. Rauner talks infrastructure, politics and his plans for 2018
Rauner: I'm actually here in Joliet and Will County meeting with elected officials and talking about different initiatives we got going on. Obviously (it's a) big year in terms of the election and also hopefully getting a truly balanced budget for the first time in maybe forever. We're going to be proposing again a balanced budget and actually proposing an income tax reduction. They overrode my veto on the tax hike last June. I'm going to propose that we start rolling that back.

My goals in this year, and then for the next four years, that's after re-election, are to roll back the income tax hike, get it back down to 3 percent over time. (That's) number one.

Number two, get property tax relief, meaning get local control and let local residents be able to control whether their levy goes up or down through a simple voter referendum process. So local residents can say, “Hey we want our levy up 5 percent to cover our schools this year,” or, “We need it to go down 7 percent over the next two years because we can't afford our homes anymore,” and then local control of the cost of government.

Third big issue, big goal is to grow the economy faster. Our biggest challenge in Illinois is our government spending has been growing four times faster than our economy has been growing. This is has been true for 30 years. That's unsustainable. It's the reason why we always have deficits. It's the reason why we're always having tax hikes. We're sort of on this long, slow debt spiral and we've got to change that.
