New York to Sue Gun Industry
New York City plans to sue the firearms industry today, charging it with creating a public nuisance by selling products that end up being used in crimes, officials said Monday.

New York's lawsuit, which would add the largest city in the United States to the list of 30 cities and counties that have sued gun makers, is expected to be filed in federal court today, a city lawyer said.

New York's lawsuit will say the firearms industry's selling practices create a public nuisance by allowing guns to be sold in an illegitimate secondary market where they fall into the hands of criminals.

"We're also saying that they have failed or refuse to design safer guns and that they have created a wall of deniability by avoiding monitoring the downstream path of their product," said Lorna Goodman, a senior attorney for the city's Corporation Counsel.
