US Ship Force Levels
U.S. Navy Active Ship Force Levels, 1886-present

This tabulation was compiled from such sources as the Navy Directory (issued at varying intervals to 1941); the Annual Reports of the Secretary of the Navy (issued annually to 1931); Comptroller of the Navy (NAVCOMPT) compilations; Department of the Navy (DON) 5-Year Program, Ships & Aircraft Supplemental Data Tables (SASDT); and records and compilations of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OP-802K, now N804J1D) Ship Management Information System (now Ship Management System), refined and edited with the assistance of the annual Naval Vessel Register.



For consistent historical comparison, Naval Reserve Force (NRF) and Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force (NFAF) ships, and Military Sealift Command (MSC) fleet support ships, are included in current and recent active totals. Figures, and conclusions drawn from them, would, otherwise, be historically inconsistent, and comparisons would be skewed.



From 1963 through 1974, former guided-missile frigates (DLG/DLGN) are counted under the categories (cruisers, destroyers) to which they were assigned on 30 June 1975: DLG 6 class Became DDG 37 class; DLG 16 class became CG 16 class; DLG 26 class became CG 26 class; DLGN 25, 35, 36 classes became CGN 25, 35, 36 classes.

Surface warfare ship totals do not include submarines, mine warfare, patrol or auxiliaries.

Notes * Mostly protected cruisers plus two armored cruisers and three unprotected cruisers. ** Although not a gunboat, the steel-hulled despatch boat Dolphin was part of the "New Navy". The great increase in numbers after 1897 includes new building, conversions, and war prizes. *** All wooden or iron ships until 1898 when the wartime expansion included eleven merchant ships temporarily converted to auxiliary cruisers. ^ Includes one steam sloop and one steam sloop-of-war. ~ Includes wooden, composite, and iron gunboats. @ Includes one sloop-of-war and three training ships. $ The distinction between "Old" Navy and "Steel" Navy is somewhat artificial, the former being the old iron-hulled vessels with early steam engines, while the latter term covers (with a few exceptions) the new steel-hulled triple-expansion steam engine warships that become the standard ships of 20th-century navies.

Events • U.S. authorized first vessels of the "steel navy" in 1883 and 1885. • First battleship (pre-dreadnought) authorized in 1886. • Publication of Alfred Thayer Mahan's widely read but often misunderstood The Influence of Sea Power Upon History in 1890.

Events • Spanish-American War, April-August 1898. • First submarine enters service in 1900. First torpedo boat destroyers enter service in 1902.

Notes * Holland, although technically a submersible torpedo boat, was the first of some 500 or so diesel-electric boats commonly referred to as "submarines." *** About 20 steel ships, converted to gunboats, were bought by the Navy in 1898 because of the war with Spain. # Before the Spanish-American War, this category included the small freight carrier Fern. For the wartime period and after, it covers colliers, supply ships, water supply ships, a transport, a hospital ship, and a refrigerator ship. *** By the turn of the century, the only active sailing ship left in the Navy (the rest had become stationary receiving or training ships or had been transferred to State Militias or Marine Schools) was the bark Severn, used to train midshipmen at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. The category is therefore closed. @@ Twenty-three converted yachts, fourteen revenue cutters transferred from the Treasury Department, war prizes, and conversions of private craft temporarily increased the number of non-steel "gunboats" in the Navy during and after 1898.

Notes * A number of torpedo boats went in and out of commission during this time period, often seeing service with reserve units or State Militias. Most, however, came back into the Navy in 1917 and therefore remain on the list. ** By 1906, all the screw steamers had either decommissioned or had become station ships, tenders, trainers, or auxiliaries, thus this category is closed down. *** After 1904, the remaining two sloops, Hartford and Mohican, only served as training or station ships, thus closing down this category. **** By 1906, the distinction between old and steel navy is no longer useful.

Notes * A number of torpedo boats went in and out of commission during this time period, often seeing service with reserve units or State Militias. Most, however, came back into the Navy in 1917 and therefore remain on the list. ** These two categories are merged together with the great wartime expansion of gunboat numbers in 1917.

Notes @ The last Coast Defense Monitor went out of commission in 1921. rc Reduced Commission: not included in "active" total. The drop in ship numbers evident from 1920-21 is a post-WWI readjustment to a peacetime strength, with limited budgets and naval arms limitation.
