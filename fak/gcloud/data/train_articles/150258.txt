Violin Islands Optical Illusion
When I start digging, and go through all your previous illusion submissions that havenâ€™t been posted yet (which I just did today), I usually find some extraordinary pieces that somehow managed to slip my sight initially. One such great example is this magnificent photo (painting?) picturing two islands that resemble something much more than just ordinary pieces of land. Do you see them forming a giant violin or is it just me?
