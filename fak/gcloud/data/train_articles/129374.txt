Despite rumors, gas stations not closing
Rumors swept Memphis late Wednesday night and Thursday that a gas shortage would be the cause an organized closing of all gas stations in Memphis.

Action News 5 checked with several area agencies Thursday, including AAA, and confirmed that these rumors have no basis in fact. Though several gas stations throughout Memphis are currently without gasoline, there is no organized effort or specific time for all gas stations to close.

According to the urban legend website Snopes.com, a similar rumor has popped up in many cities across the Southeast United States in the days since Hurricane Katrina made landfall. It appears that this rumor started in an email that was quickly circulated on the internet.

At a press conference Thursday, President Bush asked drivers to be "prudent" in the next few weeks amid fuel shortages caused by Hurricane Katrina.

The President said, "Don't buy gas if you don't need it."

Bush said his administration's convinced the fuel supply disruptions from Katrina will be temporary. He said one big pipeline's already partially restored, while others will come back on-line soon.
