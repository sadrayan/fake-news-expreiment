Dr. Sabato:

Hello again from Texas. It’s been a long spell.

I write afresh with urgency because we’re fact-checking Sen. Ted Cruz’s July 17 claim here that Beto O’Rourke is the only Senate candidate to call for President Trump’s impeachment.

As of that date, would this statement seem accurate to you? Why or why not? Any other recommended authorities on this topic?

A note: We rely on attributable on-the-record information for all our stories.

Meantime, perhaps you saw our poll write-up.

Finally and personally, I trust you’ve heard about the great Peggy Fikac seeking work. Her cell remains 512-496-7090.

Thank you,

g.

Just had a think with my Crystal Ball team.

In the somewhat-to-very competitive Senate races (see our website), O’Rourke appears to be the only Democratic candidate to call for impeachment. However, we do not keep up with uncompetitive Senate states. Sometimes long-shot candidates will take positions that more cautious nominees who have a real chance to win will avoid. Maybe the DSCC can help you there.

Sen. Kamala Harris has called on Trump to resign, but she’s not on the 2018 ballot.

As for Peggy, a journalist that able should be able to find a good job even in the current downsizing. I wish her well.

Best wishes,

Larry Sabato
