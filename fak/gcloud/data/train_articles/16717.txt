Thanks for reaching out about the wealth gap between black Americans and white Americans. Unfortunately, it is a widely reported fact in our country.

According to data released in October by the Federal Reserve System of the United States, the median net worth of white families is now ten times that of black families.

The Pew Research found identical conclusions, saying, "In 2016, the median wealth of white households was $171,000. That’s 10 times the wealth of black households ($17,100) – a larger gap than in 2007"

Here's a graphic from the Urban institute, showing the wealth gap discussed above:
