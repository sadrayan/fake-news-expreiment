J.D. Alexander demands Scott turn over public records on state plane sale
Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander sent Gov. Rick Scott a formal public records request Thursday asking for all information relating to the sale of two state planes.

The request is comprehensive: "I request copies of all written materials (hardcopy or digital) including letters, memoranda, notes, phone logs, office appointment calendars, legal memorandum or opinions, emails, agreements and contracts in the Governor's Office or the Department of Management Services related to the sale of the two state aircraft which are the subject of my previous two letters to you dated February 17 and 22, 2011," he wrote.

Alexander wants the information, likely created since Nov. 2, in hard copy and data disk. "Also, since my office, like yours, is located in the Capitol, the requested documents may be delivered to the Senate Budget Office Committee office in room 201, the Capitol."

Alexander had sent two letters to Scott questioning his decision to sell the state planes. The first letter commended the governor for selling the planes but criticized him for not seeking the approval of the Legislature first. His second letter demanded the governor cite his “legal authority” for selling the planes and the names of advisers who told him to do it.

The governor stood by the sale Friday, saying, “I reviewed that project step by step with our general counsel, and we did the right thing.”
