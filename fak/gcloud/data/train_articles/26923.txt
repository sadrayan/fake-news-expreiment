BREAKING: Federal Judge Tosses Michael Cohen Warrant And All Evidence With It

Federal Judge Earl Manuel Mariano of the Northern California 43rd Circuit Federal and State Court of Appeals has declared the evidence collected by the FBI at Trump Lawyer Michael Cohen’s office to be completely illegal and inadmissible in any court of law. The Superior court immediately issued a concurring decision, stopping the appeals process.

According to the clerk who wrote the ruling for Mariano, who is coincidentally vacationing at Trump Resorts Hawaii, his boss was very clear and that he should “just write something good” since it was really just a politically motivated favor:

“The court that issued the warrant did so without clarifying the office letter “D” that is clearly listed above the door that contained any and all of the evidence collected. Anything collected in that room is therefore malifecient malifescutis and fruit of the poisonous loin.”

The judge couldn’t be reached for comment.

This little goof up on the part of the Mueller legal team shows that they have no ideahow far President Trump’s friends will go to cover for him. Stupid liberals.
