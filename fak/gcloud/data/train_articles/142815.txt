The rate of decline in the United States remains too slow to achieve TB elimination in this century.

Eliminating tuberculosis (TB) will require interrupting TB transmission as well as major efforts to address latent TB infection. In 2016, a total of 9,272 TB cases were reported in the United States. This represents a 2.9% decrease from 2015.

The national incidence rate was 2.9 cases per 100,000 persons (3.6% decrease from 2015).
