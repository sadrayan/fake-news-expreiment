Buchanan, Trump Edge Closer to Showdown
WASHINGTON â€” Former television commentator Patrick J. Buchanan and New York developer Donald Trump stepped farther from their Republican roots and closer to a possible showdown for the presidential nomination of the Reform Party on Sunday.

Buchanan, who is expected to make a formal announcement of his plans to enter the Reform Party contest today, said in a television interview that he had made the decision "because the Washington elite of the GOP has left me."

Trump, meanwhile, told Associated Press that he will file papers today, changing his voter registration from the Republican Party to the Independence Party--the Reform affiliate in New York.

"The Republican Party has just moved too far to the extreme right," he said. "The Democrats are too far to the left. I believe the Reform Party can be the true centrist party. And that's very much in line with my thinking."
