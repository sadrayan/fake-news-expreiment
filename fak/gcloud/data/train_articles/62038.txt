President Donald J. Trump is Delivering on Deregulation
Quote We will get rid of the redundancy and duplication that wastes your time and your money.

SURPASSING GOALS FOR FY 2017: The Trump Administration has far exceeded its promise to eliminate regulations at a 2:1 ratio and impose no lifetime net regulatory costs.

Agencies have issued 22 deregulatory actions for every one new regulatory action. This 22:1 ratio far exceeds President Trump’s promise to eliminate two rules for every one new rule. In total, agencies issued 67 deregulatory actions while imposing only three new regulatory actions.

Federal agencies achieved $8.1 billion in lifetime net regulatory cost savings, the equivalent of $570 million per year. These savings go beyond the Administration’s goal of imposing no lifetime net regulatory costs in FY 2017. In contrast, the previous administration imposed between $5.7 billion and $15.2 billion in annualized regulatory costs in its final eight months in office.



EVEN GREATER SAVINGS IN 2018: The Trump Administration is committed to producing even greater regulatory cost savings in FY 2018.

Federal agencies are committed to cutting more than $9.8 billion in lifetime costs for regulations finalized in FY 2018. This $9.8 billion in savings would amount to $686.6 million per year.



REGULATORY PLAN FOR FY 2018: Today, the Trump Administration is releasing its first full Regulatory Plan and Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions.
