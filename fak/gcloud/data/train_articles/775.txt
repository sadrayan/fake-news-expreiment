Women's Land: Reflections on rural women’s access to land in Latin America Strengthening women’s access to land and control over its use is not just a matter of agricultural development and food security, but a question of human rights and justice for women. The human rights of women are not yet fully respected despite the progress made in legislation at global, regional, and national levels. Apart from formal legislation, access to and control of land by women should be part of other mechanisms for recognising these rights, in communities, for example, where women are often not included in spaces for participation and decisionmaking. Although the law may protect their land rights, it is difficult for rural women to gain access to the judicial system to protest when these rights are violated. This scenario of inequality in which women find themselves can be reversed through social and

economic changes to give women the tools they need to empower themselves. Institución(es): ILC, Fundación Tierra
