Watch Lindsey Graham’s angry defense of Brett Kavanaugh
Some Republican senators on the Senate panel considering Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination forcefully defended him Thursday — the most notable of which was Senator Lindsey Graham, who angrily lashed out at Democrats over how the allegations were brought forward.

“This is not a job interview. This is hell,” Graham said.

Graham blamed Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein for holding back Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations, turning to the Democrats on the panel as he yelled, “If you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.” He continued: “This is the most unethical sham since I’ve been in politics, and if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn’t have done what you did to this guy.”

Turning back to Kavanaugh, Graham told him, “You’ve got nothing to apologize for.”

“You’re looking for a fair process? You came to the wrong town at the wrong time, my friend,” Graham said.

Feinstein has said she received Ford’s allegation in a letter and sent it to the FBI. She and other Democrats have also said the FBI should have investigated allegations made by Ford and two other women, just as it did in 1991 when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexually harassing her.
