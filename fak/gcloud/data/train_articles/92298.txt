(a) A school district may not have a wealth per student that exceeds: (1) the wealth per student that generates the amount of maintenance and operations tax revenue per weighted student available to a district with maintenance and operations tax revenue per cent of tax effort equal to the maximum amount provided per cent under Section 42.101(a) or (b), for the district's maintenance and operations tax effort equal to or less than the rate equal to the sum of the product of the state compression percentage, as determined under Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year and any additional tax effort included in calculating the district's compressed tax rate under Section 42.101(a-1); (2) the wealth per student that generates the amount of maintenance and operations tax revenue per weighted student available to the Austin Independent School District, as determined by the commissioner in cooperation with the Legislative Budget Board, for the first six cents by which the district's maintenance and operations tax rate exceeds the rate equal to the sum of the product of the state compression percentage, as determined under Section 42.2516, multiplied by the maintenance and operations tax rate adopted by the district for the 2005 tax year and any additional tax effort included in calculating the district's compressed tax rate under Section 42.101(a-1), subject to Section 41.093(b-1); or (3) $319,500, for the district's maintenance and operations tax effort that exceeds the amount of tax effort described by Subdivision (2). (b) For purposes of this chapter, the commissioner shall adjust, in accordance with Section 42.2521, the taxable values of a school district that, due to factors beyond the control of the board of trustees, experiences a rapid decline in the tax base used in calculating taxable values. (c) Repealed by Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 396, Sec. 3.01(a), eff. Sept. 1, 1999. (d) Expired.

(f) For purposes of Subsection (e), a school district's effective tax rate is determined by dividing the total amount of taxes collected by the district for the applicable school year less any amounts paid into a tax increment fund under Chapter 311, Tax Code, by the quotient of the district's taxable value of property, as determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, divided by 100. (g) The wealth per student that a district may have under Subsection (e) is adjusted as follows: AWPS = WPS X (((EWL/280,000 - 1) X DTR/1.17) + 1)

(a) Not later than July 15 of each year, using the estimate of enrollment under Section 42.254, the commissioner shall review the wealth per student of school districts in the state and shall notify: (1) each district with wealth per student exceeding the equalized wealth level; (2) each district to which the commissioner proposes to annex property detached from a district notified under Subdivision (1), if necessary, under Subchapter G; and (3) each district to which the commissioner proposes to consolidate a district notified under Subdivision (1), if necessary, under Subchapter H. (b) If, before the dates provided by this subsection, a district notified under Subsection (a)(1) has not successfully exercised one or more options under Section 41.003 that reduce the district's wealth per student to a level equal to or less than the equalized wealth level, the commissioner shall order the detachment of property from that district as provided by Subchapter G. If that detachment will not reduce the district's wealth per student to a level equal to or less than the equalized wealth level, the commissioner may not detach property under Subchapter G but shall order the consolidation of the district with one or more other districts as provided by Subchapter H. An agreement under Section 41.003(1) or (2) must be executed not later than September 1 immediately following the notice under Subsection (a).

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a school district's wealth per student exceeds the equalized wealth level for the first time in the 2006-2007 or a later school year, the commissioner may consider the district to have reduced its wealth per student to the equalized wealth level for any school year as provided by this section. (b) When the commissioner initially identifies a school district under Section 41.004 as having a wealth per student for a school year that exceeds the equalized wealth level, the commissioner shall estimate: (1) the amount of state revenue to which the district is entitled under Chapter 42 for that school year; and (2) the cost to the district to purchase attendance credits under Subchapter D in an amount sufficient to reduce the district's wealth per student to the equalized wealth level for that school year. (c) If the commissioner determines that the amount described by Subsection (b)(1) exceeds the amount described by Subsection (b)(2), the commissioner shall notify the district of the commissioner's determination. In lieu of exercising an option described by Section 41.003, the district's board of trustees may authorize the commissioner to withhold from the state revenue to which the district is entitled under Chapter 42 an amount equal to the amount described by Subsection (b)(2). (d) In calculating the amount of state revenue to be withheld from a school district under this section, the commissioner shall calculate the cost for the district to reduce the district's wealth per student to the equalized wealth level using the final attendance and tax rate data for the school year and shall award the district any available credit or discount under Subchapter D as if the district had exercised the option under Section 41.003(3) in a timely manner. If the final amount calculated for the cost for the district to reduce the district's wealth per student to the equalized wealth level for a school year exceeds the amount of state revenue to which the district is entitled under Chapter 42 for that year: (1) the commissioner shall: (A) withhold the entire amount of state revenue to which the district is entitled under Chapter 42 for that year; and (B) withhold the additional amount of the cost for the district to reduce the district's wealth per student to the equalized wealth level for that year from the state revenue to which the district is entitled under Chapter 42 for a subsequent school year, or if the additional amount exceeds the amount of state revenue to which the district is entitled, add the difference to the cost of the attendance credits that the district must purchase in the subsequent year; and (2) the district is not required to take any further action to reduce its wealth per student for that year. (e) An action by the board of trustees of a school district authorizing the commissioner to withhold state revenue from the district under this section is valid without voter authorization.

(b) If a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction should hold each of the options provided by Section 41.003 invalid, the commissioner shall act under Subchapter G or H to achieve the equalized wealth level only after notice and hearing is afforded to each school district affected by the order. The commissioner shall adopt a plan that least disrupts the affected school districts. If because the exigency to adopt a plan prevents the commissioner from giving a reasonable time for notice and hearing, the commissioner shall timely give notice to and hold a hearing for the affected school districts, but in no event less than 30 days from time of notice to the date of hearing. (c) If a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction should hold an option provided by Section 41.003 invalid and order a refund to a district of any amounts paid by a district choosing that option, the amount shall be refunded but held in reserve and not expended by the district until released by order of the commissioner. The commissioner shall order the release immediately on the commissioner's determination that, through one of the means provided by law, the district has achieved the equalized wealth level. The amount released shall be deducted from any state aid payable to the district according to a schedule adopted by the commissioner. Added by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 260, Sec. 1, eff.

(a) For purposes of this subchapter, the taxable value of an individual parcel or other item of property and the total taxable value of property in a school district resulting from the detachment of property from or annexation of property to that district is determined by applying the appraisal ratio for the appropriate category of property determined under Subchapter M, Chapter 403, Government Code, for the preceding tax year to the taxable value of the detached or annexed property determined under Title 1, Tax Code, for the preceding tax year. (b) For purposes of this subchapter, the taxable value of all or a portion of a parcel or item of real property includes the taxable value of personal property having taxable situs at the same location as the real property.

(a) The commissioner shall detach property under this section from each school district from which the commissioner is required under Section 41.004 to detach property under this subchapter. (b) The commissioner shall detach from each school district covered by Subsection (a) one or more whole parcels or items of property in descending order of the taxable value of each parcel or item, beginning with the parcel or item having the greatest taxable value, until the school district's wealth per student is equal to or less than the equalized wealth level, except as otherwise provided by Subsection (c). (c) If the detachment of whole parcels or items of property, as provided by Subsection (a) would result in a district's wealth per student that is less than the equalized wealth level by more than $10,000, the commissioner may not detach the last parcel or item of property and shall detach the next one or more parcels or items of property in descending order of taxable value that would result in the school district having a wealth per student that is equal to or less than the equalized wealth level by not more than $10,000. (d) Notwithstanding Subsections (a), (b), and (c), the commissioner may detach only a portion of a parcel or item of property if: (1) it is not possible to reduce the district's wealth per student to a level that is equal to or less than the equalized wealth level under this subchapter unless some or all of the parcel or item of property is detached and the detachment of the whole parcel or item would result in the district from which it is detached having a wealth per student that is less than the equalized wealth level by more than $10,000; or (2) the commissioner determines that a partial detachment of that parcel or item of property is preferable to the detachment of one or more other parcels or items having a lower taxable value in order to minimize the number of parcels or items of property to be detached consistent with the purposes of this chapter. Added by Acts 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 260, Sec. 1, eff. May 30, 1995. Sec. 41.206. ANNEXATION OF PROPERTY. (a) The commissioner shall annex property detached under Section 41.205 to school districts eligible for annexation in accordance with this section. A school district is eligible for annexation of property to it under this subchapter only if, before any detachments or annexations are made in a year, the district's wealth per student is less than the greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42. (b) Property may be annexed to a school district without regard to whether the property is contiguous to other property in that district. (c) The commissioner shall annex property detached from school districts beginning with the property detached from the school district with the greatest wealth per student before detachment, and continuing with the property detached from each other school district in descending order of the district's wealth per student before detachment. (d) The commissioner shall annex the parcels or items of property detached from a school district to other school districts that are eligible for annexation of property in descending order of the taxable value of each parcel or item according to the following priorities: (1) first, to the eligible school districts assigned to the same county as the school district from which the property is detached whose total adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year does not exceed by more than $0.15 the total tax rate adopted for that year by the school district from which the property is detached; (2) second, to the eligible school districts served by the same regional education service center as the district from which the property is detached whose total adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year does not exceed by more than $0.10 the total tax rate adopted for that year by the school district from which the property is detached; and (3) third, to other eligible school districts whose total adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year does not exceed by more than $0.05 the total tax rate adopted for that year by the school district from which the property is detached. (e) If the districts identified by Subsection (d) for a school district are insufficient to annex all the property detached from the school district, the commissioner shall increase, for purposes of this section, all the maximum difference in tax rates allowed under Subsection (d) in increments of $0.01 until the districts are identified that are sufficient to annex all the property detached from the district. (f) If only one school district is eligible to annex property detached from a school district within a priority group established by Subsections (d) and (e), the commissioner shall annex property to that district until it reaches a wealth per student equal as nearly as possible to the greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42, by annexing whole parcels or items of property. Any remaining detached property shall be annexed to eligible school districts in the next priority group as provided by this section. (g) If more than one school district is eligible to annex property detached from a school district within a priority group established by Subsections (d) and (e), the commissioner shall first annex property to the district within the priority group to which could be annexed the most taxable value of property without increasing its wealth per student above the greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42, until that district reaches a wealth per student equal as nearly as possible to the greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42, by annexing whole parcels or items of property. Then any additional detached property shall be annexed in the same manner to other eligible school districts in the same priority group in descending order of capacity to receive taxable value of annexed property without increasing the district's wealth per student above the greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42. If every school district in a priority group reaches a wealth per student equal to the greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42, as nearly as possible, the remaining detached property shall be annexed to school districts in the next priority group in the manner provided by this section. (h) For purposes of this section, a portion of a parcel or item of property detached in that subdivided form from a school district is treated as a whole parcel or item of property. (i) The commissioner may order the annexation of a portion of a parcel or item of property, including a portion of property treated as a whole parcel or item under Subsection (h), if: (1) the annexation of the whole parcel or item would result in the district eligible to receive it in the appropriate priority order provided by this section having a wealth per student greater than $10,000 more than the greatest level for which funds are provided under Subchapter F, Chapter 42; or (2) the commissioner determines that annexation of portions of the parcel or item would reduce disparities in district wealth per student more efficiently than would be possible if the parcel or item were annexed as a whole. (j) The commissioner may modify the priorities established by this section as the commissioner considers reasonable to minimize or reduce the number of school districts to which the property detached from a school district is annexed, to minimize or reduce the geographic dispersal of property in a school district, to minimize or reduce disparities in school district wealth per student that would otherwise result, or to minimize or reduce any administrative burden or expense. (k) For purposes of this section, a school district is assigned to a county if the school district is assigned to that county in the 1992-1993 Texas School Directory published by the Central Education Agency.

(b) If an order for the detachment or annexation of a portion of a parcel or item of property does not describe the specific area of the parcel or item to be detached or annexed, the commissioner, as soon as practicable after issuing the order, shall determine the specific area to be detached or annexed and shall certify that determination to the appraisal district for the county in which the property is located. (c) If portions of a parcel or item of property are located in two or more school districts as the result of a detachment or annexation, the parcel or item shall be appraised for taxation as a unit, and the commissioner shall determine the portion of the taxable value of the property that is located in each of those school districts based on the square footage of the property, or any other reasonable method adopted by the commissioner.
