Dr. Judith Stacey « Respect My Research
Professor of Sociology , New York University

In 2001, Dr. Judith Stacey and a colleague, Dr. Timothy Biblarz, authored an analysis of 21 studies of lesbian and gay families. In that article, Stacey and Biblarz noted preliminary evidence of some “modest and interesting” differences between children raised by heterosexual parents and children raised by lesbian and gay parents, but they affirmed that “parental sexual orientation has no measurable effect on the quality of parent-child relationships or on children’s mental health or adjustment.”

The GLBT organization SoulForce released a video on YouTube of Dr. Stacey who claims that James Dobson’s Focus on the Family and other anti-equality groups have misrepresented her research on lesbian and gay parenting.

In her video statement, Stacey calls Focus on the Family’s use of her work “a complete distortion” and clarifies that “there is absolutely nothing in the article we wrote, nor in any of the research that has yet been published, that would warrant any form of discrimination against parents on the basis of sexual orientation.” Her comments are excerpted from a 2005 Soulforce video titled Dear Dr. Dobson: An Open Video Letter to Focus on the Family.
