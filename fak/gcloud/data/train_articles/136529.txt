Candy Nations Provides A Sweet Treat For Your Eyes
By: Caroline De Tino

Surrounding the World Trade Center for a limited time are sculptures with a sweet twist.

Now through February 28, stop by and marvel at Candy Nations, a one-of-a-kind, candy shaped sculpture exhibit. Specially created by French artist Laurence Jenkell, Candy Nations has been featured in over 25 countries, and has had over 80 pieces displayed at the Port Authority Bus Terminal for the first time ever earlier this year.

Gather up friends or family and play a game of find the flag by searching for the all candy shaped flags scattered throughout the World Trade Center campus. Each candy flag features countries in the G20 summit.

Four additional sculptures will also be on display at the Oculus, Oculus Plaza, West Plaza, Liberty Park, West Concourse, and 2 World Trade Center lobby, 4 World Trade Center lobby, and the Millenium Hilton New York Downtown .
