America's Turkey Farmers

Over the last 30 years, the turkey industry has gone from mainly marketing a single-product consumed at holidays or special occasions, to offering a diverse array of food choices ranging from sausages to burgers, deli meats and more. Increasingly, consumers are including turkey in their daily diets because of its health benefits, versatility and great taste.



Today, the turkey industry produces more than 5.8 billion lbs. of turkey products annually.
