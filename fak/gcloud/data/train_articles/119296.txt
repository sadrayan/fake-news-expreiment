Donald Trump took time from his non-stop, jam-packed schedule while in Israel to visit a teenage cancer patient who desperately wanted to meet the American President while he was visiting the Middle East.

As the Gateway Pundit notes, the story was completely ignored by the American media, which was too busy reporting on phony Trump-Russia conspiracy theories to notice.

Emilee Inbar is a 14-year old girl who’s been battling cancer for half of her life at the Rachashei Lev center for pediatric cancer. She also happens to be a big-fan of President Trump.

The director of the center reached out to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who arranged the meeting during the President’s first overseas trip.

President Trump took a break from his 27-hour whirlwind tour of Israel to meet Emilee.

The two spoke about her health, education, and even joked about the pressures of the presidency. The delighted teen then offered the President a blessing and thanked him for the meeting. Before leaving, Emilee gave the President a hand-written letter, saying the next time they meet will be in the White House.

President Trump was obviously touched by the teen’s well wishes, and hoped for her full recovery.
