Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010
Expand all Collapse all

The United States has an enormous firearm problem compared with other high-income countries, with higher rates of homicide and firearm-related suicide. Compared with 2003 estimates, the US firearm death rate remains unchanged while firearm death rates in other countries decreased. Thus, the already high relative rates of firearm homicide, firearm suicide, and unintentional firearm death in the United States compared with other high-income countries increased between 2003 and 2010.

US homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher. For 15- to 24-year-olds, the gun homicide rate in the United States was 49.0 times higher. Firearm-related suicide rates were 8.0 times higher in the United States, but the overall suicide rates were average. Unintentional firearm deaths were 6.2 times higher in the United States. The overall firearm death rate in the United States from all causes was 10.0 times higher. Ninety percent of women, 91% of children aged 0 to 14 years, 92% of youth aged 15 to 24 years, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States.

We examined 2010 mortality data obtained from the World Health Organization for populous, high-income countries (n = 23). Death rates per 100,000 population were calculated for each country and for the aggregation of all non-US countries overall and by age and sex. Tests of significance were performed using Poisson and negative binomial regressions.

Violent death is a serious problem in the United States. Previous research showing US rates of violent death compared with other high-income countries used data that are more than a decade old.

Violent death is a serious public health problem in the United States. Among 15- to 24-year-olds, homicide is the second leading cause of death and suicide is the third leading cause; for 25- to 34-year-olds, suicide is the second leading cause and homicide is the third leading cause of fatality, following unintentional injuries for both groups.1x1WISQARS.

The United States is known to have higher levels of violent death, particularly homicide, compared with other developed nations. Although the United States does not appear to have higher rates of nonlethal crime, the rates of lethal violence and especially gun violence are much higher than in other high-income countries.2x2Zimring, F.E. and Hawkins, G.

Approximately 2 decades ago, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used data from the early 1990s to compare the United States with other high-income countries in terms of violent death (ie, suicide, homicide, firearm accidents) for children aged 5 to 14 years.4x4Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Rates of homicide, suicide and firearm-related death among children: twenty-six industrialized countries. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ; 46: 101–105

PubMed | Google ScholarSee all References In a previous article, we updated and expanded that comparison to examine all age groups and both sexes using 2003 data. These 2003 data are now more than 12 years old. In this article, we again update the data plus we provide country-level data for each high-income nation and contrast the US levels of lethal violence for whites, who traditionally have lower homicide rates than nonwhites in the United States, with all citizens (ie, whites and nonwhites) of other high-income nations.

Google ScholarSee all References Data were limited to 2010, the most recent year that had complete data for the greatest number of countries. Of the 27 high-income OECD countries that provided mortality to the World Health Organization (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom [England and Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland], and the United States], Iceland and Luxembourg were excluded for having very small populations. Mortality data were categorized into 6 mutually exclusive categories using the ICD-10 classification system. Countries were included if they reported their mortality data using detailed 3- or 4-character ICD-10 codes. These categories were defined as firearm-related homicide (X93, X94, X95, U01.4), firearm-related suicide (X72, X73, X74), non–firearm-related homicide (X85, X86, X87, X88, X89, X90, X91, X92, X96, X97, X98, X99, Y00, Y01, Y02, Y03, Y04, Y05, Y06, Y07, Y08, Y09, U01.0, U01.2, U01.3, U01.5, U01.6, U01.7, U01.8, U01.9, U02), non–firearm-related suicide (X60, X61, X62, X63, X64, X65, X66, X67, X68, X69, X70, X71, X75, X76, X77, X79, X80, X81, X82, X83, X84, Y87.0, U03), unintentional firearm death (W32, W33, W34), or firearm death of undetermined cause (Y22, Y23, Y24). Cause of death data included both 3- and 4-character ICD-10 codes (eg, X93 included both X93 and X930-X939) except where the 4-character code was specified as the being important to the definition (ie, Y87.0, Y87.1, U01.0-U01.3, U01.5-U01.9). All countries used detailed ICD-10 character codes except Korea, which provided only 3-character ICD-10 codes. Thus, 133 deaths were excluded using “Y87” because it was not possible to determine if those were Y87.0 (non-firearm-related suicide), Y87.1 (non-firearm-related homicide), or Y87.2-Y87.9, which were neither of these. Greece and Switzerland were excluded for not using detailed 3- or 4-character ICD-10 codes, because their method of reporting could not be aggregated with data from the other 23 countries. Thus, the final list of populous, high-income OECD countries included in this analysis included Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom (England and Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland), and the United States.

Death rates per 100,000 population were calculated for the United States, for each individual country, and for the aggregation of all non-US countries, by age and sex categories and overall. Overall numbers include small numbers of deaths attributed to those with an unknown age, although an “unknown” column is not presented in the tables because of the numbers being so small. Ratios were calculated comparing the United States with all non-US countries. Tests of significance were performed using Poisson and negative binomial regression techniques to assess the statistical significance of fatalities in the United States versus non-US countries. Negative binomial models were used if the dispersion parameter showed that the data were overdispersed, whereas Poisson models were used when the data were not overdispersed. All analyses were performed using Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Wash) and Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex).7x7StataCorp.

Some two thirds of these were firearm homicides, a rate of 3.6 per 100,000. Firearm homicides were especially high for the 15- to 24-year age group, at a rate of 8.2 per 100,000, and the 25- to 34-year age group, at a rate of 8.9 per 100,000. The rate of suicide (12.4/100,000) was twice as high as the homicide rate, and firearm suicides (6.3/100,000) were 75% higher than firearm homicides (3.6/100,000). Firearm suicide rates increased with age; however, nonfirearm and total suicide rates peaked among those aged 35 to 64 years and decreased among those aged ≥65 years. Men had more than twice the rate of violent death compared with women and more than 6 times the rate of death from firearms. There were more than 31,000 firearm deaths in 2010, or more than 86 firearm-related deaths per day (an average of 74 men and 12 women) (Table 1Table 1).

The 25- to 34-year-olds and 35- to 64-year-olds had slightly higher homicide rates than the 15- to 24-year-olds. The total suicide rate among all age groups was 15.0 per 100,000, and the firearm suicide rate was 0.8 per 100,000. The rates of firearm suicide, nonfirearm suicide, and total suicide increased with age. Unintentional and undetermined firearm death rates were extremely low. There were more than 6600 firearm deaths in all 22 high-income countries included in these data in 2010, or approximately 18 per day (with 93% of the victims being men) (Table 2Table 2).

However, the total suicide rate in the United States was ninth highest among all 23 high-income OECD countries. The highest total suicide rate was found in Korea. Jump to Section Materials and Methods Data Source Study Population Statistical Analysis Results United States Other High-income Countries US Comparisons with Other High-income Countries US Comparisons with Specific Countries White US Mortality Comparisons with Everyone in Other High-income Countries Discussion Study Strengths and Limitations Conclusions References White US Mortality Comparisons with Everyone in Other High-income Countries Nonwhite homicide rates in the United States are far higher than white homicide victimization rates. Yet, even US whites have rates of homicide victimization far in excess of all people (including both whites and nonwhites) in other high-income countries. For example, the white firearm homicide rate in the United States was more than 13 times higher than rates for all races in the other countries, and the white overall homicide rate was more than 4 times higher (not shown). Overall white firearm death rates (including firearm suicide, firearm homicide, and unintentional firearm deaths) in the United States were 9.0 times higher than the overall firearm death rates in the other high-income countries. The black overall firearm death rate in the United States was 16.6 times higher than the overall firearm death rate in these other countries (not shown).
