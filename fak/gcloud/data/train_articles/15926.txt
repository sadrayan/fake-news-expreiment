"Selby, Gardner (CMG-Austin)":

Professor Caldwell:

Good morning from Austin.

I write seeking your help with some urgency because we're trying to

check a claim that Bernie Sanders admits he's a Democratic socialist

and the Nazis were Democratic socialists.

I would welcome your guidance and commentary for our story on if these

references hold up, factually speaking.

Here is the tweet brought to our attention this

morning.<https://twitter.com/JasonVillalba/status/654167151645884417

I am at the phone number below or would be happy to hear back by email.

Wow.

Utterly wrong.

The Social Democrats were a party that helped to found the Weimar Republic, Germany's first democracy. They were banned when the National Socialists came to power in 1933. The Social Democrats stood for democracy and "socialism"--the latter term vague, and referring to anything from workers' rights to subsidized housing to regulation of industries to nationalization of industries. In other words, they supported first and foremost democratization of German politics, in order for the people to reach social goals through democratic means.

The National Socialists were an anti-democratic party. They opposed political democracy, they rejected political pluralism, they opposed universal and equal voting rights. They were ultra conservative (nationalist, racist, anti-Marxist, anti-Jewish, anti-feminist, and so on). They viewed democrats, Social Democrats, Communists, as well as Jews and other ethnic groups, as their enemies.

I'm happy to talk with you more about this on the telephone. 713 869 9852, will be here for the next few hours. Either this person is utterly ignorant of history or he is knowingly lying.
