In a 2013 Interview, Trump Said ‘I Do Have a Relationship’ With Vladimir Putin
Donald Trump said this week he’s never spoken to Vladimir Putin and knows nothing about him. But in 2013, he was singing a far different tune.

In an interview three years ago, MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts asked him, “Do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin? A conversational relationship or anything that you feel you have sway or influence over his government?”

Trump declared, “I do have a relationship and I can tell you that he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today He’s probably very interested in what you and I am saying today, and I’m sure he’s going to be seeing it in some form.”

So was Trump misleading this week by denying he knows anything about Putin, or was he exaggerating that supposed “relationship” between him three years ago?

Either way, it makes this relevant again:

Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow – if so, will he become my new best friend? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2013
