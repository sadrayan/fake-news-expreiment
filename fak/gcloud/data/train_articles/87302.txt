Florida ranks 4th, again, for Advanced Placement success
At Lake Nona High School in Orlando, the principles class was offered last year and 89 percent of those who took it passed the exam, better than the national average. This year, Lake Nona is offering AP computer science A for the first time, with 34 students enrolled, all but one having taken the principles class first, said Jasara Hines, the schoolâ€™s AP computer science teacher.
