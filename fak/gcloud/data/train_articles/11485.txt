Research Interests

Daniel Wirlsâ€™ research interests range across American politics, institutions, public policy, and political history. He has published work on the founding period and the early Senate, antebellum representation in the Senate and House, the Seventeenth Amendment, Cold War and post-Cold War military policy, and contemporary political transformations. His most recent books are The Federalist Papers and Institutional Power in American Political Development (Palgrave MacMillan, 2015) and Irrational Security: The Politics of Defense from Reagan to Obama (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010). He is currently working on an analysis of national security as a policy arena and a critique of the Senate, with an emphasis on the nature and consequences of Senate representation and procedures.
