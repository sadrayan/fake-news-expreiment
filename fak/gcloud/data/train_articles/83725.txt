U.S. House votes unanimously to eliminate redundant auto sales paperwork
DETROIT, MI -- The U.S. House on Wednesday unanimously passed a bill introduced by a Metro Detroit representative seeking to eliminate redundant paperwork required in auto sales.

U.S. Reps. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) and Bob Latta (R-OH) co-authored the bill in a bi-partisan effort to eliminate a provision in the Clean Air Act that requires auto dealers to provide buyers documentation showing a vehicle complies with environmental standards that are already regulated at factories.

“I’m proud to offer a common-sense solution to cut red tape for Michigan auto dealers and consumers," Peters said in a statement after the passage, "and I’m glad that Congress was able to put aside politics to deliver for Michigan small businesses and our middle class families. Auto dealers and consumers should be able to focus on business not additional paperwork.”

The bill will now head to the Senate, where opposition is unlikely.



The National Automobile Dealers Association had been pushing for legislation to eliminate the burden of inspections and paperwork that are already required at the factory level before cars enter the marketplace.
