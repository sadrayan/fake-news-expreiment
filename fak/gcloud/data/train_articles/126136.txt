FACT CHECK: Mother Sues Tampon Company for ‘Stealing' Daughter's Virginity
On 27 March 2016, the web site World News Daily Report published an article reporting that an Idaho woman was suing the Kotex company for $1.4 million dollars because, she claimed, one of her daughters lost her virginity while using a tampon:

The family’s attorney claims the product’s packaging did not issue any warning about the possibility of losing one’s own virginity while using the product.

“Why is there no warning that a women’s hymen can be broken when the tampon is inserted into the vaginal region? This is the question we ask” explained Ben Ali Mufta, the family attorney. “The breaking of the hymen and resulting loss of virginity of my client’s daughter will have dire consequences for this young girl for the rest of her life,” he told local reporters. “This is a tragedy that could have been easily prevented had the company taken its responsibilities,” he acknowledged yesterday.

Fatima Ushban, mother of five and recently immigrated from Bangladesh, believes the company has tarnished her young daughter’s body.

“Who will want of my daughter now? Her body has been defiled, she is dirty!” she told local reporters in tears. “What will I do with her? Who will want to marry her now?” she asks about her 11-year-old daughter, visibly distraught by the whole affair.
