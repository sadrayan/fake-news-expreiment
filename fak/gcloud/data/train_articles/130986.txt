Hawaii native parked shooter's car - Honolulu, Hawaii news, sports & weather - KITV Channel 4
A Kamehameha graduate working as a valet at the Mandalay Bay Resort said he parked the shooter's car on Saturday. The gunman, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, checked his car into the hotel on Saturday morning.

Valet Chad Nishimura, who is from Mililani, said he spoke briefly with Paddock.

"Just in shock, really. It's scary to know that I was close to someone that was that dangerous. I would've never thought. He seemed like a normal guy. When he came in, nothing too weird about him. He didn't have any crazy bags with him that I can remember. We are a convention hotel so we have a bunch of people that have boxes and multiple carts worth of stuff. There's nothing weird that I can remember," Nishimura said.

Nishimura and hundreds of employees at Mandalay Bay are cooperating with FBI agents as investigations continue.

A number of people from Hawaii were at Sunday night's concert or nearby. Social media helped connect family and friends worried about their loved ones.

Tara Spangler, originally from Pa'ia Maui, was working close to the concert venue, at the Hooter's Casino.

She posted on her Facebook page that she was safe but said shooting victims fleeing the concert, swarmed into the casino.

"You can just see towels of blood everywhere and people walking past and they have like blood spots on their shirts and even on their face. I remember asking a girl, 'Hey are you OK?' Because she was just covered in blood and she said, 'Yeah, (she was shaking) and said this is not my blood,'" Spangler said.

Spangler said they could hear bullets firing in the distance. Fearing for her own life, she hid inside a closet.
