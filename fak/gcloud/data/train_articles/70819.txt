GREENWALD: GOVERNOR'S PLAN AGAIN BENEFITS WEALTHY OVER MIDDLE-CLASS



(TRENTON) - Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) released the following statement Tuesday on Gov. Chris Christie's State of the State address:



"Let's be clear about this - Gov. Christie's income tax plan may sound nice, but it would save a family earning $50,000 per year just $80.50 and a family earning $100,000 per year just $275, all while a millionaires get a $7,265.75 tax break.

"Under this tax cut, middle-class families don't save enough for a week's worth of groceries, while millionaires save enough to go on an exotic vacation.

"The governor is once again missing the point. He continues to focus on tax breaks for the rich while middle-class families struggle with the highest property taxes in the nation. If the governor wants to cut a tax, let's focus on finding a way to chop property taxes by 10 percent.

"Still, we will review any plan the governor puts forth, but it must be a plan and not a sound bite. Does he plan to take the money from schools to pay for his tax cut? Does he plan to let property taxes increase even more? We need to see a real plan, not political theater.

"Democrats will be focusing on continued way to combat property taxes and restore the property tax relief cut by this governor. He should join us in this effort."
