Florida rises in schools report, but some rankings use old data

FOR THE RECORD - ********** CORRECTION OR CLARIFICATION PUBLISHED SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 2010 ********** * An article in Thursday's Local & Business section left the impression that Florida's public schools jumped from 31st place to eighth place in an Education Week ranking between 2007 and 2010. However, Education Week did not give states an overall ranking in its annual "Quality Counts" report in 2007, as it did this year. The state Department of Education has been comparing Florida's 2007 "Quality Counts" rankings with reports from subsequent years. But the 2010 and 2007 reports use different variables to measure education quality and, therefore, are not comparable. Florida's overall No.8 ranking in this year's report is accurate. ********************************************************************************

The news surprised some education officials and parents -- in some cases even more so than when the publication announced last year that Florida had made it into the nation's top 10.

Florida public schools rank eighth in the nation -- a huge leap from 31st just three years ago -- in Education Week magazine's annual "Quality Counts" report released today.

Each year, Education Week puts together a state-by-state report card rating public-education systems in such areas as student achievement, academic standards, teachers and financing. The report uses available national data as recent as 2009 and as far back as 2000.

Overall, Florida earned a B-minus.

The Sunshine State took the No. 7 spot in student achievement. That rating recognized that test scores have improved in Florida and that the state is closing the achievement gap between impoverished children and their wealthier peers.

The state did a little better in the way it funds schools, getting credit for its equal distribution of money to school districts.

But the report used data in this category only up to 2007. That means it did not cover the deep funding cuts that came later.

Florida's public schools, on average, started the 2009-10 school year with $418 less per child than they had at the start of the 2007-08 year.

State Sen. Stephen Wise, a Jacksonville Republican who is chairman of the Senate education appropriations committee, was "ecstatic" after hearing about Florida's overall grade.

The report showed Florida made significant gains in student achievement while also spending about $1,000 less per child than the national average.

"It begs the question -- why are they suing us?" Wise said, referring to a well-publicized lawsuit that a group of parents and attorneys filed a few months ago, saying the state doesn't adequately fund public schools or provide a quality education.

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit either declined comment or couldn't be reached for comment.

Wise said he would like to improve school funding, however. Although Florida's overall grade was a B-minus, Education Week gave it a C-minus in finance.

"Judging strictly at face value, Florida is in very good shape," said Amy Hightower, director of Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, the Maryland-based nonprofit group that compiled the massive report.
