BREAKING: Dan Rather Ends Retirement, Announces Historic Project to Topple Trump
Respected news icon Dan Rather launched a Facebook page to counter the lies and “alternative facts” from Donald Trump. As with so many of us, he had enough of the garbage from Trump and the news media.

The Facebook page, “News and Guts,” will report honest, hard-hitting news. The media needs to follow Rather’s lead and begin telling the truth and not repeating the lies from the Trump Administration.

In just a few weeks, the page has over 350 thousand followers. These are people who can no longer take the reporting of lies and “alternate facts” as news.

Rather wants the page to be “a little more free-wheeling” than his personal page. It encourages a two-way street of thoughts and articles that followers want to see covered.

This truthful journalism is welcome by all. With Trump wanting to control what the media reports, and many going along with him, “News and Guts” will be a source for the truth.

For sure, it will not be one of Trump’s selected news sources. And it will not cower under Trump’s threats.

There are many warnings from journalistic professionals on Trump’s handling of the media. And some of his closest advisers want him to close access to those who criticize him.

The First Amendment of the Constitution protects freedom of the press. Trump’s actions to control the media are unconstitutional, contrary to the oath of office that he took, and criminal.

There are other media outlets who will sometimes fairly report the news. Both The New York Times and CNN called Trump a liar about the size of his inaugural crowds and the absurd claim that he lost the popular vote because of voter fraud.

The media must stand up to Trump and accurately report the news. Those who choose to confirm the lies of Donald Trump can be punished by not supporting advertisers and turning them off. Also, letters to advertisers do wonders.
