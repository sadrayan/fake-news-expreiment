93 marijuana dispensaries in Vancouver identified by CBC
About 40 per cent of Vancouver's marijuana businesses are less than 300 metres away from city schools and community centres — putting them in violation of the city's proposed regulation on pot dispensaries.

The city released its list of 84 marijuana-related businesses operating within Vancouver on Friday, but admitted the list may not be complete.

The city initially denied a request to provide a comprehensive list, so last week CBC compiled one of its own. The disclosure comes as Vancouver announces it is looking at new rules to regulate the booming retail marijuana business, including a $30,000 licensing fee to help recover the cost of enforcement.

"In the last two years, the city has seen a rapid growth rate of 100 per cent per year in marijuana-related businesses ... [going] from 60 to 80 in the last four months alone," the city said in a statement.

While medical marijuana shops have become commonplace in Vancouver in recent years, there is little in the way of regulations to control them, the statement said.

The city is only notified of dispensary locations "through the business improvement associations, enquiries or complaints from residents and the general public (311) and sometimes through enquiries into licensing from operators," said the city's communications manager Tobin Postma in an email to CBC.

Marijuana-related businesses

Friday's release listed 84 dispensaries; CBC News identified a total of 93 dispensaries — including 91 that are in operation and another two that are on the brink of opening. The city's proposed regulations require marijuana businesses to be at least 300 metres from schools, community centres, neighbourhood houses and other marijuana-related businesses.
