Guadagno says Christie sticks to principles, but willing to 'compromise'
CARLSTADT — Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno told supporters this evening that Gov. Chris Christie has stuck to his principles of smaller government and less taxes while still finding room for “compromise.”

“That’s what this governor has been doing in the state of New Jersey for the last four years and it’s beginning to work — he’s had four balanced budgets,” Guadagno told Republicans , not mentioning that the constitution requires balanced budgets. “He has not increased the taxes on anyone. In fact, he vetoed attempts by the Democrats to raise taxes on anyone. You can clap for that.”

Guadagno , speaking at a legislative office, was filling in for Christie, who was scheduled to greet the supporters but canceled at the last minute.

She attacked state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), Christie’s opponent in next month’s gubernatorial election, saying the legislator helped former Gov. Jon Corzine develop is budgets was responsible for a massive deficit he left behind.

The lieutenant governor also claimed Christie himself has changed perceptions of the Garden State.

“When we started in 2009, you know people used to laugh about New Jersey,” she said. “They used to say ‘Snooki’ and the ‘Sopranos.’ Now, go anywhere in the country. Talk to businesses anywhere in the country — and I do that, it’s not job — hundreds of businesses, and you say to them, ‘what do you think about New Jersey now?’ And they will say, ‘New Jersey? I love that governor.’”
