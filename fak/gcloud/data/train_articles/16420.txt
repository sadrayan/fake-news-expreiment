AUSTIN â€“ The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) today arrested an Ellis County woman at the Capitol Complex on charges of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest. The charges stem from an incident that occurred at the John F. Reagan Building, during a House State Affairs Committee meeting.

Troopers arrested Amy Hedtke, 42, of Waxahachie, after she ignored repeated requests by the House Sergeant-at-Arms to stop recording/live video streaming during the meeting. Signs posted in the meeting room prohibit such action without proper media credentials. DPS Troopers were called in and also requested suspect to stop recording/live streaming and to leave the committee room.

After repeated requests from Troopers, Hedtke was placed under arrest and taken in custody without incident and booked into the Travis County Jail on the two Class B misdemeanor charges.
