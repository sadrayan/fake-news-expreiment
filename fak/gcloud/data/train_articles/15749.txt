Austin ISD is the source of that info. I've attached the Approps testimony from AISD CFO Nicole Conley as an example: To put it in perspective, AISD could lower its tax rate by 35 cents if it were not for the $406 million we must pay in recapture this year. For our average homeowner, that would amount to about $1,400 in lower taxes per year.
