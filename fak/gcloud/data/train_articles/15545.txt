Since the case is still not settled I can't offer any details beyond what is in my report and testimony.

Dr. Ansolabehere:

Hello again.

I gather from the US district judge’s ruling here that your analysis fueled her conclusion that about 608,000 registered Texas voters lack one of the photo ID’s required by the 2011 state law to vote at the polls.

I suspect you elaborated in testimony and in a report to the court on how you got to that figure. Could you kindly point out your testimony or report or both?

I am fact-checking this recent claim: “Texas has 600,000 registered voters who don’t have the kind of photo ID needed to vote.”

Other questions:

--Given the passage of time, would this figure still hold? Why or why not?

--Other thoughts/elaboration for our story?

I am hoping to lay all this out for our readers this week. THANKS.
