Those were indeed good days for the federal New Democrats. It was 1987. An election was in the air. The Conservative government suddenly appeared less than invincible. And everything seemed to be going NDP leader Ed Broadbent's way.

Of course the major breakthrough wasn't to be. One year later, the NDP had gained 11 seats, but was stuck in third place.That sense of optimism in the ranks may have returned today however, with the NDP -- now the Official Opposition -- surging to first place in at least one national poll.

And the experience of 1987 stands as a hint of what might be possible... as well as a cautionary tale.

The NDP's leader Tom Mulcair was in Toronto yesterday to speak to the Economic Club of Canada, and he joined us in studio.



"The federal dept of finances' own reports show, that NDP governments are the best at balancing the books when in office. OK, there was one exception -- but he turned out to be a Liberal."
