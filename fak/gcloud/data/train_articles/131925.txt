Uncle Sam's Misguided Children
This was their response: "Logistically, we could not add a flag without removing a flag from the poles outside our VA. Rather than single out one military branch's flag to be temporarily replaced with the LGBT flag, we chose to remove all of them for o

ne day in order to show our dedication to serving all Veterans equally." That is the dumbest bunch of hogwash I have ever heard!!! By removing the service flags of ALL the branches that represent ALL the veterans and replacing it with any flag that singles out one particular group of humans who are part of the veterans then you have actually excluded the rest....if you want to fly one flag to show you represent all veterans EQUALLY then just fly the good ol' Stars and Stripes. It is the only flag that promotes everyone equally. Otherwise, just stick to displaying all the service branch flags and forget about singling out specific groups within the vet community.
