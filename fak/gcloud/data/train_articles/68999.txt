A Letter from Governor Tony Evers



I've been an educator my entire adult life.



Some of the most meaningful moments in my life happened in the classroom. I met my wife, Kathy, in Mrs. Potter's kindergarten class in my hometown of Plymouth, Wisconsin. My first job was teaching science in Baraboo. Before becoming state superintendent, I was a high school principal in Tomah, and I ran school districts in Oakfield and Verona. As state superintendent, I worked to ensure every child in Wisconsin can get a world class education by creating a public school system that is fair for all.



I'm not only an educator – I'm also a parent. My three kids attended public schools in communities around the state. No matter where the Evers family ended up, we were welcomed by the community. That culture of acceptance is part of what makes Wisconsin special.



I believe that we are stronger when we look out for each other. I was elected governor and as state superintendent three times by a coalition of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans because I'm honest, I work hard, and I know how to treat folks on the other side of the aisle with respect without sacrificing our Wisconsin values.



I've worked across party lines to get things done for our kids, and now as governor, I am working to build an economy that works for everyone, healthier communities, support for our kids and our schools, and better roads and infrastructure. He believes that every single person in our state deserves an equal opportunity to get ahead and that we must work together to change the direction of our state for the better.

My focus is on solving problems, period. I am proud to serve the people of Wisconsin with the humble appreciation that the will of the people is the law of the land.
