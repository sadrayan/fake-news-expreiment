Woman ‘pregnant’ with 12 baby squid
A WOMAN became “pregnant” with 12 baby squid after eating calamari.

The shocked 63-year-old felt a sharp pain in her mouth as she bit into a

portion of whole cooked squid.

She immediately spat out the sea creature — along with its internal organs —

but could still feel “small, squirming organisms” in her mouth.

Doctors in South Korea examined the woman and found 12 squid spermatophores

attached to her tongue, cheek and gums.

A “spermatophore” is a sac of semen that implants itself in the female squid

before a mechanism shoots out sperm and fertilises her eggs.

The case was revealed in a paper by the National Centre for Biotechnology

Information in Maryland, US.

The paper says: “Twelve small, white organisms stuck in the tongue, cheek and

gums were removed. The foreign bodies were identified as squid

spermatophores.”

A similar case was reported last year after a woman ate raw seafood in Japan,

but British diners are unlikely to be hit because chefs in the West remove

internal organs when preparing squid.
