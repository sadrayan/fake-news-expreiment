First TV Spot of Fall Campaign-- Texas: Open for Business
Sun, 09/12/2010 - 1:29pm — wfranklin

Our campaign launched a new television spot today called “Open for Business.”





The spot highlights the economic success Texas is experiencing because of the leadership and pro-growth policies put into place by Governor Rick Perry.

The keys to success? Don't spend all the money. Keep taxes low. Keep regulations fair and predictable. Tort reform to prevent frivolous and junk lawsuits. Fund an accountable education system. Then get out of the way and let entrepreneurs and the private sector do what the private sector does best-- create jobs. Since 2005, Texas has created far more private-sector jobs than all over states combined.

As the Governor continues traveling the state, bringing his positive message directly to Texans, the momentum and excitement of our campaign continues to get stronger every day.
