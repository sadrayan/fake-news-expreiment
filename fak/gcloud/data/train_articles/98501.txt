Mr. Speaker, American troops are not allowed to paint targets for air strikes. They are not allowed to accompany Iraqi forces to the front lines. This is exactly what the Prime Minister promised would be the case for Canadian soldiers, and yet Canadian special forces are indeed being put on the front lines.

Brigadier General Rouleau said that Canadians were going to the “the forward-most Iraqi fighting positions”. That is why they call it “the front”.

It is a simple question. When did the Prime Minister decide to send Canadian troops into combat?
