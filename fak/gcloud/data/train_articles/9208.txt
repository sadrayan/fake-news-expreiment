For those down in the dumps over Donald Trump’s victory in the US election, watching the new president on the receiving end of a Stone Cold Stunner may cheer you up.

To highlight how truly bizarre Trump’s victory over Hilary Clinton is, the 70-year-old has now become the first president to headline a match at Wrestlemania.

In 2007, Trump was involved in a ‘Battle of the Billionaires’ match against WWE owner Vince McMahon at Wrestlemania 23 where the loser was forced to have his head shaved in the ring.

Predictably, Trump managed to preserve his blond locks as the wrestler he represented, Bobby Lashley, beat Umaga, who was in McMahon’s corner.

After the match ended, the new US president went on to help shave McMahon’s head in front of the 80,000 strong crowd in Detriot.

But the best moment of the evening was saved until last as Austin delivered his trademark Stunner on Trump and left him on the floor as he left the ring with a can of beer in his hand.
