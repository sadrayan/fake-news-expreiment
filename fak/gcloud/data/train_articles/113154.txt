Nissan Responds to Nation's Tragedy



All of us at Nissan are deeply affected by the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone impacted by this tragedy and the events that have followed.



Out of emergencies such as this, heroes arise and come forward. We express our deepest gratitude to all personnel and to the tens of thousands of volunteers working to heal a nation.



Nissan employees throughout the country are assisting in these efforts. We are especially proud of the Nissan employees and family members who are serving in the military or volunteer emergency services or otherwise supporting the recovery.



Please join Nissan in support of their tireless efforts and sacrifice!
