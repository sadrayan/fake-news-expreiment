ATM security tips

Because most ATMs give out cash and many accept deposits, it makes sense to be alert and aware of your surroundings no matter where or when you use an ATM. Here are some personal safety tips when using an ATM:

When you’re by yourself, avoid using an ATM in out-of-the-way or deserted areas. Use ATMs located inside banks or supermarkets where other people are around. Use ATMs in well-lit, public areas.

Be aware of your surroundings when withdrawing funds. If your notice anything out of the ordinary, come back later or use another ATM.

If it looks like someone has tampered with the ATM equipment, don’t use it. (This could mean that a criminal has attached a “skimmer” to the ATM to steal your financial information.) If a suspicious person offers to help you use the ATM, refuse and leave.

When typing in your pin, cover the keypad so others can’t see.

After completing your transaction, remember to remove your card, cash and any printed documents such as receipts or statements.

Put your money and ATM card away before you leave the ATM. Always avoid showing your cash. Always verify that the amount you withdrew or deposited matches the amount printed on your receipt.

Take your receipts with you so potential criminals will not know how much you withdrew or how much money is in your account.

When using a drive-up ATM, keep your car doors locked and your engine running.
