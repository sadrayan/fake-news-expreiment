Questions linger over whether Syria has declared all chemical weapons
Last month, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed the nerve agent sarin has been used in an attack on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun.

The attack killed more than 100 people and raised serious concerns about the use of chemical weapons in Syria.

Under the mandate of OPCW director-general Ahmet Uzumcu, the organisation was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 for its work eliminating chemical weapons.

Mr Uzumcu discusses the Khan Sheikhoun attack and Syria's chemical weapons capabilities with Beverley O'Connor.
