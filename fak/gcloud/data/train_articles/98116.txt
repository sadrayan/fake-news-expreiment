Robredo To Step Down As VP If None Of The Otso Diretso Makes It To Magic 12?
QUEZON CITY, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Quezon City Bureau) – After all, Leni Robredo has some delicadeza left in her. She is promising to vacate her position as Vice President if none of the Otso Diretso Senatorial candidates makes it to the top 12 in Monday’s Philippine midterm elections.

While this may be wishful thinking on the part of many Filipinos, they are hoping that Robredo will be woman enough to take full responsibility for a possible zero win for the eight Opposition candidates. She has taken on the responsibility of “leading the Opposition,” but a zero win for the Otso would mean a failure of that leadership.

Already, Otso has scored zero in as far as the endorsement by the block-voting Iglesia Ni Cristo is concerned. None in the Opposition slate made it to the INC endorsement. Is this a foreboding of what will happen on May 13?

Stay tuned!
