I spoke with Stephie Garza about our conversation the other day and wouldn't you believe it, she confirmed your suspicion! Stephie is our attendance clerk and lives just a few blocks away on 2nd or 3rd street. She laughed when I asked her your question and says that it is true! We have always been able to have pizza delivered to Sanchez but the same has not been true for the neighborhood. In fact one of our volunteers who also lived in the neighborhood would have her pizza delivered to the school and then take it home : )
