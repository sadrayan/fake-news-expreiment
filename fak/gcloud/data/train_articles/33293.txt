Ivanka Trump says the media is not the enemy of the people. The White House declines to agree.
Washington (CNN) Ivanka Trump said Thursday she does not believe the press is the enemy of the American people, putting her at odds with a view repeatedly expressed by her father, President Donald Trump, and his White House, which declined to take a stand on the issue hours later.

Asked at an Axios event at the Newseum in Washington if she believes "the media is the enemy of the people," Ivanka Trump, a White House senior adviser, replied, "No, I do not."

"I've certainly received my fair share of reporting on me personally that I know not to be fully accurate, so I have some sensitivity around why people have concerns and gripe, especially when they're sort of targeted," she continued. "But no, I do not feel that the media is the enemy of the people."

President Trump, moments before leaving the White House for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Thursday, defended his daughter's remarks.

"They asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the FAKE NEWS, which is a large percentage of the media, that is the enemy of the people!" he wrote on Twitter.
