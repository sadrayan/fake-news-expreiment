Milwaukee Streetcar
Ride for Free For a Year

Expected fare (after initial 12-month free period): $1.00

All rides will be free for the first year thanks to Potawatomi Hotel & Casino! Just hop on and hop off to connect with jobs, entertainment, dining and more!

After the first year of operation, passengers will purchase tickets off-vehicle as there are no fareboxes on board. Fare inspectors will make random checks of all passengers throughout the day to make sure they have valid streetcar passes.
