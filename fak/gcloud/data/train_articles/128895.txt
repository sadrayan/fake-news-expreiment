FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) - The five flag poles that line the entrance sidewalk to the VA Northern Indiana Health Care System at 2121 Lake Ave. typically fly flags of the country's five branches of military: Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard.

On Tuesday, through, those flags were taken down and just one was flown in their place: an LGBT pride flag.

June is celebrated as Pride month around the country.

The sight drew plenty of attention from residents and visitors to the VA. NewsChannel 15 received several questions and comments and photos from viewers.

The VA Northern Indiana Healthcare System issued the following statement:

"Logistically, we could not add a flag without removing a flag from the poles outside our VA. Rather than single out one military branch's flag to be temporarily replaced with the LGBT flag, we chose to remove all of them for one day in order to show our dedication to serving all Veterans equally."

The VA said service flags were put back up before the end of the business day.
