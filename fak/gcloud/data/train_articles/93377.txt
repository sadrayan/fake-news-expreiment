Gov. Charlie Crist usually has a sharp eye when it comes to appearances. But when it came to the extravagant cost of a 12-day trade mission to Europe this summer, the governor looked the other way. The July trip that was expected to cost taxpayers $255,000 wound up with a public price tag of more than $430,000, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports. That covered more than two dozen people who traveled with the governor, including nine bodyguards who spent more than $148,000. In the midst of a state budget crisis, this is too much like business as usual. The governor and Enterprise Florida, the public-private business organization, offer the predictable defenses. Crist's expenses of more than $30,000 were paid with private money, which raises its own questions about possible conflicts. Enterprise Florida says the trip resulted in more than $5-million in sales and lays the foundation for future deals worth $96-million. That's great, but that's not the point. When state unemployment and home foreclosures are rising, taxpayers are particularly sensitive about foreign trips, legislative retreats at resorts and other examples of behavior that suggests politicians don't feel their pain. Spending this kind of money and jetting around Europe with a large entourage always raises eyebrows, but it really sends the wrong message in tough economic times. Crist is well known to be frugal in his public and private life, but unfairly or not voters will remember this junket the next time the governor talks about the need for everyone to tighten their belts.

Hell, hire me, I'm always bragging about Florida, and I'm fine with a big mac.I'm cheap to keep, but my passion for Pinellas is strong!! I drive my friends nuts, everyone that knows me, say I'm addicted to Florida, and I'm prou by Ken Dec 10, 2008 10:06 PM An average Joe, travelling on his own money, could do the same trip for a couple thousand - and why the hell 9 bodyguards? One or two, maybe. by Brian Dec 10, 2008 10:06 PM I'm trying to figure out why he needs nine bodyguards in foreign countries. Did an overseas drug deal go bad or something? by jack Dec 10, 2008 3:59 PM what a clown! next he'll be crying for more taxpayer money. why doesn't concentrate on lowering our taxes and insurance rates like he promised? when you can spend money on taxpayer funded vacations, you shouldn't get one more dime of our money! by John Dec 10, 2008 3:59 PM I'm sorry. Trade mission? Sales? For Florida businesses? Governor on a sales trip? Enterprise Florida? Huh? by Tom Dec 10, 2008 3:59 PM Gift law violation ; plain a simple ! by Lin Dec 10, 2008 3:59 PM I really don't understand.The trip cost double what it was supposed to, & yet someone else paid Crist's expenses & they were only $30,000.What on earth was all that money spent on? by jimmy Dec 10, 2008 3:59 PM This sort of extravagance is run of the mill in politics. Let's all hold our breath and see how long it takes for Times editors to work up a good sweat over Barack's buddies in Illinois being frog marched before Prosecutor Fitzgerald's grand jury.
