NEW VIDEO: Rick Perry ignores $18 billion budget deficit 25 year incumbent focuses on re-election instead of issues

HOUSTON -- A day after Bill White called for gubernatorial term limits, his campaign released a new web video highlighting Perry's approach to the $18 billion budget deficit: ignoring it.

The video is available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZM7XJ7L_XM.

"Perry's served longer than any other governor in Texas history, and he's used that time to nearly double state spending, double state debt and run up an $18 billion budget deficit. He expects another four years? He's helped create the biggest budget crisis in Texas history, but Perry, a typical career politician, wants to hide his record from Texans in order to continue to consolidate his power in Austin and serve special interests," said Katy Bacon, campaign spokesperson.
