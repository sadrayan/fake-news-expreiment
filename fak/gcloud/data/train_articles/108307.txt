Aaron Hernandez Found Not Guilty; Will Return To The New England Patriots For 2015 Season
Bristol County, CT â€“ Aaron Hernandez has reason to celebrate today, as Judge E. Susan Garsh has ruled to drop all current charges against him due to a lack of evidence. Shortly after the decision was made, the NFL expressed that they would be glad to bring Hernandez back, along with Bill Belichick who let it be known that he is welcome to come back as a tight end for the team.

Hernandez will still need to undergo some extensive training due to his muscles tightening up while in prison, but the strength he has built up during his time in lockup may help him as a lineman. Some are worried about his wide receiver capabilities, citing that prisoners can lose a tremendous amount of coordination while being locked in a cell for a long period of time, but it seems that Hernandez still has it in him.

Speculation has already started about Hernandez possibly getting back his original $19.3 million salary for 2015 to 2018. His 2013 and 2014 salaries apparently have no chance of being recouped due to the circumstances which were not covered in his contract. His 2012 signing bonus will likely be made available to him within the next few months.

If Hernandez is received well by the general public, it is expected that Puma will renew their endorsement deal which was ended soon after the murder charge occurred. CytoSport is remaining tight lipped on their intentions, but other sponsors will likely come knocking if things go as well as everyone hopes.

Hernandez is already getting back into shape to be at his best for this next coming season.
