Pixie Skeleton Mystery Reappears in the US
Almost 2 years after The Mystic Menagerie Podcast ran the Cornish Pixie Remains story, it has reemerged in the USA. Like all the great British TV comedies, the original story and images have been recycled for the American audience by a mysterious chap called James Cornan of Wilmington, North Carolina. Other than the location, the story of the Pixie skeleton discovery was copied verbatim and submitted to the 'Pictures in History' Facebook page where it was picked up by the US press. The newspapers didn't have to dig far before they realised it was initially featured on this blog back in 2016 and not only linked the page but also named me as the originator.

I'd personally like to thank James Cornan, The Charlotte Observer, The Asheboro Courier Tribune, The News & Observer, and the Pictures in History Facebook page for giving this story the exposure it deserves. Although the story was a hit in Japan and featured on prime time TV (see below), it failed to gain traction in the UK and Europe, but it appears that it has been a hit in the US. The Facebook article has been seen by 18K people, received 2K comments and been shared 25K times. Assuming a simple reach of 50 people per share, itâ€™s been seen by 1,250,000 people. My blog page also received a staggering 17K views in one day and the Youtube video has be viewed 53K times.

The Pixie bones now reside in a secure facility in Germany where biological specimens that defy conventional science are stored. The mystery of the Pixie bones has never been solved and remains one of this century's greatest mysteries.
