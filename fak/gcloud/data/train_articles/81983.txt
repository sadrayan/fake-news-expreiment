Amtrak crash: Why positive train control is a negative for many railroads
And since then, railroad officials have explained that the fast-approaching 2015 deadline was unworkable. Twice since 2008, the head of the industry trade group Assn. of American Railroads -- whose members include Amtrak and the largest freight railroads -- has taken to The Times' letters page to warn of the difficulties of implementing PTC by December 2015. His letters highlight the regulatory, logistical and financial hurdles that the railroads must overcome to bring PTC online. Other railroad experts over the years have blamed congressional budget cuts for the lack of adequate safety and cited other technologies that could be implemented more quickly.
