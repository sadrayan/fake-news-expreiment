I believe this chart - http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/number-of-poor-uninsured-nonelderly-adults-in-the-aca-coverage-gap/ - is our most up-to-date resource on the coverage gap, though it merely gives you the raw numbers, not any analysis. But it’s current as of February 2015.

Thanks for this. Why does Kaiser stick with CPS for these estimates? Census bureau seems to suggest ACS of late.

I heard back from Rachel Garfield, our best expert on this...

1. The State Health Facts chart I sent yesterday is our most up-to-date data on the coverage gap

http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/number-of-poor-uninsured-nonelderly-adults-in-the-aca-coverage-gap/. ...

2. As for why we use CPS data, Rachel says: “The ACS does not contain all the variables we need to accurately determine eligibility under the ACA. Specifically, it does not have sufficient detail on income sources or family structure.”

I hope that helps.

Got it, thanks. Does the 948,000 figure filter out individuals living here without legal authorization?

Yes – all the folks shown in the chart are people who would be eligible for Medicaid if the state they live in were to expand Medicaid under the ACA. And folks who are in the country illegally are not eligible.
