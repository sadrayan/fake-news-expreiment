Listen: This could spell disaster
As a Representative of Florida’s 22nd district and former mayor of West Palm Beach, I know Rick Scott is no good for Florida.

Spending $100 million attacking Charlie in an attempt to whitewash his failed record isn’t going to work.

If we step up and help Charlie fight back, we will win. Even contributing just $1 to the people’s team will go SUCH a long way.

Can you donate to Charlie’s campaign now?

If Rick Scott wins, the next four years are going to be rough for Floridians.

— He’ll continue to attack a woman’s right to make her own health care choices.

— He’s going to push even harder to deny LGBT Floridians’ right to marry whomever they love.

— We can expect even more cuts to education while continuing to give his ultra-wealthy allies BIG tax cuts.

We can’t afford to not to stand with Charlie. It could mean disaster for our state’s future for generations to come. We can’t let our state suffer four more years of Rick Scott’s disastrous leadership.

Step up and contribute just $1 or more to Charlie’s campaign before it’s too late:
