Why You Probably Won’t Get to Use Your Ticketmaster Vouchers
How do I know if I got vouchers?

Anyone who bought tickets using Ticketmaster’s website between Oct. 21, 1999, and Feb. 27, 2013, should have received between one and 17 vouchers.

If you’re logged in to your Ticketmaster account, you can check to see how many are available to you here.

What are the vouchers worth?

There are three types, each with a different value:

A $2.25 discount on any ticket.

A $5 discount toward UPS delivery.

Two free tickets for general admission seating at venues owned or operated by Live Nation Entertainment, which owns Ticketmaster.

Great! Which of my favorite bands are playing?

You can’t use the vouchers on just any Ticketmaster order. The company has selected specific events for which they qualify throughout the United States, which means the shows near you might be awfully limited.

The company set up a webpage listing which events would be eligible, with more than 430 initially listed. Free tickets for Alabama Shakes, Weezer, Bob Dylan, Def Leppard, Snoop Dogg, Steely Dan and The Cure were briefly made available in the first batch of concerts.
