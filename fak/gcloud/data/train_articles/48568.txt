Twelfth Annual Report to Congress on PEPFAR (2016)
The bold and visionary leadership by President George W. Bush and the United States Congress that created the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) – a legacy that President Barack Obama has embraced and on which he has significantly expanded – has fundamentally transformed the global HIV/AIDS response.

Since 2003, with the extraordinary investment of Congress, PEPFAR has helped halt the relentless escalation of new HIV infections and mortality rates across the globe. PEPFAR has saved millions of lives and prevented millions more HIV infections by providing core HIV prevention and treatment services, changing the very course of the HIV pandemic.

At its core, PEPFAR is a reflection of the compassion of the American people. It has become an iconic brand of U.S. government engagement in health, development, and diplomacy. By setting and being held accountable to clear metrics, PEPFAR has proven that it is possible to demonstrate clear outcomes and impact. And this work is far from done.
