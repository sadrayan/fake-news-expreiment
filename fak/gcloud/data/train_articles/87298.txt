Florida gave charter schools millions before they closed
Charter schools, which proponents see as a way for some families to move their children into schools better suited to their needs, have grown in popularity since they were authorized in the 1990s. There are more than 650 charter schools statewide with more than 250,000 students. These schools receive money from school districts to pay for day-to-day expenses like salaries.
