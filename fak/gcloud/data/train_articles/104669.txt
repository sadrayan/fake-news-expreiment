Republicans cited Thursday’s ruling as just the latest example of judicial overreach in favor of liberals.

“No one familiar with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals should be surprised at today’s ruling,” South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said in a statement. “The 9th Circuit has a well-earned reputation for being presumptively reversible.”
