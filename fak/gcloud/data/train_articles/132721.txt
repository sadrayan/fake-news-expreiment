Target and The Salvation Army: Making a Difference Every Day
With gift-giving season in full swing, we took a short break to spend some time with longtime Target partner The Salvation Army. During this time of year, people across the country gather together to give the most important kind of gift – helping those in need.

For each of the last two years, Target has provided $250,000 in gift cards to 96 Salvation Army Chapters to assist their holiday toy drives and Angel Tree program. But, the holidays aren’t the only time to lend a hand.

Year-round, Target proudly supports The Salvation Army as it serves more than 30 million people in the United States. Grants to local chapters, support from team member volunteers, donations and support of disaster relief efforts are just a few of the ways Target helps out.

In fact, over the past five years, Target has provided cash and in-kind donations totaling more than $13.6 million to all The Salvation Army locations nationwide.

“The Salvation Army appreciates our long-time partnership with Target,” says Major George Hood, National Community Relations Secretary for The Salvation Army. “Through Target’s generous year-round contributions, volunteer assistance and other support, we continue to make a difference for those in need.”
