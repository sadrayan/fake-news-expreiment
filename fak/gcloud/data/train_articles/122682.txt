No fines for NFL players honoring 9/11
NFL players will not have to shell out a fine to honor the victims of 9/11 on Sunday.

Yahoo! Sports reported that players from Redskins tight end Chris Cooley to Titans quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, who had tweeted pictures of new Reebok gear honoring the national tragedy, were expecting to have to shell out a fine for wearing the special cleats and gloves in Sunday's games.

But NFL spokesman Greg Aiello told the Daily News on Friday afternoon that the players would not be fined for wearing the tribute gear, despite the league's strict uniform policy.

"We have extensive plans for Sunday to respectfully recognize the significance of the day," he said.

All NFL players, coaches and sideline personnel will wear a special NFL 9/11 ribbon on their apparel on Sunday.

Jet players Nick Mangold and Dustin Keller plan to wear the cleats and gloves, which were in front of both players lockers on Friday.

Chicago Bears linebacker Lance Briggs had tweeted about the possibility he would be fined for the red, white and blue cleats and gloves.

"So once the breast cancer game is played, players can wear pink gloves and shoes as much as they like," Briggs noted on his Twitter account. "For the anniversary of 9/11 game, why is it if I wear shoes and gloves that are the colors of our nation's flag...I will be fined by the league.

"Reebok great job on these gloves and shoes..looks like I'm getting fined this week. Lol!"

Briggs can put his wallet away, at least for this Sunday.
