Willie Nelson may be getting old but he is so done with the death rumors.

Two days before the singer turned 84, (Saturday, April 29,) he released a timely new music video for his song "Still Not Dead," from his newest album, "God's Problem Child."

Nelson first sings in the toe tapping tune, "I woke up still not dead again today. The internet said I had passed away."

ICYMI: Matthew McConaughey, Jack Ingram and Mack Brown host 5th annual fundraiser in Austin, Texas

The legendary singer is also seen at the beginning and end of the video wearing that "Smoke Weed Everyday" ugly Christmas sweater that he received as a gift from Snoop Dogg.

For two and a half minutes, the song pokes fun at the fake death stories Nelson has read about himself in previous years. Nelson not only assures us that he is alive and well, but he's still on the road touring; "They say my pace would kill a normal man."

Spoiler Alert! If you don't want to know about it, then stop reading.

An awesome moment from the music video captures the 84-year-old jumping into the air and completing a 360 degree circle. How's that for a man who's been in the business for more than 60 years?

Happy Birthday Willie and keep making that music!
