REVEALED: Donald Trump’s Harvard rejection letter from 1964
‘We cannot offer you admission to the Class of 1968’

Donald Trump applied to Harvard and was rejected in 1964, according to leaked documents passed to The Tab.

His rejection letter, which was sent to us last night, reads: “I am very sorry to inform you that we cannot offer you admission to the Class of 1968.”

Thanks to Admissions Office policy dictating all communication with prospective students is copied and stored under file, a copy of Trump’s letter has been kept hidden – until now.

This will no doubt be a blow to Trump’s campaign, as he is forced to remember he had to go to Fordham University, and then worse – Wharton Business School at Penn.

When we reached out to the Harvard Admissions Office, they told us they decline to comment on finalised admissions decisions.

Check the date.
