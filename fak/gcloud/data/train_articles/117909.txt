A shield is in front of the eagle; the shield has 13 red and white stripes (representing the original 13 colonies) with a blue bar above it (it symbolizes the uniting of the 13 colonies and represents congress). Above the eagle are 13 white clouds, 13 white stars, and many tiny stars. 50 white stars surround the eagle in a circle (on a deep blue field). The words, "Seal of the President of the United States" surround the seal (on a tan field).

The first President who used a presidential seal was Rutherford B. Hayes; in 1880, Hayes used the seal for White House invitations. US President Harry Truman had the seal redesigned on October 26, 1945, adding the circle of stars and re-orienting the eagle towards the right (the side with the olive branch).
