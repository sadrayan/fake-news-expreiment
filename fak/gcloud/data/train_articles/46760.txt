F.B.I. Chief Says Politics Won’t Interfere With Inquiry on Hillary Clinton’s Email
WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said Thursday that he was certain the bureau would be able to complete the investigation into Hillary Rodham Clinton’s personal email account in a timely manner and that he would make sure politics did not interfere with it.

“I am following this very closely, and I get briefed on it regularly,” Mr. Comey said at a quarterly meeting with reporters at F.B.I. headquarters.

He added, “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter, as we do all our work, so that we are able to do it in a professional, prompt and independent way.”

The F.B.I. opened an investigation this summer into how classified materials were handled in connection with Mrs. Clinton’s account when she was secretary of state in response to a referral from the inspector general of the intelligence community. The inspector general, I. Charles McCullough III, had said that sensitive national security information had been found in the account. It is illegal to have classified information on an unsecure network.
