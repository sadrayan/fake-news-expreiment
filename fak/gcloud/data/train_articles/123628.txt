Clinton aide: Obama trying to "manipulate the Iowa caucuses"

A Clinton spokesman, Mo Elleithee, this afternoon drew a distinction between her campaign's approach to college campuses and Obama's, amplifying Yepsen's criticism of the Obama campaign.

There’s a big difference here. We are not systematically trying to manipulate the Iowa caucuses with out of state people. We don’t have literature recruiting out of state college students. We didn’t bus in folks from out of state to the JJ. We didn’t bring in out of state activists to the Heartland Forum.

Also, I'm told the out-of-state student backing Clinton, whom I mentioned earlier, was born in Iowa and plans to live here after she graduates, for what it's worth.

UPDATE: Obama spokesman Bill Burton responds:

Rather than denigrating the caucus rights of students who go to school in Iowa, we would suggest the Clinton campaign organize them. Their attack here is borne out of pure political frustration. Iowans are determined to launch a winning candidate for the Democratic Party to bring real change for our country. They will not be deterred by efforts to dampen participation and 11th-hour attacks.

An Obama aide also pointed out that there's no evidence his campaign was busing in students from out of state, while my colleague Ben Adler reported that Clinton volunteers from out of state were planning to come back to caucus (it's unclear to him how organized this effort is) and the Clinton campaign did email out a call for volunteers to come from other midwestern states prior to the Jefferson Jackson dinner.

Still, it does seem that Obama is the only one with a large-scale program to bring back college kids from out of state -- certainly in no small part because he can.
