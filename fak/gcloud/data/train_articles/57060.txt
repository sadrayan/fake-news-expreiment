Best States for Business Environment
Business environment holds a third of the weight in ranking the Best States for economy. This subcategory evaluates both the private sector business birth rate and the number of patents granted per million people in a state. Overall tax burden, venture capital investment and the number of top businesses headquartered in a state were factored in, as well. Inventors, entrepreneurs and out-of-the-box thinkers thrive in environments where they can push the status quo, and often flock to the same areas of the U.S., where they can pursue their business aspirations surrounded by fellow innovators. Those new ideas and businesses can be a boon to a stateâ€™s economy.

California, home to Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, ranks first in the nation for business environment. Massachusetts places second in this subcategory, followed by Washington, Colorado and Utah.
