Board of Directors
ARM’s maximum authority is the Board of Director’s, which is why its deliberations are of mandatory compliance. It guides and manages the organization. It is responsible for defining the direction of the Foundation, in line with the interests of its various allies and actors in the supply chain.

People who serve on ARM’s Board of Directors do so voluntarily and without monetary remuneration. They are committed to dedicating approximately 3 days per month to the Foundation – including meetings, reunions and other activities.

Some key functions of the Board of Directors include the design of high- level policies and strategies, the provision of advice on specific subjects, public representation of ARM and ensuring appropriate financing for the organization.
