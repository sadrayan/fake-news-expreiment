Millions Are Speechless After Discovering Why Obama Just Gave Mexico …
Turns out Barack Obama isn’t all that against building a border wall to keep out illegals after all.

Thing is, he wants illegals to enter America, he’s just not okay with them entering Mexico.

Looks like the U.S. is giving our neighbors to the south $75 million so they can build their own wall to protect themselves from Central American invaders.

One of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s talking points in his campaign has that he wants to protect our borders. He wants to secure the American people from the dangers of illegal immigration and strengthen those borders by building a wall However, it seems that President Barack Obama wanted to do one lasting thing before leaving office, so he gifted Mexico $75 million … to help the Mexicans build a wall to improve their border security. According to a Financial Times story cited by Newsmax , Mexico wanted to stop people from Central American countries like Guatemala from entering their country via its southern border.

Financial Times story details Mexico’s role in stopping people from getting into its country from Guatemala. A reported 175,000 Central Americans were deported from Mexico in 2015 (a 68 percent jump from 2014), and so far in 2016 that number is approaching 100,000. The Times claims the U.S. is sending Mexico $75 million in the form of equipment and training to help shore up its southern border. Ultimately, some of the Central American migrants wind up at America’s southern doorstep. Stopping them from entering Mexico is the first line of defense. A U.S. Border Patrol agent said earlier this year the U.S. should borrow a page out of Mexico’s security playbook and strengthen its border defenses and deport more illegals when they arrive.

Hypocrisy much?
