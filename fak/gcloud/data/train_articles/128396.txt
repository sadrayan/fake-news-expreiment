UA Local 1
Welcome to Plumbers Local 1 of New York City



Plumbers protect the health of the nation and the highly skilled members of Local 1 are no different. We specialize in both commercial and residential work, and also in medical gas certification and back-flow testing. We work on everything from stadiums to your residential home and small business. Our contractors are available 24-hours a day for all your plumbing needs.



We encourage you to peruse our website to learn more About Us. If you are a contractor, we want you to contact us and we can send a member of our team to evaluate your upcoming project. What separates us from everyone else is our skill and training. Our apprentices go through a rigorous 5-year program on their way to becoming experienced journeymen, but the training doesn't end there. We continue to provide training so that there is no project too small or complex that we cannot fulfill on-time and budget for you!
