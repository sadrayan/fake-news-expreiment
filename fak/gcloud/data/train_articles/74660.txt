House Minority Leader Pelosi Holds Weekly News Conference

PELOSI:

Good morning. (inaudible) of course as the U.S.-China (inaudible) which we're learning more about. And I commend the president for making this a priority in the talks with China.

And this is the recognition by China that this needs to be addressed is very significant. It defangs the argument that some have said it is no use, we are not doing anything unless the Chinese do something. Well, they are. And it's really quite a remarkable -- when China and the U.S. deliver on their Cuban (ph) pollution -- carbon- pollution reduction, other nations hopefully will make similar commitments. They no longer have the excuse China isn't doing it, and people in Congress no longer have the excuse, isn't doing it so I should we. So I think it is pretty exciting.

You make, some of you, recall who were here at that time, that that was a very important the issue for me. I established the select committee on the climate crisis and energy independence headed by Ed Markey, and so we're very excited about agreement.

Immigration -- on the subject of immigration later today we will have press comments with some members who are urging the president to act, to use his executive authority to improve the situation.

I -- we have had this conversation before and I will again call to your attention the op-ed we wrote, that says the president no longer -- not only has been legal authority to act, but all the precedents of presidents before, from Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon -- you know most of them. Before you were born, some of you, but Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Reagan, Reagan, any number of occasions, President George Herbert Walker Bush, President Clinton, President George W. Bush, all of them have taken executive actions.

I refer to again, as presidents before him, Obama has authority to act. I joined the (inaudible). We have over 100 senators to a letter today, Louise (ph) and Zoe (ph) do, calling upon members to join them in urging the president not to take that action. So that will be exciting to see, the timing of that, and the scope of it. We have no idea, but what we do know is that every modern-day president before President Obama has used that executive authority.

We're excited about our new members. Last night we swore in the 100th member -- woman member -- 100th woman to -- in this 113th Congress. When we swear in the new Congress we will go over 300 in history, but 100 was this Congress, and that's pretty remarkable, 65 of them on the Democratic side and some of them in the Senate, but 65 House Democratic women. It was a decision we made some years ago to increase our numbers. There were 12 when I came to Congress; now we have 65. That pace is not good enough, but nonetheless a source of pride.

The incoming class will be two-thirds women and minorities, four veterans. We're very proud of them. You'll be seeing more of than as they go through their orientation here, but we are proud of what they are doing.

So again, I regret the loss of some of the members. We lost -- nine of our members will not be returning. Three longstanding members, Tim Bishop, New York one (ph), Nick Rahall from West Virginia, and John Barrow from Georgia, very, very valued members of the House of Representatives, independent representatives of their district, and they did not get re-elected, and then six members of the freshman class, two who had been here before and now came back, Carol Shea-Porter and (inaudible), two excellent members of Congress, two brand new members in Illinois, Brad Schneider, and (inaudible), and then two down south of Florida, Joe Garcia and (inaudible) in Texas and one more actually. One more -- it's (inaudible) in Nevada.

So while some are calling this a big wave. In many respects Democrats write large were, but when you think of the waves that we have had in terms of the House -- 54 lost in the first election after the election. Since 1994, 54 -- only 54 Democrats lost their seats. You know our wave when we took the House, and then a further wave when President Obama was elected and then the wave that gave the majority to the Republicans, so altogether about 12 members, nine who lost their seats, and -- 10 who lost their seats and three who did not seek election.

In California, we probably picked up a seat. We haven't lost a House Democrat since 1994 in California. This election year, where they were targeting California -- I don't know, but they were targeting California with either break-even or gain a seat, and that's why number of people who had lost are mitigated by the ones in California. We've gained Pete Aguilar. So I know you probably wanted to talk some politics, so that's that.

But again, the service and the leadership of the members that we have lost, you can't quantify it. But because of the quality of their service.

But nonetheless, we are ready to get going and we hope to honor the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act by having a real voter engagement using the inspiration of what people did for people to have the right to vote. People died, people risked their lives, and now we'll have the 50th anniversary; we'll have the 50th anniversary of John Lewis walking over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.

And all of that inspiration, education helps us to give people of purpose, a reason to register, a reason to vote, and I think you're going to see a massive return to the field of politics of elections when we have the next election.

I'll be very honesty with you I don't care if they register Democratic or Republican; I just want them to engage and I want them to vote, because two thirds of our electorate did not vote in this election, and that's not a good model to the world.

So with that I will be pleased to take any questions you may have.

(inaudible). Yes sir? You again.

(LAUGHTER)

QUESTION:

On health care.

PELOSI:

On health care.

QUESTION:

Speaker Boehner made it clear last week they were probably going to have multiple (inaudible) on health care. He had the news here in the past few days about some of comments made by Mr. Gruber, which has sort of ignited that side, and they're talking about possibly having hearings and calling him up to talk about what he meant in the architecture behind this.

Tell me, how did your side engage on this issue within a different way. With them going back to this well again, what does that mean? Does it give you more opportunity, or does it (inaudible). Or is this just, you know, you feel like you're fighting the same battle over and over?

PELOSI:

Well, you gave an interesting set of observations, but one that you skipped is Mr. Gruber's comments were a year old, and he has backtracked for most of them.

QUESTION:

(OFF-MIKE)

PELOSI:

Nonetheless, you didn't have it in your narrative, and that's really important that does -- he's not even advocating the position that he was at some conference and said.

So I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill. So with all due respect to your question, you have a person who wasn't writing our bill commenting on what was going on when we were writing the bill, who has withdrawn some of his statements that he made. So let's put him aside.

But to your further question, which is more important, and with our without him the Republicans will try to undermine the Affordable Care Act, and we recognize that.

But the fact is what is projected to be over 9.5 million people will have access to health care when this enrollment -- who didn't have it before, or didn't have it in the manner in which they have it now.

And that doesn't count all of those who are going onto the expansion of Medicaid. So we are very, very proud of it. So how do -- does our side approach it? With great pride. With great pride. And a clear message to people who have that access to quality affordable health care, who have the liberty to keep the job they have, or change jobs or become self-employed, or start a business, that this is not going to be taken away from them.

And if you are a woman, no longer being a woman would be a pre- existing medical condition for your being discriminated against in getting insurance, and if you're in college, or graduating from college, no longer will you be pulled off of your parents (inaudible). If you have a pre-existing medical condition no longer will you be discriminated against or charged astronomical rates.

So the message is really what this legislation has meant in the lives of the American people. Clearly there's been a tremendous amount of misrepresentation about it that you saw in the campaign. There was less use of it as a campaign issue, because the proof of the pudding is in the policies that people now have, the protections, the patient's rights that are now there. So we will just speak to it with pride and from a factual basis.

Yes ma'am?

QUESTION:

On the Keystone Pipeline, you have expressed a lot of skepticism in the past about this project and whether it will create jobs, so I'm wondering what you think about Senate Democrats sudden decision to hold a vote on it.

And then, on your own leadership, after Senate Democrats lost seats last week I'm wondering if you gave any thought to stepping down as the leader and what you thought about when you decided to say.

PELOSI:

Why don't I start with the second question, because I've heard it from you -- from you all a number of times, and what I said to the most recent person who asked, you've said, well, you've lost now three times; why don't you step aside? You've heard that question when we lost two times, or one time, and then I said, what was the day when any of you said to Mitch McConnell when they lost the Senate three times in a row -- lost making progress in taking back the Senate three times in a row, "Aren't into getting a little old Mitch? Shouldn't you step aside? Have you ever asked him that question? Have you ever asked? Has any of you ever asked him that question?

So I don't understand why that question should even come up. I'm here as long as my members want me to be here, as long as there's a reason to be here. I'm not here on a schedule, on anything except a mission to get a job done.

I am so proud of the confidence my members have placed in me. My life my life and who I am is not the dependent on being here. So I have the liberty of, if you want me here, I am happy to be here; if you don't, I'm proud of what we have done together.

But it is just as interesting as a woman to see how many times that question is asked of a woman and how many times that question is never asked of Mitch McConnell.

Having said that, to get to the Keystone -- and I say that kind of thinking I have a mission for women on this score. When we won the House, and that was largely an initiative that I started around 2000 to take us to a place that we would win the House. That was a big thing.

I was never on the kind of "Time" magazine even though I was the first woman -- wasn't that a curiosity? That the Republicans win Boehner's on the front of "Time" magazine. Mitch McConnell wins, he's on the front of "Time" magazine. Isn't there a pattern here?

Now, as I said, my -- who I am does not depend on any of that, with all due respect to all of you, but as a woman, it's like, is there a message here? Is there something that we're missing?

Okay, on the Keystone, here's the thing about this vote today that we're going to take up. I don't know what the Senate is doing. I'm in -- I ready about what you say. I just know what is happening here, and here the rules met yesterday to make an order of the debate today and the vote tomorrow on a bill on the Keystone Pipeline.

What is important to know about that legislation is, that if you were 100 percent for the Keystone Pipeline, you would have to have a problem with the legislation on the floor, because it exempts the Trans-Canada Pipeline Initiative from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. As you know, there was a -- in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 2010, there a leak, but they were compensated because they were - they had paid into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. There have been payments made into that that compensated for that.

This says, even though these tar sands, which are highly corrosive, would be going through this pipeline, and you know that there are cases in Nebraska about this right now, should there be a leak, Trans-Canada does not -- will be exempted from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, even though the tar sands component of what they are transmitting is highly corrosive.

So God willing, there never would be a leak. But if there is, they are totally off the hook. So independent any discussion about the Keystone Pipeline and the jobs it creates and where the oil goes and the rest of that, is the subject of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which they're exempted from in this bill.

And for that reason, I think you'll see people who may be on both sides of the Keystone Pipeline Bill, or the Keystone Pipeline in and of itself, voting against it today. But we'll see -- I mean, it's not today; tomorrow, but the debate on it. Why would they do that? Why do you think that they would exempt them highly controversial -- which the president has said his standard would be the impact on the environment that they would -- well, we understand, we know who it was. And I guess the Koch brothers have said, that, a separate issue, but in relationship to the tax credit for the tax bill that's come up, that they're going to spend money against Republicans who support tax credits for wind and renewables. So this is of a pattern. It's of a pattern.

But again, I haven't made a public statement about the pipeline, but I do make a public statement about this bill. They should not be exempt from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.

Yes, ma'am?

QUESTION:

(OFF-MIKE) on immigration, to a (inaudible), an omnibus. It's going to have to come out before the middle of next month. Do you expect that to happen? Do you foresee a big fight? And how do you try to make sure the government doesn't shut down, or address not having another shutdown (inaudible)?

PELOSI:

Well, I don't think that Republicans should do that. I don't think they should do that. They're saying to the president's don't use your executive authority. Suppose he turned to us, and said, don't use your legislative authority. That's what presidents do. They have executive authority. He has his authority to perhaps veto such a bill, but I don't think we have to go to that place. We have big problems. We want to create jobs, good-paying jobs for the American people. We want to do what he do whether it relates to energy in a way that grows our economy, keeps people in a healthy environment.

And why are we going down this path by the Congress can prevent it all from happening by passing the Senate bill? Five-hundred days since the Senate passed the Immigration Bill.

And a couple of years since the speaker has been saying over and over again, we will pass an immigration bill in the House. It may not be the Senate bill. We may not even want to go to conference with the Senate bill, but we will establish principles. Remember that, we saluted his principles when they went up the flagpole, his members chopped down the flagpole. So, but nonetheless, give me another chance. Don't be excited about it; it's going to happen. And then it didn't.

So Congress could prevent the president from doing executive action by legislating on the subject at hand, passing this bipartisan bill that passed over 500 days ago.

Yes?

QUESTION:

Thank you. You mentioned the (inaudible) brief segue into my question of extenders. We've heard a lot of different things about that. House Republicans were voting for a one-year extension. Obviously, there are Ways and Means members who want some provisions to be permanently renewed, and there are a lot of Republicans who also want the (inaudible) renewed at all. What would you...

(CROSSTALK)

PELOSI:

Thank you for your question. They're having conversations now, House and Senate, on this. The Senate passed a bipartisan committee bill, which is a good place I think to start and I think end because there are certain equities to be balanced.

One is we really do have to have revenue reform. We have to reform the tax code. But when you make so many things permanent in a bill like this, you diminish the leverage from one part of the bill to another to -- to -- at the end of the day, increase revenue so that we can reduce the deficit.

And so, I would hope that they would come out with something, House and Senate, that looks like the Senate bipartisan passed a bill in committee.

And the problem I have with the permanent aspects of it is that it is an impediment to doing real reform, which we need to do to simplify, to be able to close loopholes, to lower the corporate rate, so that we can have a better tax system.

The problem with the one-year is, it's retroactive. It's this year, maybe one month. By the time we passed it, there would only be one month to the bill, so that doesn't get you too much. And if you're thinking in terms of wind, solar, any -- any transaction you want more lead time than one month.

So the fact is, is that two years at the least, which gives 13 months in the next year to be able to debate hopefully with full transparency, put everything on the table, be agnostic, what works, what doesn't work, get it done so that we can lower the corporate rate, make permanent some of the issues that should be made permanent, but do so in that more comprehensive frame, then making some thing's permanent here that diminish your ability to something much better in the tax bill. But we'll just see when they come forward with what they have.

Yes ma'am?

QUESTION:

There's been some discussion that Obama delaying executive action on immigration really depressed turn-out in the Democratic debate (ph). I was wondering if you agree with that? And how do you plan to take on this issue (inaudible)?

PELOSI:

Well, I don't -- right now, we have to look to see what -- different things happen in the election in different places. And members are coming back, and we're getting the review. Of course, I have an overview of it from here, but unless you're on the ground, what happened in a specific district remains to be seen until we see a certain pattern. So I don't know.

I can't say that the president delaying the executive action depressed -- I do think that with two thirds of the electorate not voting, it's something other than the president's actions, time table on immigration. And that's what we have to find out. That's why we want to use and -- and honor of the Voting Rights Act by having that inspiration, that education to encourage people to vote.

And as I said before, this is nonpartisan registration education and the rest. If they want to register Republican, God bless them, but pay attention and make sure that the people you're voting for know what is important to you.

And what is important to most people is their financial stability and -- and good paying jobs, affordability for education for their children. Those kind of issues, which, frankly Republicans have avoided and I think an increased participation of the electorate will -- would improve the climate for debate for working families in our country to have an economy that works for everyone.

So I think that the -- one of the depressors -- one of the big depressors of voting is big money in campaigns. It just turns people so totally off, all this money coming in and saying without any -- where does this money come from? And coming in with misrepresentations, whether it's about the Affordable Care Act, whether it's about immigration, whatever it is, the issues that are important to people's lives are being so mischaracterized, pox on both your houses, I'm not even going to vote.

I don't if you saw -- they had a report why people didn't vote. Something in the 60s said, `I didn't have time.' And then another chunk, `I was busy with work or school.' And another time was something that related to time, as well. Well, all of that adds up to it wasn't important enough for me.

Now for some, it is a legitimate time concern. Working two jobs, having both here and there, you can't stand in line for long hours when people have deterred the vote for you in your community by reducing the hours, reducing the days, reducing the polling places, reducing machines. So there's -- there are a lot of things that contribute to that.

But the overarching thing I think is that not enough people saw that it was really important to their well-being that they vote. The Republicans called it as a base election. They got out their base, `Impeach the president. Sue the president,' all that negative stuff. And again, that was a deppresant (ph). The strangulation of the airwaves by big money is so undemocratic, and that's why I fought the Supreme Court for the Citizens United decision.

So, we'll be talking some more. This afternoon we're going to come out here and talk about -- a little bit about immigration. I can't stay the whole time then because I have a lot of work to do about who's going to be the next chair of the -- the people who want to come into talk about those kinds of subjects. So I won't be able to stay the whole time.

And who's going to be the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee? And I'm very proud of the -- an issue (ph) I think sometimes in the course of our legislative lives, a person comes along who's a perfect fit to take us into the future. I think that is who she is. She has amassed tremendous amount of support. And my calls to the members congratulating them on their election hearing their views of the election, enlisting them in our -- voting rights 50 anniversary initiative. Some of them, may be fewer than 20, have asked me what I had thought of that or why I have not asked them about it. And it's just because I haven't.

But I have spoken to a few. Because some -- one of you had said to my staff before, `I hear she's asking people'. No, just those who ask me or those who are clearly not assigned to one person or another or spoken for one person or another. I haven't spoken to anybody who was a very lovely man, Frank Pallone who's terrific. He's terrific. But, you know, we had a choice to make. But anybody who is for him, I respect their decision, friendship, their support of him. So I haven't had any conversations of that kind, only in conversations when the subject that has come up.

So I'm trying to anticipate all of your little scattered things that come to our office. We have not even had the conversations with the candidates for D Triple-C. And yet I heard yesterday that I made the choice was about to announce it -- somebody I haven't even spoken to that, within -- 24 hours before, I didn't have the faintest idea I was in.

So, if you want to know call me.

(LAUGHTER)

Thank you all.

Oh! We didn't bring up the Giants! How about the Giants! Hey, all of the taunting before and now, 10, 12, 14, every other year, World Champion San Francisco Giants.

Remember all of your enthusiasm about the Giants, and all the rest of it? I should have brought down the rally rag, the pennant, the headlines, "Yes, yes, yes".

QUESTION:

(inaudible)

PELOSI:

What?

(LAUGHTER)

QUESTION:

(inaudible)

PELOSI:

I did something (ph). But you know, the thing is...

(LAUGHTER)

... what I do think is that we might want to just fill in those blanks. I don't know. But in any event, I'm really looking forward to my -- really looking forward to my Kansas City -- my gosh. The revs (ph) are so good there.

QUESTION:

What if they don't sign panda?

PELOSI:

That was the chant of the parade.

QUESTION:

What if they don't sign panda?

PELOSI:

Sign panda. Sign the panda. Sign the panda. We want to know what's going to happen with Mad Bum. That would be Madison Bumgarner to...

(LAUGHTER)

We'll see. I mean, panda -- how about that catch at the end? Was that just great when his back like that? So anyway, we're -- we're very proud of our Giants. I said to the commissioner at the game, "Can you believe that we have two teams in the World Series that are wild cards? And he said, "That's how I envisioned it."

(LAUGHTER)

So there you are. One way or another. Go Giants.

But it's interesting to me, because all -- you know, before it was -- and nothing. Perhaps I should have brought in the rally rag or pennant.

When we had our first leadership meeting last week, I had this headline -- "Not About the Bum" "Yes, yes, yes." "Rein of Victory" -- rain, because it was raining the day of the parade, but R-E-I-N. "Dynasty" -- you're not getting enthusiastic at all.

(LAUGHTER)

I'm not wasting my time on you guys.

(LAUGHTER)

Aren't the National wonderful. The coach got a good article the other day. That was nice. I wanted a red and orange -- I mean, orange and black series with Baltimore. We didn't get that, but we did get the trophy.
