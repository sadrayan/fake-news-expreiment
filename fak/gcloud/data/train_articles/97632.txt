Supporting Families
Our Conservative Government is committed to providing real support for Canadian families, which is why our record includes:

supporting choice in child care through the Universal Child Care Benefit, which provides parents with $1200 a year for each child under six

creating the Tax-Free Savings Account, a flexible way for Canadian families to save for their priorities without paying taxes on interest or withdrawals

investing $253 million a year for over five years in affordable housing projects

providing targeted support for Canadian students with investments of more than $10 billion annually in students and education

investing an additional $50 million in funding to improve on the Youth Employment Strategy to better integrate students into the workforce

introducing Pension Income-Splitting for senior couples, increasing the Age Amount and bringing in the largest Guaranteed Income Supplement increase in over 25 years

introducing measures to protect the well-being of seniors with the creation of the Protecting Canada’s Seniors Act

enhancing consumer safety standards on products like children’s playpens, baby bottles and children’s jewelry

delivering on our low-tax plan by cutting taxes over 150 times since forming Government, saving the average Canadian family $3,220 a year

We’re building on this record by:

providing $76 million in annual tariff relief on baby clothing and sports equipment

enhancing the Adoption Expense Tax Credit to better reflect the cost of adoption

promoting healthy living and physical activity through continued support for community- based programs like ParticipAction and Athletescan

investing in communities across Canada with $150 million to support repairs and improvements to existing small public infrastructure

Moving forward, our Government remains committed to supporting Canadian families with our low-tax plan and measures to help sustain a higher quality of life for hard-working Canadians.
