Charter completes purchase of Time Warner Cable, Bright House
Charter now is the nation's second-largest broadband Internet provider, behind Comcast, and the third-largest pay-TV distributor behind AT&T; and Comcast. Charter clinched the deal to buy Time Warner Cable a year ago, after Comcast's bid for Time Warner Cable ran into a regulatory buzzsaw. Charter had been eyeing the Time Warner Cable assets long before that, and Wednesday's deal close marks the end of a more than two-year dance.
