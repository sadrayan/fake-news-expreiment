Straight Out Of A Movie-Sharks Swim Through The Streets Of Miami After Hurricane Irma
After hurricane Harvey did what it did to Texas, the news of hurricane Irma’s impending arrival upon the States caused paranoia and fear across the islands and the entire state of Florida.

Naturally, many Floridians hardly blinked an eye at the thought of another hurricane making it’s way toward the shoe -shaped state. Prone to tropical storms and hurricanes galore-Florida natives know all too well what they are in for as the storm season peaks August through September.

While half the country prayed up with Florida residents on their mind- the OG natives gathered their supplies “hunkered down” to weather the storm as per usual, at least s**t got really real. Then even the south’s most southern -couldn’t stand the rain.

Well, as forecasts predicted – many parts of Florida were hit pretty hard by Hurricane Irma, and Miami was one of those places.

In the wake of Irma, many parts of Miami were so badly flooded that some of the ocean’s residents are now swimming up and down the city’s streets.

Among them is none other than the infamous shark. If you thought you only had to worry about sharks while chillin’ at the beach, you might want to think again.
