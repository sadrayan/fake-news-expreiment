Fulton State Hospital Rebuild Project
About Fulton State Hospital

Fulton State Hospital, built in 1851, is the oldest state psychiatric hospital west of the Mississippi River. The Biggs and Guhleman Forensic Centers on the campus treat patients with serious mental illness who are committed by Missouri courts for evaluation and treatment related to a crime, or who have seriously assaulted patients or staff in our other state psychiatric hospitals.

Biggs is the stateâ€™s only maximum security psychiatric facility. Since 2007, the facility has taken in over a thousand admissions from 99 Missouri counties and the City of St. Louis. As Missourians, we have a moral responsibility to these patients and their caregivers to provide the best possible environment: one that is safe, secure and conducive to healing.
