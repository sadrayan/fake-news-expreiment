Connectivity Action Plan
Citizens, businesses and governments use information technologies on a daily basis. Digitisation is rapidly transforming our economy and society. This transformation requires high-quality digital connectivity, which grows along with the needs of society and the economy. The Netherlands is currently well equipped, but in order to maintain this position, sufficient invest­ments must be made. To achieve this, the preconditions cre­ated by the government must be in place. This Action Plan outlines the government’s efforts to remain the European digital leader with the aim of providing high-quality connectivity that can serve a wide range of demands and is available at competitive prices anytime and everywhere.
