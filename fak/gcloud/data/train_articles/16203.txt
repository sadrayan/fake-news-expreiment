The statement might be literally factual given that Ron Paul finished ahead of Senator Cornyn in the Gravis survey. The more subtle point to be made is that Cornyn did see his favorability ratings among conservatives drop over the summer, which helped fuel further talk of a challenge from the right. Stockman's intent seems to be to make Cornyn seem vulnerable to such a challenge. But the polling up to this point is likely to be much less relevant once actual campaigning starts, and Cornyn is able to campaign actively to counteract this kind of message. The fact that Ron Paul - who has given no serious indication of wanting to run, and isn't running - was thrown into the Gravis match-up underlines the fact that the race is not as developed as Stockman's statement implies.

Jim:

Sorry to belabor this, but it bears on Stockman’s accuracy. He said that “in every poll,” Cornyn “always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about.”

Is there evidence that voters have “heard about” the two individuals you tested against Cornyn? What is it?

What’s your opinion of which tested foes are “heard about” or not and why?

Certainly neither of the two candidates that were in the primary race when we were collecting data are widely known. I think it would roughly fair to say that anyone who has previously run statewide or nationally, or has in some other way been the subject of media exposure, could be referred to as someone people have "heard about.
