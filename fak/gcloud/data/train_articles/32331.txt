Clean Missouri – Join us today!
Missouri voters overwhelmingly passed Amendment 1 in November, but some politicians are trying to overturn the will of 1,469,093 voters.

We won’t let that happen.

We voted to stop gerrymandering and create a new system that protected communities of color and prioritized fairness. But right now, a few politicians are blatantly ignoring us and using their unchecked power to reject the will of the people.

There are several proposals moving in Jefferson City right now that would allow gerrymandering back in Missouri.

These proposals could:

- Allow political consultants and party-picked lobbyists to rig districts once again.

- Weaken protections for communities of color.

- Take map-drawing out of the light into secretive backrooms.

- Gut the checks and balances that ensure no party will have an unfair advantage in future map plans.

- Make communication between public officials and their constituents private.
