U.S. Chamber Applauds Passage of House Legislation to Stop Waters of the U.S. Rule
WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Chamber of Commerce Senior Vice President for the Environment, Technology and Regulatory Affairs William Kovacs issued the following statement regarding the bipartisan passage of H.R. 1731, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act:

“By passing this legislation members of the House of Representatives have protected our nation’s free enterprise system against the flawed Waters of the United States (WOTUS) definition, as created by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE).



“By unjustly expanding federal jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act to include waterways, ditches, wetlands and other features, WOTUS could ultimately slow, or bring to a complete halt, numerous projects across the nation and significantly impact a portion of the U.S. economy.

“The Chamber now urges members of the Senate to acknowledge the negative impact this definition would have on our nation’s economy and to swiftly pass its own bill, which is scheduled for hearing on May 19.”



The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and industry associations.
