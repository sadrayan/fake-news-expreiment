Star Wars™ and the Power of Costume
about

Hamilton Building - Level 2

Take a unique journey into the Star Wars™ universe as characters are brought to life through a dramatic presentation of more than 70 original costumes. Star Wars™ and the Power of Costume will closely examine the captivating process of costume design for iconic outfits featured in all seven films of the Star Wars series—from Queen Amidala’s lavish gowns to Darth Vader’s imposing black armor.

Watch the designers and actors through several exhibition videos. Learn cultural and historic context as interpreted by Smithsonian scholars. Experience the processes of concept artists and costume designers with interactive encounters. Explore the artistry of the world’s most recognized cinematic costumes, including Queen Amidala, Chewbacca, X-Wing Pilots, and Droids, including C-3PO and R2-D2.

This exhibition goes beyond the chronological, literary, or filmic order often used to chronicle Star Wars. It focuses instead on the creative process, encompassing the essence of George Lucas’ vision and the exciting challenge of translating his iconic characters into a dynamic reality.
