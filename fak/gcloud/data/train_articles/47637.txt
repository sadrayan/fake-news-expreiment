Georgia Governor Signs ‘Fetal Heartbeat’ Abortion Law
The law’s critics said that they intend to target Republicans for defeat, especially those from the demographically shifting northern suburbs of Atlanta who supported the bill in the General Assembly.

“Georgians will fight back in the courtroom and at the ballot box & win,” Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor in 2018, said in a tweet on Monday.

What are other states doing?

Governors in Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio signed bills similar to Georgia’s this year. They have not gone unchallenged: A federal judge is expected to hear a challenge to the Mississippi law later this month, and a judge in Kentucky blocked the law there.

Similar measures in Iowa and North Dakota have been found unconstitutional.

Lawmakers in South Carolina and Tennessee have pressed for fetal heartbeat bills of their own, and in Arkansas, the state government narrowed the time frame in which women can have abortions.

Alabama is considering a different tack. Under a bill approved by the State House of Representatives last month, doctors would face up to 99 years in prison for performing an abortion in most instances. If a State Senate committee approves the measure, which does not currently include any exemptions for rape or incest, at a hearing on Wednesday, the full chamber could consider it as soon as Thursday.

What’s next?

Supporters of abortion rights, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have vowed to challenge the Georgia law in court.

Elisabeth Smith, the chief counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement on Tuesday that the law was “bafflingly unconstitutional.” The Supreme Court has recognized a woman’s right to an abortion until about 24 weeks into a pregnancy, the time when a fetus becomes viable outside the womb.
