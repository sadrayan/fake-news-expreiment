Recovery Act
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- commonly called the “stimulus” -- was designed to spur economic growth while creating new jobs and saving existing ones.

Through the Recovery Act, the Energy Department invested more than $31 billion to support a wide range of clean energy projects across the nation -- from investing in the smart grid and developing alternative fuel vehicles to helping homeowners and businesses reduce their energy costs with energy efficiency upgrades and deploying carbon capture and storage technologies. The Department’s programs helped create new power sources, conserve resources and aligned the nation to lead the global energy economy.
