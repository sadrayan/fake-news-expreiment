Eric Trump: “My Father’s Tax Return Is Irrelevant Because We’re Going To Cancel Taxes For WEALTHY People Anyway.”
President Donald Trump has asked for the heads of every protester who demanded his tax return.

Trump has dismissed calls for his tax returns on Twitter. “I did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?”

However, the matter didn’t end here!

Eric Trump decided to throw more lights on what they have for Americans during a brief phone interview with KYXL Radio.

Eric argued that Trump’s tax return is “irrelevant,” largely because “he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.” He said, “When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.”
