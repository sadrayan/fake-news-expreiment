Defence cuts, skill fade and lack of 'intellectual investment' in Arctic threatens Britain’s northern flank, report says
Russia poses a serious threat to Britain because the military is failing to protect the Arctic flank, a new report says.

Britain’s ability to defend against threats from the Arctic and the High North is at risk due to cost savings, skill fade and a lack of intellectual investment. The country must show “a new level of ambition” and apply more resources to address the developing security situation from the north, says the report published today by the Defence Sub-Committee.

Threats from Russian military presence and influence, combined with climate change and competition for resources have meant the traditionally low levels of tension in the region can no longer be guaranteed.

The report, On Thin Ice: UK Defence in the Arctic, says that whilst the Arctic is usually characterised by close multilateral cooperation among the Arctic States, the changing natural environment is being accompanied by a change in the security environment. The retreating ice sheet is making the Arctic more accessible to shipping and is exposing the region’s extensive natural resources to exploitation and competition.

Whilst MPs accepted there was a “divergence of views on Russia’s motivation,” they cautioned “it is difficult to conclude that this build-up of military strength is proportionate to an exclusively defensive outlook”.
