FLINT, MICHIGAN:

A FAILURE OF PRIMARY PREVENTION

Introducing Makayla*

• 12 month old girl (DOB 8/15/2014) presented last

week for her 1 year old check up. No concerns.

• Lives with single mom and 2 older siblings in west

side (48504). Formula from WIC; powder mixed with

warm tap water.

• Physical exam and development are normal.

Makayla receives her 1 year old vaccines and routine

lead and hemoglobin screening.

• A couple days later, lead level comes back as 6 ug/

dL.



*Hypothetical scenario



Blood lead level of 6 ug/dL….

• Blood lead levels (BLL) above 5 ug/dL are

considered elevated blood lead levels (EBL)

• Just a few years ago (2012), 10 ug/dL was cutoff

• Increasing evidence shows NO safe blood lead

level

• Disproportionately impacts low income, minority

children

• Primary prevention is most important

Primary Prevention

• “Because no measurable level of blood lead is known to

be without deleterious effects, and because once

engendered, the effects appear to be irreversible in the

absence of any other interventions, public health,

environmental and housing policies should encourage

PREVENTION of all exposure to lead.”

“Low Level Lead Exposure Harms Children: A Renewed Call for Primary

Prevention.” 2012 CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning

Prevention.

What will happen to Makayla?

• Vast evidence supports increased likelihood of:

• Decrease in IQ

• An increase in BLL from 1 to 4 ug/dL, drops mean IQ -3.7 points

• Small change in mean IQ, shifts entire population IQ

distribution

• Reduces high achievers IQs (>130) and increases kids with low

IQs (<70)

• Implications for special education services, employment,

incarceration, life achievement, etc

Behavioral Burden

• Increased likelihood of :

• ADHD behaviors

• Delinquent behaviors and arrests

• Total arrests and increased rates of arrests involving

violent offenses

• Other health effects: hematologic, cardiovascular,

immunologic, endocrine, etc

The Cost

• “For childhood lead poisoning, $5.9 million in medical care costs, as

well as an additional $50.9 billion (sensitivity analysis: $44.8–$60.6

billion) in lost economic productivity resulting from reduced cognitive

potential from preventable childhood lead exposure.”

• “The present value of Michigan’s economic losses attributable to lead

exposure in the 2009 cohort of 5 year-olds ranges from $3.19 (using

U.S. blood lead levels) to $4.85 billion (using Michigan blood lead

levels) per year in loss of future lifetime earnings.”

Lead in Water

• Increasing as source of lead, because of success in

controlling other sources.

• Increasing due to aging water infrastructures, change in

water sources, disinfectant uses, etc

• Disproportionally impacts developmentally-vulnerable

formula-fed infants and pregnant mothers

• For about 25% of infants drinking formula made from tap water at

10 ppb, blood lead would rise above the CDC level of concern of 5

micrograms/deciLiter (or ug/dL).

• Increase in fetal death and reduced birth weights

RESEARCH

FINDINGS

Results of Pediatric Blood Lead Levels (BLL)

• Methods

• Data from all blood lead levels processed at Hurley Medical Center

• HMC Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved

• All children 5 years of age and younger

• Zip codes 48501-48507

• Two periods of comparison:

• PRE-SWITCH: January 1, 2013 – September 15, 2013

• POST-SWITCH: January 1, 2015 – September 15, 2015

• Analyzed % Elevated Blood Lead (EBL)

• EBL = Blood lead Levels > 5 g/dL

• EBL analysis conducted based on scientific literature (most notably

DC lead in water exposure)

Blood Lead Level Analysis

• Large sample size

• N= 1746 for Flint children (pre n=906, post n=840)

• N= 1670 for non-Flint children (pre n=943, post n=727)



Flint results for children 5 years and under:

• PRE-SWITCH % EBL: 2.1% (consistent with MDHHS data 2.2)

• POST-SWITCH % EBL: 4.0%

• p < 0.05; STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

High Risk Zip Codes Results

• Focus on zip codes

(48503 and 48504) with

high water lead levels

• Total n=742, pre n=394,

post n=348

– Results:

• PRE-SWITCH % EBL:

2.5%

• POST-SWITCH % EBL:

6.3%

• p < 0.05; STATISTICALLY

SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

What was rest of county doing?

• Analysis of same time periods for Genesee County

children who live outside of City of Flint zips codes (non

48501-48507)

• N=1670 for non-Flint children (pre n=943, post n=727)

Non-Flint results for children 5 years and under:

• PRE-SWITCH % EBL: 0.6%

• POST-SWITCH % EBL: 1.0%

• p = 0.637; NO CHANGE

• % EBL all children less than 5 years of age

Conclusions from BLL analysis

• % of children with EBL in Flint has increased

• Most striking increase in zip codes with highest water lead levels

• Results underestimate risk: infants not screened for lead

and water usage unknown.

• Accurate exposure largely unknown since national childhood lead

screening focuses on household lead exposure (paint, soil, dust) at

later ages (1 and 2 yrs)

• Results are consistent and concerning. Primary

prevention has failed.

Next Steps

• Immediately limit further exposure

• Encourage breast feeding

• No tap water for high risk groups: infants on formula &

pregnant mothers

• Declare health advisory: allows for additional resources

and public education

• Distribution of lead clearing NSF-approved filters

• Public education regarding precautions (flushing, etc)

• Re-connect to Lake Huron water source ASAP

And Makayla…

• Asymptomatic now

• But what will her future hold

and an entire generation of

Flint children?
