U.S. Senate: LDA Reports
Section 209 of HLOGA requires the Secretary of the Senate to make all documents filed under the LDA, as amended, available to the public over the Internet. The information and documents may be accessed in two ways. A researcher with a specific query in mind may use the query system, which has been expanded from that available prior to January 1, 2008. A researcher who is interested in downloading the Secretaryâ€™s lobbying documents database may do so by clicking below. Please note that the downloadable lobbying documents files include all documents received during a given calendar quarter. The lobbying documents database includes the lobbying registrations (LD-1) and reports (LD-2).

The contributions database is limited to the documents filed under section 203 of HLOGA (LD-203), the first of which is required to be filed by registrants and lobbyists by July 30, 2008.
