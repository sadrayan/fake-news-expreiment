CAIR Civil Rights Reports
CAIR began documenting anti-Muslim incidents following the 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, when some commentators initially blamed Muslims for the bombing. Before the real perpetrators were identified, unsubstantiated rhetorical links sparked a wave of anti-Muslim hysteria that resulted in almost 250 incidents of harassment, discrimination and actual violence against American Muslims or those perceived to be Middle Eastern.

CAIR documented the anti-Muslim backlash following the Oklahoma City bombing in a report called "A Rush to Judgment." That account was the first of CAIR's annual reports on the status of American Muslim civil rights.

CAIR's reports on the status of Muslim civil rights in America from 1996 through 2009 can be found below. In 2010, CAIR initiated a review and update of its civil rights database. This included adding Islamophobia classifications and reviewing the current civil rights case classification definitions. Civil rights data for 2010 can be found in our first Islamophobia report.
