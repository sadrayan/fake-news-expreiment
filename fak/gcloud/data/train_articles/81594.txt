Medicare: A Timeline of Key Developments
1985: The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) made Medicare coverage mandatory for newly hired state and local government employees. In addition, COBRA established the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which required hospitals participating in Medicare operating active emergency rooms to provide appropriate medical screenings and stabilizing treatments. 1985: The Emergency Extension Act of 1985 froze PPS payment rates for inpatient hospital care and continued physician payment freezes to slow the growth of Medicare spending. 1985:

• Medicare Part A deductible: $400/year

• Medicare Part B premium: $15.50/month

• Total Medicare population: 31.1 million beneficiaries 1986: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA 1986) revised several of the payment procedures for various Medicare services in order to help slow the growth in Medicare spending. 1987: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987) imposed quality standards for Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes - in response to well-documented quality problems facing seniors in nursing homes. OBRA 87 also modified payments to providers under Medicare as part of the deficit reduction legislation. 1987: The Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987 was enacted to improve antifraud efforts and strengthen beneficiary protection programs. 1987: The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 froze Medicare payment rates in an attempt to slow Medicare spending. 1988: The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, the largest expansion of the program since the enactment of Medicare, included an outpatient prescription drug benefit and a cap on beneficiaries' out-of-pocket expenses, and expanded hospital and skilled nursing facility benefits. Medicaid began coverage of Medicare premiums and cost-sharing for Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level, known as Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB). The U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care (which became known as "Pepper" Commission after the late Congressman Claude Pepper of Florida) was established to assess the feasibility of a long-term care benefit under Medicare.

QMB benefits were retained. 1989: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 1989) established the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) for physicians, replacing charge-based payments.

OBRA 1989 also included a number of other provisions designed to slow the growth in Medicare spending.
