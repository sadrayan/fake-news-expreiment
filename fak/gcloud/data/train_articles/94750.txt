Protect your Vehicle

Always lock your vehicle and take your keys.

Never leave your car running and unattended.

Park in a well-lit area.

Take valuables with you when you are not in your vehicle.

Keep valuables out of sight.

Give parking attendants the ignition key only. Keep your trunk and glove box locked at all times. If possible, get separate keys for the ignition and the trunk and glove box.

Install an anti-theft device. Many insurance companies may give you a discount for certain anti-theft devices. Check with your agent for details.
