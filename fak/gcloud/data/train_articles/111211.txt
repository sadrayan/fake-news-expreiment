“ ” I still don't know whether Adams really and truly believes in the nonsense he promotes. I really don't and still can't tell.

NaturalNews.com[note 1] and its sister site WakingScience.com are websites run by Mike Adams (self-labeled "The Health Ranger") which promotes alternative medicine and related conspiracy theories.[2] Even other quacks think it's a quack site.[3] The site particularly specializes in vaccine denialism and the alleged vaccines-autism link,[4] AIDS/HIV denialism,[5] quack cancer treatments,[6] and conspiracy theories about "Big Pharma".[7] If there's an alternative medicine or alternative medical treatment out there, you can guarantee that NaturalNews has one article singing its praises to the sky and one more bashing the stupid "skeptics".

In short: If you cite NaturalNews on any matter whatsoever, you are almost certainly wrong.

Health beliefs [ edit ]

Adams is a flat-out opponent[8] of modern medicine[9] and opposes any long-term medication[10] or doctor visits.[11][12] Adams calls himself a "holistic nutritionist".[13] In short, Adams opposes:

A recurring theme is the contrast between the site's exacting criticism of evidence-based medicine and its unquestioning acceptance of the appeal to nature, New Age and alternative medicine.[30] (Adams himself supports both quantum healing[31] and quantum consciousness.[32]) This often involves rejection of the scientific method's application to medicine as "inherently flawed,"[33] repudiating the entire philosophy of modern medicine post-Pasteur.[34] Adams is a firm germ theory denialist.[35][36][37] Adams also conflates evidence-based medicine in general, the failings of Big Pharma, and the US health insurance system: to him, it's all a monolithic entity called "mainstream medicine."[38] The site blames the pharmaceutical industry for all vaguely drug-linked celebrity deaths rather than looking at any surrounding factors.[39][40][41][42]

The response to any alternative medicine claim, however, is blind acceptance, whether the topic at hand is homeopathy,[43] chiropractic,[44] dental woo,[45] aspartame scares,[46] vitamin woo,[47] anti-vaccination panic[4][48][49] or detox diets.[50]

Vaccines [ edit ]

Adams has argued that "detoxing" after vaccination will let you avoid their bad effects:[51]

If you’re being forced to take a vaccine against your will (by a totalitarian medical regime like California), are there things you can do to protect yourself from vaccine toxins? [....] The key to surviving this assault on your body is to eliminate these chemicals quickly. In this video filmed at our Consumer Wellness Center Laboratories, I reveal nutritional strategies for accelerating your body’s natural detox so that you can safely survive a vaccine assault that’s forced upon you by a coercive, fascist medical regime.

Yet surely this would mean that he would be OK with compulsory vaccination, if the government just handed out free detox afterward.

Conspiracy theories [ edit ]

NaturalNews also features many Big Pharma conspiracy theories,[7][52][53] believing that there is no depth Big Pharma will not sink to, no lie too big for them to tell, in order to poison American citizens and cover up their "junk science."[54] Adams claims that the pharmaceutical industry is creating HIV vaccines with the sole purpose of creating as many HIV positive people as possible to sell anti-retroviral drugs to at a huge profit.[55] Mammographic screening creates cancer, which is then expensively treated for big profit.[56][57][58][59] He considers that chemotherapy warrants criminal prosecution.[60][61][62]

More recent conspiracy theories claim that Bill Gates and Microsoft are in the process of developing weaponized, ethnically-targeted influenza viruses as part of a sinister eugenics plot.[63] No, really. Adams also manages to misinterpret attempts to develop reversible forms of male contraceptives as deliberate attempts to permanently sterilize minorities.[64]

His reaction to Angelina Jolie's preventive double mastectomy due to having the BRCA1 gene mutation was predictable: the quoted 87% probability that she would come down with breast cancer was irrelevant, since diet and lifestyle changes can magically suppress BRCA1 expression. And of course, oncologists are cast as the quacks here, not fine upstanding people like Adams.[65][66]

The site has also claimed that "the UK government is run by criminal pedophiles who rely on Muslim pedo networks to provide a steady supply of nine and ten-year-old little girls and boys". Because that's the only possible reason they'd try and stop Tommy Robinson from promoting hate and disrupting criminal trials.[67]

Other woo [ edit ]

Adams' love for woo isn't restricted to medicine. Cold fusion and so-called free energy ideas and devices like the Energy Catalyzer are presented on his website with the same enthusiasm as the latest alternative medicine fad.[68][69] He collects news about chemtrails.[70] He is a 9/11 truther,[71] Birther,[72] and pretty much everything else-er. Also a Sandy Hook denialist.[73] He considers Alex Jones, Jeff Rense, and David Icke to be "REAL heroes",[74] and Icke[75] and whale.to[76] to be reliable sources. Curiously, he supports Ron Paul, who is a real medical doctor and not a practitioner of woo (in the field of medicine). This could be because Paul supports "health freedom,"[77] despite Adams simultaneously supporting health care reform and Cuba's health care system.[78]

NaturalNews advances a hard green position, even though the site also promotes global warming denialism.[79] To top it off, Adams promotes conspiracy theories about gun control.[80]

He thinks Scientology is treated unfairly.[81][82] According to Adams, this is due to attempts by anti-religious bigots and (you guessed it) Big Pharma to oppress their belief system in order to protect their profits.

As well as Sandy Hook, Adams has also issued his informed opinion of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shootings, declaring that they were "obviously" staged, or perhaps that the killer, James Holmes, was involved in "experimental" neuroscience that got out of hand.[83] Furthermore, he says the 2013 attacks on the Boston Marathon were a false flag operation by "private military contractors."[84]

In 2014 Adams wrote several articles where he tried to prove that the Malaysian airplane disaster in March 2014 was a government cover-up, and that the plane was secretly made into a "stealth weapon", possibly carrying nuclear weapons. He also stated that he believed that the people behind the cover-up could go as far as "secretly sink some aircraft debris in the Indian Ocean so they can "find it"." Even though he believes the passengers might have survived he states that "world governments are rolling out their 'official' stories, there is no question in my mind that they will do anything to support those official stories, even if it means discarding the lives of all the passengers."[85]

The site also tends to predict that any sizable storm heralds the collapse of the economy and the end of civilization.[86][87]

Also, "conventional physics" is a conspiracy of the same sort as conventional medicine.[88]

Also transphobia. But of course.[89]

Birtherism [ edit ]

In 2011, NaturalNews embraced birtherism, asserting that Barack Obama's birth certificate was fake:[90]

… it's so fake that the whole thing has become an IQ test for figuring out how many people can be so easily fooled by a fake… If I turned in a document like this as part of an effort to get a home loan, for example, and I assembled it layer by layer with obvious cutting and pasting of numbers from multiple sources in order to fake my reported income levels, I would be guilty of a felony crime. At the very least, I would be laughed out of the room. "Are you kidding me? This is your best attempt at falsifying an income statement?" they would say. Even a high school kid with a scanner and Photoshop knows how to make a more convincing forgery than this.

Adams took this as the ideal opportunity for a piece of truly biting social commentary about the fakeness of modern American life.

Couples are now artificially fertilized (fake conception!), and when their children are born, they feed them fake milk (infant formula). They grow up on fake sweeteners and fake (artificial) colors. In school, they're taught fake U.S. history so that they have fake ideas of how the world really works. When they're old enough, they get to participate in faked voting schemes where the winners are already determined. And thanks to the internet, we live in a world of fake friends, fake emotions and fake sex. Football games are played on fake grass, and today's "reality" TV shows are all faked, too. Professional wrestling is fake (but MMA isn't), and most of the news consumed by the masses is entirely fabricated. Even the science behind most of modern medicine is faked, fabricated or twisted around in order to get the results the drug companies want to see. And oh yeah, the drugs are faked, too, especially the antidepressants which appear to work only because of the placebo effect — which is real, even though it only exists in the mind. For the most part, we are fake people living in a fake world engaged in fake interactions. So why shouldn't we have a fake President with a fake birth certificate to top it all off? I don't know what the problem is here with the obviously fake birth certificate. Of course it's a fake. But isn't that what we vote for when we vote for any president? After all, presidential election campaigns are all about making fake promises uttered with fake smiles as part of faked speeches that are actually written by somebody else and read on the teleprompter.[90]

Between 2011 and 2014, Adams decided that having this post up was rather damaging. But, if he just deleted it or at least took a shred of responsibility for it, that would also be embarrassing. Instead, the post was updated with a totally believable explanation of why he was a birther and now isn't:[91]

The article which originally appeared here has been removed because it is no longer aligned with the science-based investigative mission of Natural News. In late 2013 / early 2014, Mike Adams (the Health Ranger), editor of Natural News, transitioned from outspoken activist to environmental scientist. He now runs the Natural News Forensic Food Lab, conducting world-class food science research and publishing scientific papers on food contaminants and nutritional analytics. Through scientific investigation powered by university-level analytical instrumentation, Adams found that, much like the majority of the population, he had been suffering over the past several years from chronic exposure to cumulative toxic elements found in the food supply, including in many organics and "superfoods." His findings — as well as breakthrough discoveries about food toxicology, protective food nutrients and the cognitive influences of food contaminants — are being published at NaturalNews.com. Notably, Adams found that exposure to toxic elements in foods altered his mindset, outlook on life and degree of happiness in the world. "I now know that much of my outlook on the world was being negatively shaped by toxic elements found not just in everyday foods, but also in some superfoods and dietary supplements," Adams now explains.

That is: the consumption of evil toxin-filled foods — as ascertained by "university-level analytical instrumentation" — caused Adams to become so delirious and susceptible to strange beliefs that he believed that President Obama's birth certificate was fake. Unfortunately, it seems that some toxic metals remain in Adams, since all of the other articles on NaturalNews continue to show the mind-altering symptoms.

Creative endeavors [ edit ]

One of the more ridiculous features of NaturalNews are Adams' cartoons, which are even less entertaining than Mallard Fillmore or The Far Left Side.[92] These ran until 2011. They are usually followed by paragraph after paragraph of Adams having to explain the cartoon to an audience who otherwise wouldn't find them "funny," let alone care. Thankfully he did't do much of the actual art, that mostly having been handled by Dan Berger of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fame, unfortunately.[93]

More ridiculous still is the "Music" section on NaturalNews, where Adams posts hip-hop videos and songs he wrote about the alternative quackery of the day. Most of the so-called "music" is cheap-sounding hip-hop injected with Mike's screeds about how terrible vaccines and antidepressants are.[94] Just like his cartoons, his hiphop postings are also followed by paragraphs of his own self-aggrandizement and boring explanations of his works for those who didn't care to listen to the actual song.

As far as poetry is concerned, Adams' creativity is unbounded.[95][96]

Other activities [ edit ]

Good Gopher [ edit ]

See the main article on this topic: GoodGopher

GoodGopher is a search engine produced by Mike Adams that blocks out reality-based information "propaganda". Enter any topic of skeptical (not just alt-med) interest and it will return the very finest crank information available.

Legal threats [ edit ]

Adams has threatened legal action against one of his many critics, Jon Entine (who, of course, published the threat in full):[97]

As you are now well aware, you are about to be named in a personal lawsuit which will cite the extensive body of your defamation and cyber bullying efforts, all of which have been archived and time stamped for court evidence. You can count on this lawsuit requiring considerable resources of your time and money for the foreseeable future. You are no doubt also aware that I have many friends in law enforcement and that we are simultaneously pursuing an effort to have you arrested and charged with cyber bullying crimes. I honestly cannot say for sure whether such an effort will be successful, but it is one of the areas we are actively pursuing against you. … I do not know if you are are rational person, but if you are, then I invite you to discuss a private settlement agreement with me which would allow us both to focus our efforts elsewhere.

Jon Entine was neither intimidated nor impressed:[98]

If Adams is true to his claim that he’s a new man, committed to serving science, he may have no choice but to sue himself for defamation. … Will Adams sue himself for libeling himself? After all, if his goal is to put anti-science purveyors out of business — and those who he claims present “blatantly fictional, distorted or wildly exaggerated” anti-science information—why not go after the person who many scientists and journalists contend is the most egregious perpetrator of “cyber bullying” and “harassment.” … Yes, science needs you, Mike. Please, send yourself a libel threat letter. Let’s shut that quack down.

Twitter silliness [ edit ]

In 2010, Adams was nominated in the Shorty Awards, basically a popularity contest for Twitter users. Adams had the most votes in the health category, closely followed by fellow alt-med guru Joseph Mercola. Skeptics decided to vote up Rachel Dunlop, a skeptical doctor from Australia,[99][100] getting her to the top of the health charts.

Adams and Mercola started pouting went vote-canvassing; hundreds of their supporters turned up, created new accounts, and were promptly disqualified, as only existing accounts were allowed to vote. When Dunlop won, Adams was most upset and responded with a list of what "skeptics" believe:[101][102][103]

Skeptics believe that many six-month-old infants need antidepressant drugs. In fact, they believe that people of all ages can be safely given an unlimited number of drugs all at the same time: Antidepressants, cholesterol drugs, blood pressure drugs, diabetes drugs, anti-anxiety drugs, sleeping drugs and more -- simultaneously!



Skeptics believe that the human body has no ability to defend itself against invading microorganism and that the only things that can save people from viral infections are vaccines.

Email spam [ edit ]

Adams sells software to evade spam blockers through his company Arial Software.[104] Does Adams admit responsibility for spam? No, he prefers to blame those who buy spammed products, rather than the spammers actually sending the stuff.[105]

Audio and video [ edit ]

Adams also owns NaturalNews Radio and NaturalNews TV, the same stuff via streaming and video, in case Mike's flock ever wanted more of his disinformation wisdom. The star of his 2017 movie "Biosludged" is human excrement. As of March 3, 2018, however, Youtube has taken down his entire Health Ranger channel.[106]

Brighteon [ edit ]

Adams created an alternative to YouTube originally called REAL.video, but later renamed to Brighteon in October 2018 accompanying the opening of his new food and supplement store, BrighteonStore. He created this site in response to "censorship" on YouTube, especially that of his good friend Alex Jones. Jones livestreams moved to this site after his ban. The site mostly has conservative channels. Conspiracy theories thrive on this site as well.

Survivalism [ edit ]

More recently, Adams has been branching out into survivalism and fearmongering about a potential technological or economic collapse of the United States, including founding or partnering with several specialized news sites devoted to those topics, such as Collapse.News(redirect) in August 2015, Bugout.News(redirect) in November 2015, and so on.

This has absolutely nothing to do with Adams being the founder and owner of the online store RangerGear.com,[107] your source for "Quality, affordable prepping and survival gear of the highest possible quality [sic] personally tested by the Health Ranger" since November 2015. Nothing at all.

Hoggwatch [ edit ]

Adams created a webshite to push negative (and false) stories about David Hogg, a survivor of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.[108]

Temporary removal from Google [ edit ]

From around the 23rd of February 2017 naturalnews.com no longer appeared in Google search results.[109] This is likely due to a sneaky redirect (for instance, the link in the mobile version in search results does not direct to the same address as the link in the desktop version). Predictably, Mike Adams flipped the table, shrieked, pulled his hair and accused Google as a bully, a pusher of hate speech, censor-happy, insane, hucksters for Big Pharma, killers (because they censor quackery cancer cures), a danger to humanity, and whatever else one can imagine and expect from someone like Mike Adams.[110] It is strange Mike Adams reacted this way; earlier, he had, after all, created his own goddamn search engine because he distrusted "mainstream" search engines. Sadly, naturalnews.com is now listed again in Google search results.[111]

RationalWiki [ edit ]

Some user comments underneath their articles speak rather unfavorably of us. However, their blog article on "Making Healthier Decisions" was kind enough to reference our list of cognitive biases.[112]
