What is Restrictive Masculinity?

Voices Against Violence (VAV) imagines a campus where compassion, understanding, empathy, inclusion, and respect are guiding values for students to develop their own sense of masculine identity. Healthy masculinities include many behaviors rather than one singular idea of "masculinity." Traditional characteristics of masculinity—traits such as independence, strength, resilience and more—are wonderful assets for people of all genders. By encouraging an expanded view of masculinity, there is room for these traits and more.
