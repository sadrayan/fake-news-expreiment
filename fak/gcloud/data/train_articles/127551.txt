Man 'uses raccoon to get around a breathalyser and is then attacked by it'
An irresistable story about a drunk sailor, a breathalyser and a raccoon captivated the internet when this 'document' was posted in an online forum.

It told the sorry tale of a marine who got into a spot of bother with the police in Camp Pendleton, San Diego, over his antics with a raccoon.

An image which was shared widely on Imgur revealed how the inebriated man was served instant karma after thinking he had discovered an ingenious way to get round a breathalyser test.

The hero of the story got a bit too drunk on a night out and, after leaving the bar, decided to drive a vehicle that only opens if you pass a breathalyser test.

According to the 'police document', he failed the test, but then spied a raccoon and decided to put it to use. According to the memo, he 'utlized the raccoon' to blow into the breathalyser.

The poor raccoon then slipped into unconsciousness and he discarded it in the vehicle's footwell as he started the engine.

Unfortunately for the sailor, the animal then awoke and launched a ferocious attack while he was driving.

Apparently, not even a raccoon attack was enough for him to put the brakes on - he continued his leisurely drive until he crashed through a fence and 'came to a stop' in a swimming pool.

According to the police 'document', he was then charged with abuse of a public animal, and drunken or reckless driving.

As stories go, it's pretty unbelievable. If it sounds too good to be true, that's because it is.

A spokesman for the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps has since confirmed this story is an internet hoax.
