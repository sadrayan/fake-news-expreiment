Cory Booker: ‘We Have Different Regulations for Toy Guns and No Regulations for Weapons on Our Street’
EXCERPT:

BOOKER: "This is not something new. We do it in many states. Connecticut did this and they dropped the gun violence in their state by over 40 percent. Deaths by suicide by over 15 percent. There’s nothing that has, in fact, not shown evidence based in this plan that would drive down gun violence and shift the terms of the debate which have been shaped, not by legislators, shaped not by Americans. It’s been shaped by the corporate gun lobby that has an insidious agenda to get more of these killing machines in the hands of people that are going to do harm. And our legislation has been shaped in dramatic ways. Most people don’t know that consumer product safety literally — one industry that’s been exempted is the gun lobby. So we have different regulations for toy guns and no regulations for the weapons on our streets that are killing so many people."
