Barack Obama announces "end" to U.S. war in Iraq: Mark Udall, Michael Bennet weigh in
Today, President Barack Obama, who's due back in Denver next week after a visit late last month, announced the end of the Iraq war, more or less, with the vast majority of U.S. troops due out before 2011 bids adieu. Colorado Senators Mark Udall and Michael Bennet quickly released statements about a moment that's been anticipated for nine years. Here's what they had to say.

Udall's statement:

"I voted against the Iraq war, and I still believe that it ultimately harmed what should have been our military's top priority - our mission in Afghanistan. However, once our forces were committed in Iraq, abandoning that country would have risked the security of the entire region.

"I remain concerned about the security situation in Iraq and believe that keeping a limited number of U.S. troops in place to continue training and assistance would have helped sustain U.S. and Iraqi progress in stemming violence. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will continue to monitor the situation closely.

"It is ultimately unacceptable to expect our troops to provide that assistance without immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts, which has become a sticking point between U.S. and Iraqi negotiators. Our troops have fought and died to establish a functioning democratic government in Iraq, and now we must respect the wishes of Iraq's leaders."
