NOW, HERE IS YOUR DEBATE MONITOR, TODD MCDERMOTT. TODD: GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT FOR THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE. THIS IS THE FINAL DEBATE BEFORE THE AUGUST 28 PRIMARY ELECTION WE ARE BROADCASTING TONIGHT LIVE FROM THE WPBF 25 STUDIOS, HE IN PALM BEACH GARDENS IN PALM BEACH COUNTY. WPBF 25 AND THE FLORIDA PRESS ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME OUR ENTIRE STATEWIDE AUDIENCE TONIGHT. I’M TODD MCDERMOTT, EVENING ANCHOR HERE AT WPBF 25 NEWS, AND AS YOU HEARD THE ANNOUNCER SAY, YOUR MODERATOR TONIGHT. WE WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ALL FIVE CANDIDATES TO OUR WPBF 25 STUDIOS TONIGHT. OVER THE NEXT HOUR THEY WILL BE ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND TOPICS IMPACTING THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. AND JOINING ME TONIGHT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE CANDIDATES OUR PANELISTS, NANCY ANCRUM, EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR OF "THE MIAMI HERALD." AND POLITICAL REPORTER GEORGE BENNETT, FROM THE "PALM BEACH POST." NOW, TO A QUICK RUNDOWN OF THE DEBATE FORMAT TONIGHT. THE CANDIDATES ALREADY KNOW THESE ROLES. EACH CANDIDATE WILL GET 45 SECONDS TO RESPOND TO A QUESTION. CANDIDATES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR 30 SECOND REBUTTALS. FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS, AND THOSE REBUTTALS ARE AT MY DISCRETION. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE TWO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR DECLINED OUR OFFER TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR OWN DEBATE. OUR FIRST QUESTION IS FOR EACH OF THE CANDIDATES, WITH THE ORDER DETERMINED BY A PRIOR DRAWIN WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN WITH MAYOR ANDREW GILLU NEXT YEAR MARKS A QUARTER-CENTURY SINCE THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA ACTUALLY SELECTED A DEMOCRAT AS GOVERNOR. HOW HAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LOST TOUCH WITH THE DEMOCRATIC VOTERS, AND WHY ARE YOU THE BEST CANDIDATE STANDING HERE TONIGHT TO CHANGE THAT? MR. GILLUM I TELL YOU, I DO NOT BUY THAT WE NECESSARILY LOST TOUCH WITH DEMOCRATS. DEMOCRATS NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS WE BELIEVE IN. I AM FROM MIAMI, EVEN THOUGH I AM THE MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA. MY MOTHER WAS A SCHOOL BUS DRIVER AND MY FATHER WAS A CONSTRUCTION WORKER. I WAS THE FIFTH OF SEVENTH KIDS AND THE FIRST TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. I HAVE TO SUBMIT THAT MY EXPERIENCE IN THIS STATE IS MORE LIKE THE VOTERS WE NEED TO WIN THAN ANYBODY ELSE RUNNING. I AM THE ONLY NON-MILLIONAIRE RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. I HAVE A MORTGAGI BELIEVE WE DES THE TAB TO REPRESENT EVERDAY PEOPLE AND THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET REGULAR VOTERS TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS AGAIN. TODD: MAYOR GILLAM, SAME QUESTION TO JEFF GREENE. HOW HAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY LOST TOUCH WITH VOTERS, AND WHERE YOU THE BEST CANDIDATE HERE TONIGHT TO CHANGE THAT? MR. GREENE: WE HAVE NOT LOST TOUCH AT ALL. I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ALIVE AND WELL AND KICKING. PROBLEM IS, WE HAVE BEEN OUTSPENT BY REPUBLICANS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THEY SAY FLORIDA IS A PURPLE STATE OR SWING STATE, IT IS NEITHER. IT IS A BLUE STATE. RICK SCOTT SPENT $120 MILLION. WE LOST BY 1%. THAT WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS YEAR. I HAVE RESOURCES AND I’M FREE TO PUT THEM UP. I AM THUS QUALIFIED BECAUSE I HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE, HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEMS MY WHOLE LIFE, AND I’M PREPARED TO FACE COMPLEX PROBLEMS AS GOVERNOR. TODD THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. GREENE. SAME QUESTION TO YOU, CHRIS KING. MR. KING: TODD, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO WINNING THE CONTEST OF IDEAS IN FLORIDA. THIS IS NOT A MONEY PROBLEM. IT IS NOT ABOUT HAVING MORE MONEY TO GET OUR MESSAGE OUT. IT IS BY PRESENTING A VISION FOR THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. IT IS ABOUT DOING THAT WITH POLITICAL COURAGE. I HAVE ARGUED THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD AT LOSING STATEWIDE ELECTIONS SINCE 200 THIS YEAR WE CAN CHANGE THAT, BUT WE ONLY DO THA IF WE HAVE THE SHOULD TAKE ON SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL INTERESTS IN THIS STATE THAT HAVE STOOD IN THIS -- STUDENT THE WAY OF PROGRESS. IF WE ARE WILLING TO OFFER SOLUTIONS TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISI AND ACCESS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT SO MANY WANTS, THAT IS HOW WE WIN. TODD: THANK YOU, SAME QUESTION TO YOU, MR. LEVINE. IT IS ABOUT LOSING TOUCH WITH DEMOCRATIC VOTERS IN THE STATE. WHERE YOU THE BEST CANDIDATE TO FIX THAT AND BECOME DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF THE STATE? MR. LEVINE: THANK YOU, TODD. I AM THE SON OF A SINGLE MOM, SECOND PERSON IN THE FAMILY TO GRADUATE COLLEGE. I AM A PRODUCT OF FLORIDA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. MY JOURNEY IN LIFE WAS TO TAKE A JOB ON A PUBLIC CRUISESHIP. I STARTED FROM NOTHING THEN I BECAME A TWO-TERM MAYOR. I PASSED THE MINIMUM LIVING WAGE, THOUGHT CRIME AND THE SEA LEVEL RISE. WE HAD THE HIGHEST LGBTQ SCORES IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. WHAT I BRING TO VOTERS IS SOMEONE THAT BRINGS THE BEST OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR NEXT WITH THE BEST OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WHAT PEOPLE WANT OUR POLITICIANS THAT DO NOT TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO, THEY WANT LEADERS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THINGS. I THINK WHAT I BRING IS THAT AUTHENTICITY OF SOMEONE WHO IS ACTUALLY DONE THE THINGS I SAID I DO. TODD MR. LEVINE, THANK YOU. SAME QUESTION TO YOU, MS. GRAHAM. MS. GRAHAM: THANK YOU. FLORIDA, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. AFTER 20 YEARS OF REPUBLICAN RULE OUR SCHOOLS ARE STARK, OUR LAKES AND RIVERS ARE COVERED IN BLUE-GREEN ALGAE, A WOMAN’S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS ON THE LINE. I LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER CANDIDATES ON STAGE. I AM A MOM, FORMER PTA PRESIDENT, SCHOOL BOARD OFFICIAL, AND I SERVED FLORIDA IN CONGRESS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. IT IS TIME TO TAKE OUR STATE BACK. IF YOU ARE READY TO END 20 YEARS OF ONE-PARTY RULE, I AM READY TO LEAD. TODD: THANK YOU. LET’S MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT QUESTION. THIS IS FOR ALL THE CANDIDATES TONIGHT. WE WILL BEGIN WITH YOU, MR. GREENE WHEN SCHOOL STARTS IN FLORIDA IN 10 DAYS, EVERY SCHOOL IS REQUIRED TO HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER ON CAMPUS. LEGISLATOR -- LEGISLATURE PROVIDED MILLIONS TO FUND THAT. IT IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY. HOW WILL WE MAKE SURE EACH SCHOOL IS PROTECTED AND GUARANTEE MONEY IS NOT TAKEN FROM OTHER MEASURES NEEDED TO HARDEN OUR SCHOOLS AGAINST, GOT FOR BID, ANOTHER ATTACK? MR. GREENE: I AM THE FATHER OF THREE YOUNG BOYS. 4, 6, 8 YEARS OLD. WHAT THE NRA AND OTHERS HAVE DONE TO OUR STATE IS SHAMEFUL. LAST WEEK I WAS IN A FIGHT WITH HER BECAUSE SHE CALLED A PROVOCATIVE EMAIL REPULSIVE. I THINK WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS HER PULSE OF, MAKING SCHOOLS UNSAFE. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE HAVE OUR SCHOOLS. SINGLE ENTRY SCHOOLS. ARMED GUARDS. WE CAN’T HAVE TEACHERS WITH GUNS. WE NEED TO PROVIDE REAL SECURITY FOR OUR SCHOOLS. KIDS NEED TO WORRY ABOUT GRADES, NOT GUNS. AS GOVERNOR WE WILL MAKE THAT HAPPEN. THERE IS PLENTY OF MONEY, IT IS JUST A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES. WE WILL MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DEFEND OUR SCHOOLS. TODD: SAME QUESTION TO CHRIS KING. HOW TO MAKE SURE EACH SCHOOL IS PROTECTED, GUARANTEED MONEY IS NOT SIPHONED FROM THE HARDENING, THE LOCKS, THE BULLETPROOF GLAS FENCING, NEEDED TO HARDEN OUR SCHOOLS AGAINST POSSIBLE ATTACK. MR. KING: I HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN IN PUBLIC SCHOOL. IN JUST A COUPLE WEEKS, THEY’LL BE STARTING ANOTHER YEAR. PARENTS ACROSS THE STATE COME UP TO ME AND SAY THEY ARE TERRIFIED ABOUT SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. I BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR CAN DO SO MUCH MORE TO CREATING THE RESOURCES TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. THAT IS WHY I AM SO PROUD OUR CAMPAIGN HAS OFFERED ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS POLICIES IN THIS RACE FOR GOVERNOR. WHAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CALLED A BULLET TAX TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN, BECAUSE WE KNOW FOR THE LAS TWO DECADES THE NRA HAS FLOODED OUR COMMUNITIES WITH AMMUNITION AND FIREARMS. IT IS TIM THEY TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND PAYING FOR THE COST OF PROTECTING OUR FAMILIES. TODD THANK YOU. SAME QUESTION TO YOU, MR. LEVINE. MR. LEVINE FIRST OF ALL, WE NEED TO FORMALIZE THIS PROCESS. AFTER 9/11 OUR GOVERNMENT PUT TOGETHER THE TSA TO SECURE OUR AIR FORCE. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE AN ES IN EDUCATION SECURITYA MINISTRATION, TO FUND OUR SCHOOLS. , PEOPLE SAY, WHAT WILL THAT COST? MY ANSWER IS SIMPLE, WE CANN AFFORD NOT TO DO IT. WE DO NOT WANT TO ARM OUR TEACHERS WITH WEAPONS, BUT BIGGER PAYCHECKS. SAME WAY AT THE AIRPORT, WE DO NOT ASK BAGGAGE HANDLERS TO CARRY GUNS TO SECURE THE AIRPOR WE WILL NOT ASK OUR TEACHERS SHOULD DO THAT, EITHER. WE NEED A MODEL OF THE ESA, THE EDUCATION SECURITY MINISTRATION, WE WILL FUND IT BY CUTTING CORPORATE TAX RATES AND LOOPHOLES. WE WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE PAYS THEIR FAIR SHARE. TODD: A QUESTION TO YOU MS. GRAHAM, IT IS GUARANTEEING MONEY IS NOT TAKEN FROM PAYING FOR THOSE HARDENING METHODS FOR SCHOOLS, BUT MAKING SURE WE FUND ARMED OFFICERS AT EACH AND EVERY FLORIDA’S 4500 SCHOOLS. MS. GRAHAM: THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION, TODD. I AM A MOM AND HAVE LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF PARENTS AS THEY HAVE FEAR ABOUT DROPPING BEAR CHILDREN OFF AT SCHOOL. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I ALSO KNOW THAT THOSE WHO ARE SO ASHEN ABOUT THIS ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE OF FLORIDA, PARTICULARLY THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE STEPPED FORWARD AND THEN A VOICE WE ARE ALL LISTENING TO, WHAT THEY WANT IS ACTION. THEY WANT TO HAVE NOT JUST WORDS OF PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, BUT WHAT YOU GOING TO DO TO MAKE OUR SCHOOL SAFER? I HAVE FOU UP -- A FLORIDA STATUTE THAT ALLOWS THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR, WHOEVER SHE IS, TO HAVE EXECUTIVE ORDER BANNING MILITARY STYLE ASSAULT WEAPONS. I WILL SIGN THAT ORDER, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DO AS GOVERNOR. I HAVE BEEN TOLD I WILL BE SUED BY THE NRA, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I BRING IT ON. TODD: BEFORE WE MOVE ON, I WANT TO ASK YOU MR. GREENE -- MR. GILLUM, I WILL YOU ANSWER AS WELL -- BUT MR. GREENE, IF YOU SIGN THIS ORDER, ONCE THE NRA SUES, WILL A BAN AND UP TIGHT UP IN COURT AND NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE DURING THAT TIME? MS. GRAHAM I ANTICIPATE BEING SUED, BUT IT WILL BE AN ACTIONABLE STATE THE GOVERNOR SHOULD TAKE TO PROTECT OUR SCHOOLS. WE DO NOT NEED THESE WEAPONS OF WAR OUT ON OUR STREETS. IT IS TIME WE TAKE ACTION SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING LIKE WE SAW AT STONEMAN DOUGLAS. I AM COMMITTED TO STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND COUNTRY TO TAKE ACTION FOR THEIR SAFETY. FLORIDA, WHO HAS BEEN FOLLOWING, UNDER CONTROL OF THE GUN LOBBY FOR TOO LONG, TAKES THE LEAD ON THIS, IT IS THE LEAD WE SHOULD TAKE. TODD: I WILL ADDRESS THE ORIGINAL QUESTION TO MAYOR GILLAM --GILLUM HAVE YOU MAKE SURE THE MONEY IS PROTECTED? MR. GILLUM: THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FAILED IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THIS. THEY PASSED A LAW AND THEN FAILED TO FUND IT. THEY HAVE MOVED MORE AND MORE OF OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS OUT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND INTO FOR PROFIT CHARTER SCHOOLS. I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SUED BY THE NRA. THEY HAD ME IN COURT TWO YEARS BECAUSE WE REFUSED TO REPEAL AN ORDINANCE THE CITY SAID, YOU CANNOT SHOOT GUNS IN CITY PARKS. YOU CANNOT SHOOT GUNS IN PARKS WHERE OUR KIDS PLAY AND FAMILIES PICNIC. IN THIS STATE THAT WAS TOO RADICAL A NOTION. WE NEED TO UNDERTAKE ALL THE POWER HOLDER NRA HAS ON THIS STATE. I BEAT THEM ONC AT THE CIRCUIT COURT, A SECOND TIME AT THE APPELLATE COURT. I TOLD THEM, I WILL SEE YOU IN THE SUPREME COURT. WE CANNOT WIN IF WE DO NOT FIGHT. TODD: THANK YOU. I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR PANEL. TORCH BENNETT, START WITH MR. KING. GEORGE: FLORIDA SPENDS A $7,400 PER STUDENT IN ITS PUBLIC EDUCATION BUDGET. WHAT SHOULD THE FIGURE BE, AND KEEP I MIND, IT ADDS A LITTLE MORE THAN $1 BILLION TO THE BUDGET. WHERE WOULD THAT MONEY COME FROM SPECIFICALLY? MR. KING GEORGE, I HAVE PUT FORWARD AN AMBITIOUS POLICY AROUND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE ARGUED IS, WE ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON LOCKING PEOPLE UP, THE COMING ONE OF THE NATION’S LEADERS IN MASS INCARCERATION, AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING THAT MONEY AND PUBLIC EDUCATION AND FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND TRADE SCHOOL. IN ORDER TO RAISE OUR PER PEOPLE SPENDING, I THINK LAST YEAR WE HAD A --DDED 47 CENTS. I’M TALKING ABOUT SAVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM OUR MASS INCARCERATION SYSTEM AND I AM ALSO TALKING ABOUT A BIG, BOLD IDEA TO LEGALIZE AND TAX MARIJUANA, THAT WOULD SAVE ANOTHER $600 MILLION INTO PUBLIC EDUCATION. TODD: I WILL REPEAT THAT NOW TO MR. LEVINE. MR. LEVINE: FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL EXPAND MEDICAID. $500 MILLION A YEAR WE WILL BRING TO FLORIDA. WE WILL MAKE SURE WE STOP ALLOWING CORPORATIONS TO PAY 5.5% TAX TO DIVERT TO OTHER STATES LIKE DELAWARE, WHERE THERE IS ZERO CORPORATE TAX WE WILL START WITH THESE CORPORATE TAX LATE. FLORIDA IS A LOW TAX STATE AND IT SHOULD STAY THAT WAY. WE WILL STOP GIVIN CORPORATE INCENTIVES. WE WILL GIVE MONEY BACK FROM THE LOTTERY, BACK TO SCHOOLS WHERE THEY ALONG. WE WILL STOP INVESTING I SOMEONE ELSE’S BUSINESS, WHICH ARE CALLED CHARTER SCHOOLS, PUT IT BACK IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. YES, WE WILL HAVE SPORTS BETTING TO MAKE SURE THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO NOT LEAVE OUR STATE. AND I BELIEVE WE CAN REGULATE MARIJUANA. AND I COULD KEEP GOING. TODD: GEORGE BENNETT, YOU HAVE A FOLLOW-UP? GEORGE: YOU MENTIONED CHARTER SCHOOLS. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ABOUT 280,000 FLORIDA STUDENTS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS. IF YOU ARE GOVERNOR, WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE STUDENTS? I BELIEVE FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE CERTAIN CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE VERY SPECIFIC, FOLKS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS, SPECIFICALLY NEED CHARTER SCHOOLS. THOSE SCHOOLS WE NEED TO KEEP UNTIL WE HAVE CAPACITY AND ABILITY TO HANDLE PROPERLY THOSE SPECIAL NEEDS. OTHERWISE WE WILL INVEST IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY, MAKE SURE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I THINK WE ARE RANKED 46TH AND OUR TEACHERS MAKE $10,000 LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. TODD I WANT TO LET MS. GRAHAM ANSWER THE ORIGINAL QUESTION, WHAT SHOULD THE SPENDING FIGURE B, KEEPING IN MIND EVERY $4000 PER PUPIL SPENDING ADDS $100 BILLION TO OUR BUDGET. MS. GRAHAM: THANK YOU, TODD. IMC PROUD TO BE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION CANDIDATE ON STAGE. I HAVE BEEN ENDORSED BY THE FLORIDA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. IT IS BECAUSE TEACHERS KNOW, MY COMMITMENT IS TO RESTORE OUR PROMISE TO PUBLIC EDUCATION FROM ONE END OF THE STATE TO ANOTHER. RESOURCES ARE WHERE WE HAVE GOT TO START. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE LOTTERY DOLLARS ARE SPENT AS THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE SPENT, AS ENHANCEMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION, BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR BUDGET AS A WHOLE. WE HAVE AN $89 BILLION BUDGET. I KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS WE CAN SHOW THE PRIORITY OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGAIN IS GOING TO BE OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM, SUPPORTING OUR SCHOOLS, PAYING TEACHERS WHAT THEY DESERVE. THE WAY WE SHOW THAT PRIORITY IS MAKING IT A PRIORITY IN OUR BUDGET. TODD: THANK YOU. SAME QUESTION TO MAYOR GILLUM. MR. GILLUM: PUBLIC EDUCATION MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. I MATRICULATED -- I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY AS THE MAYOR, BU FOR WHAT MY TEACHERS POURED INTO ME. WE SHOULD PAY TEACHERS WHAT THEY ARE WORTH. STARTING SALARIES FOR TEACHERS IN FLORIDA IS 45TH OUT OF 50 IN THE STATE. WE SPEND $45,000 A YEAR FOR A KID TO BE INCARCERATED. I PROPOSE A $1 BILLION INVESTMENT WHICH BEGINS PAYING OUR TEACHERS, BUT ALSO SUPPORTING THE PAY OF OUR SUPPORT STAFF. BECAUSE OF WE DO NOT IMPORT REAL TALENT INTO EDUCATING OUR KIDS, WE CANNOT HOPE FOR A BRIGHTER AND BETTER ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR OUR STATE. TEST HAS TO BEGIN WITH THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. TODD THANK YOU, I WANT TO POSE THE ORIGINAL QUESTION TO MR. GREENE. WHAT IS THE PERFECT SPENDING FIGURE, AND WHERE SHOULD THE ADDITIONAL MONEY COME FROM? MR. GREENE: IT SHOULD BE A LOT MORE THAN $7,400 A STUDENT. THEY DECLARED WAR ON PUBLIC EDUCATION. YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY WON THE WAR. DID YOU KNOW 12TH-GRADERS IN FLORIDA, ONLY 19% CAN DO 12TH GRADE MATH WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN FLORIDA, BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHERE THE MONEY WILL COME FROM IS EASY. IT IS AN $89 BILLION BUDGET. NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE TO STOP THE BILLION DOLLARS WE ARE GIVING TO CHARTER AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. AND THE GOVERNOR’S BUDGET THIS YEAR IS $1.4 BILLION DISCRETIONARY. I AM RUNNING OUT OF TIME -- ANOTHER$800 A CHILD. TODD: I WILL MO ON AND BRING IN ANOTHER PANELIST, NANCY ANCRUM FROM MIAMI HERALD, WHO WAS A QUESTION TO ALL OF THE CANDIDATES, STARTING WITH MR. LEVINE. NANCY: RICK SCOTT CALLED HIMSELF THE JOBS GOVERNR. FLORIDA HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT JOB GROWTH AND UNEMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER, I LIVE IN MIAMI, WHERE ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG NEWS, JOBS ARE EITHER HIGH PAYING OR LOW-WAGE. HOW WILL YOU NARROW THE INCOME INEQUALITY GAP, AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS IN A HIGH COST REGION? MR. LEVINE THANK YOU, NANCY. I HAVE TRAVELED AROUND THE STATE, AND THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR ALL FLORIDIANS. AT $25 MINIMUM WAGE, NO ONE CAN LIVE ON THAT. EVEN WITH THREE JOBS. YES, GOVERNOR SCO DID GREAT A LOT OF JOBS, BUT THEY WERE LOW-PAYING JOBS. I WANT TO CREATE A 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY. I COME FROM MASSACHUSETTS. YOU KNOW WHAT BOSTON HAS A GREAT HIGH-PAYING JOBS? IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY BRIBED THEIR WAY, THEY PAY THEIR TEACHERS I NATIONALL COMPETITIVE RATES AND SALARY, AND THEY HAVE THE GREATEST EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY. IN ORDER FOR US TO CREATE BETTER JOBS WE NEED TO HAVE FIRST OF ALL BETTER EDUCATION, CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE NEED TO CREATE A 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY. TODD: THANK YOU, SAME QUESTION TO YOU, MS. GRAHAM. IT HAS TO DO WITH THE NARROWING THE INEQUALITY GAP IN IMPROVING LIVES FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS IN THIS HIGH-COST ECONOMY. MS. GRAHAM: THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, NANCY. WHEN I HEAR RICK SCOTT SAY JOBS, JOBS, JOBS. I HEAR, YES, YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK THREE JOBS IN FLORIDA JUST TO GET BY. A COUPLE DAYS AGO I SPENT TIME WITH WORKERS AT THE ORLAND AIRPORT AND I HEARD SUCH CHALLENGING STORIES FROM THEM. THEY’RE MAKING LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GET TIPS, BUT THEY ARE NOT TIPPED NEARLY ENOUGH TO AFFORD THEIR RENT, PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE, BUY MEDICATION. WE IN FLORIDA HAVE TO DO BETTER. WE HAVE TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, I WILL FIGHT FOR $15. WE SHOULD PROVIDE PAID SICK LEAVE SO NO PARENT HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILD OR LOSE THEIR JOB. WE HAVE TO BE A COMPASSIONATE STATE AGAIN WHERE WE CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER. WHEN I AM GOVERNOR, IT WILL BE THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA I WAKE UP EVERY DAY WORKING FOR YOU. TODD: MS. GRAHAM, THANK YOU. SAME QUESTION TO MAYOR GILLUM. MR. GILLUM: I HAVE FULLY SUPPORTED A $15 MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS STATE BUT ALSO HAVE TO SAY, I DO NOT KNOW A PERSON WHO ONCE TO EARN MINIMUM. EVERYONE I KNOW WHO WANTS TO WORK A JOB AND A JOB WITH DIGNITY, WHERE THEY CAN GET A WAGE AND TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND FAMILIES, I REMEMBER GROWING WATCHING MY MOTHER AND FATHER TRADE BETWEEN WHICH BILLS THEY COULD PAY BEFORE SOMETHING GOT CUT OFF, WORKING FULL-TIME JOBS. THAT IS NO WAY TO LIVE AND WE HAVE TO IMPROVE THIS ECONOMY BY TRUTHFULLY RECOGNIZING FLORIDA CANNOT JUST BE A CHEAP DATES STATE. WE HAV TO PAY PEOPLE WHAT THEY ARE WORTH. I HAVE AN INITIATIVE TO MAKE SURE WE TRAIN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, SKILLE LABOR, SO WHEN THEY GRADUATE, IF THEY ARE NOT ON THE WAY TO COLLEGE, THEY HAVE A SKILL TO MONETIZE AND EARN A GOOD WAGE. THAT IS HOW WE PULL THIS STATE UP. NOT FOR SOME, BUT FOR EVERYBODY. TODD: MR. GREENE, SAME QUESTION. MR. GREENE: HE DID NOT CREATE ANY JOBS. WHEN BARACK OBAMA BECAME PRESIDENT, LET’S FACE IT, MITCH MCCONNELL SAID, WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO NOT ALLOW ANY FISCAL PROBLEMS. WHEN YOU PRINT THAT MUCH MONEY, YOU GET CHEAP, LOW-PAYING JOBS. THAT IS WHY THEY COME TO FLORIDA, NOT BECAUSE OF RICK SCOTT. IF YOU WANT BETTER JOBS, IT IS SIMPLE, BETTER EDUCATION. THINK ABOUT IF YOU ARE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU DO? YOU GOOGLE FLORIDA SCHOOLS. YOU SEE 40TH IN THE COUNTRY. GUESS WHAT? YOU MOVE ONTO ANOTHER ONE. WHEN I AM GOVERNOR I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE TOP FIVE SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. I PROMISE YOU, THE GOOD PAYING JOBS WILL BE COMING TO FLORIDA. TODD: THE QUESTION MR. KING. NARROWING THE INCOME INEQUALITY GAP IN IMPROVING LIVES OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS IN THE STATE? MR. KING: NANCY, I THINK WE SHARE A LOT OF OPINIONS ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO. WHAT I WOULD ARGUE, WE HAVE NOT HAD A GOVERNOR WITH THE POLITICAL COURAGE TO STAND UP TO THOSE FORCES THAT KEEP CREATING THOSE LOW-WAGE JOBS. THIS IS ONE OF MY DIFFERENCES WITH CONGRESSWOMAN GRAHAM. I WAS STUNNED TO READ OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THAT HER COMPANY WAS BUILDING THE AMERICAN DREAM WALL IN YOUR COMMUNITY, NANCY, MIAMI. A MEG MALL, THE LARGEST MALL IN THE COUNTRY, THAT WILL BE A MECCA FOR LOW-WAGE JOBS, BUILT ON THE EDGE OF THE EVERGLADES. YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS STUFF UP. WE CAN SAY ONE THING, BUT WHEN LEADERS DO ANOTHER, IT UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO TRANSFORM THE FUTURE OF FLORIDA. THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING WE NEED COURAGE IN FLORIDA. TODD: A REBUTTAL? MS. GRAHAM: ABSOLUTELY. I AM SO PROUD OF MY FAMILY’S SERVICE AND PUBLIC SERVICE HERE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. I HAVE TAKEN EVERY STEP TO MAKE SURE ANY CONFLICT OF INTEREST, ANY CONFLICT, IS ONE THAT CANNOT GO ANYWHERE. I HAVE REMOVED MYSELF FROM MY FAMILY COMPANY. I HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO PUT EVERYTHING I HAVE IN A TRUST. I WILL MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WAGES UNDERMINE MINISTRATION, THEY WILL BE $15 AN HOUR TO A STRAIGHT -- UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION, THEY WILL BE $15 AN HOUR. TODD: I HAVE TO LIMIT YOUR ANSWERS TO 30 SECONDS. WE HAVE SO MUCH TO GET TO BEFORE THE FIRST BREAK. THIS GOES YOU, MS. GRAHAM, BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WILL STAND UP TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. HOW EXACTLY WILL YOU STAND UP TO PRESIDENT, HOW WILL THAT BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA? AND HOW WILL YOU DO SO WHILE YOU PAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DUES TO MAR-A-LAGO CLUB? I DO NOT PAY THAT. I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO STOOD UP BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION ON CNBC I SAID WHAT I FELT. I WOULD BE SCARED TO DEATH TO HAVE DONALD TRUMP IS MY PRESIDENT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, IT COULD NOT BE WORSE. I HAVE STOOD UP TO HIM SINCE. WHOEVER IS GOVERNOR BETTER STAND UP TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE IS ORGANIZING THESE SQUADS THAT ARE TEARING CHILDREN OUT OF THEIR MOTHER’S ARMS AT THE BORDERS. TODD: YOU HAVE GONE 30 SECONDS. WE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME, I APOLOGIZE. MR. KING, SAME QUESTION STANDING UP TO THE PRESIDENT, HOW DOES IT BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA? MR. KING: WE NEED A GOVERNOR THAT STANDS UP WITH COURAGE AND INTEGRITY AND VISIO THAT IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP DEMANDS, BASED ON THE WAY HE LEADS. HE CALLED HIMSELF DONA TRUMP’S WORST NIGHTMARE, BUT AFTER HE WAS ELECTED, HE CALLED HIM A GREAT GUY WHO HE WAS BEHIND 100%. IT IS OK TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT, BUT WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO A GUY WHO WE OBVIOUSLY ALL HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH. TODD: THANK YOU, SAME QUESTION TO MR. LEVINE. MR. LEVINE: I HAVE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT. DURING HILLARY’S ELECTION I SPENT A YEAR AND A HALF FIGHTING DONALD TRUMP TO TRYING TO HAVE THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT. -- SAID HE WAS A GREAT GUY. A GREAT GUIDE? HE MOCKED TO DISABLED PEOPLE, INSULTED EVERY WOMAN IN AMERICA. HE DID WORSE THAN THAT. HE CALLED JOHN MCCAIN A COWARD. HE SAID HE ACCEPTED DAVID DUKE’S ENDORSEMENT. SERIOUSLY? THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE MORE LIKE DONALD TRUMP. JEFF, ONE TRUMP IS ENOUGH. MR. GREENE: PHILIP, FIRST OF ALL, I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS STOOD UP TO DONALD TRUMP. THAT IS NONSENSE ABOUT YOUR SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON. WHEN DID YOU STAND UP TO DONALD TRUMP? WHEN I WAS RUNNING FOR SENATE IN 2010 YOU GAVE MONEY TO MARCO RUBIO. YOU SUPPORTED A REPUBLICAN OF FLORIDA AND YOU ARE COMPLAINING I STOOD UP TO DONALD TRUMP? I DID EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID OR HILLARY CLINTON DID THE SAME DAY WHEN I SAID, WE HAVE TO STAND BEHIND OUR NEW LEADER. I HOPE WHEN I BECOME GOVERNOR -- TODD: THANK YOU, SIR. I WANT TO GO TO MS. GRAHAM TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON STANDING UP TO THE PRESIDENT. MS. GRAHAM: AS A MOM I AM APPALLED WITH WHAT THIS PRESIDENT REPRESENTS. WE CAN NEVER NORMALIZE IT, NEVER MAKE IT OK, BECAUSE HE IS SPEAKING TO THE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS. I HAVE CALLED DONALD TRUMP AN EMBARRASSMENT. I RECOGNIZE WE HAVE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE HAVE HAD PRESIDENTS, REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, MAYBE WE DID NOT AGREE ON EVERYTHING, BUT WE KNEW THEY HAD THE COUNTRY’S BEST INTERESTS AT HEART. I DO NOT FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. WHEN YOU ARE RIPPING BABIES OUT OF THE ARMS OF MOTHERS, YOU ARE RUNNING UP AGAINST MOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- TODD: I HAVE TO HAVE YOU STOPPED. -- STOP THERE. MR. MAYOR? MR. GILLUM: I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE ON THIS STAGE THAT WAS ACTUALLY -- WHO HAS CALLED FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE DONALD TRUMP. I CALLED FOR THAT IMPEACHMENT A IT WAS CLEAR HE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE IN THE FIRING OF JIM COMEY. I AM NO FAN OF JIM COMEY NECESSARILY, BUT THERE IS RULE OF LAW IN THIS PRESIDENT BROKE IT. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT STANDING UP TO THE PRESIDENT, YOU CAN FOLLOW MY LEAD. DONALD TRUMP A DANGER TO HIMSELF AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, THE REST OF THE WORLD. HE IS UNDESERVING OF THE TITLE. TODD: THAT IS ALL THE TIME FOR THIS PART. ONE BREATH, ONE SIP OF WATER. A SHORT BREAK, RIGHT BACK WITH MORE QUESTIONS FOR THE CANDIDATES. YOU’RE WATCHING "THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE
