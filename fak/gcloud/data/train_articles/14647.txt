Comstock Votes To Repeal Death Tax
Washington, DC- Congresswoman Barbara Comstock (R-VA) issued the following statement on the passage of H.R. 1105, The Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015 - a bill Comstock cosponsored. This important piece of legislation permanently repeals the 40% tax on family owned businesses and property that is imposed currently at the time of the owner’s death - which often puts a family in tough financial circumstances and threatens a lifetime of work and achievement. This legislation passed the House by a vote of 240 to 179.

“Imagine building up a family business or family farm your whole life only to lose much of that business upon the death of Mom or Dad. Under current law, Uncle Sam swoops in and can take up to 40% of what you spent a lifetime building up for your children and grandchildren. Today we voted to stop that injustice.

“Family businesses are the backbone of the American economy and should not be punished for saving responsibly and investing in our country. This legislation provides hardworking families and small businesses with the economic security they need to create jobs and grow our economy. No longer will families be forced to sell parts of their farms and small businesses in order to pay an unfair tax to the government due to the death of a loved one.

“The Death Tax is double taxation on income already earned and taxed as well as an undue burden on American families. With passage of this legislation, those who own family farms and small businesses will be able to plan ahead for their future and pass along their hard earned businesses to their children and grandchildren.”
