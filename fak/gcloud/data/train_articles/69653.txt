Brody File Exclusive: Marco Rubio On Life Issue: "I would rather lose an election than be wrong on that issue”
In video that you will only see on The Brody File, Marco Rubio says when it comes to the life issue, “I would rather lose an election than be wrong on that issue.” Rubio made the comments to Iowa pastors last week in Cedar Rapids. The Brody File has the exclusive video below. The American Renewal Project, an influential evangelical organization concerned about the slide of Judeo-Christian principles in this country, sponsored the pastors meeting with Rubio.

Overall, Rubio does not require certain exceptions that might come with pro-life legislation but he told pastors (like he has in the past) that he would sign bills that have exceptions because saving lives is the priority. “I stood up on a debate stage and was challenged about the fact that I don’t require that there to be an exception for rape or incest and this is a tough position. I have said that I will vote for bills that have exceptions because they save lives. The 20-week abortion ban has exceptions and I’ll vote for anything that saves lives but I don’t require it. That is not a majority position even in the Republican Party but I just don’t feel that this is a political issue, I really don’t. But I will support bills that have exceptions because I’m in favor of anything that protects life. These are not politically easy issues and I get a lot of free advice about how I need to moderate on these things in order to win but it’s not a political issue for me. It’s just not and I’m not going to change my position on it for anyone. If I were to change my position on either one of those issues you mentioned (Life and marriage), forget about campaigns it would put me in direct conflict with my church and it would put me in direct conflict with what I teach my children.”
