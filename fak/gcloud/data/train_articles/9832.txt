January 15, 2014, Miami, Florida. The Hispanic vote will make a difference in the 2014 elections, and Rick Scott's selection of Carlos Lï¿½pez-Cantera as his Lieutenant Governor shows that he understands how important our vote is. However, his selection of a Hispanic lieutenant governor cannot cover up all the harm Rick Scott, his administration and the Florida Republican Party have caused Hispanic families. And more so when his new lieutenant governor has passionately promoted during his tenure in the state legislature, the same failed policies that have come out of the governor's mansion during the past four years. In 2011, Lopez-Cantera staunchly supported HB 7089, the anti-immigrant bill modeled after the racial profiling Arizona law, which Rick Scott embraced during his first governor's race. Lopez-Cantera called it a "common sense" and "reasonable" bill in a press release on March 10, 2011. * The governor vetoed a bill that would have restored the right to obtain a drivers licence for all immigrants. This veto not only affects Hispanic families, but all Floridians who now pay exorbitant car insurance premiums because we have many unlicensed and uninsured drivers. http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/rick-scott-vetoes-immigrant-driver-license-bill/2124859 * The governor has denied thousands of Hispanic students the opportunity to attend college. These measures condemn our families to low paying jobs that will affect Florida's economy for generations. http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/college/bright-futures-changes-could-impact-thousands-of-hispanic-and-black/2112765 * The governor purged from the voter rolls thousands of Hispanics who were qualified voters, simply for partisan reasons. http://nbclatino.com/2013/08/12/opinion-florida-voter-suppression-is-a-disgrace/ Rick Scott can change the name of his running mate on the ballot to a Hispanic, but he cannot change the harm his terrible policies have caused to Florida Hispanics. - 30 -
