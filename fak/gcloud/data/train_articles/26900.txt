BREAKING: FBI Executes Search Warrant At Obama D.C. Mansion
Remember how President Trump has mentioned that Barack Obama was responsible for wiretapping him during the campaign? It seems that no matter what liberals say, he might be right.

In a shocking development, FBI officials raided former President Barack Obama’s $8.9 million dollar mansion in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington D.C. early Tuesday morning.

According to sources within the agency, the raid was related to “a cabal of Obama administration officials” who actively worked to use the power of the United States government to undermine Trump “during the 2016 presidential campaign and after.”

Officials removed 36 desktop computers, multiple removable storage drives, 12 laptops, and “multiple pieces of recording and surveillance equipment” as well as “thousands of pounds of paper documents” from Obama’s home.

The former President has not yet been arrested, but FBI spokeswoman Shelly Smithers says “arrests are possible.”

Obama moved into his D.C. home at the beginning of the year, followed by his partner-in-crime Valerie Jarrett in March. At the time it was speculated that the home would be used as a base of anti-Trump operations. Now, it seems, that is confirmed.

The FBI says that a statement can be expected on Friday.
