U.S. Chamber Statement in Reaction to COP21 Climate Change Agreement
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Stephen Eule, vice president for climate and technology at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for 21st Century Energy, today issued the following statement regarding the climate change agreement reached today in Paris:

“The Paris climate conference delivered more of the same—lots of promises and lots of issues still left unresolved. While we are reviewing the final agreement, it’s clear that implementation still faces the same obstacles that we’ve been warning about for years. None of the commitments made, including those by the U.S., are binding, and many aren’t even complete. Moreover, Congress must appropriate any funds that the Obama administration has pledged.

“The White House’s overall domestic strategy of making energy more expensive and less abundant to satisfy international constituencies, many of whom compete against the United States, should worry the business community, American workers, and consumers. We will continue our efforts to understand how this deal affects the U.S. jobs and growth.”
