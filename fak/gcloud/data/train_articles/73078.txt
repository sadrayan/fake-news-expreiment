CFCoalition About Us
About Us!!

The Vision And Mission: To empower Families at the grassroots level to give them a voice in their government again!

The Christian Family Coalition was founded with the purpose of serving as a voice for the pro-family citizens of Florida to ensure that our religious liberties are protected from government intrusion.

The Christian Family Coalition works to introduce pro-family legislation at the state and local levels of government. We inform and educate citizens on where candidates stand on the issues that affect the traditional family unit.

The Christian Family Coalition mission is:

1. Proclaim our values in the public arena and in the media.

2. Train Christian leaders for effective social and political action.

3. Inform Christians about timely issues and pending legislation.

4. Protest anti-Christian bias and defend the legal rights of Christians.

If you want to keep America free we must work to make her a strong nation again by renouncing values that seek to destroy the infra-structure of the family and the future of our society.

IT'S WHAT'S RIGHT WITH AMERICA!"
