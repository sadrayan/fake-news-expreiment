Women abuse in SA: Report reveals shocking findings
Talking back, burning food and neglecting children are, according to some South Africans, good enough reasons for a man to hit a woman.

This was revealed in a report released by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), titled “Crime against women in South Africa”, which showed that almost as many women as men in this country believe that there are circumstances which warrant violence against women.

As TimesLive reports, the report uses data from Stats SA’s “Victims of Crime” survey as well as figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO).

“The highest percentage of individuals thought it was acceptable for a man to hit a woman if she argues with him‚ and the lowest percentage of individuals thought it was acceptable for a man to hit a woman if she burns food‚” the report found. “Neglecting the children and arguing with the husband are considered by both men and women to be the most serious issue.”

According to the report, these attitudes are a massive stumbling block in the fight against women abuse.

“Attitudes and perceptions play a very important role in shaping human behaviour‚ including criminal activity and vulnerability to crime‚” the report says.

The report also found that, although South Africa’s murder rate has declined between 2000 and 2015, it has been on a steady rise for women, with an increase of 117% between 2015 and 2017.

Also extremely concerning is the number of women who became victims of sexual abuse, which more than doubled in 2016/17 compared to the figure recorded in the previous year.

“The number of women who experienced sexual offences also jumped from 31 665 in 2015/16 to 70 813 in 2016/17, which is an increase of 53%. These are drastic increases in less than twenty-four months,” the report continues.
