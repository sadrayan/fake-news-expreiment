Philadelphia Eagles fans took to the streets to celebrate after the team won its first Super Bowl title in franchise history with a 41-33 victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday night.

We're rounding up sights and sounds from Philadelphia. We're also listening to the Philadelphia police scanner, just like we did after the Eagles beat the Vikings in the NFC Championship game.

Here are some of things we overheard on the Philadelphia police scanner after the game. We'll continue updating this post as celebrations continue in Philadelphia.
