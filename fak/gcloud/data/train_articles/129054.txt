Parents In California Holding "Measles Parties"
In response to the measles outbreak, parents in California are letting their children go to what is called a “measles party.”

Many parents are keeping their kids up to date on shots, but others avoid vaccinations of all kinds, at all costs. Some Bay Area parents are taking this idea to the extreme by holding a “measles party.”

At these gatherings, unvaccinated kids are made to hang out with infected kids with the intention of catching this disease.

Parents are weighing in on whether or not these “measles parties” are a good idea, or a mistake.

The California Department of Public Health Strongly opposes the intentional exposure of children to measles.
