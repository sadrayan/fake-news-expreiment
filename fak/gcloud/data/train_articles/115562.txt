Regional Directors Senator Art Torres (Ret.)

Chairman Senator Art Torres (Ret.) was elected Chairman of the California Democratic Party in 1997. He was appointed to finish the term vacated by Bill Press in 1996. He ran unopposed in 2001 and 2005 and was elected by unanimous approval of the body. Senator Torres is widely credited for helping return the CDP to a position of national prominence. Senator Torres served twenty years in the California State Legislature, eight as an Assembly member and twelve as a State Senator. While serving as Chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee, he sponsored “Universal Health Care.” During his legislative tenure he was also Chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, Senate Joint Committee on Science and Technology and Senate Toxics Committee. Some of Senator Torres' legislative successes include creating the most successful anti-high school dropout law in California's history. He also co-authored legislation creating the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles and the historic California Clean Drinking Water Act, Proposition 65. Senator Torres was the first Latino to receive his Party's nomination for statewide office when he ran for Insurance Commissioner in 1994. He has been a leader in the Latino community, fighting for better representation and more rights for the state's large and important Latino/Chicano population. Senator Torres received his Bachelor's degree from UC Santa Cruz and his J.D. from UC Davis School of Law and later served as a John F. Kennedy teaching fellow at Harvard University. He has two children, Joaquin and Danielle. Joaquin, a graduate of Stanford and the graduate school of Acting at NYU, is currently a working actor in New York. Danielle is a graduate of USC with a major in the music industry. Chairman Torres can be reached at chairman@cadem.org.

Reginald Byron Jones-Sawyer

Secretary Reggie's commitment to equal opportunity began at an early age. His family was one of the pioneers in the civil rights movement, so his passion for public service and his willingness to fight for those who are disadvantaged was instilled in him through his upbringing. Today, Reggie is active with the Democratic Party and the Los Angeles Professional Managers Association, which is affiliated with Service Employees International Union Local 347. He aggressively works to elect Democratic candidates who share his views on affirmative action, labor issues and quality education for every child. Professionally, Reggie is Director of Asset Management for the City of Los Angeles. His duties include directing senior level administrators and real property management staff who, in turn, are responsible for managing $32 million worth of leases in 800 city-owned properties worth in excess of $2 billion.

Previously, Reggie served as Assistant Deputy Mayor (1994-1998). He made policy recommendations to the Mayor and directed the operations of the Departments of City Planning, Building and Safety, Housing, Housing Authority, Environmental Affairs and Community Redevelopment Agency. He oversaw several budgets and staff totaling more than $110 million and 1,344 employees. His greatest joy in life is raising his two children, Lauren Diane Jones-Sawyer and Reginald Byron Jones-Sawyer, Jr.
