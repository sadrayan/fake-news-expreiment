Don't believe everything you read.
“People say believe half of what you see, son

and none of what you hear

But I can’t help but be confused

If it’s true, please tell me dear”

– Marvin Gaye

Y’all know best that Chip and I have a love for entrepreneurship. You guys know us for our construction company, Chip’s love for real estate and also my love for retail—which includes the Silos in Waco, Texas. And some of you have even seen our national projects like the magazine, our book, furniture, rugs, wallpaper, and paint. We love Magnolia, and we’re passionate about all things home.

So many things are happening right now and it feels like we are moving at the speed of light. At times, it’s even hard to keep our own parents in the loop. It’s true. At this point in our career we can honestly say, we’ve heard it all—from reports of us moving our family to Vegas to us having more or less children than we actually have. So remember, you can’t believe everything you read.

At the end of the day, we’ve learned it’s impossible to control all the information that’s out there. We care about you guys, and the best way we can protect you from false information is to direct you to our official channels. Follow our social media accounts (Find those here, here and here), sign up for our newsletter, and keep up with our blog. These are the spots where we’ll tell you about our new partnerships, projects, and even personal news. Always remember: if you’re reading big, exciting news about us, and we did not confirm it on our official sites, then proceed with caution.

We are so thankful for your support—we wouldn’t be here without you! And just in case you were wondering, YES! We are currently filming season 5 of the show. No! I am not getting into the business of facial creams. And No! We are not expecting baby #5. And no worries, believing some of these stories happens to the best of us.

In summary, don’t buy the facial cream, friends.
