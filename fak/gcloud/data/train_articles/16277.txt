The transition would end the US contractual relationship with ICANN, which has served as a valuable backstop to make sure that ICANN does not abuse its authority or stray from its narrow mission. If the transition happens at the end of the month, the US oversight responsibilities will in theory be replaced by the multi-stakeholder community, which includes the technical community, businesses, civil society, and governments. While this would not lead to government “control” of ICANN as would be the case in a UN body, governments will have more authority in ICANN than they do currently. It is unclear how the more powerful role of governments will affect ICANN. It is clear that some governments, including China and Russia, prefer UN governance of the Internet. There no reason whatsoever to think that the transition will satisfy them. This will be an ongoing fight regardless of what happens at the end of the month.

Hope this helps,

Brett

Also, how will governments “have more authority in ICANN than they do currently?”
