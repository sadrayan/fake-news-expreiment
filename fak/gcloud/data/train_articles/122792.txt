Home in San Francisco, Pelosi Gets the Crawford Treatment
SAN FRANCISCO, March 12 — San Francisco, meet Crawford, Tex.

Using a tactic usually trained on the home turf of President Bush, a group of protesters from Code Pink, a women’s antiwar group, have camped in front of the home of Speaker Nancy Pelosi here, bringing their message — and mattresses — to the doorstep of the nation’s highest-ranking Democrat.

The protest, which began Sunday afternoon with dozens of demonstrators, is just Code Pink’s latest effort to engage Ms. Pelosi, who the group feels has not gone far enough or fast enough to get the troops home from Iraq.

“The point is to keep showing our dissatisfaction,” said Toby Blome, 51, a protest organizer who sported a frilly pink apron and pink skirt. “It’s hard to do on our own, but I know I speak for millions of people.”

By Monday afternoon, however, Ms. Blome was speaking for exactly three people: herself and two other tired-looking protesters. One of those was Leslie Angeline, 50, who said she had slept till about 4 a.m. outside Ms. Pelosi’s three-story red-brick home.

“It was O.K.,” Ms. Angeline said, “till the sprinkler system went off.”

Code Pink organizers said that reinforcements were on the way and that protesters would maintain “Camp Pelosi” until a coming Congressional vote on supplemental financing for the Iraq war. Similar camp-outs, used during previous antiwar protests near the president’s Crawford ranch, are planned for Ms. Pelosi’s Washington home and office, the organizers said.
