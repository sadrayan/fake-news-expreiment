he Masjid Abu Bakr mosque in Flushing, New York, burned an American flag on Saturday in protest of the Trump presidency.

“Down with Trump!” and “Not my president”, they chanted as the flag burned.

Many are disgusted by the act and have called for the mosque to face legal punishment, or at the very least lose their tax exempt status.
