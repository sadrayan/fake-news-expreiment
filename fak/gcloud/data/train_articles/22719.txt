Time to die: U.N. ads promote killing off the elderly
Hey all you wrinkly, middle-aged has-beens: Are you ready to move over and let the next generation have your spot on the planet? After all, you’ve lived a good life. And your aging body is going to cost taxpayers a lot more than the salt you think you are worth. In other words, your return-on-investment isn’t looking so good to the United Nations.

In case you haven’t heard, our brains are being conditioned to look upon you as the burden you are. And it’s time you see yourself that way too:

That’s right. The UN is promoting we EUTHANIZE our aging parents. These commercials, of course, aren’t really from the United Nations. But they are designed to point us to the grim reality of Agenda 21, a very real global strategy to reduce the population in the years ahead. Yes, it sounds like something out of a zombie movie, but it’s been going on now for several years as we’ve been reporting. (Check out this recent interview we did on Agenda 21)

Disguised as environmental stewardship, Agenda 21 is nothing more than repackaged Socialism, and many heavy-hitters with billions of dollars and a worldwide influence are behind it.

Of course the mainstream media has been ignoring this. And only one well-known media outlet — Glenn Beck — has been sounding the alarm. And while we usually don’t include him in our Christian watchman resources, this video is worth a look:

One last video, showing how Agenda 21 will undoubtedly affect the future of the body of Christ:
