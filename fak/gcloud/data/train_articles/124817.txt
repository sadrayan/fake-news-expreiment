Sen. Sessions Comments on the Death of Coretta Scott King
Statement of U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions on the death of Coretta Scott King:



“The death of Coretta Scott King, a Perry County, Alabama, native, marks yet another sad passing of an historic leader in the movement for equal rights in America. She courageously stood with Dr. King and Rosa Parks to commence the modern civil rights movement with the Montgomery bus boycott. Through many dangers, toils and snares, she served as a partner of Dr. King in the monumental and peaceful drive for equality. All Alabamians should be proud of Mrs. King’s role in that effort to make America and Alabama a better place.”
