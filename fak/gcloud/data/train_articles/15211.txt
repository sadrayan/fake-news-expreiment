Eleven-step air permit process

All new, modified, reconstructed, relocated or replaced air pollutant sources (unless exempt) are required to obtain a construction permit from the Department of Natural Resources. The facility, DNR and the public all have a role in the construction permitting process. The diagram below is an interactive illustration of the construction permit process.

The shape of each step shows who has the key role at that phase of the process: a cloud (oval) represents the facility; a rectangle represents the DNR Bureau of Air Management; a star represents the public. This overview provides only a summary of the construction permit process and requirements. Please refer to the Wisconsin Statutes and Wisconsin Administrative Code for the specific language and requirements for construction permits.
