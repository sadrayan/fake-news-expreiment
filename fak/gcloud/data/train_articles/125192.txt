Bob Dylan Awarded Nobel Prize for Literature
Singer-songwriter has Bob Dylan won the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature, the first time that prestigious award has been bestowed upon a musician. He was granted the honor for “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition” and is the first American winner of the Nobel literature prize since author Toni Morrison in 1993.

Although Dylan’s name has reportedly been mentioned in Nobel deliberations for years, many experts did not expect the academy would broaden the literature prize field to include the world of music. The academy’s permanent secretary, Sara Danius, explained that “Bob Dylan writes poetry for the ear, but it’s perfectly fine to read his works as poetry”:

Sara Danius said while Dylan performs his poetry in the form of songs, that’s no different from the ancient Greeks, whose works were often performed to music. Danius told The Associated Press that a “great majority” on the 18-member Nobel panel voted for Dylan. She said her personal favorites among Dylan’s songs include “Chimes of Freedom” and “Visions of Johanna,” and suggested that people unfamiliar with Dylan’s music start by listening to his 1966 album “Blonde on Blonde.”



Dylan is perhaps the most unconventional Nobel literature prize winner since the award went to Italian playwright Dario Fo in 1997. Fo coincidentally passed away at age 90 on the same day Dylan’s award was announced by the academy.
