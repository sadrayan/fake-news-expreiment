Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (Wiley Investment Classics): Charles P. Kindleberger, Robert Aliber, Robert Solow: 9780471467144: Amazon.com: Books
I bought this three years ago and it has shaped my investing greatly. My goal in investing is always to buy low and sell high. This book helps me understand how to do the first half--buying low. I now buy after crashes.



Interestingly, something somewhere is always crashing. And I have also used Kindleberger to size up what are obvious manias (easy one: there are now more construction cranes in Toronto than any other city in North America). Places where I have bought after crashes are Greek shipping companies in January 2013 (42% gain in 12 months even including a stock that went from $70/share to $0.11/share) and Indian small caps in August of 2013 (up ~30% gain in 5 months), the US housing market in 2012, and a small bank whose shares went from $300, to $1, to $11 (counting reverse splits).



I have proven that you can still lose money even buying after a big fall (US Treasurys)--so I am not touting Kindleberger as a panacea. it is far from clear how to get the timing right during or after a crash. But this book did a great job illuminating the crazy ways people can cause a good or a stock to part from reality both on its way up and on its way down. Using it, I succeed more often than I fail. And I succeed more often than if I had not read it.



I would place this book on the short list, with Taleb's, Lefevre's, and Malkiel's work if you invest for yourself.
