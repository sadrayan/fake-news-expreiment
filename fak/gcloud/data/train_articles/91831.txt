Funding cuts strain health plan for poor
In a fragile new health program that already offers limited and uneven care to 30,000 of the poorest and sickest Minnesotans, the choices for comprehensive medical care will drop today from four hospitals to three -- and soon may plunge to one.

North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale confirmed that it would stop taking new patients in General Assistance Medical Care (GAMC) at the end of Friday after surpassing its 1,977-patient limit on enrollments.

Within three weeks, University of Minnesota Medical Center/Fairview in Minneapolis is likely to hit its enrollment cap, followed shortly by Regions Hospital in St. Paul, officials said. That will leave only Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis for people who want to enroll in GAMC or for those already in the program who seek comprehensive care.

If all four hospitals hit their limits, the only medical care available to GAMC patients will come from hospital emergency rooms or clinics that offer charity care.

"This is not good news," said Mary Maertens, CEO of Avera Hospital in Marshall, Minn., 150 miles southwest of the Twin Cities. "We already see more GAMC patients in our emergency department because of the new program. This whole thing was not a good idea."

Although it is a statewide program, the stripped-down GAMC negotiated this spring by Gov. Tim. Pawlenty and the Legislature shifted most of the cost and care responsibility to hospitals. Only four hospitals signed up under the new program, which took effect June 1, and all are in the Twin Cities.

For outstate residents, GAMC options already have narrowed: visit a local hospital emergency room, find a doctor to offer charity care or drive to the Twin Cities for care in a clinic.

Hitting the enrollment caps "is what we expected," said Brian Osberg, state Medicaid director at the Minnesota Department of Human Services. He helps oversee the GAMC program. "We just didn't expect it this quick."
