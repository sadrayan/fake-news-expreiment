PAYE FAQs:

Q. What is PAYE?

Pay-as-you-earn is the process by which the government via the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) collects employee taxes directly from the employer.

1. “pay as you earn” applies to all employments The “Pay As You Earn” method of deducting income tax from salaries and wages applies to all income from any office or employment. Thus “Pay As You Earn” applies to weekly wages, monthly salaries, annual salaries, bonuses, commissions, directors’ fees (whether the director is resident or non-resident) and any other income from an office or employment. The system applies to all cash emoluments and all credits in respect of emoluments to employees’ accounts with their employers, no matter to what period they relate. It includes the value of housing where this is supplied by the employer. It does not include earnings from “casual employment” which means any engagement with any one employer which is made for a period of less than one month, the emoluments of which are calculated by reference to the period of the engagement or shorter intervals. Regular part-time employees and regular casual employment where the employees are employed casually but regularly are not considered to be casual employees.

2. employer’s duty to deduct income tax

It is the employer’s statutory duty to deduct income tax from the pay of his employees whether or not he has been specifically told to do so by the Department. The normal P.A.Y.E. year runs from 1st January to 31st December.

3. PAYE regulations

The administration of the Law is vested in the KRA Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Department who may authorize other persons to perform the majority of the duties for which he is responsible. The relevant legislation is contained in Section 37 of the Income Tax Act and such rules as the Cabinet Secretary may have made under section 130; and sections 38 and 83 of the Tax Procedures Act, 2015.

If any employer fails to comply with the provisions of section 37 and with the provisions of any rules made under section 130 which deal with the payment over of tax deducted and the accounting for it to the Commissioner, the Commissioner may by order impose a penalty equal to twenty five percent of the amount of tax involved or ten thousand shillings whichever is greater, and the provisions of the Act relating to the collection and recovery of the tax shall apply to the collection and recovery of any tax payable and such penalty as if it were tax due by the employer.

4. Common terms used in PAYE regulations a. Employer For “Pay As You Earn” purposes the term “employer” is to be taken, when necessary, to include:

i. Any person having control of payment of remuneration.

It also includes an employee who retires on pension and stays in Kenya where pensions received from a registered pension fund exceed KSh 25,000 per month (KSh 300,000 per annum).

c. Paying Point

A “paying point” is the place at which remuneration is paid. If a non-resident employer calculates remuneration abroad and remits the remuneration direct to the employee then such remuneration should be notified to the Department through the employer’s local representative and P.A.Y.E. tax operated on the remuneration accordingly. Any cases of doubt should be referred to the KRA Domestic Taxes Office for advice.

Q. What is fringe benefit or low interest rate employment benefit?

When an employer provides loan to an employee and charges interest which is below the prescribed rate of interest, then the difference between the prescribed rate and employer’s loan rate is a benefit from employment chargeable to tax on the employee. The benefit is computed as the difference between the interest charged by employer and prescribed rate of interest. Low interest rate employment benefit provisions will also apply to a director and will continue to apply even after the employee or director has left employment as long as the loan remains un-paid. However, following amendment to the law by the 1998 Finance Act and introduction of “FRINGE BENEFIT TAX” which is payable by employers, the determination of the chargeable benefit is now in two categories i.e. for loans provided on or before 11th June,1998 and loans provided after 11th June, 1998.

(i) low interest rate benefit

Employees will continue to be taxed on low interest rate benefit in respect of loans provided by the employer on or before 11th June, 1998 as before. The low interest benefit chargeable on the employees is calculated as the difference between interest charged to the employee and the prescribed rate of interest of 15% per cent, or such interest rate based on the Market Lending Rates prescribed by the Commissioner; whichever is lower. For Example: Otiende Associates provide employee Jane a loan of Ksh 1,500,000 at 0% interest rate, prescribed rate of Interest is 2%

Calculation of Low Interest benefit:

Low Interest Benefit is (2%-NIL = 2%): Kshs 1,500,000 x 2% = Kshs.30,000 per annum i.e. Kshs.2,500 per month

*The prescribed rate of interest for the year of income commencing on or af ter 1st Januar y, 1995 is 15 per cent (15%) or such interest rates based on the market lending rates as the Commissioner may prescribe from time to time. Prescribed Rate of Interest on Low Interest Benefit
