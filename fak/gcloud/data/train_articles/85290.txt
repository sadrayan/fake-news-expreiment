HPV Vaccine: State Legislation and Statutes
Background

Discussion continues about whether or not to require girls and boys to be vaccinated against Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which causes most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), first issued guidelines for girls between ages 11 and 12 to receive the HPV vaccine. In 2011, for the first time, ACIP expanded those guidelines to recommend the vaccine for boys between ages 11 and 12 as a form of cancer prevention. The June 2016 recommendation by ACIP recommends the routine vaccination of boys and girls between ages 11 and 12.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 79 million Americans are infected with HPV. There is no cure for HPV, only treatment for related health problems. Most strains of HPV do not produce cancer or any symptoms and disappear on their own. When it does not go away, however, HPV can cause cancer and genital warts. In the United States, nearly 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year and over 4,000 women die from it. This number is much smaller than in other countries largely because of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, a screening tool for cervical cancer. The American Cancer Society reports that, with early detection, cervical cancer is usually treatable.

Currently, Gardasil 9 is the only HPV vaccine available in the United States. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends administering the vaccine to girls and boys between 11 and 12 years of age, before they become sexually active. ACIP recommends an immunization schedule of 2 doses before the 15th birthday and 3 doses after the 15th birthday.

Aside from recommendations by ACIP, school vaccination requirements are decided mostly by state legislatures. Some state legislatures have granted regulatory bodies such as the health department the power to require vaccines, but they still need the legislature to provide funding.

The debate in states has centered, in part, around school vaccine requirements, which are determined by individual states. Some stakeholders who support access to the vaccine do not support a school mandate, citing concerns about the drug's cost, safety, and parents' rights to refuse. Still others may have moral objections related to a vaccine mandate for a sexually transmitted disease. Financing is another concern. If states make the vaccine mandatory, they must also address funding issues, including Medicaid and CHIP coverage, youth who are uninsured, and whether to require coverage by insurance plans. This has caused some to push for further discussion and debate about whether or not to require the vaccine.

The CDC announced that the HPV vaccine is available through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program in all 50 states, Washington DC and the eight US territories. VFC provides vaccines for children ages nine to 18 who are covered by Medicaid, Alaskan-Native or Native American children, and some underinsured or uninsured children.

Facts About HPV

More HPV-associated cancers occurred in the cervix than any other site—about 11,693 per year.

HPV is the name of a group of viruses that includes more than 100 different types.

16,479 potentially HPV-associated cancers of the head and neck (oral cavity and oropharynx) occur per year.

State Legislative Action

Since 2006, legislators in at least 42 states and territories have introduced legislation to: require the vaccine, fund the vaccine or educate the public or school children about the HPV Vaccine. At least 25 states and territories have enacted legislation, including Colorado, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. The Michigan Senate was the first to introduce legislation (SB 1416) in September of 2006 to require the HPV vaccine for girls entering sixth grade, but the bill was not enacted. Ohio also considered legislation in late 2006 to require the vaccine (HB 703), which also failed.

Other State Action

While most states have addressed HPV vaccination requirements through the legislature, some states acted through the executive branch. According to the CDC, the New Hampshire Health Department announced in 2006 that it would provide the vaccine at no cost to girls under age 18. In May 2007, the department reported they had distributed over 14,000 doses in the state. On February 2, 2007, Texas became the first state to enact a mandate-by executive order from the governor-that all females entering the sixth grade receive the vaccine, with some exceptions. Legislators in Texas passed H.B. 1098 but overrode the executive order and the governor withheld his veto. In 2015, the Rhode Island Department of Health decided to require the vaccine for seventh graders. The Department is authorized to do this without legislative approval.

School Requirements

Three jurisdictions currently require HPV vaccines for school attendance: Rhode Island, Virginia, and District of Columbia. In July 2015, the Rhode Island Department of Health announced a HPV vaccine requirement for seventh graders starting in September 2015. As mentioned in the previous section, The Rhode Island Department of Health had the ability to do this without legislative action. The Virginia legislature passed a school vaccine requirement in 2007. The District of Columbia’s bill was enacted and the requirement started 30 days after Congressional Review Period expired. See the bills marked under the school mandate column in the table below for more information.

As of May 2018, at least eight states have proposed HPV-related legislation for the 2017-2018 sessions. Below are two tables: The first includes any proposed or enacted legislation from the 2017-2018 legislative session and the second includes any enacted legislation previous to 2017.
