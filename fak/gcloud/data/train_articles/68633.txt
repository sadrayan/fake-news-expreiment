Crews begin to raze Haiti hotel's remains

'Sad place' had several U.S. visitors

Construction crews today were going to begin removing what remains of Haiti's Hotel Montana, a four-star lodging that collapsed in the earthquake and entombed dozens of people, including Americans.

"It's a sad place because it's a temporary burial ground for perhaps 60 people," said Bob Isakson, managing director of DRC Emergency Services, a Mobile, Ala.-based construction and recovery firm working at the site.

The recovery work there was beginning on a day that a rare rescue happened in Port-au-Prince. French rescuers pulled a teenage girl, near death from dehydration, from rubble near the destroyed St. G�rard University. Darlene Etienne was being treated on a French hospital ship, the Associated Press reported.

The 145-room hotel perched in terraces at the top of a mountain once provided visitors "the finest view in Port-au-Prince," said Isakson, who had stayed at the hotel. It was a favorite of Westerners.

About 300 people were staying at the five-story hotel when its floors pancaked on top of one another. Many were not inside.

Several families believe their loved ones are still trapped, among them four students and two faculty members of Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., who were in Haiti to distribute aid to impoverished Haitians.

On Wednesday, DRC workers were at the Montana checking the stability of the site, building ramps for heavy equipment and discussing how to handle the deceased. Workers will begin working with jackhammers, small bulldozers and excavators.

Fairfax County (Va.) Search and Rescue, which arrived at the Montana two days after the earthquake and rescued several people, was on its way home Wednesday, said a spokesman, Capt. Willie Bailey. Several people were rescued from secure spaces and elevator shafts.

Using heavy equipment at the site has its risks, Isakson said.

There is a one-lane, quarter-mile road winding to the top of the mountain. The hotel, which had multiple terraces, is above many homes. "If we're not careful, the whole thing can go down the side of the mountain," Isakson said. "Even the ground where the parking lot was flat is slanted. Everything is off kilter."

Karel Zelenka, the Haiti representative for Catholic Relief Services, attended several meetings there, the most recent before Christmas. The hotel had several open-air salons and conference rooms and a view of the city, harbor and airport.

"It was the high class living up on the hill vs. the slums downtown," Zelenka said.

Fran�ois Guillaume, executive director of the Haitian American Chamber of Commerce of Florida, was at the hotel with Leroy Strickland of Orlando, an American business colleague, 10 minutes before the earthquake struck. Guillaume left to find some medicine for a headache. When he got back, "the top of the building was on the floor."

Strickland is unaccounted for.
