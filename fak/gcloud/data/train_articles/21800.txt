Sample and Methodology detail



Despite its new name and some tweaks, American voters disapprove 58 - 16 percent of the Republican health care plan to replace Obamacare, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today.





Disapproval of various versions of the Republican health care plan ranges from 56 - 21 percent to 62 - 17 percent in surveys by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University conducted since March. On March 24, the House of Representatives cancelled a vote on its first health care bill after a Quinnipiac University poll showed voters disapproved 56 - 17 percent.





In today's survey, Republican approval is 37 - 23 percent, with overwhelming opposition among every other listed party, gender, education, age or racial group.





If a U.S. Senator or member of Congress votes for the Republican plan, 46 percent of voters are less likely to support their reelection, with 17 percent more likely and 33 percent who say the health care vote won't matter in their decision.





Under the Republican plan, their health insurance costs will go up, 41 percent of American voters say, while 10 percent say their costs will go down and 35 percent say costs will stay the same.





"Call it a dressed up retread of the last GOP healthcare plan, or simply a wolf in sheep's clothing. Americans aren't buying this latest version of the plan to kill Obamacare," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





"And the dismissal comes with the dire warning: If you vote for this one, you may not be around to vote for the next version."





American voters oppose 71 - 24 percent, including 53 - 39 percent among Republicans, decreasing federal funding for Medicaid.





Voters also oppose 61 - 35 percent cutting off federal funding for Planned Parenthood.





Opposition to cutting Planned Parenthood funding jumps to 80 - 15 percent, including 67 - 25 percent among Republicans, when it is explained that federal funding for Planned Parenthood is used only for non-abortion health services such as breast cancer screenings.





American voters support 60 - 33 percent "an expansion of Medicare that would make it available to any American who wants it, also known as universal health care." Republicans oppose this idea 57 - 33 percent, while every other listed group supports it by wide margins.





Guns





American voters support 94 - 5 percent, including 92 - 8 percent among voters in households where there is a gun, background checks for all gun buyers. Support is over 90 percent in every listed group.





It's too easy to buy a gun in the U.S. today, 57 percent of voters say, while 6 percent say it's too difficult and 32 percent say it's about right.





If more people carried guns, the U.S. would be less safe, 57 percent of voters say, while 35 percent say the nation would be safer.





American voters say 79 - 17 percent that the way people talk about politics in the U.S. today contributes to violence. This belief is strongly held among all listed groups.





The recent shooting of a U.S. Congressman and several other people in Virginia will have no impact on how people talk about politics, 53 percent of voters say, while 11 percent say it will have a positive impact and 31 percent say it will have a negative impact.





From June 22 - 27, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,212 voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points, including the design effect. Live interviewers call landlines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys nationwide, and in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa and Colorado as a public service and for research.
