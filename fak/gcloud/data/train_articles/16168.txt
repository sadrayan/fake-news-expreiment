Mr. Selby,

Maria asked me to follow up with you on your question. In think these two links below should provide a good window into the link between brain trauma and CTE. Let me know if you have follow questions.

Best

Conclusion:

The criteria described above constitute the first step in the process of fully characterizing the neuropathology of CTE, just as the Boston meeting was the first of a series of consensus conferences of the investigators funded by the NIH research initiative. However, it was noted that, thus far, this pathology has only been found in individuals exposed to brain trauma, typically multiple episodes.

Armed with the new definition, researchers at the Mayo Clinic searched for signs of CTE among the 7,000 brains that are preserved at the clinic's Jacksonville, Florida, location.

Kevin Bieniek, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Mayo Clinic's Department of Neuroscience, 66 brains of people who had played contact sports -- primarily high school and college football, but also boxing, rugby, wrestling and soccer. The researchers also examined the brains of 198 control subjects who had not been exposed to contact sports. They found signs of CTE in the brains of 21 people who played contact sports -- almost one in three. They found no signs of CTE in the brains of the people who had not played contact sports.

initially narrowed the number to a more manageable 1,800 in an effort to limit his sample to people who participated in contact sports. Bieniek then spent months combing through medical records, obituaries and other resources.

"I was surprised," said Bieniek, who published his findings with his adviser, Dr. Dennis Dickson, one of the nation's leading experts in neurodegenerative diseases. "There is a pretty strong link between repetitive head trauma and CTE."
