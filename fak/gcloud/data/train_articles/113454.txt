Self-defense tips
On the heels of a break in and beating that left an elderly woman in Toledo dead, self defense experts have a tip that could save your life.

Val Glinka teaches self-defense to students at Sylvania Southview High School. For decades, he's suggested putting a can of wasp and hornet spray near your door.

Glinka says, "This is better than anything I can teach them."

Glinka considers it inexpensive, easy to find, and more effective than mace or pepper spray. The cans typically shoot 20 to 30 feet; so if someone tries to break into your home, Glinka says "spray the culprit in the eyes". It's a tip he's given to students for decades. It's also one he wants everyone to hear.

Over the weekend someone broke into the Austin Street home of 83-year-old Cecilia Sobecki. The suspect robbed and beat Sobecki, breaking her hip and wrist. Sunday, Sobecki died. The suspect is still on the loose.

If you're looking for protection, Glinka says look to the spray.

"That's going to give you a chance to call the police; maybe get out."

Maybe even save a life. The suspect from this weekend's beating is described as a heavyset white female, about five foot eight inches tall. She was last seen wearing a dark hood. If you have any info police want to hear from you.
