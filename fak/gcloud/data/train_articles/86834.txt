Donald Trump Says His Mocking of New York Times Reporter Was Misread
In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Kovaleski said that he met with Mr. Trump repeatedly when he was a reporter for The Daily News covering the developer’s business career in the late 1980s, before joining The Post. “Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,” Mr. Kovaleski said. “I’ve interviewed him in his office,” he added. “I’ve talked to him at press conferences. All in all, I would say around a dozen times, I’ve interacted with him as a reporter while I was at The Daily News.”

A representative for The Times said on Wednesday: “We’re outraged that he would ridicule the physical appearance of one of our reporters.”

Last Saturday, Mr. Trump, already under fire for voicing support for a database of Muslims in the United States, insisted that he had watched while “thousands and thousands of people” cheered in Jersey City as the twin towers collapsed.

After reports that the authorities had found the accounts unfounded, Mr. Trump seized on the 2001 article by Mr. Kovaleski as proof of his claim. That story contained a sentence saying that the authorities in the days after the terrorist strikes had detained and questioned “a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks” on rooftops with tailgate-style parties. The story never referred to “thousands,” and it did not say that the allegations had been substantiated. Mr. Kovaleski, in interviews since Mr. Trump made his claim, has said his reporting did not bear out the “thousands” number, or even “hundreds.”

As for the claim that Mr. Kovaleski was trying to pull away from his past reporting, he said, “Nothing could be further from the truth.”
