Visualize it. Senator Kid Rock in 2018.

It could happen. The singer is featured on a "Kid Rock for Senate" website, sitting in a grand chair next to a stuffed deer, with the tagline "Are you scared?"

On Wednesday, Kid Rock tweeted, "I have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real ...The answer is an absolute YES."

Kid Rock, real name Robert Ritchie, would be a Republican challenger to unseat U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat from Michigan.

Is it a joke? The Redneck Paradise singer's name has been floated in the past.

Wes Nakagiri, a Livingston County Tea Party activist who was elected to the Republicans' central committee in February, told the Detroit Free Press that Kid Rock was a viable candidate for the spot

"(Kid Rock) has name I.D., is an out-of-the-box idea, and would kind of get rid of that stodgy Republican image," she said. "I'll bet you he would generate as much excitement as Trump did."

Kid Rock performed at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland and supported Donald Trump.

In April, Kid Rock, rocker Ted Nugent and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin visited President Trump in the White House and Oval Office.
