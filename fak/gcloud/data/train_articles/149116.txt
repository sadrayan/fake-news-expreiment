A new SuperData report (via GamesIndustry.biz ) shows that Fortnite has made more than $1 billion off in-game purchases alone. The report also claimed Fortnite is only growing in popularity overall, with an upward trend since October 2017 that saw a huge spike in February that only started slowing in May while still continuing upwards. That slowed May growth was still good enough for a whopping $318 million in revenue.Epic Games may soon have even more opportunities to make money off in-game Fortnite purchases too, as Fortnite may soon be getting vehicle skins and players are likely about to get the opportunity to gift in-game items to one another . Plus, Epic will soon start generating Fortnite revenue outside of the game entirely once Funko's Fortnite merchandise hits the market.Meanwhile, the battle royale genre continues to be the most popular for streaming, with viewers having watched nearly 700 million hours – 83 percent of which were from Fortnite – of battle royale gaming in May. That far outpaced the number-two genre, MOBAs, which racked up 275 million hours of viewing time.Nick Santangelo is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia.
