Billionaire real estate developer, businessman and television personality Donald Trump -- who had never held public office -- flirted with the idea of running for president for decades before jumping into the 2016 race. Trump ran an unconventional campaign, one that tapped into the frustrations of millions of Americans who felt their concerns were being ignored by establishment politicians. Still, his statements about immigrants, Obamacare and even his own previous positions were frequently rated untrue or misleading by independent factchecking websites. While Trump raised less money than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, he received free media attention valued at about $5 billion. At 70, Trump was older than any previous U.S. president at the time he took office, and was the fifth commander in chief to have lost the popular vote. He maintained, without credible evidence, that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally. Trump chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Pence had been a congressman for 12 years, joining the Tea Party Caucus and building a reputation as a strong social conservative.
