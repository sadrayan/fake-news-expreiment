The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 set a single rate of 35 percent and a $5 million exemption (indexed for inflation after 2011) for 2011 and 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) made the $5 million indexed exemption permanent for 2013 and on and raised the tax rate to 40 percent. Under pre-ATRA law, the exemption would have reverted to an unindexed $1 million in 2013 and the top statutory rate would have risen to 55 percent.

The passage of ATRA reduced predicted 2013 tax revenue from $37.7 billion to $14.2 billion.

In 2011, over 90 percent of estate taxpayers will come from the top 10 percent of the income distribution while nearly half will come from the top 1 percent. These groups pay 98 and 79 percent of estate tax revenue, respectively. Estates of people in the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution will pay more than half of all estate taxes.
