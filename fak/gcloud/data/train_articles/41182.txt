Edwin E. Witte

Born in Jefferson County, Wisconsin in 1887, Edwin E. Witte was a professor of Economics from 1933-1957. He served as the chairman of the department for twelve years and was the principal author of the Social Security Act. He received a B.A. in 1909 and a Ph.D. in 1927, both from the University of Wisconsin. During his lifetime, Edwin held more than thirty government positions, nine of which were full time. He was a person of unusual capacity for warm personal relations and the good will he bestowed and received in return was exceptional. He was a prodigious worker who was widely respected by students. His impact on economics, on the University, on legislation, and indeed to the history of our time was extraordinarily profound.
