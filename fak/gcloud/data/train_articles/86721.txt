Modernization Program

About the Modernization Program

The State's Public Housing Modernization Program began in 1980 with an initial appropriation of $3 million to provide grants to public housing developments where rental income is insufficient and funds are unavailable from other sources for needed repairs and improvements. Only State-aided developments not receiving federal operating subsidies are eligible for grants. Funds are appropriated on an annual basis.

The modernization program is an important source of funding for the State's portfolio of public housing. Since 1989, grants have been allocated on a multi-year basis for comprehensive, long-range modernization plans. The grants are used to replace or repair roofs, heating systems and ventilation work, renovate elevators, plumbing systems, modernize bathrooms and kitchens, replace existing windows and add storm windows. Improvements to a development can also include masonry re-pointing and repair, upgrading of electrical systems, landscaping, lead testing and asbestos abatement.

Since the program's inception, over $244 million has been appropriated, and approximately $228 million has been awarded to 31 Public Housing Authorities to upgrade 57 housing projects containing nearly 19,918 apartments. These appropriations include $2,800,000 set aside for the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program.
