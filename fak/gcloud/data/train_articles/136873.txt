First Technical University, Ibadan
I am very delighted to welcome you to Nigeria’s premier technical university, First Technical University, Ibadan. We are a University that offers unique, functional and innovative tertiary education.

An initiative of the Oyo State Government, the University was established to combat the growing scourge of youth unemployment in Nigeria. The country is currently faced with myriads challenges relating to the empowerment, education and employment of its teeming youth. According to the National Population Commission (NPC, 2013), about half of Nigeria’s population of 182 million people is made up of youth (that is, individuals between 15 and 34 years). Yet, the combined admission capacity of the Nigerian University System, public and private, is barely up to 40% of qualified and eligible candidates.
