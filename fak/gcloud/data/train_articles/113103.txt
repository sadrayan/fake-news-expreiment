Hyundai supports people
Hyundai Motor Company will donate $300,000 to the American Red Cross



In response to the tragic events that occurred in New York and Washington earlier this week, Hyundai Chairman Mong-Koo Chung announced today. "This is a very sad time," the Chairman said. "What happened this week affects everyone around the world. But we have great faith that this donation -- along with donations from others around the world -- will enable the American Red Cross to help people who need help the most." The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Hyundai Motor America go out to the victims, their families and the brave rescue teams working around the clock to help find and assist the injured.

HYUNDAI'S FOUNDING CHAIRMAN - CHUNG JU-YUNG - 1915 - 2001 Chung Ju-Yung was born in North Korea in 1915 as the eldest son of a poor peasant farming family. At the age of 18, he set off for good to Seoul with hopes of finding a better life.

Success was not immediate. He worked in various jobs, such as railway construction, bookkeeping and dock work. Mr. Chung's first experience as an entrepreneur came in 1938 when he started his own rice store. However, he was forced to close his business a year later because of the policies of the Japanese occupation forces.

After the liberation of Korea in World War II, Mr. Chung went into business repairing trucks for US Armed Forces. He then went into the engineering and construction business, eventually building multibillion-dollar mega-projects around the world.

His venture into the shipbuilding business is legendary. Despite a lack of experience in shipbuilding, he persuaded a customer to give him an order to build a ship for tens of millions of dollars. Now the company that he started is the largest shipbuilder in the world.

By sheer force of effort and creativity, Mr. Chung built businesses, which helped make Korea the economic powerhouse that it is today. From humble beginnings, he rose to great heights. But even at the peak of his success, he remained disciplined, lived simply and worked hard.

In his final years he turned his efforts towards the reunification of Korea. This son of a farmer sought to open avenues of communication between the North and South Korean governments and between the people, north and south. In private talks with leaders, in cross-border business ventures, and in grand gestures, such as driving 1000 cattle back to North Korea, he helped bring hope back to the most cherished goal of reuniting the Korean people. It may well be that this final act of kindness and concern, while acting as an Ambassador of Peace, may be viewed by history as his greatest achievement.

Our Honorary Founding Chairman had many great philosophies that he lived by, but the one that we should all remember is: "It is failures rather than successes that teach us invaluable lessons. . . . It is not necessary to remember one's success. That should be remembered by others instead. Rather, we should remember our losses and failures. . . . . Those who forget their failures will fail again and again."

SALUTING AMERICAS UNSUNG HEROES Hyundai Motor America is extending our support of nursing that began in 2000. In 2001, Hyundai will be the exclusive automotive sponsor at the Student Nurses Convention, the Emergency Room Nurses Convention, and the National Association of Hispanic Nurses Convention. Hyundai is supporting the American Nurse Association Foundation by pledging $10,000 for nursing research grants. Hyundai will also fund various scholarships at these conventions. Acutely aware of the severe shortage of nurses, Hyundai, through grass roots efforts with our Hyundai dealers, is rendering scholarship support to local nursing organizations and nursing schools. Our 2001 plan also includes brand advertising in the major nursing publications.

Hyundai will continue to explore other opportunities to create a long-term relationship with the nursing community as we continue to support and salute these unsung heroes.





HYUNDAI HELPS KIDS BEAT CANCER



As too many of us have experienced, there is nothing more heartbreaking than seeing a child battle cancer. While these children are often exceptionally strong and remain positive-spirited, it certainly would be wonderful if children never had to endure such pain and loss in their lifetimes. Hyundai wholeheartedly agrees, and since 1997, Hyundai has been the proud sponsor of the Jimmy Fund, which helps support groundbreaking research at the world-famous Dana-Farber Cancer Institute located in Boston, Massachusetts.

Last year, Hyundai raised over $346,000 and this year, we are pairing up with the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) to implement nationwide tournaments called Kids Helping Kids Fight Cancer to raise more money for cancer research. In addition, every Hyundai dealership across America is given the opportunity to donate a portion of each Hyundai sold to go toward the Jimmy Fund or toward a regional pediatric cancer research or treatment facility of their choice. These donations help immensely in the ongoing fight against pediatric cancer.

With Jimmy Fund support, Dana-Farber physicians and researchers are moving ever closer to a 100% cure rate.





"POWER OF THE PURSE" WORKSHOPS ADVISE WOMEN



Ask most women and theyll tell you  buying or servicing a vehicle is one of their least favorite experiences. Yet today, over 80 percent of all new car purchases are made or influenced by women.

With that in mind, Hyundai launched the Power of the PurseTM program in 1994. Held in conjunction with 10 womens conferences and expos across the country each year, these free workshops are designed to help women gain the knowledge and expertise they need to become savvy car buyers.

Over the past six years, hundreds of women car buyers (and often times men) have attended the informal, one-hour workshops. In 1999, PR News singled out the Power of the PurseTM program as the best Community Relations/Event Marketing Program of the year, awarding Hyundai their prestigious Platinum Public Relations Crystal Trophy. Currently, Hyundai is the first automotive sponsor for the American Women in Sports Media (AWSM) and theyll be hosting a Power of the PurseTM seminar at their annual convention. If you would like to know more about the Power of the PurseTM program, call the hot line at 1-800-633-5151.
