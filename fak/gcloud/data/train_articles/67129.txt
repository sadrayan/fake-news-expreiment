Trump visits Virginia golf club
President Trump visited his golf course in Virginia on Sunday morning.

The presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., shortly after 9:30 a.m., according to a White House pool report.

It’s unclear whether Trump is golfing at the club. He was spotted in a red cap — believed to have his “Make America Great Again” slogan on it — and a white polo shirt.

Trump also dined at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., with members of his Cabinet, their spouses and new White House chief of staff John Kelly on Saturday night.

He tweeted about healthcare on Sunday morning prior to the golf course visit.
