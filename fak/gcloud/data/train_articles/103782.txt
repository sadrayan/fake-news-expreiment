Massive Alligator Spotted Again on Florida Golf Course
A massive alligator seen roaming a Florida golf course has been spotted again.

The alligator, apparently named "Goliath," was seen eating a turtle on Thursday morning at the Myakka Pines Golf Course in Englewood, Florida, according to the club's Facebook page.

Two people at the course had seen the alligator roaming the course earlier this month. The club's general manager told ESPN that he estimated the size of the gator was 12 to 13 feet.
