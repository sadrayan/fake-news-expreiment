From UCR staff:

Currently, the FBI UCR Program does not publish rates by county. However, please find attached the 2015 Crime by County and coding guide.

Individuals using FBI UCR Program tabulations are cautioned against drawing conclusions by making direct comparisons between cities. Comparisons lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction. It is important to remember that crime is a social problem and, therefore, a concern of the entire community. The efforts of law enforcement are limited to factors within its control.

Crime rates are indicators of reported crime activity standardized by population. They are more refined indicators for comparative purposes than are volume figures. A crime rate, defined as the number of offenses per 100,000 population, is derived by first dividing a jurisdictionâ€™s population by 100,000 and then dividing the number of offenses by the resulting figure.
