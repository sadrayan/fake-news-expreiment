Have you ever heard of anyone having a kid by a squid before?

A South Korean woman has been impregnated by one such sea creature, according to reports.

The odd claim has apparently been made in a research study from the National Center for Biotechnology Information based in Maryland in the United States.

According to the paper a 63-year-old woman was eating a serving of whole squid when she experienced a sharp pain in her mouth.

She told medical staff that she could also feel something in her mouth, which they described as “bug-like organisms”.

Baby cephlapods were then reportedly removed from her gums, tongue and cheek and later identified as “squid spermatophores”.

“She did not swallow the portion, but spat it out immediately,” the research paper states.

“She complained of a pricking and foreign-body sensation in the oral cavity.”

It continued: “Twelve small, white spindle-shaped, bug-like organisms stuck in the mucous membrane of the tongue, cheek, and gingiva were completely removed, along with the affected mucosa.

“On the basis of their morphology and the presence of the sperm bag, the foreign bodies were identified as squid spermatophores.”

According to Wikipedia, a spermatophore is “a capsule or mass created by males of various animal species, containing spermatozoa and transferred in entirety to the female's ovipore during copulation.”
