Climate change denial is a castle built on sand. Its collapse is inevitable. The question is, can we get real in time to avert the worst damage to our beautiful Ocean State? To do that, we need to enact a nationwide price on carbon pollution to make the market work properly and discourage dumping carbon into our atmosphere. Here�s why I think we can.

First, the days of free carbon pollution end this June, when the Obama administration announces regulations on the biggest emitters. That won�t just lower the polluters� emissions, it will change their thinking. When their free-pollution holiday is over, a nationwide carbon fee may start to look better to them.

Second, the polluters have had a political field day since the Citizens United decision allowed unlimited dark money into our elections � what one newspaper called the �tsunami of slime.� That one-sided assault is coming to an end as environmental money begins to match the polluters in elections. The environmental money will still be less, but it has the advantage of a truthful message.

Third, major brand-name corporations like Walmart, General Motors, Coca-Cola, Apple, Mars and many others have terrific climate policies. They just haven�t all put their communications or government relations effort in line with their sustainability work. The military gets how serious this is and has listed climate change as a national security threat; commander of the U.S. Pacific Command Adm. Samuel Lochlear has said it�s our worst threat in the Pacific Theater. When these voices are heard more clearly it will be devastating to the denier apparatus.

Fourth, the denier apparatus is a phony: front organizations designed to look like they�re real; bogus messages designed to sound like they�re truthful; a whole big charade connected to and funded by polluters. Phonies don�t last.

Most important, the climate deniers have lost the public. Independents and Democrats overwhelmingly support action on climate change, and most Republican voters under 35 in a recent poll said climate deniers are �ignorant,� �out of touch,� or �crazy.� Republican mayors and governors, away from the polluter money choking Congress, are getting to work on climate change. Republican economists support a carbon tax. Republicans increasingly see they cannot possibly win the 2016 presidential race with a denier candidate.

Before Citizens United, many Republican senators were working on and voting for climate legislation. Republican friends in the Senate have complained to me that the polluter money attacks Republicans in primaries, not just Democrats in general elections. The polluters, post-Citizens United, have run a coal-fired purge of the Republican Party in Congress. But even vast polluter money can only bully them quiet for so long � and when compliance is imposed by fear, disruptions are abrupt.

When the denial castle collapses, the prospects for a serious carbon bill in Congress are good. The revenues from a revenue-neutral carbon fee are all returned to the public, and there are appealing ways to do that: lowering corporate tax rates from 35 to 30 percent would be a huge value to good corporate citizens such as CVS and its consumers; giving seniors on Social Security a raise, or students (and their parents) relief on college loans would please many Rhode Islanders; a straight-out check to heads of households would be possible.

There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining, and we�re near tipping points where solar is the cheaper power even ignoring the extra harm done by carbon pollution. America has a prosperous clean energy future to look forward to, and there�s more economic security in our own American know-how than in corrupt foreign fossil fuel countries.

More than anything, as an optimist, I believe this will get done because it must. April was the first month in human history with consistently more than 400 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere (for at least 8,000 centuries it�s been between 175 and 300 ppm). Sea level at the tide gauge off the Newport Navy base is up about 10 inches since the Hurricane of 1938, because warming seas expand (and swallow our beaches). Our orchards are seeing unaccustomed winter blooms, which are very risky, if a hard cold snap follows � ask the Michigan cherry industry.

Our commercial fishermen see fish in Rhode Island Sound like tarpon and grouper that their fathers never saw, and have lost important fisheries like the winter flounder; lobster are moving offshore to cooler waters; as one fisherman said to me, �It�s getting weird out there.� Rainbursts now cause 100-year flooding every few years � even 500-year flooding in Cranston three years ago.

Rhode Island�s first summer residents were Southern traders, come to avoid the fetid Carolina heat; now that heat is marching northward to become our summers. And don�t be misled, the links connecting these results to carbon pollution are forged in immutable laws of science and nature.

We simply have to get this right. Rhode Island has too much at stake to fail.
