State Rep. Janet Adkins announces run for Nassau County schools superintendent
State Rep. Janet Adkins has filed to run for superintendent of the Nassau County School District in November 2016, she announced Saturday.

Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, is term limited in the District 11 seat, which has already attracted six candidates hoping to replace her.

"I am running as a conservative Republican for Nassau County Superintendent of Schools because I believe education is at a crossroads, and now is the time for change and reform," she said in a statement. "As a parent of two children enrolled in our local schools, I share the sense of urgency that families face about their child's education, their choices and opportunities."

Superintendent John Ruis has not filed to run for re-election.

So far, Nassau School Board member Kathy Burns, a Republican, and Cheryl Reynolds James, a Libertarian, have also filed to run for the seat. Burns is the only candidate to report any campaign contributions - $7,050.

Adkins, a former Nassau County School Board member, was previously elected to the Florida House in 2008, 2010 and 2012. The District 11 seat covers Nassau County and parts of Duval County, including Arlington and the Beaches area.

She's taken an interest in education during her time in the state House: She chairs the K12 Education subcommittee and is a member of the full House Education Committee, the committee for Education Choice and Innovation and the Education Appropriations subcommittee.
