The Library of Congress believes that most of the papers in the Theodore Roosevelt collection are in the public domain or have no known copyright restrictions. All manuscripts authored by President Roosevelt himself are in the public domain and are free to use and reuse. Researchers should watch for modern documents (for example, published in the United States less than 95 years ago, or unpublished and the author died less than 70 years ago) that may be copyrighted. Rights assessment is your responsibility.
