Good morning. Edward Alden nudged me to reach out to you in hopes you can help us analyze this claim by a Texas sheriff: “We’re the only nation in the world that does not use the military to secure our border.” He was quoted in this Midland Reporter-Telegram news story.

I would be happy to engage by phone or email. I’d also welcome suggestions on who (or what) else to consult.

?

Thanks,

Obviously he's wrong. Canada and Germany come to mind. And the U.S. does use the military in a support role on the border more than many nations. Of course, all nations that have a military would use the military if there were a military attack from another country.

Have you or anyone else authoritative fleshed this out?

Not that I know of. But it's sort of like confirming the sky is blue. I can't remember the last time I was met by military personnel when crossing a border. Can you? Most countries have a professional border patrol/customs service in charge. Militaries are typically not deployed to active duty on the border in peacetime. The U.S. Military is involved at the border but in a support role and can't make arrests. Burden of proof should be on the sheriff to back up his crazy claim. PA
