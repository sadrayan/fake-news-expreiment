Obama on Memorial Day Photos: Pictures You Need To See
Today is President Barack Obama's final Memorial Day in office. The 44th President has followed with tradition, as many of his predecessors have since the day became a national holiday to honor the members of the military who died fighting for the U.S. around the world. During every year in office, save one, Obama has laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. This year, Obama will be marking Memorial Day after a historic visit to Asia, which concluded on Friday with a visit to Hiroshima, Japan.

Obama has already declared Memorial Day 2016 as a day of permanent prayer and peace, asking Americans to unite in prayer at 11:00 a.m. The president also asked that we observe National Moment of Remembrance at 3:00 p.m.

"Those who gave their last full measure of devotion for the values that bind us as one people deserve our utmost respect and gratitude," Obama wrote. "In recognizing those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we pledge to never stop working to fulfill our obligations to all members of our Armed Forces so they know we stand beside them every step of the way -- not just when we need them, but also when they need us."
