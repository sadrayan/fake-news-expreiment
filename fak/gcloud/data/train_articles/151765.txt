Nike Inc: Recipients
METHODOLOGY: The numbers on this page are based on contributions from PACs and individuals giving $200 or more. All donations were made during the 2018 election cycle and were released by the Federal Election Commission. Figures for the current election cycle are based on data released on September 24, 2018.

This table lists candidates receiving money from this organization in 2017-2018. The organizations themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations' PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals' immediate families. Organization totals may include subsidiaries and affiliates.

The first chart shows money given to congressional candidates. The second and third charts show contributions only to candidates who won election in November of the cycle displayed.
