PA Voting Machines Changed Votes In Most Counties
Claims of voter fraud are piling up in the recent Pennsylvania election “won” by Democrat Conor Lamb — and new news about voting machines is incredibly suspicious.

According to poll watchers, voters reported more than 470 incidents in which they tryed to vote for Rick Saccone but instead found their vote changed to Conor Lamb.

“Nothing I could do would make the machine apply my vote properly,” one woman in the 23rd District told the Pennsylvania Gazette. “I eventually left and Conor Lamb got my vote.”

A Harrisburg resident identifying himself as Rick Scalamone told the Gazette:

“Democrats obviously sabotaged the vote. I couldn’t vote for Rick no matter what. His name wasn’t even on the screen. I had no choice but to vote for Conor Lamb or walk away. I chose to walk away.”

Poll workers tried putting people on new machines, but found that the problems persisted. For some reason, it was not reported to the state Board of Election Integrity until the next day. In 14 of those districts that were affected, known Democrats were working the polling locations in charge of those voting machines.

In parts of Pennsylvania, trucks full of illegal immigrants were observed voting at multiple poll locations. Photographs of the offenders have been turned over to ICE and the FBI. In addition, three counties so far report that more votes were cast than there are residents.

It’s time to drain the swamp! It’s time to deport the illegals! It’s time to stop Democrats from destroying are country! It’s time for a new America where people who do these illegal things aren’t allowed to vote at all!

The vote was officially too close to count, but Lamb has declared victory despite the fact that absentee ballots have not yet been counted.
