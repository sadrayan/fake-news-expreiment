Maryland woman arrested for breaking father-in-law's windows because it 'was fun'
LEONARDTOWN, Md., Aug. 12 (UPI) -- A Maryland woman apparently gets her kicks by tossing bricks thorough the windows of family members.

An officer from the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office was summoned to a home in Leonardtown after getting a report about property destruction.

The residents of the home called police after someone, later identified as Michelle Waro, had started tossing bricks through windows at the home. According to the homeowner, Waro is his daughter-in-law.

When he arrived on the scene, Cpl. Connelly saw the 43-year-old suspect behind the home. With a laugh, she asked Connelly to "take me away because of this," Southern Maryland News Net reported.

Waro allegedly broke nine windows at the home with landscaping bricks and caused an estimated $8,000 worth of damage before being taken into custody.

After Connelly arrested her, Waco allegedly said, "This was fun and they are a bunch of bitches." She was charged with three counts of reckless endangerment and two counts of property destruction over $1,000.
