2 WHEREAS, The State of Illinois is often regarded as having 3 two distinct regions, the City of Chicago and downstate 4 Illinois; and

16 WHEREAS, The City of Chicago is frequently treated as a 17 separate region of the State and has often been exempted from 18 major legislative initiatives the General Assembly enacts in 19 law because of this fact; and

2 WHEREAS, There continue to be organizations pushing for 3 separation between the City of Chicago and downstate Illinois 4 such as the "Southern Illinois Secession Movement"; and
