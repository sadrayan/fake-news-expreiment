Lt. Gov. Patrick Asks Fort Worth ISD Parents to Speak out Against Unilateral Action of Superintendent
AUSTIN – Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, called for the resignation of Dr. Kent Paredes Scribner, Superintendent of the Fort Worth Independent School District. He issued the following statement:

“After less than a year as superintendent, Dr. Scribner has lost his focus and thereby his ability to lead the Fort Worth ISD. He has placed his own personal political agenda ahead of the more than 86,000 students attending 146 schools in the district by unilaterally adopting ‘Transgender Student Guidelines.’

“Without any discussion with parents, board members, principals, and other community leaders, Dr. Scribner’s unilateral action, underscores this lack of fitness to hold his position as superintendent.

“Campus safety should be of paramount concern for anyone in his position. Every parent, especially those of young girls, should be outraged.

“The State of Texas has an affirmative responsibility to provide a safe environment in the schools where attendance is compulsory. While this may be an example of the need for the Legislature to pass a meaningful School Choice Bill, we must not allow the actions of Dr. Scribner to go unnoticed or unanswered.

“I call upon the parents within the Fort Worth ISD to take immediate steps to repeal this stealthy scheme and remove Dr. Scribner from his post.”

Parents can address the elected members of the Fort Worth ISD School Board meeting on Tuesday, May 10, 2016, at 5:30 p.m. The meeting will be held in the Board of Education complex at 2903, Shotts Street, Fort Worth, TX 76107.
