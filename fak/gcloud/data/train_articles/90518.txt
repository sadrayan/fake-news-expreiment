Uber, Nevada taxi legal battle gets complicated
LAS VEGAS (AP) — A legal battle between Nevada’s highly regulated taxi industry and ride-sharing company Uber has gotten complicated as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case.

In court Monday, Clark County District Judge Douglas Herndon blamed the overlap on the state attorney general’s office.

“I think you’re jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling,” he said.

The attorney general represents the Nevada Taxicab Authority and Nevada Transportation Authority. The state regulators want to put an end to Uber, which allows people using a smartphone app to hail a ride from one of its drivers in the driver’s personal car.

Uber attorneys, in filings Monday with Nevada’s Supreme Court, also accused the state of shopping for a courtroom.

Senior Deputy Attorney General Kimberly Arguello told Herndon her office may have handled the filings “inartfully.”

Hours after Uber launched its ride-sharing services Oct. 24 in Las Vegas, Reno and Carson City, the state hastily sought orders to halt the company’s business in all three cities.

Herndon said his office got a call from the attorney general’s office the next business day asking if the judge had granted the request to temporarily stop Uber in the Las Vegas area. He hadn’t and said he wouldn’t until he held a hearing.

Not long after, the attorney general filed its complaint and motions in Washoe County, Herndon said.

Herndon later denied the state’s request to halt Uber’s business.
