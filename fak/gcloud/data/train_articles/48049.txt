Note: Because the FCC requires that the political file contain the actual time the rate for spots “communicating a political matter of national importance” air, that information should be included in the file as soon as possible. If that information is only generated monthly, the file should include the name of a contact person who can provide the times that and rates for specific spots aired. The FCC’s online political files include a folder for “Terms and Disclosures.” NAB suggests that, for stations subject to the online public file rule, the names of contact person(s) be placed in that folder.
