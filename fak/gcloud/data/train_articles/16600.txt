Subject: Seeking a tally

I hope that you can pitch in on the queries (pasted below my sig in this email) submitted last week. I’d add to my original inquiries that I’d also be interested in the specific basis of the 780,000 and 792,000 figures in this FEMA release. Also, I am spotting very little

information about people left without homes in Louisiana. Any guidance there?

I do not seek fresh research here. I simply seek what was already public or available from FEMA as of early November 2017.

I hope to complete our fact-check today.

Thanks,

g.

With regard to the 780,000 and 792,000 figures in the September news release, we have an updated 893,997 households who have registered for assistance after Hurricane Harvey. I have no data on those left homeless as a result of the hurricane.

If you have further questions, let me know.

I just fielded a reply (see below). It says the 780,000 number originated with FEMA in Texas.

How did FEMA in Texas get to its figure?

Gardner,

The 780,000 was a number agreed upon by the State and FEMA at the 30 mark of the Harvey TX response effort. We received it from the FEMA/STATE response unit at that time.

The 792,000 is the number of survivor families who had applied for assistance at that time. The current number as of 12/4/2017 is 892,160

.... Bob is right that the numbers were derived from data collected by the State/FEMA response unit.

So, what did the data precisely indicate? How was it derived?

The number reflects the total number of survivors who registered for federal assistance through our National Processing Service Center on a specific date. The data is electronically collected.

Any kind of federal assistance? I am interested in if it indicates people left without homes or not.

You are correct. The number includes survivors looking for grants for rental assistance, home repair, personal property replacement, or direct housing (manufactured housing units or travel trailers). I am still waiting to hear back on a Nov. 4th figure for those identified for direct housing.

The number is for households who registered for federal assistance, which includes FEMA grants for rental assistance, home repair, and some personal property replacement, and low-interest loans to homeowners and renters from the US Small Business Administration. During times of disaster, FEMA tasks the SBA with providing disaster loans to homeowners and renters as well as businesses as part of the federal assistance package that comes following a presidential disaster declaration.

Out of 40,288 households who have been referred for direct housing interviews, 30,747 have indicated they have found alternate housing resources and do not need FEMA assistance, and 8,738 households have been found to need direct housing solutions from FEMA, meaning a manufactured housing unit or a travel trailer. We cannot say whether those 8,738 households are actually homeless, just that they have no short-term housing solution. They could be living with friends or neighbors currently.

Put another way: Is that figure reflective of individuals or households or what? How many people left without homes does it reflect? Conversely, does it also fold in people seeking anything outside of housing-related aid?
