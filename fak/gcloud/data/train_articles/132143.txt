Bunbury man's Bali horror

A Bunbury man has had a horrifying experience while on holiday in Bali after doctors found a spider inside his stomach.

Dylan Thomas was at the popular holiday destination at the weekend celebrating his 21st birthday with his best friend when he awoke in pain on Saturday morning.

He discovered a small red mark near his belly button and went to Bali International Medical Centre early Sunday morning when he discovered it growing.

He was sent home with antihistamine and told it was just an insect bite.

“I woke up the next day and it had blistered all the way from the bottom,” Mr Thomas said.

“That’s when I got concerned and went back to the hospital.

“They didn’t know what it was, referred me to a specialist who came in on the Monday and they were able to determine what it was from a swab.”

Mr Thomas doesn’t know what type of spider it was, but said it was about the size of a matchstick head.

Doctors removed the spider from the appendix scar it had entered.

He described the feeling as a burning, searing pain.

“Not like something I have ever experienced before and it is still quite painful,” Mr Thomas said.

“It was a bit concerning to know that something had been inside me for the last three days.”

Mr Thomas said his friend was horrified when he returned to the hotel and told him about the ordeal.

“It’s just the fact that something had been inside my body and was causing everything to happen, I can’t explain that feeling,” he said.

The tradesman’s mother was the first to spread pictures of the scar when she put it on Facebook.

“Mum was a bit horrified, she was the one who originally put it on Facebook,” he said.

Mr Thomas has embraced his new nickname, Spiderman.

“My mates are never going to let me live it down,” he said.

“It is a bit of a memento from my trip to Bali. One I will never forget.”
