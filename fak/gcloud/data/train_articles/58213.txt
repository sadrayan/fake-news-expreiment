Tracking all of President Trump’s false or misleading claims
“Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs.” Fact Check: Trump consistently fails to understand trade deficits. It is not a matter of "lost" money or "trillions of dollars" being "ripped from our nation." A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.

“And we're right now building a lot of wall in the southern border.” Fact Check: No, Trump’s wall is not yet being built. Congress inserted specific language in its appropriations bill that none of the $1.57 billion appropriated for border protection may be used for prototypes of a concrete wall that Trump observed while in California. The money can be used only for bollard fencing and levee fencing, or for replacement of existing fencing. The same restrictions were included in the spending bill Trump signed on Feb. 15, 2019. Trump appears to acknowledge the renovations, except he persists in claiming it is a wall.

“We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country.” Fact Check: Trump’s tax cut amounts to nearly 0.9 percent of the gross domestic product, meaning it is far smaller than President Ronald Reagan’s tax cut in 1981, which was 2.89 percent of GDP. Trump’s tax cut is the eighth largest tax cut — and even smaller than two tax cuts passed under Barack Obama.

“Our country has never been better economically.” Fact Check: The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton — or Ulysses S. Grant.

“Democrats will have a unanimous vote on a 20% issue in opposing Republican Senators tomorrow. The Dems are for Open Borders and Crime!” Fact Check: Democrats generally do not advocate for illegal immigration, let alone people pouring over the border. Many Democrats support immigration controls and tougher border security measures, just not Trump's wall.

“[The Russia Investigation] was a hoax. This was a witch hunt. I have absolutely nothing to hide. And I think a lot of things are coming out with respect to the other side.” Fact Check: President Trump frequently said the special counsel's investigation was a witch hunt or a hoax. The special counsel revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The special counsel concluded Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. But a summary of the special counsel's report, released by Attorney General William Barr, concluded the investigation "did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." The special counsel defined “coordination” as an “agreement — tacit or express — between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.” The special counsel also examined whether Trump obstructed justice. The special counsel’s report states that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him," Barr's summary said.

“China had free rein over our country, taking out $500 billion a year for many years. We actually rebuilt China, in the truest sense of the word. We rebuilt China.” Fact Check: The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services in 2017 with China was $335 billion. Trump often just cites the goods deficit, which was $375 billion, according to the Census Bureau. In any case, countries do not make or lose money on trade deficits.
