Tale of the Tape: Which former Governor running for President was worse – Jeb Bush or Rick Perry?

As Jeb Bush visits Rick Perry’s home turf on a fundraising swing, it got us thinking – if you put them side-by-side, who would win in a contest for Worst Former Governor Running for President?

Turns out, it’s a virtual tie! Both governors left behind a disastrous legacy. Check out the tale of the tape:

Joint Statement by Florida Democratic Party Chair Allison Tant and Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa:

“No matter who wins thecontest to be America’s worst former Governor, the voters lose. After the disastrous legacy that each governor has left behind, it’s clear that neither of these men is fit to be President. Americans deserve a president who shares their values and their vision for the future, not a failed GOP governor who wants to take us backwards.”
