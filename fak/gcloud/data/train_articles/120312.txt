Type 1 Diabetes Research Funding and Advocacy
“We are all in this together. To be able to go to the Walk and see that we are a community makes all the difference to my family,” Carmen Carr, Keyoshi Carr’s mother.

Keyoshi’s family changed forever when her older sibling was diagnosed with T1D. They quickly became active members of the JDRF community, doing school fundraisers, T1D education workshops and starting a JDRF One Walk team.

Six years later, the unimaginable happened again. Keyoshi was diagnosed with T1D. She had been a participant in TrialNet, a JDRF-funded program that offers risk screening for relatives of people with T1D. She had tested positive for antibodies, so her parents we’re watching for the symptoms. They credit TrialNet with potentially saving her life.
