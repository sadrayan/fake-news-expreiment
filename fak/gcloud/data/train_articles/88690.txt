Pro-Jindal super PAC fueled by Louisiana cash

The super PAC supporting Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s presidential bid took in $3.7 million in the first half of the year, according to a Federal Election Commission report released Friday.

The pro-Jindal group, Believe Again, spent about $1.1 million and has $2.6 million cash on hand.

The fundraising haul on behalf of Jindal is in line with super PACs backing other long shot candidates, including Carly Fiorina and Lindsey Graham.

He pulled in donations from several donors also supporting other candidates, including $250,000 from Bob Mercer, who is heavily backing Ted Cruz, and $10,000 from Foster Friess, who is aligned with Rick Santorum.

His only $1 million donation came from Gary Chouest, the Galliano, La.-based head of a ship company that’s a major player in the Gulf Coast. Of 130 contributions to the super PAC, more than two thirds can from his home state of Louisiana.
