Trend Information

Sample and Methodology detail



There is only a small gender gap as American voters agree 63 - 31 percent with the U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision on abortion, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today.





Men agree 61 - 32 percent, while women agree 65 - 30 percent, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University National Poll finds. Republicans disagree with Roe v. Wade 58 - 36 percent. Every other listed party, gender, education, age and racial group agrees.





The Supreme Court is mainly motivated by politics rather than law, American voters say 50 - 42 percent. The court is too liberal, 19 percent of voters say, as 31 percent say it is too conservative and 41 percent say it is about right.





But 49 percent of voters approve of the Supreme Court's decision upholding President Donald Trump's travel ban on citizens from five mostly Muslim countries, while 46 percent disapprove.





President Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court should make the court more conservative, 31 percent of voters say, as 29 percent say it should make the court more liberal and 35 percent say it should keep the current balance on the court.





American voters are divided on when the U.S. Senate should consider President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, as 46 percent say the Senate should consider the nomination and 48 percent say the Senate should not consider the nomination until after the November elections.





"It's a draw on banning travel from some largely Muslim countries, but there is no ambivalence on abortion as men and women dig in and say, 'Hands off Roe v. Wade,'" said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





American voters say 65 - 24 percent, including 48 - 37 percent among Republicans, they would like to see the U.S. Supreme Court be a check on President Trump.





Voters say 71 - 20 percent, including 51 - 36 percent among Republicans, they would like to see the U.S. Congress be a check on the president.





Elections to the U.S. House of Representatives





If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were held today, 50 percent of American voters say they would vote for the Democratic candidate, as 41 percent say they would vote for the Republican candidate.





Independent voters back the Democratic candidate 49 - 35 percent.





There are wide gender and racial gaps:

Men go Republican 50 - 42 percent as women go Democratic 58 - 33 percent;

White voters are divided 46 - 46 percent. Backing Democratic candidates are black voters 80 - 13 percent and Hispanic voters 60 - 35 percent.

American voters disapprove 78 - 15 percent of the way Congress is handling its job.





Immigration is the most important issue in deciding how they will vote in November's election for the House of Representatives, 27 percent of voters say, with 23 percent citing the economy, 22 percent listing health care and 13 percent saying gun policy.





"Is it a signal of a blue wave? Four months until elections for the U.S. House of Representatives and 50 percent of American voters say they plan to vote for Democratic candidates," Malloy added.





Trade Policy





Trump's trade policies are bad for the U.S. economy, voters say 50 - 39 percent and bad for their personal financial situation, voters say 46 - 35 percent.





Trump's trade policies will result in a trade war, voters say 52 - 38 percent and say 73 - 17 percent that a trade war would be bad for the U.S. economy.





From June 27 - July 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,020 voters nationwide, with a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points, including design effect. Live interviewers call landlines and cell phones.
