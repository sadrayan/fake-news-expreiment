The study on Discrimination and the Texas Economy was completed on October 23, 2015.

The best way to describe the process is “secondary research” with the findings of the secondary research extrapolated to Texas.

The study used conventional research methodology which may be easily replicated by other independent researchers. The team did an extensive review of the published research findings from legitimate sources. The team analyzed the findings of the published research and then projected the findings onto Texas based on population, per capita, and similar experiences such as loss of sporting events. The team was very clear in the study about their assumptions and how they were applied to any calculations. The data sources were documented in the Bibliography (Appendix B).

2. Was the fiscal impact estimates part of Study 1 launched using a conventional methodology? If so, what’s the best way to describe the approach?
