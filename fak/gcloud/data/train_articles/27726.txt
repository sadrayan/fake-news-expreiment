The Big Three Finish Among Top 10 in Total Day; Fox News Is No. 1 and Posts Year-Over-Year Growth
For the full 7-day week of May 7 2018, Fox News was the most-watched basic cable network in total day (18th straight week), the second-most-watched basic cable network in prime time, and a top 5 basic cable network among adults 25-54 in both of the aforementioned dayparts. Compared to the same week last year, FNC posted +6 percent in total prime time viewers, and +3 percent in total viewers.

Hannity was the No. 1 cable news program in both total viewers and A25-54 demo, marking 8 consecutive weeks as the most-watched cable news show, and four weeks as the No. 1 show in the 25-54 demo.

The Ingraham Angle defeated MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show last week, both in total viewers and among adults 25-54. It’s the first time Ingraham has posted an across-the-board win over Maddow.

Despite finishing No. 3 across basic cable, both in prime and in total day, MSNBC posted a very rare year-over-year loss in audience. The network was -9 percent in prime time and -9 percent in total day; and CNN posted double digit audience losses from the same week last year.

All three cable channels finished in the Top 10 in total day viewers, with Fox News No. 1, MSNBC No. 3 and CNN No. 7.

Per Nielsen live-plus-same-day data, TNT was by far the No. 1 basic cable network in prime time last week thanks to its continuing coverage of the NBA playoffs.
