Record of Accomplishment

President William Jefferson Clinton led America into the 21st century as the world’s leading force for peace and prosperity, freedom and security, and a more integrated global community rooted in shared values, shared benefits, and shared responsibilities. At home, he presided over unprecedented economic growth and dramatic social progress, which grew out of his core values of opportunity, responsibility, and community.

He advanced new ideas consistent with those values and governed beyond the old politics of left and right to build a new vital center in American life. In so doing he redefined the role of government for 21st century America: to create the conditions and give people the tools to make the most of their own lives. From beginning to end he pursued this vision, sometimes in conflict with the traditional positions of his own party, and often in the face of attacks from an increasingly partisan opposition party. President Clinton’s political philosophy, known as the Third Way, attracted followers around the world and continues to inspire innovative leaders in many nations.

Here are the results of eight years of sustained effort by President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and one of the most accomplished - and most diverse - administrations ever to serve the American people.
