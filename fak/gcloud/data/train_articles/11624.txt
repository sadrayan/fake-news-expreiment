Palm Beach County GOP motion to censure Crist fails on tie vote
WEST PALM BEACH — A motion to censure Gov. Charlie Crist for bucking the GOP on a variety of issues failed tonight on a 65-to-65 vote at a Palm Beach County Republican Executive Committee meeting, our Jennifer Sorentrue reports.

Committee member Steven Ledewitz proposed the partisan reprimand because Crist embraced the $787 billion Democratic stimulus package, failed to campaign for some local Republican candidates in 2008 and has appointed liberals and Democrats to various posts.

Volusia County’s Republican Executive Committee passed a resolution censuring Crist earlier this month.

The 65-to-65 censure vote came after a motion to table the resolution failed on a 64-to-64 vote with four absentions. There were no abstentions in the 65-to-65 vote, Sorentrue reports, but apparently two committee members were out of the room.
