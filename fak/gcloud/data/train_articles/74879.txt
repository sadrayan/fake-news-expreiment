PFT: Patriots footballs may have been closer to 11.5 PSI
Were Patriots footballs significantly under the legal pounds-per-square-inch threshold, or were they just slightly under?

According to Mike Florio over at Pro Football Talk, the ball intercepted by Indy linebacker D'Qwell Jackson in the second quarter of the AFC Championship Game was later measured at 10.5 PSI, which is 2.0 PSI under the legal minimum. However, a source told Florio, 10 other footballs -- which were reportedly also about 2.0 PSI under the legal range -- may have actually been closer to 11.5 PSI.

The new information contradicts the report from ESPN earlier this week that said 11 of 12 Patriots footballs measured in at about 2.0 PSI below the 12.5 PSI legal minimum. PFT's report says that perhaps just one football fell in that range.

Where the footballs measured and when is a significant piece into the league's investigation. If most of New England's footballs were found to be just 1.0 PSI below the legal range, then the league's margin for error in terms of finding the Patriots guilty of any wrongdoing may be slimmer.

As Patriots coach Bill Belichick noted on Saturday, any number of elements can impact the air pressure within a given football. If Patriots footballs were in fact under the legal limit by just 1.0 PSI, it would seem to strengthen the argument that natural causes reduced the air pressure inside New England's footballs.

PFT's report comes within a larger piece written by Florio that places some blame for the circus surrounding "Deflategate" at the feet of the NFL. You can read it all right here.
