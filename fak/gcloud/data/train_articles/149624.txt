Judicial Watch: Total Obama Travel Costs So Far, $106 Million
Based on a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit gainst the Department of Homeland Security, the government watchdog group Judicial Watch was able to obtain further travel records from the Secret Service, showing trip costs of $3.7 million that, combined with earlier travel records, reveal that travel expenses for President Barack Obama and his family have cost taxpayers, to date, $105,662,975.27. Travel costs for President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, to date, equal $7,560,425.01.

“It is troubling to see such massive amounts of money paid out for trips that appear to have minimal value to the public interest,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “And it is frustrating to have to file multiple FOIA lawsuits and engage in long-running court battles to get basic information about the costs of presidential travel.”
