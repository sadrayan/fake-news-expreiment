JAY-Z – Dirt Off Your Shoulder
About “Dirt Off Your Shoulder”

“Dirt off Your Shoulder” is the second single released from Jay-Z’s 2003 album “The Black Album.”

In 2004, the song was combined with the Linkin Park’s single “Lying from You” and released as a single for the mash-up album Colision Course.

In the song, “Dirt” represents the people who are trying to bring him down and are jealous of his success. Jay-Z expounds on his accomplishments and lavish lifestyle, and notes that these disparaging types are nothing more than dirt that he must brush off his shoulder.
