Obama Puts Something SICK in White House as a ‘Christmas Decoration’ – Look Closely
Photos of the Obama family’s final White House Christmas decorations were released yesterday, and Americans immediately noticed something very odd about this year’s display.

Western Journalism reported that Hillary Clinton’s will be on prominent display in the White House during the Christmas season, despite the fact that she lost the election. With this move, the Obamas are once again insulting Trump and making no secret of the fact that they wish Clinton had won the presidency.

“An official portrait of the former first lady and Democratic presidential nominee is hanging in the Cross Hall of the White House, displayed alongside an array of bells, baubles and other holiday décor,” The Hill reported.

“A tree adorned with gold stars represents ‘The Gift of Service,’ which pays homage to first lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative, aimed at supporting military service members and their families. Kiosks with touch screens can be used to pen a note to send to troops,” The Hill continued.

This comes after millions of American Christians were offended that the Obamas’ White House decorations did not include any images of Jesus Christ or the nativity scene. It’s sickening that the Obamas’ are willing to politicize Christmas by proudly displaying the painting of Clinton, yet are not willing to include anything about the true, biblical meaning of Christmas.
