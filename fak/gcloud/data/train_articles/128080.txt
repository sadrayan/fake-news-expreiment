'Stubborn and chauvinistic' men to blame for most road deaths - Transport Minister Dipuo Peters
She was addressing the media in Midrand on Tuesday‚ where she was delivering a progress report on the state of the Festive Season Road Safety Campaign which was launched at the beginning of December.

"We claim no easy victories and we tell no lies in confronting the scourge of road carnage underpinned by lawlessness and a recalcitrant attitude of some of our road users‚" Peters said.

"We have to do everything in our might to deal with the male stubborn and chauvinistic attitude as they account for 77.4% percent of fatalities and 89.4% being black."

She said a worrying behavioural pattern that continued unabated was the tendency to ignore the call for road safety by road users‚ something women were increasingly guilty of too.

"We have equally noticed a very disturbing trend relating to female road user behaviour. Females account for 21.2% of the total percentage of our fatalities [and] we have to deal decisively with this phenomenon and investigate the casual factors of this unfortunate trend‚" the minister said .

Between December 1 and 19‚ there have been 845 fatalities recorded‚ an increase of 17% over the same period last year.

Peters said she would urgently convene a meeting with all traffic chiefs and regional directors of provinces with high fatalities to engage and also "robustly" confront the prevailing situation with a view to finding solutions to reduce fatalities.

The Department of Transport would also engage the Department of Justice in a bid to introduce minimum sentences for negligent and reckless driving.

According to Peters‚ drunk driving remains one of the main contributing factors to crashes.

"We are seeking to reclassify drunken driving from Schedule 3‚ which is less severe to a more severe Schedule 5 offense to ensure those who negligently cause crashes on the roads do not get bail easily and spend time behind bars‚" she added. - TMG Digital
