What are Auto Fleet Sales? (with pictures)
Auto fleet sales are sales of vehicles to companies, organizations, or government agencies that own a fleet of vehicles. Some types of businesses that may own large fleets of vehicles are rental car companies, businesses that deliver products or packages, taxi and shuttle services, and those that provide vehicles for employee use. Organizations or government agencies that may own a fleet of vehicles include charities, police departments, fire departments, postal services, armed forces and local and national government agencies.

Many vehicle manufacturers rely on auto fleet sales for a large percentage of their vehicle sales and offer special programs and incentives for fleet purchasers. In fact, when car companies tout a vehicle as being the “best-selling” in a particular category, it may be due in large part to auto fleet sales. Of course, manufacturers may not advertise the fact that a car’s sales volume is actually due to auto fleet sales, as opposed to sales to regular consumers.

There is also a negative aspect of fleet sales for vehicle manufacturers, as they typically generate lower profits per vehicle and often diminish the value of a vehicle in the public’s eye. For example, in the mid-1990s the Ford Taurus was the best-selling vehicle in its class in the United States. Ford featured this fact prominently in its advertising for the Taurus.
