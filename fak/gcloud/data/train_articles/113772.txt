RIO DE JANEIRO — American skeet shooter Kim Rhode has made history.

Rhode defeated China’s Mei Wang in a shoot-off to claim the bronze medal in women’s skeet. She and Italian luger Armin Zoeggeler are now the only athletes to earn a medal in six straight Olympics, with Rhode being the first woman to accomplish the feat.

She has six medals, including three golds, to become the most decorated female shooter in Olympic history.

Rhode also ties the record for most years between medals after winning double trap gold as a 17-year-old at the 1996 Atlanta Games.

Diana Bacosi captured gold in women’s skeet. Bacosi hit 15 of 16 targets to defeat fellow Italian and 2008 gold medalist Chiara Cainero in the final match for her first gold medal.

American Morgan Craft finished fifth.
