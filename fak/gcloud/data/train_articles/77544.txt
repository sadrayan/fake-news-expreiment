How much does a private jet flight cost with NetJets?

With a NetJets membership, you purchase an undivided interest in a specific aircraft and gain access to a fleet of more than 650 jets worldwide. Prices per share with the private aviation company vary depending on the type of jet you choose — light, mid-size or large-cabin — and how often you fly. The smallest share you can purchase is a 1/16 interest, which gives you 50 hours of flight time a year. Your biggest upfront cost is a one-time acquisition fee: for the Phenom 300 Platinum Edition jet, which is being added to the NetJets fleet later this year, a 1/16 interest, or 50 flight hours, costs $550,000. The largest share possible is a one-half interest, or 400 hours of flight time, which costs $4.4 million.



In addition to the acquisition cost, fractional jet owners are also responsible for a monthly management fee and an occupied hourly fee, which covers fuel, maintenance, catering and landing fees. For that same jet, the monthly management fee for a 50-hour share is $9,600, while a 400-hour share costs $60,000. The occupied fee is the same regardless of jet size, at $1,950 per hour. NetJets owners sign up for a two-year, two-and-a-half-year or three-year commitment, depending on the size of the aircraft, and NetJets has a guaranteed buy-back option after that commitment is up.



NetJets also has finance and leasing options, if you want a smaller upfront expense. NetJets offers 6 percent fixed-rate financing on balances $100,000 and up after you’ve put down 20 percent of the value at signing. You can also buy a pre-paid lease with the Marquis Jet Card, which is good for 25 hours of flight time. A single year starts at $119,900 in a Hawker 400XP jet.
