TaB Energy Drink
TaB Energy

TaB Energy is a pale pink, lightly carbonated, low calorie energy drink named after Tab, Coca Cola's original low-calorie cola brand. While it shares the Tab name, it is not a cola product like the original Tab. Fashion Week Daily describes it as a "sweet and sour beverage" with a taste "reminiscent of a liquid Jolly Rancher." Some drinkers alternatively label the taste as reminding them of strawberry or watermelon Nerds, and find it bitter yet quenching. It is sweetened with Sucralose and packed in a 10.5 ounce slim, pink can. The original Tab had 31 milligrams of caffeine and less than 1 calorie per serving, while Tab Energy has 95 milligrams of caffeine and 5 calories. The drink is somewhat unique amongst energy drinks, in that it is designed specifically for women. The brand's website offers daily inspirational ideas "for feeling fabulous" and offers sylish, pink-infused desktop wallpapers and customized e-greetings.
