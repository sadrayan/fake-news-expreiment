House fails to override Trump veto on national emergency
The House failed on Tuesday, 248-181, to get the two-thirds majority necessary to override the first veto of Donald Trump's presidency, which he had issued in response to Congress voting to terminate his emergency declaration.

Why it matters: Trump's national emergency, which he declared in order to collect $3.6 billion of the $8 billion he has requested for a border wall, will stay in effect as a number of lawsuits challenging its legality work their way through the courts.
