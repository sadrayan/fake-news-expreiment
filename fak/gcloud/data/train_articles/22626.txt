BREAKING: Chuck Schumer, Democrat Senate Minority Leader, Accused of Raping His Daughter's 16 Year Old Friend: Friend Then "Committed Suicide" â€” Steemit
December 9: Lisa Schumer exposed her father's ongoing sexual relationship with her 16 year old high school best friend, Rebecca, which resulted in two abortions and led the girl to "commit suicide" three years later. Caitlin Schumer, Chuck Schumer's wife, confirmed the story. Lisa Schumer said she was informed by the girl's mother of the "affair" and that her mother, Caitlin Schumer reportedly paid Rebecaa to "go away." Three years later, the young woman was dead.

Sex with a minor is rape. According to Lisa and Caitlin Schumer, Chuck Schumer repeatedly "had sex" with Rebecca, impregnating her twice.

Although the young woman is no longer alive to testify, records from Planned Parenthood could be the key in proving the abortions did occur. Additionally, Rebecca left behind very detailed diaries during the time period of the "affair".

This news comes on the heals of Schumer's recent vehement condemnation of Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for the Alabama state Senate, for similar allegations that have since proven to be false.

Lisa Schumer said that she came forward because she could not stand for the blatant hypocritical behavior her father was guilty of in his calling for Roy Moore to remove himself from the Senate race.
