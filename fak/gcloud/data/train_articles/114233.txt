KKK fliers praising President Donald Trump surface in west Mobile
The Mobile Police Department is investigating a series of KKK fliers praising President Donald Trump being distributed in a west Mobile neighborhood this past weekend.

On Monday afternoon, Mobile Police Department spokesman Donald Wallace confirmed that they are investigating the incident.

The KKK fliers, sent in clear ziploc bags, with a letter and white rice inside, appeared outside of homes in the Autumn Ridge neighborhood just before 4:00 p.m. on Saturday (June 17) afternoon.

A relative of one of the victims, Laurie-Anne Crespo, said her relative found a piece of KKK/Trump propaganda in front her home around that time.

Later, the relative discovered that every home in the neighborhood had received the same flier.

In an email Crespo said many of the residents were upset and complaining on about receiving the letters using the Next Door application for their neighborhood association.

"We are notifying everyone we can think of, including the NAACP, MCDEC-MINORITY Affairs Division, local and national media, local and state officials and candidates," said Crespo.

The message on the KKK fliers lists the American Christian Knights organization, based in Mississippi, with their phone number and website address. The letter states that, "Only white Christians need apply."

The letter has President Trump's name written in large font at the the top. The letter lists five reasons why citizens should support President Trump.

It begins by stating that, "Like it or not he's our President."

The letter goes on to say that President Trump has been trying to stop illegal immigration, put Americans back to work and even takes a jab at former President Barack Obama.

The American Christian Knights organization distributed a similar letter in west Mobile back in January, during the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

At this time the Mobile police said the investigation is ongoing.
