Here's ad from Ryan-backed group 'thanking' Curbelo for healthcare vote
@PatriciaMazzei

The promised TV ad from a political nonprofit backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan to praise Miami Rep. Carlos Curbelo and other vulnerable Republicans who voted for the American Health Care Act is here.

American Action Network pledged to politically back House lawmakers who supported the Obamacare replacement legislation, a priority for Ryan and President Donald Trump. Curbelo and 20 other Republicans who voted "yes" could face challenging reelection races in their swing districts next year. Curbelo has yet to draw an opponent.

The ad features a California woman who lost her doctor under the Affordable Care Act. It will be tailored to each of the representatives' districts. The only other Florida Republican also getting the help is Rep. Brian Mast of Hutchinson Island.

The bill still hasn't moved in the Senate.

This post's headline has been changed to avoid confusion with Ryan's political arm, "Team Ryan."
