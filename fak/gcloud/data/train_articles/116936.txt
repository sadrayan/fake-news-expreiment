Chick-Fil-A story is about so much more than just 'marriage' and 'speech'
I made this graphic to explain what the real problem is with Chick-Fil-A. I'm glad it's taking off on Facebook shares and now being featured at JoeMyGod blog.

Chick-Fil-A's corporate "charity" arm WinShape has donated millions of dollars to groups like Family Research Council. FRC doesn't just oppose marriage equality, they really do HATE gays. Its president Tony Perkins has said of LGBT people:

“They are intolerant. They are hateful. They are vile. They are spiteful...pawns of the enemy.”

And in 2010 Tony Perkins' Family Research Council claimed in federal forms they had spent $25,000 to lobby Congress on "CIVH.Res.1064Ugandan Resolution Pro-homosexual promotion." This proposed Congressional resolution condemned the Ugandan government's legislative efforts to make "homosexuality" an offense punishable by death.

How can anyone oppose condemning that? But Family Research Council apparently did.

And Family Research Council gets money from Chick-Fil-A. Joe Jervis was the first to break this story, more details can be found here.

Dan Cathy can say whatever he likes about gays and marriage and Jesus and whatever. And people are free to eat at Chick-Fil-A. But they should do so understanding where Dan Cathy's profits go and what sorts of things they support.
