Did you know DC sidewalks are overrun with cockroaches at night? : washingtondc
I don't step outside much after dark, but tonight first time since it got warmer I needed to make a quick late night run to locate Harris Teeter at 11:00pm. The stairs of the store and sidewalks in front were overrun with hundreds of cockroaches and I could literally hear them crawling and clicking.

Not to say the sidewalks everywhere else are clear. I stepped on a few cockroaches on my very street on the way to HT.

Did you all know this? Also is this city public works job to spray and sanitize for pests?

EDIT : Corrected auto correct.

UPDATE: TIL Cockroaches (a.k.a. Palmetto bugs) are southern USA urban environments fixtures. Thank you all for the information. Also boric acid is the insecticide of choice. Here is how it works: https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef614 Besides roaches DC also has apparently rat infestation.
