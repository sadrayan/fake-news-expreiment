Death of a young man after consuming egg and then sweet banana

After consuming egg and then sweet banana immediately, he died on the spot.

After researching the cause of his death, they discovered that the mixture of the egg and the sweet banana in the stomach turns into a poison that kills on the field.

For this reason do not eat the egg with sweet banana; It kills the net.

Do not keep it for yourself, share ...

---------------------------

Only the bad people are not going to share this because they want to see others die ...

Our Investigation – It is being told that fruits like Banana is having rich contents of Potassium, Vitamins C and B6 along with Fibre and fats. And Egg is having good contents of Fats, Protein and cholesterol. So, when we mix them together, it becomes toxic.

The above logic looks highly illogical as we mix these kind to varieties to also make pancakes and they are one of the most wonderful dishes eaten worldwide.

It looks like another internet hoax. From childhood onwards we have been consuming many combinations of egg and banana on a daily basis and still we are alive.

Conclusion – This news could be true only if the person who had consumed rotten banana and rotten eggs in large quantity. So eat fresh food and be healthy. Banana and egg is good and healthy combination of food to be consumed. Man cannot die after consuming egg and sweet banana unless and until he keeps on eating it endlessly. This is just an internet hoax
