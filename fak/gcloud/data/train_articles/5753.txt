Graham Requests Sinkhole Records From Governor
WASHINGTON, D.C. – In reaction to Governor Rick Scott’s office claiming they weren’t made aware of a sinkhole dumping toxic water into Florida’s aquifer for weeks, Representative Gwen Graham is expanding a public records request to include all electronic communication concerning the sinkhole to and from the governor’s office.

“I don’t know which is worse. Either Governor Rick Scott knew about the sinkhole and didn’t inform the public, or leadership at the Department of Environmental Protection is so irresponsible they didn’t alert the governor to a potential public health disaster. Both scenarios are appalling, and the people of Florida deserve full accountability,” Rep. Graham said.

Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Jon Steverson was handpicked by Governor Scott and reported to be the only person he “felt was worthy of an interview.” Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater declined the opportunity to nominate any other candidates for the position.

This public records request follows a previous request Rep. Graham made to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on Friday, September 23. The toxic sinkhole, now estimated to be more than 300-feet-deep, opened up in Polk County last month, but nearby residents were only alerted of the potential danger when local media exposed the incident three weeks later.
