BREAKING: Sasha Obama Just Crashed Her Expensive New Car Into A Lake
When Barack Obama bought his daughter Sasha a used Bugatti Veyron for Christmas, she apparently loved the new car so much that she immediately took it for a spin. Unfortunately, that car didn’t last long.

The former President* put his “hard-earned” speaking fees to work getting the car for his daughter, but it quickly became a $1.1 million piece of fish food when she picked up her friends and promptly crashed it into a lake. The Washington Times-Heraldreports:

The younger Obama daughter frantically called police after she apparently went too fast around a turn and drove her car off the road and into Lake Hope, about 32 miles outside of Washington, D.C. Officers noted a “strong smell of marijuana” in the crashed vehicle, but no drugs were found as the wreckage was searched. Sasha Obama was cited for reckless driving and released into her parents’ custody. Her three passengers, ages 15, 17, and 16, were also released into their parents’ custody. One was treated for “minor injuries” according to Washington Sheriff Donald Harland.

Forgetting for a moment how ironic an Obamacar sinking into Lake Hope is, why would any parent spend more than a million dollars on a car for a child who has just turned 16? Why was she allowed to drive it unsupervised. What if someone had been seriously hurt?

According to police, Sasha Obama admits she was driving “more than 90 mph down Lake Hope Rd.” where the speed limit is 35.

The Obamas have no respect for America, but hopefully Sasha has learned a (expensive) lesson about speeding.
