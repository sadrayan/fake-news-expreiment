DPVA Statement on Donald Trumpâ€™s New Leadership Team in Virginia
The Democratic Party of Virginia (DPVA) Chairwoman Susan Swecker released the following statement after Donald Trump's campaign announced its new statewide leadership team in Virginia:

"As more deeply troubling reports of Trump mistreating and degrading women come to light, his campaign is attempting to gloss over its disastrous week by naming a new Republican leadership council, which unsurprisingly includes lawmakers who have spent their careers supporting legislation that restricts women's rights. What Donald Trump stands for is fundamentally incompatible with Virginia values. These Republicans are on the wrong side of history, and they will be held responsible by Virginians for enabling a man accused of repeatedly groping and assaulting women and then bragging about it. By supporting Trump, they are validating the behavior of someone who is unfit to hold our nation's highest office. Just this week, students at Virginia's universities publicly denounced Trump, and Virginia Republicans would do well to take a page from their book."
