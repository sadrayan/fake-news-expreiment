Former Texas Police Officer Found Guilty of Killing 15-Year-Old Jordan Edwards
A white former police officer in a Dallas suburb was found guilty by a jury on Tuesday of fatally shooting an unarmed black high school freshman with a high-powered rifle in April 2017.

The former officer, Roy D. Oliver II, was fired from the Balch Springs Police Department after he shot and killed Jordan Edwards, 15, as Jordan and four other teenagers drove away from a house party. Mr. Oliver fired into the vehicle, hitting Jordan in the head as he sat in the front passenger seat.

Last week, Mr. Oliver testified that he had decided to fire at the car when he saw it moving toward his partner, Officer Tyler Gross, endangering him. But Officer Gross told the court that he had not feared for his life.

The jury returned its verdict on the second day of deliberations. Mr. Oliver, 38, was found not guilty on two counts of aggravated assault, but he faces at least five years or up to life in prison on the murder conviction.
