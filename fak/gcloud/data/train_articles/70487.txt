Biographers and analysts keep chipping away at Donald Trump, hoping to eventually reach the core, the bottom line, the ultimate truth. New York Times journalist Timothy L.

But you also have to consider the source. O'Brien refers to all of the books Trump has penned as "nonfiction works of fiction" and "a tour of the business world according to Mister Id.
