Don’t vote for Kesha Rogers
Kesha Rogers is one of the candidates on the ballot for U.S. Senator in the Democratic primary -- but do not be fooled.

Ms. Rogers is a member of the “LaRouche Movement,” which has a history of violent rhetoric. The LaRouche movement is a political cult promoting Lyndon LaRouche and his ideas. Rogers aligned herself with this organization of 'revolutionary socialists' that are focused on impeaching President Obama. She has even paraded around Texas with a poster of the President depicted with a Hitler mustache.

Rogers believes that global warming is a hoax, the U.S. economy is secretly controlled by London financial institutions and has advocated for colonizing Mars.

The Texas Democratic Party does not support the candidacy of Kesha Rogers or anyone that aligns themselves with the LaRouche Movement. Our State Democratic Executive Committee even issued a resolution against her campaign.

Do not vote for Kesha Rogers. Rogers’ candidacy is an insult to our Party, our President, our state, our Democratic values, and to all the work you are doing to move our state forward.
