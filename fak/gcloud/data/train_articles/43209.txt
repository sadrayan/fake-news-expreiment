Directed Energy
Joe Sullivan

Laser Pod Systems Engineer

“Directed energy is basically throwing electro-optical physics at the target,” says Joe Sullivan, systems engineer working in directed energy at Lockheed Martin in Orlando, Florida. “It’s a whole new world and getting in on the ground floor is about as exciting as it gets for an engineer.”

Joe started at Lockheed Martin as an analog electronics design engineer on the Canadian Forces Low Level Air Defense System program and is now a systems engineer developing control solutions for a laser pod development program. He is part of a team exploring and addressing the challenges of operating podded laser systems in a high-speed airborne environment.

He thoroughly enjoys the work he does and the company he works for and says, “I love to learn. I can’t think of a better place to learn than Lockheed Martin. I am a very fortunate engineer.”
