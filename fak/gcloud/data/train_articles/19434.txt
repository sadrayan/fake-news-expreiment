Mark's Weekly Update
Meeting Deputy Jordan Sherrill I want to begin our newsletter with an update on some great news. Many of you may have read about or been praying for Deputy Jordan Sherrill--one of our Caldwell County Deputies who was shot during a traffic stop in July. This week, I was honored to meet Deputy Sherrill and personally tell him 'thank you.' He’s an outstanding young man and deputy. Most importantly, I’m extremely grateful to tell you he is recovering well! Please continue praying for him and his family in the coming days and weeks as he continues his recovery.

With Deputy Jordan Sherrill Honoring Susan Belcher and Chancellor David Belcher I was grateful to present Western Carolina University's Susan Belcher with an official U.S. Flag, flown over the U.S. Capitol building in honor of her late husband, Chancellor David Belcher, who passed away this past summer. We are so thankful for the Belchers and everything they've done for the WNC community. Meredith Whitfield from Western Carolina tweeted about our presentation with the photo here.

Presenting Susan Belcher with a U.S. Flag, honoring Chancellor David Belcher Investigation Update  Interviewing Bruce Ohr On Tuesday this week, the House Judiciary and House Oversight Committees in Congress paused recess to reconvene and privately interview Bruce Ohr, a DOJ official who was at the center of the issue with the infamous, uncorroborated dossier and investigating the Trump campaign. Here are some key facts you need to know about Bruce Ohr to understand why he is important to our investigation: Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS  which was the firm hired by the Clinton campaign to write the dossier.

Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI.

The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign. In other words, from what we know, it looks like Bruce Ohr was the Department of Justice’s middle man between the Clinton campaign and the FBI. We also have records showing at least 60+ contacts between Bruce Ohr and Chris Steele who, as you know, was the author of the dossier. We even have records of Ohr and Steele communicating after the FBI had told the American public they had ‘terminated’ Steele as a source! This is very important. The Department of Justice is not supposed to be involved in partisan political campaigns. If we know Bruce Ohr was communicating with someone like Chris Steele, hired to write a partisan democrat opposition research project, that is a problem. We need to know what they discussed, when they met, and more. While we aren’t permitted to share everything from the interview publicly, the interview was productive, and we learned some important information that we can use to continue. We will keep you updated as we receive more. Ultimately, remember this: this is not about challenging the integrity of institutions like the FBI and DOJ. On the contrary, this investigation is about PROTECTING the integrity of those institutions. The vast majority of men and women at the FBI and DOJ are outstanding, integral, hard-working people who desire to keep you and me safe every day. They deserve our thanks. On the other hand, the evidence we’ve seen clearly shows there were a few rogue actors at the top, from the previous administration, who broke the rules for political purposes. That cannot be allowed to stand. This investigation is about bringing accountability to those people  and we will keep working until we do so. I interviewed with Fox News’ Sandra Smith before the Bruce Ohr interview to explain more about the situation and why he matters to the topic. You can watch the clip here.
