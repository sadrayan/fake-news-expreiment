How much money have the presidential candidates taken from the fossil fuel industry?

This list tracks funding to 2016 presidential campaigns from individuals working in the coal, oil and gas industries.

Last updated March 21, 2016.

The following data was provided by the Center for Responsive Politics, based on filings made available on March 21, 2016.These totals include funding from individuals working for the fossil fuel industry to each candidate’s campaign committee; they do not include funding via super PACs.

Because of lax regulation of political donations—due in part to the Citizens United Supreme Court decision—it is impossible to track all of the support provided to candidates from the coal, oil and gas industries. Private foundations like Hillary Clinton’s Clinton Foundation and super PACS like Ted Cruz’s Keep the Promise PAC have received millions of dollars from fossil fuel sources, but are not included in this list.
