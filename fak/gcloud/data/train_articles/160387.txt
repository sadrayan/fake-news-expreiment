French army trolls Trump with picture of them training in rain
After Donald Trump failed to make it to the American war cemetery at Belleau in France at the weekend, the US president has been gently mocked by the official Twitter account of the French army.

Using the hashtag #MondayMotivation, they posted a picture of a soldier training, with the caption: “Il y a de la pluie, mais c’est pas grave [it is raining, but it’s not a big deal].”

At the weekend, the French weather was given as the reason for Trump not visiting the cemetery. His press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said “near-zero visibility” meant Trump could not visit via helicopter, and he did not use a motorcade to travel for fear of disrupting traffic in Paris.

The jibe from the French military came after social media users picked up on an appearance in the rain last year by Justin Trudeau, seized on by many as a rebuke to Trump’s non-attendance.

Dispensing with his umbrella mid-speech, the Canadian prime minister said: “As we sit here in the rain, thinking how uncomfortable we must be these minutes as our suits get wet, and our hair gets wet … it’s all the more fitting that we remember on that day in Dieppe the rain wasn’t rain, it was bullets.”

The US president was bombarded on social media with images of his predecessor Barack Obama paying his respects to veterans on multiple occasions in the rain.

Trump, who has made paying respect to veterans a significant element in his complaints about black NFL athletes kneeling during the national anthem, has a history of difficulty with the rain. A couple of weeks ago, he was filmed dumping an umbrella outside Air Force One, after struggling to put it down so he could get through the door of the plane.
