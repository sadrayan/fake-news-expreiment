BREAKING: Donald Trump’s Kids Are Selling Access To Their Father For A $1 Million “Donation” – This Is IMPEACHABLE! [DETAILS]
The shamelessness of President-elect Donald Trump and his family is limitless and without boundaries. They do not care about the appearance of impropriety or actual impropriety. That is why Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Jr., founded a non-profit organization to funnel money through when they sell access to Trump once he is inaugurated. Indeed, Fascism has come to America in the form of an orange failed businessman with a penchant for using racial slurs.

The non-profit the Trump offspring founded is named the “Opening Day Foundation “, and they are offering Trump’s richest supporters the grand opportunity of private access. However, the access comes with a price tag of a cool one million dollars. Individuals who are rich, but not rich enough to attempt to buy a favor from the president, can also purchase time with either of the Trump boys for as little as $25,000. What does one purchase besides time with Trump? Certain packages include pictures and a private reception with the president. Others include a multi-day hunting trip, or a fishing trip with Eric or Donald Jr.

Trump’s sons, who are named as “honorary co-chairs” of the foundation, promise that the “net proceeds” of the event will be donated to “conservation” charities. They fail to stipulate any of the charities, however. This means that is it possible they will donate the money to themselves. Why wouldn’t they? The Trump boys founded this charity less than a week ago, and it would not be out of the realm of possibility for them to found another just to keep the money. Furthermore, the “net proceeds” are different from the gross amount taken in. Who knows how much will be spent on the event, or where the services will be procured.

All in all it smells like another scam cooked up by Trump to swindle a few bucks to put into his pockets. We have come to expect nothing less.
