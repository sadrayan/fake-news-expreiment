Cuts to mental health care could leave thousands without help, advocates say
"We're trying to figure out how to take the cut so it doesn't cripple just one thing," said Donna Wyche, division manager of mental health and homeless issues for Orange County government. "We want to keep the CRC open because it's a state-of-the-art program, and it helps everyone â€” the jails, the hospitals, the consumers. But if we spread the cuts out, it will eliminate some of the programs that people go to when they leave the CRC. So what happens then?"
