Iconique! It's Miley
We can’t stop and we won’t stop – because it’s our party and we can do what we want to – here’s Miley! Yes, Ms. Cyrus is the latest star to cover the Wonderland Spring 18 Issue, self-styled and shot by the equally fantastique, Ellen von Unwerth.

Talking #BitchIsBack, Elton John and her “perfect” pet pigs, the iconique figure elsewhere tells us about the standout moment from last year’s Tonight Show takeover (it may or may not involve a certain HRC), and gets deep in personal style chat.

In shops shortly, or, if waiting’s simply not your vibe, pre-order today from the Wonderland shop – here.
