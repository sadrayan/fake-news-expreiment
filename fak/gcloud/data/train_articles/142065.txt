Breaking: Paul Ryan Nominates Joel Osteen to Be New House Chaplain
It just goes to show, they care nothing about "Gods Truth For the Conduct of Mankind with respect toward other mankind... they only want to "talk prosperity" because their mentality is about "Greed and Money".



The care for general society has no concern for these Republicans.... if they could, they'd change money to read-- "In Money We Trust" !!!! Screw everything and everyone else. They have the mentality of Slaver's.... one in which nothing matters except money... and no act is to vile in the pursuit of money.





Anyone who talks of honor, ethics, truth and fair play... Republicans will want to incarcerate them and if they could, they'd order them before a firing squad.



They figure they've force fed PLUTOCRACY DOWN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THROAT....!!!! they've insulted and denigrated the justice system....so now... REPUBLICANS... figure all they got to do, is keep pushing and the rest will submit to PLUTOCRACY.
