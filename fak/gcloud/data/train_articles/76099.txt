Database of State Incentives for Renewables & EfficiencyÂ®
The North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center has always striven to keep DSIRE a free and open resource, providing valuable information on thousands of policies and incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency. It takes significant effort from our team of analysts to keep the information in DSIRE up to date. After 20+ years of federal support, the funding to keep this an open and free resource has been discontinued. We will strive to keep DSIRE free and open for as long as we can, but we ask for your financial support to do so. Please consider giving a tax-deductible donation to support DSIRE today. go.ncsu.edu/ givencclean
