Images reveal how Hiroshima has become a modern city 70 years after atomic bomb
The pictures of the modern metropolis - complete with soaring towers and bullet trains - give little hint of what happened 70 years before.

The only obvious testament to the horror of what occurred here on August 6, 1945, is the skeletal dome - the only building left standing near the epicentre of the bomb which left 140,000 dead.

In the intervening decades, the Atomic Bomb Dome has been carefully preserved as the city rose from the ashes around it.

Photographer Eugene Hoshiko, who grew up in Yokohama, on the otherside of Japan, travelled to Hiroshima to see for himself what had become of the city he had seen so many pictures of over the years.

He was amazed by what he saw.

'The city I found was very much rebuilt and alive, with a population today of 1.2million,' said Hoshiko.

'The streetcars are packed again. The stark wasteland seen in the black-and-white photos taken soon after the bombing is but a memory.'

Very little of the city which existed before August 6, 1945, survived the bomb dropped by the Americans.

About 90 per cent of Hiroshima was destroyed, and 140,000 out of its 350,000 residents had died by the end of the year, as a result of radiation poisoning.

Three days later, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing another 80,000 and forcing the Japanese to surrender - finally bringing to an end the Second World War.

Like Hiroshima, it to has had to rebuild itself from the ground up.

Reconstruction: It was rumoured nothing would grow in the city at first, but then, the next spring, the flowers began to bloom again - and people decided to return to the devastated city and rebuild

‹ Slide me › Past: 'The stark wasteland seen in the black-and-white photos taken soon after the bombing is but a memory,' said photographer Eugene Hoshiko, who wanted to see the city for himself. Pictured: The ruins of the Nagasaki Medical College, and the same place today. The city was hit three days later

The biggest surprise, it seems, was the size of the Atomic Bomb Dome, which had always loomed large in his mind.

'It wasn't as big as I had imagined. Then I thought, the building itself may be small, but its meaning is huge to all of us human beings,' said Hoshiko.
