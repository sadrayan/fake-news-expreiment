Pawlenty will sign health bill for poor
With just a week to spare before thousands of low-income Minnesotans were scheduled to lose state-sponsored health coverage, the House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to approve a compromise measure that would extend the state's General Assistance Medical Care program (GAMC).

The 121-12 vote ended weeks of political battle that brought the program to the brink of death, after a veto by Gov. Tim Pawlenty, and produced intense lobbying by the state's hospitals, Catholic bishops and advocates for the poor.

The measure, which passed the Senate last week, allows GAMC to survive in a pared-down form and continue serving about 30,000 of the state's sickest and poorest residents.

The measure "is not what I might have wished,'' said a tearful Erin Murphy, a St. Paul DFLer, nurse, and one architect of the compromise. But, she added, the vote showed that "people who live in the shadow of society deserve care.''

Pawlenty, who helped negotiate the compromise with DFL and Republican leaders two weeks ago, will sign the bill, said Brian McClung, the governor's deputy chief of staff. He said the measure will "help rein in the costs of this program while continue to provide coverage to low-income Minnesotans.''

The GAMC program was set to expire April 1, after Pawlenty vetoed its funding last year as part of his effort to balance the state budget and also vetoed legislation aimed at its restoration last month.
