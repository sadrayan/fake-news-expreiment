Absent Rauner gets shoutout as Illinois Republicans cast Trump convention votes
Illinois Republican Chairman Tim Schneider had the honors of casting the Illinois’ delegation vote at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night, hailing an absent Gov. Bruce Rauner, and leading chants of “Woo” and “Trump.”

“I’m a proud citizen of the state of Illinois and the United States of America and we have the finest governor in our nation in Gov. Bruce Rauner,” said Schneider, a Cook County commissioner who was picked for the state GOP job by Rauner.

Rauner is absent from the convention and aides have said he is not “formally endorsing” Trump, though the governor has called himself the leader of his party and has urged support for the GOP ticket.

Schneider then cast the state’s 69 delegate votes — six for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, nine for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and 54 for Donald Trump, whom he called “the next president of the United States.”

Schneider then engaged in an uncharacteristic Ronnie “Woo Woo” Wickers-style impression, chanting “woo, woo, woo” and then began shouting “Trump, Trump, Trump,” before his microphone was cut off.

Moments earlier, state Rep. John Cabello, R-Machesney Park, the delegation co-chair and a major Trump supporter, introduced himself to the convention as “the only Hispanic member on the Republican side of the aisle” in the state House, before turning the microphone over to the state GOP chairman.
