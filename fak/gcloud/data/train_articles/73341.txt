Gov. Rauner declares $188 million in state taxable income for 2015
Gov. Bruce Rauner released his 2015 tax returns Friday, revealing that he and wife Diana had more than $188 million in state taxable income, a huge jump from a year prior when they reported an income of $58 million.

A longtime equity investor, Rauner paid more than $50 million in federal and state taxes, for a total tax rate of 26 percent.

The information comes just days after Republicans led by Rauner were able to pick up six seats in the state legislature, thanks in part to tens of millions of dollars in his own money that the governor poured into competitive races.

In keeping with a practice since declaring his candidacy in 2013, Rauner released only the two-page Form 1040. Not disclosed were the schedules and other attachments that could provide more details about his earnings and the size and sort of tax breaks he might use to his advantage.

State law does not require Rauner to make any tax disclosures, but many top officials and politicians routinely share that information with the public, including the release of supporting attachments.

Even so, the documents show, as in prior years, that the bulk of his income comes from revenue categories that qualify for tax rates discounted well below the 39.6 percent top federal tax bracket for high earners.

Separate returns for the Rauner Family Foundation show it made $11.6 million in charitable contributions.
