Senator Scott Brown's father passes away following battle with Parkinson's disease
Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown's father, Claude Bruce Brown of Newburyport, died Thursday afternoon following a long battle with Parkinson's disease, according to the senator's office in Washington.

â€œGrowing up, my relationship with my Dad was a complicated one. As we have both matured, our relationship, respect and love for each other also matured," Brown said in a statement. "He was a good man with a big heart. Gail, Ayla and Arianna and I are thankful for his wife Peggy, her family and their unwavering love for him during his final days. I will miss his guidance and sense of humor."

The senator said that his father, who's been divorced from his mother since he was about a year old, had spent much of the past year in hospitals or assisted living facilities battling the debilitating disease. As the National Institute of Health explains it, Parkinson's disease includes a grouping of motor system disorders, which are the "result of the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells."

The senator's father previously served as a city councilor in Newburyport for 18 years, and his political career is said to have inspired the younger Brown to pursue his own destiny in public service.

Brown recently lost his U.S. Senate seat to Democrat Elizabeth Warren in a grueling campaign that holds the distinction of being the most expensive Senate contest in the nation's history. But Brown has hinted at a return to politics and is considered a front-runner to win U.S. Sen. John Kerry's seat should the senior senator become the new Secretary of State, kicking-off a special election as expected.

Funeral arrangements are pending and will be announced by the family in the coming days.
