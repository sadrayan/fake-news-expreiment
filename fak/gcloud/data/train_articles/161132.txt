IN THE BEGINNING

Vanguard Media Limited, publishers of Vanguard Newspapers was established in 1984 by Mr. Sam Amuka (a renowned, veteran journalist and columnist of the Sad Sam Fame. Sam Amuka was editor of Sunday Times and the First Managing Director of the Punch Newspaper.) He is from Itsekiri land in the present Delta State of Nigeria.

The maiden copy of VANGUARD hit the news stands as a weekly on Sunday June 3rd, 1984 with the motto: Towards a better life for the People. It went daily on July 15, 1984. It aims to serve the people through unflinching commitment to free enterprise, the rule of law and good governance.

DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH

Between 1988 and 1995, it published among others, Mr. & Mrs. Magazine (a compilation of the popular comic cartoons on the front page of the paper), Lagos Mirror (an evening paper), Vanguard Yellow Pages (a directory), Lagos Law Directory and Sports Now (a weekly publication devoted entirely to sports).

As at today, the paper has on its stable, the Daily Vanguard, Saturday Vanguard and Sunday Vanguard. It has since added other titles taken care of specialised interests. These include: Financial Vanguard, Allure, Sweet Crude, Hitech, Sports Vanguard and Cyber life. These titles are so-product specific that no serious policy maker, businessman, Politician, student and/or interests groups would ignore.

Major among Vanguard’s features include: Sports, Advertising, Management and marketing, Maritime, Energy, Hi-tech and Computer, Aviation, Business and Banking, Tourism, Health, Labour, Human Angle and Women affairs, Politics, Education and Insurance.

Vanguard is one of the leading Newspapers in Nigeria today . It has developed a rich heritage as the most entertaining, refreshing, authoritative, detailed and reader friendly newspaper in the country.

Consequently, for every copy of VANGUARD purchased, at least ten people queue to read the same copy. VANGUARD is a family-oriented newspaper which also appeals to the upwardly Mobile Executive and Captains of Industry.

Very importantly, to meet the growing demands of the market, the paper circulates 20,000 copies (daily) in Lagos, the nation’s business heartbeat. Others include Abuja-12,000 copies, South-West 15,000, South-South 25,000, South-East 15,000, North Central 18,000, North-East 7,500 and North-west 7,500. These total 120,000 copies with a Print Run of 130,000 copies daily.

Categorically, it is a newspaper with a penetrating reach to all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria which is today complemented by the most sophisticated, global readership through the internet address https://www.vanguardngr.com

Vanguard is a reference point in sports journalism. We dare say that we serve the menu hot and fresh in this area and a high level of professionalism is used, thus, this is too obvious to warrant any serious argument.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SOCIETY

In pursuit of its aim and objective of a better life for the people of Nigeria, the paper organized a public lecture in 1995 with the topic: Crisis and Reconstruction of the Nigerian economy by Prof. Bade Onimode. By 1996, another lecture was held with the topic: Understanding the Nigerian Economy and Polity in the 20th Century. It was delivered by the renowned historian, Dr. Yusufu bala Usman. In order for a broader perspective to be achieved, another lecture was organized on â€œAfrica and Global Competitiveness in the next millennium (i.e. 21st century). This lecture was delivered by a Ghanaian Professor, Dr. Kwesi Botchwey, Director, Africa Programs and Research, Harvard Institute for International Development, Cambridge, USA.
