US-backed militants advance deep inside ISIS-controlled Syrian desert
Rate Article (4.33 / 3)

During the last three days of April, militants of “Maghaweir Al-Thawra” armed group, formerly known as “New Syrian Army”, took control of a string of sites in southeast Syria, namely Tarwazeh Al-Wa`er, Sereit Al-Wa`er, Jabal Ghrab, Humaima, Swab desert, Al-Kamm Swab, T3 Pumping Station, Me`izeileh and Tarwazeh Al-Attshaneh.

According to Syrian opposition’s media, the ultimate aim of these operations is to “completely liberate” the vast desert region in Homs and Deir Ezzor provinces and hence to “prepare for further operations”.

It is known that “Maghaweir Al-Thawrah” militants coordinate their operations with US-led international anti-ISIS coalition – in particular, with Jordan and the U.S.

Several sources claim that the aforementioned insurgent group has deployed multiple patrols in the area north of Al-Tanf border crossing at the Iraqi border. Furthermore, according to the same sources, militants conducted a successful operation capturing Humaima village from jihadists of the so-called “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria” (ISIS).

This village is situated in the southern part of Wadi Al-Sawab valley which, in turn, is considered a gateway to the town of Al Bukamal in Deir Ezzor province, longtime stronghold of the aforementioned terror group.

Some analysts believe these actions by US-backed militant group conform with a greater plan of the US-led coalition to seize complete control of the border between Syria and Iraq. A part of it in northeastern Syrian province of Hasakah is already controlled by Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) allied to the U.S. On the other hand, in southeastern part of Syria, US-backed “Maghaweir Al-Thawrah” group mentioned above controls important Al-Tanf border crossing to Iraq.
