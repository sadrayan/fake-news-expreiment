US Sports Betting Revenue By State In 2019
Single-game sports betting within the United States was only legal in Nevada until May 14, 2018. On that date, the SCOTUS struck down PASPA, effectively unlocking the legislative key for states that wished to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders. In the months prior to that date, a handful of states had proactively passed legislation designed to go into effect or further mature if and when the PASPA was eradicated.

Delaware was the first state outside of Nevada to launch single-game sports betting on June 5, taking advantage of its status as an original “grandfathered” state under PASPA. That allowed it to begin taking single-game wagers without any immediate further legislation. New Jersey soon followed, officially taking its first wager June 14.

A total of seven states had legal sports betting markets by the end of 2018. Below we take a look at the monthly sports betting handle and hold for each, along with the key facts to know in each market.

States with potential in 2019

A number of states made progress during their respective 2018 legislative sessions on sports betting laws, but not enough to actually enact them. The next opportunity for those jurisdictions will come in 2019. Others are still in active sessions, with an outside chance of passing legislation during the current calendar year. A look at which states seem to be on track to have legalized sports betting within the next 6-12 months.
