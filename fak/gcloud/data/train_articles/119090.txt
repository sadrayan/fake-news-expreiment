Report: Tiger Woods' Florida Restaurant to Open by May
Tiger Woods: golfer, course architect ... restaurateur?

That final label appears to be on the horizon, as Woods' first restaurant is set to open shortly near his home in Jupiter, Fla., according to a Golf.com report.

Construction continues on an 8,000-square-foot space that will be named "The Woods Jupiter: Sports and Dining Club," which is part of the new Harbourside Place retail development. Woods was reportedly seen recently on the property, accompanied by friend and NBA star Michael Jordan. According to the report, the restaurant was projected to open by the end of March, but now a "soft opening" is expected by late April or mid-May, followed by a full-fledged opening this summer.

"Construction on the restaurant is on-going, but no opening date has yet been set," said Glenn Greenspan, Woods' spokesman, in an e-mail to Golf.com.

Woods' first foray into off-course ventures came in the area of golf course design. His first completed course, El Cardonal in Mexico, officially opened to the public in December, and his first U.S. design, Bluejack National outside Houston, is expected to open this fall.

Woods last played competitively at the Farmers Insurance Open, and he announced on Feb. 11 that he would be taking a break from the PGA Tour until his game was "tournament-ready." He has until March 13 to commit to the Arnold Palmer Invitational, held March 19-22, an event that he has won seven times.

The report describes the restaurant's name as "cumbersome" and adds an interesting tidbit: Nike "has the rights to the name Tiger Woods" according to the building's owner, thereby preventing the 14-time major champ from using it as part of the restaurant's name.
