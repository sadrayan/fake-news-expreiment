The tweet which seems to be the origin of the post is not available anymore, but if the incident is true then it is a malicious effort by the RSS to spread hatred, and if not it is an equally shameful act by those spreading such rumours.

Fortunately there have not been any undesirable responses to the controversy as peace has prevailed.
