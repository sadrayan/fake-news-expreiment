The U.S District Attorney Has Announced That He Will Be Pursuing Charges Of Treason Against The Former President Barack Obama
President Donald Trump and his administration are set to make former President Barack Obama pay for his treasonous acts, stating that “no one is above the law”.

Just days before leaving the presidential office, Obama signed an order that Placed Dana Boente as second in line for the position of a U.S. Attorney General. However, as soon as President Trump stepped in the White House, he reversed that order and Dana Boente was pushed down the power line with no clarification why.

Nevertheless, now he claims that he will bring charges against anyone conspiring against the President. And as many people believe that Obama is working alongside Hillary with the so-called “Deep State” in an attempt to undermine Donald Trump’s presidency by causing riots across the country, Boente thinks this is an act of domestic terrorism.

Recently, the New York Post reported how the former president has made a promise to fight President Trump in everything he does and now it looks like he is prepared to command an army of troublemakers near the White House.

CDTZT REPORTS : WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA IMMEDIATELY UPON LEAVING OFFICE ESTABLISHING A PRIVATE WEBSITE AND PROCLAIMING ON IT THAT “I WON’T STOP; IN FACT, I WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU, AS A CITIZEN, FOR ALL MY DAYS THAT REMAIN.” IT’S OBVIOUS TO EVEN LAYMEN TO DEDUCE THAT “THE BERKELEY RIOTS MAY HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA HIMSELF.” THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR THE FBI TO IMPLICATE OBAMA FOR SEDITION AND TREASON BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, THERE IS FIERCE DEBATE OVER THE FALLOUT INCLUDING WORRYING ABOUT TRAITORS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IF ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST THE AGITATOR IN CHIEF.

Many people have expressed their concerns regarding this issue as apparently, Obama has now gathered an “army of agitators” more than 30,000 in number. These people are under his command as he comfortably maneuvers them from a bunker, located less than two blocks away from the White House.

According to Lou Dobbs, “Barack Obama, who many claim will be creating a shadow government to frustrate the policy goals of this administration, we’re looking at something that’s coming very close to, it seems to me, sedition.”
