Ryan equates Wisconsin protests to Egypt
6 years ago

Washington (CNN) - Republican Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan compared the protests in his state's capital to those in Egypt that led to the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

"He's (Gov. Scott Walker) getting riots, it's like Cairo's moved to Madison these days," Ryan said Thursday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."



Thousands protested in the capital city Tuesday and Wednesday over a bill that would strip Wisconsin public employees of most of their collective bargaining rights and have them pay dramatically more for benefits.

Walker said he is dealing with a budget crisis, which includes a $137 million shortfall, and Ryan supported the newly elected Republican governor, saying he's "not asking a lot."

"He's basically saying I want you public workers to pay half of what our private sector counter parts are, and he's getting riots," Ryan said. "People should be able to express their way, but we've got to get this deficit and debt under control in Madison if we want to have a good business climate and job creation in Wisconsin."

According to Walker's press secretary, Cullen Werwie, the controversial legislation is expected to reach the state Senate on Thursday and, possibly, the Assembly (lower chamber) on Friday.
