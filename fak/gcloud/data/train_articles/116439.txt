White House private party with Prince, Russell Wilson
Washington (CNN) "Don't party and tell," might be the new White House motto.

Administration officials are remaining tight-lipped on a private party featuring Prince and Stevie Wonder at the White House over the weekend. During Monday's daily briefing, reporters drilled Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, for details on the star-studded event. It was not included in the President's public schedule but was documented by guests on social media.

"The President and first lady did hold a private party at the White House over the weekend, but given the private nature of that event, I don't have a lot of details to discuss from here," Earnest said.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson let the public live vicariously through him -- posting a picture with his arms around his on-again-off-again singer girlfriend Ciara to Instagram. Wilson captioned the photo "Dancing at The @WhiteHouse to Prince and Stevie Wonder with my lady Ciara. Thanks Mr. President and First Lady!"

According to Page Six of the New York Post, 500 guests were in attendance at the private Saturday night concert, including CEOs and an assemblage of movie and TV stars; however, the White House said it does not anticipate releasing that sure-to-be-glamorous guest list at any point.
