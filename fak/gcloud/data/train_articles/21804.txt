Trend Information

Sample and Methodology detail



American voters trust House Speaker Nancy Pelosi more than President Donald Trump, 49 - 42 percent "on issues that are important to you," according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today. Independent voters trust Pelosi more than President Trump 49 - 36 percent.





There are gender, racial and partisan gaps, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe- ack) University National Poll finds:

Men are divided as 48 percent trust Trump more and 42 percent trust Pelosi. Women trust Pelosi more 54 - 37 percent;

White voters trust Trump more 52 - 42 percent. Black voters go to Pelosi 82 - 2 percent and Hispanic voters trust her more 62 - 27 percent;

Republicans trust Trump more 88 - 6 percent, as Democrats back Pelosi 91 - 5 percent.

Trump and Republicans in Congress are responsible for the partial government shutdown, 56 percent of voters say, as 34 percent say Democrats are responsible.





American voters trust Democrats in Congress more than President Trump "on the issue of border security" 50 - 41 percent. Independent voters trust Democrats more 50 - 37 percent.





Democrats in Congress have a negative 38 - 57 percent job approval rating, their best grade since a negative 38 - 50 percent approval rating in a July 2, 2009 survey. Republicans in Congress get a negative 30 - 65 percent job approval rating, little changed from recent surveys.





"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - one; President Donald Trump - zero. The first round of many to come in the heavyweight bout goes the Speaker's way as Trump takes the hit for the shutdown and his party is suffering along with him," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





"Does 38 percent approval translate to reelection problems? Maybe."





Trump gets a negative 38 - 57 percent job approval rating, compared to a negative 41 - 55 percent score January 15.





Trump gets negative grades for handling key issues:

46 percent approve his handling of the economy and 51 percent disapprove;

37 - 58 percent for handling foreign policy;

38 - 59 percent for handling immigration.

The Wall





American voters oppose 55 - 41 percent building a wall along the border with Mexico, compared to 55 - 43 percent opposition January 14.





A wall would not significantly reduce violent crime in the U.S., voters say 64 - 33 percent, and would not significantly decrease the amount of illegal drugs in the U.S., voters say 60 - 37 percent.





Voters support 61 - 33 percent a bill that funds new border security measures, but does not fund a wall along the Mexican border. Republicans oppose this "no wall" idea 62 - 32 percent, but all other party, gender, age and racial groups support it.





Voters disapprove 66 - 31 percent of the president using emergency powers to fund a wall along the border.





American voters also oppose 68 - 26 percent shutting down the government to get funding for a wall.





Shutting down the government for leverage in policy disagreements is "inappropriate," voters say 79 - 16 percent.





"Voters buy in on better border security. But that wall...Bad idea," Malloy said.





"'Don't build it,' voters say, 'and it wouldn't work anyway.'"





Transgender People in the Military





American voters say 70 - 22 percent that transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military. The only listed group opposed to this is Republicans, opposed 50 - 40 percent.





From January 25 - 28, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,004 voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points, including the design effect.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts gold standard surveys using random digit dialing with live interviewers calling landlines and cell phones.
