The one senatorial trip to the valley by Cruz is common knowledge here. I heard it from various community outreach groups over the last four days, and from business types at a congressional q and a session yesterday in Mission. Further, Steve Taylor who lives here and writes and reports daily on valley undertakings, said he is "certain" Cruz only made the one trip to Mission as a senator. Cruz spoke with business leaders at the Cimarron Country Club there and then went to Anzalduas Park on the River for a photo op.

I can't speak with authority about the "listening tour." I was told that Cruz has very quietly opened an office down here, and a reputable lobbyist who lives here told me that, but I don't know it to be fact. You can find the Iowa stuff in the Des Moines Register and the Dallas Morning News, both of which have tracked his Iowa and New Hampshire trips.

It looks to us like your tweet lacked the clarification that you meant during Cruz’s Senate term.

It's Twitter, Gardner. 140 characters. He's the US senator and he's been here twice. Once for a Tea Party rally and once to talk to rich business people. One time in 8 months as their senator and he never met with anyone who did not have money and there are about 100 public interest groups down here worried about colonias and health care and food and education and he didn't talk to one of them. I really don't care what my tweet looks like to you, which I am sure you understand.
