Who We Are
We are dedicated to doing something very dramatic - we want to replace cigarettes with smoke-free products as fast as possible.

That's why we have more than 400 scientists, engineers, and technicians developing less harmful alternatives to cigarettes at our two research facilities in Switzerland and Singapore.

It's the biggest shift in our history. And it's the right one for our consumers, our company, our shareholders, and society.
