With the adoption of the Paris Agreement, governments have agreed to hold warming well below 2°C, and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. They have put forward their proposed contributions to a “fair sharing” of effort to move global emissions downward in the period 2020-2025-2030 in their (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions.

The Climate Action Tracker rates (I)NDCs, 2020 pledges, long-term targets and current policies against whether they are consistent with a country’s fair share effort to the Paris Agreement 1.5°C temperature goal.

The CAT “Effort Sharing” assessment methodology applies state-of-the art scientific literature on how to compare the fairness of government efforts and (I)NDC proposals against the level and timing of emission reductions consistent with the Paris Agreement. The focus of the assessment is on the period 2020, 2025 and 2030.
