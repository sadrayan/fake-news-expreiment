Fact check: Is Ted Cruz correct that Beto O'Rourke supported a $10 per barrel tax on oil?
Updated at 12:05 p.m. on Tuesday: Revised to include Sen. Ted Cruz raising the issue in a billboard advertisement.

WASHINGTON â€” Sen. Ted Cruz and his GOP allies are looking to hold his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, over a barrel with an arcane bit of energy policy.

The Republicans have taken to bashing O'Rourke for supporting a $10 per barrel tax on oil. Cruz cites that charge on the campaign trail, on TV and through billboard advertisements, while an outside super PAC group making the issue the centerpiece of an expensive advertising blitz.

"For anyone in the oil and gas industry, you would have to be out of your mind to vote for Beto O'Rourke," Cruz said at a recent campaign event, seeking to drive a wedge between his opponent and one of Texas' most important industries.

O'Rourke rejects the broader attack that he's an enemy of the energy sector.

"I strongly support the oil and gas industry and the workers of Texas who have helped to make us far more energy independent and secure, who are creating significant job opportunities and economic growth for our state," he said recently.

But what about that $10 per barrel tax on oil?
