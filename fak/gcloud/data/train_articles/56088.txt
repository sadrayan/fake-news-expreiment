Miss Universe Malta did NOT try to smuggle drugs into UK
The fake news item.

A report circulating the social media purporting that Malta's Miss Universe contestant has been caught trying to smuggle cocaine into the UK is nothing more than an item of fake news.

The story purporting to be the news agency Metro of the UK, claimed that Martha Fenech was arrested at London's Heathrow airport for trying to smuggle two kilos of cocaine hidden in two bags of coffee inside two suitcases.

Citing "officials", the item claimed Customs and Border Protection police officers searched her suitcases upon suspicion and found a plastic coffee bag containing white powder.

It went on to say that Ms Fenech was then taken to a private search room where the officers found a second bag full of powder.

When contacted, Ms Fenech expressed shock at the fictitious item but said she was not surprised, since some other Miss Universe girls had also targetted.

"Such a report can be very harmful. People who know me immediately laughed it off, but several other contacted me to know if I'm OK. Other 'girls' apparently were only happy to share the fake news item," she told Times of Malta this morning.

"This is a very serious accusation. It taints my name, it taints Malta's name," said Ms Fenech, adding that she intended to report the claim to the cyber police.

She also posted a comment on Facebook saying: "I do hope that you all realise that the current news being shared about me is completely FAKE!!

Regards from Malta...not the UK."
