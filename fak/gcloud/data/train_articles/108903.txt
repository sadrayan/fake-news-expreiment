About Us
Recycling Drives Sustainability

As the world’s largest recycler of aluminum and producer of flat-rolled aluminum product, we leverage aluminum’s unique properties to deliver sustainable solutions to our customers by maintaining a high level of recycled-metal inputs across our product portfolio – a competitive differentiator and a key component of our sustainability strategy.

Our manufacturing model not only reduces the energy, water, landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations, it also lowers the carbon footprint of products made using our aluminum.

We recycle more than 65 billion beverage cans each year, turning them back into new beverage cans in just roughly 60 days. We also created the first–and largest–automotive closed-loop recycling system in the world. The closed-loop system recycles scrap aluminum from the automotive manufacturing process. Closed-loop recycling allows us to take back as much of our customers’ aluminum scrap as possible, turning it directly back into the same product again. Closing the loop preserves the value of the alloy, reduces recycling and transportation costs, minimizes environmental impact and establishes a secure supply chain.

This process requires just five percent of the energy and emits only five percent of the greenhouse gases compared to using primary aluminum, helping Novelis and its customers drive toward zero waste to landfills and greater carbon reduction.
