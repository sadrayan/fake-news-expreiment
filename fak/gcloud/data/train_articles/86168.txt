Cigarettes Can Saturate Car's Interior with Toxins, Endangering Health of Children

The News Wheel - April 27, 2017



The dangers of smoking have been well-documented, and even the dangers of secondhand smoke have been widely explained and accepted. But, have you heard about third-hand smoke exposure and the serious complications and illnesses it can cause? According to Naveed Saleh, M.D., M.S., and writer for PsychologyToday.com, research suggests that smoking in the closed environment of a car seriously pollutes the interior with nicotine and other smoke pollutants. Such nicotine pollution constitutes third-hand exposure. Saleh noted that because the average American spends more than an hour a day driving in a car, exposure to pollutants covering car surfaces add up. Moreover, total smoke pollution can linger in a cars interior for days, weeks, or months. ...

Virginia Senate passes bill to penalize smoking while children are in car

Bristol Herald Courier (press release) (blog) - March 3, 2016



So it might have been a little unusual to see Chafin, now a conservative Republican state senator from Russell, stand up on the Senate floor Thursday to support of legislation that, in effect, restricts smoking. To Chafin, however, House Bill 1348 protects something more important than the right to consume some of a dwindling Virginia cash crop in a private setting. Our children deserve to be protected, he told colleagues in asking support for the legislation, which would prohibit smoking in vehicles when children under 8 years old are present. Violating the law would bring a $100 civil fine. We have all kinds of laws that protect our youth, he said. Automobiles are dangerous...and they are dangerous because they are also a confined space. Chafin pointed to studies that say concentration of exposure to secondhand smoke is 27 times greater in a confined space like a car. The science is there, he added, saying the legislation, sponsored by Del. Todd E. Pillion, R-Washington, is a bill that has come of time.

They plan to ask the Kingman City Council for a new ordinance that would make it a finable offense to smoke in a vehicle with minors in it. The prohibition would include traditional tobacco products and e-cigarettes, and it would be a secondary offense - that is, one could only be cited for it if pulled over for another reason first.

Lawmakers look to limit smoking in cars

Daytona Beach News-Journal - February 4, 2014



Bean and some of his colleagues in the Legislature want to make it illegal to smoke in a car when minors are present. It would be considered a secondary offense, meaning police could not cite someone unless they were also committing a primary traffic violation, such as speeding or running a red light. Violators would be required to pay a fine up to $30. Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, Oregon and Utah have similar laws on the books, and 14 states, including Florida, are considering bills that would restrict smoking in cars, according to the Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights. "The main objective of smoke-free car laws isn't to ticket every person who smokes in a car, but instead to raise awareness and educate the public about the hazards of secondhand smoke," said Liz Williams, a project manager for Berkeley, Calif.,-based Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights. "Florida is in good company by examining this issue and debating whether it is a good tool to protect public health in the state," she said. "The goal is to educate - not punish."...

Arkansas, Louisiana, California, Maine and Puerto Rico all have such laws. The age of the minor varies from state to state. Anti-smoking advocates would like to see Virginia join that list. Virginia is far behind what other states have, said Bronson Frick, an assistant director of Americans for Nonsmokers Rights, a national advocacy group.

Most states that have outlawed smoking in the car with a child present, Frick said, usually take an educational approach, too: They have a campaign to inform the public about the health risks of second-hand smoke.

Residual tobacco smoke in used cars: futile efforts and persistent pollutants

Nicotine and Tobacco Research, 2010-08-30

Methods: Surface wipe, air, and dust samples were collected in used cars sold by nonsmokers (n = 40) and smokers (n = 87) and analyzed for nicotine. . . .

Discussion: Findings suggest that smokers can prevent their cars from becoming contaminated with residual TSP by reducing or ceasing smoking; however, commonly used cleaning and ventilation methods did not successfully decrease contamination levels. Disclosure requirements and smoke-free certifications could help protect buyers of used cars and empower them to request nonsmoking environments or a discount on cars that have been smoked in previously.

City council mulling smoking-in-vehicle ban

Record Herald - Lance Cranmer - June 24, 2010

What began as an idea proposed by a Washington High School government class could become a reality in the very near future.

Washington C.H. City Council discussed the possibility of a city-wide ban on smoking in cars where small children are present during Wednesday's meeting.

"It's a worthwhile thing," said council chairman Dale Lynch. "And the fact that this is something students came up with - it shows that people can initiate things."

The proposal was first brought up by a group of Washington students from Jon Creamer's AP Government class when they spoke before council on May 12.

The students presented information on similar laws already in place in Arkansas, California, Louisiana and Maine. Currently there are no similar laws - in either state or individual city governments - in the state of Ohio.

Washington C.H. City Council recently took on a controversial topic in a different way last month when it approved a resolution to support a statewide texting while driving ban. In that case, though, state leaders were already crafting a bill - which later passed - to ban texting while driving. ...

Smoking would be banned in all cars, parks and play areas under new proposals

Smoking in all private cars and outdoor spaces where children gather should be banned, the Royal College of Physicians has proposed.

Passive smoking doubles the risk of cot death in babies and toddlers, the Royal College of Physicians said.

Parks, play areas, outdoor swimming pools and all vehicles should be covered by an extension of the existing smoking ban, England's oldest medical institution said.

The proposals, which have won the backing of Sir Liam Donaldson, the Government's Chief Medical Officer, are outlined in a report showing the impact of passive smoking on children's health.

Doctors reported 20,500 cases of lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis in children caused directly by passive smoking, the report said. . . .

The report was timed to influence the Government's July review of existing smoking legislation, which came into force in 2007.

The proposals, which were welcomed by the Department of Health, include a call for smoking to be outlawed in all vehicles, rather than just those which contain children, to make the ban easier to enforce. ...

Smoking In The Car Could Cost You

Central Florida News 13 ( Orlando, FL), 2010-03-17

Reported by Troy Kinsey



The federal government finds developing kids exposed to second-hand smoke are at high risk of having weaker lungs or life-threatening illnesses.

That's why lawmakers could move to slap a $100 fine on drivers caught puffing with a kid under 16 years old in the car.

Smoking is already banned in schools and on playgrounds. Logic follows the family car ought to be off limits too.

But tell that to critics, who complain the bill is tantamount to throwing a wet blanket over the flickering flame of freedom.

This is going to be a very controversial, hot issue, said Sen. Victor Crist.

The Tampa Republican is backing the bill in the Senate.

By his own admission, the opposition will be tough. But he argues the facts are tougher....

Brandon Loomis The Salt Lake Tribune



Utah lawmakers on Tuesday passed a proposed ban on smoking in a vehicle in which children are riding.

HB82, sponsored by Rep. Jay Seegmiller, D-Sandy, would bar smoking in the vehicle when a child younger than 8 and requiring a restraining device is present. The proposed penalty is a $45 ticket.

"This is a tremendously important bill to protect the rights of children who can't speak for themselves," he said. . . .

The bill passed 40-31 and now goes to the Senate. ...

Hundreds fined for smoking in cars since new laws

News Interactive Network/News Limited/News.com (au), 2009-11-08

ELISSA DOHERTY, HEALTH REPORTER

MORE than 400 people have been cautioned or fined for smoking in cars with children in South Australia since the controversial law was introduced.

The state led the nation by introducing a law prohibiting smoking in vehicles in the presence of people under 16 in May 2007, in a bid to protect children from passive smoking.

Since then, police have fined 317 people and cautioned 85.

Offenders can be issued with an on-the-spot fine of $75 and if it proceeds to court, the maximum penalty is $200.

A woman was recently convicted for the offence in NSW just three months after that state brought in the new laws.

Queensland motorists who smoke while children are in their cars will be fined from next year.

From January 1, Queensland police will enforce a $200 on-the-spot fine to drivers who smoke with children under 16 in their cars.

Premier Anna Bligh said the laws would protect children from the dangers of passive smoke.

"It is important we protect children who have no choice but to travel in cars with adults and their parents and family members ... where those people don't make the right choices about smoking around them," Ms Bligh told reporters.

She made no apologies for the crackdown. ...

Ban on smoking in vehicles with children

$100 fine proposed for drivers who smoke with kids in car

Boston Herald - October 1, 2009

Drivers smoking with children in the car would face $100 fines for each child under legislation that got a push in committee Thursday. Rep. Denis Guyers bill (H 3233) imposes fines of at least $100 for each child.

Drivers could duck the fine by performing five hours of community service or taking tobacco education or cessation courses.

Children, who breathe more quickly than adults, are particularly at risk of suffering second-hand smoke side effects, said Dr. Mona Sharifi, a pediatrician at Childrens Hospital. A child sitting in a car for roughly 10 minutes breathes in the equivalent of what a firefighter breathes during hours battling wildfires, she said. Its the one environmental exposure that stands out above the rest, Sharifi said. ...

Smoking in vehicles brings higher nicotine exposure

The researchers said their findings pointed to a need for a campaign to discourage smoking in cars.

Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch, 2009-09-17

Sharing a ride with a smoker will give you a much heftier dose of nicotine than having a meal in a restaurant that allows smoking or hanging out at a smoky bar, according to new research.

Even opening the window or switching on the air-conditioner when a smoker lights up leaves significant amounts of nicotine in the air, according to the study by four researchers at Johns Hopkins University.

In fact smokers who put their windows down all the way averaged more nicotine in the air, perhaps because they tended to be heavier smokers or perhaps because the air whipping around inside their cars distributed smoke and nicotine more widely, said Dr. Ana Navas-Acien, one of the researchers and an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins' School of Public Health.

"In any case it is clear that ventilation is insufficient to eliminate tobacco smoke," she said.

Nicotine, which is toxic, is the addictive substance in tobacco.

The Hopkins team believes its research, using air samplers placed in 22 drivers' cars last summer, is the first to measure nicotine concentrations in actual driving conditions rather than in laboratory simulations. Their results were published in the medical journal Tobacco Control. . . .

A handful of states, including Arkansas, California and Louisiana, ban smoking in cars when children are passengers. So does Puerto Rico. Beginning next month, Avis Budget Group Inc. will ban smoking in all of its rental cars, citing customers' complaints about tobacco odors and residues.

The Hopkins researchers said their findings were generally in line with recent studies suggesting that smoking two cigarettes a day inside a car leaves the air with about 20 percent more particulate matter than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ceiling for what it considers unpolluted air.

They said the drivers they studied all agreed that smoking posed a health risk to passengers, and that 15 percent would only smoke when they had no passengers in their cars. ...

Passive smoking in cars linked to hayfever and wheezing in children

Eur Resp J 2009; 34: 629633

MedWire News (uk), 2009-09-15

Mark Cowen



Children who are regularly exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke when traveling by car have significantly higher rates of hayfever and wheezing than those without such exposure, results of an Irish study show.

Writing in the European Respiratory Journal, Luke Clancy, from the Tobacco Free Research Institute in Dublin, and team explain: Children may be more vulnerable to second-hand smoke-induced respiratory diseases due to smaller airways and greater oxygen demand, as well as a less-mature immune system.

But they add that there is no evidence quantifying second-hand smoke-induced respiratory health effects in children exposed to second-hand smoke in cars.

To address this, the team studied 2809 children, aged 1314 years, selected randomly from schools throughout Ireland. ...

Finland To Restrict Smoking In Private Cars

Bernama - September 15, 2009

HELSINKI, Sept 15 (Bernama) -- Finland will soon ban smoking in private vehicles if a child under 18 years old is a passenger in that car, local media reported on Tuesday.

A proposal on the issue will be handed to Finland's Parliament within two weeks. The legislation, which is expected to pass, would make Finland the only European country to regulate smoking in private cars, according to Xinhua news agency's report, citing the local media.

However, no punishments are planned for smokers who break the rule for the time being. That means smokers can be urged, but not forced, to stop smoking if a child is in the car. ...

Smokers' Cars Loaded With Nicotine

Levels twice those found in places that permit smoking, study suggests

HealthDay [HealthScout], 2009-08-24

Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter



Passengers riding in the cars of smokers are exposed to nicotine levels nearly twice those found in restaurants and bars that permit smoking, a new study suggests.

The dangers of exposure to secondhand smoke are well known, including the risk for heart and respiratory disease, and have led to laws banning smoking in many public places. Many anti-smoking advocates believe the next frontier in the fight against secondhand smoke is in cars.

"These levels of exposure are unacceptable for nonsmoking passengers, particularly children, who are at increased risk for secondhand smoke-related health problems," said study co-author Patrick Breysse, director of the Division of Environmental Health Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Breysse and his co-author Dr. Ana Navas-Acien, an assistant professor of occupational and environmental health at Hopkins, believe that smoking should be banned in cars as it has been in other places.



Secondhand tobacco smoke concentrations in motor vehicles

Tobacco Control [Epub ahead of print], August 25, 2009





Context: Motor vehicles represent important microenvironments for exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS). While some countries and cities have banned smoking in cars with children present, more data are needed to develop the evidence-base on SHS exposure levels in motor vehicles to inform policy and education practices aimed at supporting smoke-free motor vehicles when passengers are present.

Objective: To assess exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke in motor vehicles using passive airborne nicotine samplers.



Methods: Seventeen smokers and five non-smokers who commute to and from work in their own vehicle participated. Two passive airborne nicotine samplers were placed in each vehicle for a 24-hour period, one at the front passenger seat headrest and the other in the backseat behind the driver. At the end of the sampling period, airborne nicotine was analyzed by gas chromatography.



Results: Median (IQR) air nicotine concentrations in smokers' vehicles were 9.6 µg/m3 (5.3-25.5) compared to non-detectable concentrations in non-smokers' vehicles. After adjustment for vehicle size, window opening, air conditioning, and sampling time, there was a 1.96-fold increase (95% CI 1.43, 2.67) in air nicotine concentrations per cigarette smoked.



Conclusions: Air nicotine concentrations in motor vehicles were much higher than air nicotine concentrations generally measured in public or private indoor places, and even higher than concentrations measured in restaurants and bars. These high levels of exposure to SHS support the need for education measures and legislation that regulate smoking in motor vehicles when passengers, especially children, are present.



MK considers bill to bar smoking in vehicles with kids

Jerusalem Post, 2009-08-25

JUDY SIEGEL-ITZKOVICH



After Johns Hopkins University researchers have proven that the amount of harmful nicotine in air-conditioned cars with smokers is much higher than in pubs and restaurants that allow smoking, an MK is considering initiating a bill to bar smoking in vehicles with children as passengers.

Israel Beiteinu MK Robert Ilatov, whose colleague MK Yuri Shtern proposed such legislation three weeks before his death from brain cancer in 2007, told The Jerusalem Post on Monday after learning of the Baltimore study that such a bill would be a fitting memorial to Shtern. He asked to read the study, which was published on Tuesday in the journal Tobacco Control.

Health Ministry associate director-general Dr. Boaz Lev said he personally was very much opposed to smoking in cars containing minors, but that he had not discussed the proposal with Deputy Health Minister Ya'acov Litzman (United Torah Judaism), who decides policy. ...
