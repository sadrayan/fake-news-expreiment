What is it?

Carnauba wax is used in the pharmaceutical industry for tablet coatings and binding. Carnauba wax comes from the leaves of the Copernicia prunifera palm grown only in Brazil. Carnauba wax is also known as palm wax or Brazil wax.

Carnauba wax primarily consists of fatty acid esters. Coating tablets with the wax enables easier swallowing of the tablet. Carnauba wax has many other uses, including uses from car wax to dental floss. Carnauba wax is a safe, non-toxic and inert ingredient.[1][2]
