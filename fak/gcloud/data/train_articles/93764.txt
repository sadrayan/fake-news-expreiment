Dropout Study: A Report to the 77th Texas Legislature (December 2000), PDF (340 KB)

Dropout rates published by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), a key component of the state's Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS), have been criticized in recent years for not presenting an accurate picture of the dropout phenomenon in Texas public schools. TEA Rider 71 of the General Appropriations Act (House Bill 1, 76th Texas Legislature, Regular Session) directed the Legislative Budget Board, State Auditor's Office, and TEA to conduct a study of the current system used to identify and report students who do not graduate from high school or those who drop out of school before enrolling in high school. Also, the study must determine the actual number and percentage of students who do not complete high school within four years of enrolling in 9th grade. This report presents the findings and recommendations from that study. The recommendations address three areas in which the current annual dropout rate has been criticized: dropout definition; dropout rate calculation; and data quality.

Working Paper No. 7. Profiles of Starting Cohort Members and Transfer Students in a Texas Public High School Cohort (January 2002), PDF (240 KB)

The quantitative measure for each indicator in the Texas accountability system is a product of extensive development by Texas Education Agency staff, guided by educators, legislators, and business leaders, and grounded in the accountability system principles. One principle is accountability for all students, but because the indicators differ, the counts and groups of students included in the measures differ somewhat. For example, the indicators related to passing the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) include all students enrolled on the last Friday in October, whereas the annual dropout rates are based on all students in attendance during the year. In the course of developing the longitudinal student status rates as measures of the high school completion rate indicator, agency staff analyzed the counts and characteristics of students included in the measures. In this paper, comparisons of starting cohort members and transfer students are reported.

Working Paper No. 6. Three-Year Follow-up of a Texas Public High School Cohort (January 2002), PDF (290 KB)

Since 2000, the Texas Education Agency has reported three groups of students-graduates, General Educational Development (GED) certificate recipients, and continuing students-in the longitudinal completion/student status rate for the district and state Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS) reports. Beginning in 2004, a longitudinal completion rate will be an indicator used to rate Texas public school and district performance. This report is intended to provide information about students who are still continuing high school after their expected graduation year and to inform the decision whether to include this student group in the definition of "high school completion" for Texas public school accountability purposes.

Working Paper No. 2. 1997-98 and 1998-99 Returning and Non-Returning Students in Grades 7-12 (June 2000)

Prior to the 1997-98 school year, districts were required to report which students in Grades 7-12 had graduated, dropped out, or returned to school. Beginning with the Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS) Submission 1 in fall 1998, districts were required to report on all students enrolled in the district at any time during the previous school year in Grades 7-12. This report details the returning statuses of students for school years 1997-98 to 1998-99.
