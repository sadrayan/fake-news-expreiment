Boxer Muhammad Ali, ‘The Greatest of All Time’, Dead at 74
Muhammad Ali died Friday, 3 June 2016, at a Phoenix-area hospital, where he had spent the past few days being treated for respiratory complications, a family spokesman confirmed. He was 74.

One of the greatest fighters in the history of boxing, Ali retired in 1981 after losing to Trevor Berbick in his 61st career bout.

Soon thereafter, Ali — who doctors said had begun showing signs of sluggishness and neurological damage in the 1970s — began receiving treatment for Parkinson’s disease.

Ali, who called himself “The Greatest,” was married four times and had nine children, including daughter Laila, who also became a professional boxer. Ali and his fourth wife, Yolanda “Lonnie” Williams, had been married since 1986.
