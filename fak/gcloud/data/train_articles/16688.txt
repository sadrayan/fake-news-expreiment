R.J.:

I trust you got my other emails. I write now on a different front regarding what happens to recapture payments by property-rich school districts.

We’re fact-checking the claim in this tweet: “The state is set to recapture an additional $500 million in Robin Hood payments from taxpayers and not one penny of it will go to public education in Texas. Instead, the state government is confiscating our property tax dollars to pay its own bills.”

What law or other guidance does the state have in place that would speak to what happens to recapture monies?

Any other LBB research on the flow of such payments?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks,

g.

Recapture revenue is part of the school finance formula and is only used in the Foundation School Program. It's set in law in Section 41.094 (b) of the Education Code http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.41.htm#41.094

All recapture revenue is shown as Appropriated Receipts in the TEA budget's method of financing http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Documents/GAA/General_Appropriations_Act_2018-2019.pdf#page=253
