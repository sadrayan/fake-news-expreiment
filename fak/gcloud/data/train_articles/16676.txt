Subject: Urgent inquiry, Texas newspaper, seeking information about border apprehensions

Vice President Pence said in Dallas on Saturday that he’d learned the day before “at the Hidalgo border center that along the southern border of the United States, we actually still apprehend 1,100 individuals a day, who are attempting to enter this country illegally, including seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists.”

For a fact-check, could you share or point me to the data bearing out the two figures – 1,100 and seven a day?

Any other recommended research resources?

I hope to complete our look at this today. I can be reached by phone or email.

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Selby, please review the link below for information for apprehensions and inadmissibles. I suggests that you focus on data related to the Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV)

Thanks. Is there a more detailed breakout of “inadmissible” individuals?

Does the term mean terrorist or suspected terrorist?

Individuals can be deemed inadmissible due to the fact that he/she did not have the proper documents, criminal background or other reasons.

That’s the information we have available. Perhaps you can reach to the White House for additional questions.
