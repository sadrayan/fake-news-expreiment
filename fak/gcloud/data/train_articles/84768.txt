This Is How Much Donald Trump’s Immigration Plan Would Cost America if Mexico Doesn’t Pick Up the Tab.
It’s not cheap to halt il­leg­al im­mig­ra­tion in Amer­ica. And even a busi­ness mogul like Don­ald Trump may have missed the bot­tom line.

Since Don­ald Trump de­clared his in­ten­tion to run for pres­id­ent, the 2016 con­tender has struck a nerve with the coun­try’s con­ser­vat­ives. And his mes­sage on im­mig­ra­tion has been para­mount to his al­lure.

Over the week­end, Trump took his rhet­or­ic to pa­per and out­lined his com­pre­hens­ive im­mig­ra­tion plan, which in­cluded erect­ing a bor­der wall, strength­en­ing in­tern­al en­force­ments like E-Veri­fy, trip­ling the num­ber of Im­mig­ra­tion and Cus­toms En­force­ment of­ficers, and re­quir­ing all im­mig­rants caught at the bor­der to be de­tained un­til they are re­moved from the coun­try, not re­leased and mon­itored.

And while Trump says his plan would boost the Amer­ic­an eco­nomy, es­tim­ates for sim­il­ar policies in­dic­ate it would come with a hefty price tag.

In his plan, Trump de­mands Mex­ico pay for his state-of-the-art bor­der wall, but Mex­ic­an Pres­id­ent En­rique Pena Ni­eto’s spokes­man told Bloomberg that the Mex­ic­an gov­ern­ment has no in­ten­tion of foot­ing the bill. That leaves the cost of build­ing up the bor­der to the U.S., and an im­pen­et­rable wall comes at a mult­i­bil­lion-dol­lar price.

The U.S. already has in place more than 650 miles of bor­der fen­cing. That pro­ject was es­tim­ated to have cost $2.4 bil­lion in 2009 and will con­tin­ue to cost bil­lions to main­tain. But Trump’s plan calls for a bet­ter bor­der fence. As­sum­ing the ex­ist­ing fence is scrapped and re­placed with one as se­cure as Is­rael’s se­cur­ity bar­ri­cade meant to de­ter ter­ror­ists, the cost of build­ing a fence along all 1,989 miles of the south­ern bor­der would come to more than $6 bil­lion. Na­tion­al Journ­al once es­tim­ated it would cost $6.4 bil­lion when all is said and done.

But the price tag of the bor­der wall is pit­tance com­pared to the mass de­port­a­tion Trump would like to see if he were pres­id­ent. While it was not lis­ted ex­pli­citly in his on­line im­mig­ra­tion plan, Trump told Meet the Press‘s Chuck Todd this past Sunday that im­mig­rants in the coun­try il­leg­ally would be sent back to their home coun­tries.

“We’re go­ing to keep the fam­il­ies to­geth­er, but they have to go,” Trump said. “We either have a coun­try or we don’t have a coun­try.”

The ex­plos­ive costs of mass de­port­a­tion have of­ten forced Re­pub­lic­an pres­id­en­tial and con­gres­sion­al can­did­ates to find an­oth­er solu­tion. Trump’s po­s­i­tion is far out­side the main­stream of many oth­er Re­pub­lic­ans. There are sev­er­al es­tim­ates out there on what it would cost to round up the roughly 11 mil­lion people who are resid­ing in the U.S. without per­mis­sion. The Cen­ter for Amer­ic­an Pro­gress, a lib­er­al think tank, es­tim­ated in 2010 (when the il­leg­al pop­u­la­tion was smal­ler) that it would take $200 bil­lion to “ar­rest, de­tain, leg­ally pro­cess and trans­port the un­doc­u­mented pop­u­la­tion over a five year peri­od.” That did not in­clude the $85 bil­lion it tal­lied for keep­ing up with en­force­ment in the sub­sequent five years.

In 2011, the Hou­s­ton Chron­icle re­por­ted that ICE Deputy Dir­ect­or Ku­mar Kibble told mem­bers of Con­gress that it cost $5 bil­lion to round up and de­port 393,000 im­mig­rants. That comes to a cost of ap­prox­im­ately $12,722 per im­mig­rant. If you had to de­port 11 mil­lion people at that cost, the feds would be dol­ing out about $140 bil­lion.

Trump ar­gues his plan would grow the eco­nomy and “end wel­fare ab­use.” Without mil­lions of im­mig­rants in the U.S., Amer­ic­an work­ers, he says, would have bet­ter ac­cess to jobs.

“We need to con­trol the ad­mis­sion of new low-earn­ing work­ers in or­der to: help wages grow, get teen­agers back to work, aid minor­it­ies’ rise in­to the middle class, help schools and com­munit­ies fall­ing be­hind, and to en­sure our im­mig­rant mem­bers of the na­tion­al fam­ily be­come part of the Amer­ic­an dream,” Trump said in his plan.

But step­ping up en­force­ment on the bor­der and in­tern­ally will add up.

Trump wants to re­quire that im­mig­rants be de­tained un­til they are de­por­ted. It is es­tim­ated that de­tain­ing one im­mig­rant costs $120 a day. Right now, some im­mig­rants are al­lowed to live out­side fa­cil­it­ies for months un­til they are de­por­ted. Re­quir­ing every single im­mig­rant to be de­tained would in­crease the cost of ap­pre­hen­sions and po­ten­tially re­quire build­ing more fa­cil­it­ies to hold im­mig­rants.

An­oth­er spendy piece of Trump’s pro­pos­al is im­ple­ment­ing in­tern­al en­force­ment meas­ures like E-Veri­fy, which helps em­ploy­ers val­id­ate a work­er’s im­mig­ra­tion status. Ac­cord­ing to a 2013 re­port by Alex Nowras­teh, an im­mig­ra­tion policy ana­lyst at the Cato In­sti­tute, E-Veri­fy would cost $2.3 bil­lion in the first 10 years.

When the Sen­ate’s so-called gang of eight re­leased its im­mig­ra­tion-re­form bill in 2013, the Con­gres­sion­al Budget Of­fice es­tim­ated the plan would cost $22 bil­lion to im­ple­ment. But, the plan — which en­forced the bor­der but also put some of the 11 mil­lion on a path to cit­izen­ship — re­duced the de­fi­cit by $197 bil­lion in the first 10 years.

It’s un­clear how much Trump’s plan would re­duce the de­fi­cit.

The biggest price tag of his plan, however, might not ac­tu­ally be pos­sible to cal­cu­late. Im­mig­ra­tion ex­perts say that even im­mig­rants liv­ing in the coun­try il­leg­ally still con­trib­ute to the eco­nomy. A New York Times story from 2013 sug­ges­ted that im­mig­rants in the coun­try il­leg­ally con­trib­uted $15 bil­lion an­nu­ally to So­cial Se­cur­ity. And the De­part­ment of Ag­ri­cul­ture has long ar­gued that de­port­ing mil­lions could have ma­jor ef­fects on the U.S.’s ag­ri­cul­tur­al eco­nomy, as it es­tim­ates that half of the coun­try’s farm work­ers over the last 15 years have been un­doc­u­mented.

“You can quanti­fy a lot of this. … The part that is harder to quanti­fy is the loss of these pro­duct­ive work­ers and en­er­get­ic and in­nov­at­ive en­tre­pren­eurs,” says Tamar Jac­oby, the pres­id­ent and CEO of Im­mig­ra­tion­Works USA, a pro-busi­ness im­mig­ra­tion group. “A pause in im­mig­ra­tion would put a huge dent in the Amer­ic­an eco­nomy that is vir­tu­ally im­possible to quanti­fy.”
