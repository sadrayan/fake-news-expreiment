OneVoice Israel Partners with V15 to Change Status Quo
TEL AVIV, Israel, Jan. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- OneVoice Israel has launched a partnership with V15, an independent grassroots movement, to empower everyday Israelis to chart a more secure and prosperous future for their country. As a non-partisan movement founded by young adults just as the 2015 Israeli elections were announced, V15 members have set aside party affiliation to disrupt the status quo.

"We believe that it's critical that the majority of Israelis who are concerned about the numerous security and socio-economic challenges we face have their voices heard in the next election," said OneVoice Israel's Executive Director Polly Bronstein. "We need a prime minister and a government who will be responsive to the people."

OneVoice Israel and V15's partnership is forged from a shared commitment to grassroots organizing to ensure that citizens have a voice in the democratic process. To that end, OneVoice Israel and V15 are working with premier grassroots consulting firm 270 Strategies to leverage the most cutting-edge mobilization techniques.

V15 only accepts support from Israeli patriots and staunch international friends of Israel with unassailable track records of supporting Israel's security and prosperity, such as Alon Kastiel, Ori Weiss, Daniel Lubetzky, and Danny Abraham.
