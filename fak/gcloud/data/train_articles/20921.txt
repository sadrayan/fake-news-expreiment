Northern Kentucky Health Department

NKY Health Parent Letters

NKY Health Statement: March 16, 2019

As has been reported in the news, a lawsuit has been filed against the Northern Kentucky Health Department and its employees, as well as other State health officials, arising from the actions taken in response to the outbreak of the highly contagious disease varicella (chickenpox) at Assumption Academy. Unfortunately, some individuals, including the attorney who filed the lawsuit, have taken to social media to spread misinformation as part of their litigation strategy. It is unfortunate when social media is used as a weapon for misinformation to advance litigation agendas and to undermine our mission to protect public health. In order to clear up any confusion caused by these self-interested and inaccurate social media posts, we are sharing with the public the actual letters which were sent by the Health Department to the parents and staff at Assumption Academy.

NKY Health Statement: March 15, 2019

We are aware of the lawsuit filed by Jerome Kunkel, and want to state that the actions taken by the Health Department with respect to Assumption Academy were done consistent with this agencyâ€™s statutory charge to protect the public health.

Chickenpox, also known as varicella, can be a very serious illness that is especially dangerous for infants and pregnant women or anyone who has a weakened immune system. The recent actions taken by the Northern Kentucky Health Department regarding the chickenpox outbreak at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart/Assumption Academy was in direct response to a public health threat and was an appropriate and necessary response to prevent further spread of this contagious illness.
