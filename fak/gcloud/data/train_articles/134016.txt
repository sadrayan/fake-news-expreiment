Blunt Force Injury Deaths
Fractures refer to the breaking of a bone (or cartilage) and usually result from significant blunt force. Fractures are classified in a variety of ways. If a fracture near the skin surface is covered by intact skin it is classified as “closed”, compared to the case when there is a laceration of the overlying skin with communication between the fracture and skin surface, which is classified as an “open” or “compound” fracture. These fractures are more susceptible to infection. Alternatively, a “simple” or “complete” fracture refers to a linear (straight line) fracture that runs across the bone shaft, involving both sides (cortices) of the bone. An “incomplete” fracture involves only one side of the bone shaft. “Greenstick” fractures are specific to childhood where the bone bends rather than breaking. A “buckle” fracture is an incomplete fracture where one cortex collapses or buckles. A “spiral” fracture occurs in long bones from a rotational force. It has a helical shape, twisting around the long-axis of the bone shaft. A “comminuted” fracture is one that has many separate fragments of bone.
