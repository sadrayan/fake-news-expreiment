Pregnancy-acquired fetal progenitor cells
The transfer and persistence of fetal progenitor cells into the mother throughout pregnancy has sparked considerable interest as a trafficking stem cell and immunological phenomenon. Indeed, the intriguing longevity of semi-allogeneic fetal microchimeric cells (FMC) in parous women raises questions over their potential clinical implications. FMC have been associated with both immune-modulatory roles and participation in maternal tissue repair. Although their influence on maternal health is as yet unresolved, FMC selectively home to damaged maternal tissues and often integrate, adopting site-appropriate phenotypes. FMC features, such as plasticity and persistence in their maternal host, suggest that they likely include pluripotent, or various multipotent and committed stem and progenitor cells. Recent efforts to determine what cell types are involved have established that FMC include cells of ectodermal, endodermal, mesodermal, and perhaps trophectodermal lineages. This review details FMC phenotypes and discusses how FMC themselves may be considered a naturally occurring stem cell therapy.
