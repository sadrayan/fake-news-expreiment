Terminology:

- In many countries (and the IDEA database) “Voter Turnout” refers to ratio of voters to registered voters. With this definition the voter registration system is less relevant.

- In the US however turnout is usually about voters compared to voting age population (“VAP Turnout” in the IDEA database). With this definition low registration rates obviously have a significant impact on the turnout.

As the question seems to be asked with the US definition in mind, registration rates are relevant. For the registration rate the IDEA database shows clearly that the US is lagging behind. While many OECD countries have registration rates of 90% and more, the US is lowest amongst OECD countries and only had 78% in 2014.

Amongst those who are registered in the US turnout was 66.6% in 2012 (which is a mid-field position amongst other OECD countries) and 42.5% in 2014 (which is amongst the lowest between OECD countries). This indicates less participation (and interest) in mid-term elections compared to presidential elections.

Both factors together put US mid-term elections at the very bottom of the OECD list of VAP Turnout figures (with 33%). But even VAP Turnout for presidential elections with 54% is low on OECD list (only Switzerland, Mexico and Japan had lower turnout in recent elections)

Conclusion:

- Compared to other OECD countries the US voter registration rate is very low which has a negative impact on VAP Turnout compared to other countries.

- In the US, the type of election (presidential vs mid-term) has a significant impact on VAP Turnout

- Amongst those US citizens who are registered, voter turnout for presidential elections is with 66.6% in the OECD mid-field, comparable for example to parliamentary elections in the UK, higher than in Canada (61%), but lower than in NZ (77%)or Australia (93%, note that voting is compulsory)

Beyond this, general reasons for varying turnout are explained on pages 12-14 of “Engaging the Electorate: Initiatives to Promote Voter Turnout From Around the World” http://www.idea.int/publications/vt_ee/index.cfm

Dr Seema Shah, Programme Officer Electoral Processes, International IDEA Reasons for Low Turnout in the US:

-Election Day is not a public holiday, which means that people have to take time off of work to vote. In some places, the lines are extremely long, which means potentially losing significant amounts of your day’s wages (especially for people paid by the hour). This has been a recent topic in the US presidential campaign.

-Many races are not competitive, due to politicized boundary delimitation. Since these races are virtually “guaranteed” to a particular party, voters don’t feel they can make a difference -FPTP can also lower the incentive to vote, since it is easy to feel that one vote isn’t going to sway the outcome anyway -Recent voter suppression intimidates voters, especially minorities, from going to the polls -The vast sums of money that go into elections also contribute to voter apathy, because voters may feel that wealthy donors control politicians so their votes don’t count anyway
