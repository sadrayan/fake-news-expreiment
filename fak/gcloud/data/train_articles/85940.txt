Gov. Christie to push for immediate tax relief effort during Shore visit
TRENTON — As promised, Gov. Chris Christie will turn up the heat this afternoon on Democrats who he blames for taking a wait-and-see approach to cutting taxes.

The Republican governor will travel to the Pavilion at the Manasquan Inlet in the first of what his office has billed as the "Endless Summer Tax Relief Tour: A Conversation at the Jersey Shore".

"Governor Christie will call for Corzine Democrats to stop holding tax relief hostage and urge the legislature to continue the New Jersey Comeback and provide bipartisan leadership by delivering tax relief to our citizens, making our state more competitive and allowing us to put more New Jerseyans back to work," according to a statement from his office.

Democrats in the Legislature sent Christie a budget that does not raise taxes, but promised to reconsider if the administration's optimistic revenue projections match collections. Either way, cuts wouldn't take effect until January.

They say Christie's push for immediate relief is aimed at boosting his standing in the national GOP. Starting Tuesday, he will leave for a whirlwind fundraising tour of five states and the District of Columbia for presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
