Good morning.

I know Christine passed along my inquiry Friday. I am following up now to be specific about one aspect.

This April 2018 issue brief takes note of the HHSC lately allocating more aid to family planning. It also says more than 300,000 Texas women fielded government-supported family planning services in 2010-11, before the actions by the 2011 Legislature took effect, and it says that 215,000 women drew on such services in the fiscal year running through August 2016.

More recently, on April 26, the HHSC posted this report stating that in fiscal 2017, 219,396 low-income Texans received family planning services through state-supported programs. A day later, the Center for Public Policy Priorities said in a blog post about the report that the number of Texas women fielding family planning services with state aid escalated 29 percent from 2016 to 2017. But, the center said, the number of women served still trailed--”by tens of thousands”--women served by government-backed family planning programs before the 2011 actions.

Is it accurate to say that more than 300,000 women fielded such services in 2010-11 and about 215,000 women did so in fiscal 2016? If not, what would be the most accurate comparative estimates and why?

I plan to complete our review today.

Thanks,

g.

With the exception of a discussion on the provider network, a comparison between current women’s health programs and legacy women’s health programs would not be accurate. The programs were different (benefits, eligibility), so they cannot be precisely compared year over year. Fiscal year 2017 data included in the Rider 97 report referenced will be used as a baseline to gauge growth and success in Healthy Texas Women and Family Planning Program in future years.

The chart attached may be helpful for background.

Subject: This accurate per your response?

You counseled in your email against comparing 2016 or subsequent state counts of women drawing on state-supported family planning to past tallies because, you said, the older figures include some double-counting due to patients drawing on multiple programs.

That’s fine, but also program benefits and eligibility changed over time, also making it inaccurate to directly compare year to year.
