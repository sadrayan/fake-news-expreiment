Suspect arrested in French Quarter robbery captured on video
New Orleans police arrested a suspect Thursday (Nov. 5) night in last month's French Quarter robbery of a man police say was beaten in the street and stripped of his wallet.

The New Orleans Police Department identified the suspect as a 29-year-old transgender woman whose birth name is Wayne Dillard. She was booked around 6 p.m. Thursday on a charge of simple robbery.

The robbery happened around 6 a.m. Oct. 3, in the 800 block of Burgundy Street.

Police said surveillance video shows Dillard and another woman attacking a man on the street and sidewalk. Court documents from Orleans Criminal District Court accuse Dillard of taking the man's wallet before she and another woman drove away in a 2005 Ford Explorer, which is registered to Dilllard.

Police say Dillard used the victim's credit card at a Dollar General at 100 Labarre Road in Metairie, about six blocks from her home address.

NOPD released video Tuesday (Nov. 3) of the robbery and a picture of Dillard, two days before officers made the arrest.
