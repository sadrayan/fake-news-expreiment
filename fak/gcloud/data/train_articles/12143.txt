March 11, 2010



- Today, members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, led by Representatives Frank Kratovil of Maryland and Travis Childers of Mississippi, announced their plans to introduce legislation that would require the federal government to cut non-security spending by nearly 6%, saving the American taxpayers over $400 billion. The proposal, which would reinstate caps on federal discretionary spending, is a key component of the Blue Dog Blueprint for Fiscal Reform, a comprehensive plan to reduce the deficit, balance the budget and lay the groundwork for sound fiscal policies over the long term.



“Although cutting discretionary spending will no doubt mean making tough choices about where to tighten our belts, it is the common sense way to focus on today’s national priorities while preparing for the future,” said Representative Kratovil. “For too long we have allowed our national debt and deficit to spiral out of control. We must enact the policies necessary to rein in spending and build the foundation for a stronger, more stable economy.”



“Every day, hard-working Americans make tough decisions in order to make ends meet, and the federal government should operate no differently,” said Representative Childers. “Our national debt and deficit have reached unsustainable levels and are continuing to grow. It’s time to return to the bipartisan spending policies that allowed us to achieve a surplus in previous decades. Reducing non-security discretionary spending is a significant step towards balancing our budget and restoring fiscal responsibility, and I am proud to join Rep. Kratovil in introducing this important legislation.



Specifically, the Blue Dog proposal to cap federal discretionary spending would:



• Cut non-security discretionary spending by 2% for each of the next 3 years, and freeze spending levels for the subsequent 2 years.

• Complement the recently restored statutory PAYGO law which will help prevent increases in mandatory spending.

• Force Congress to prioritize our limited resources and make the tough year-to-year decisions necessary to restore balance to the federal budget.



Originally enacted under bipartisan agreements in the 1990’s, discretionary spending caps have a proven track record of controlling spending and reducing the deficit. Alternatively, since they were allowed to expire in 2002, discretionary spending has jumped by more than $538 billion, an alarming trend that threatens to cripple the nation’s economy and saddle future generations of Americans with mountains of debt. ### Print version of this document
