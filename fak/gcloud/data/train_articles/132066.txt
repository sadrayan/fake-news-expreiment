him, askt him w T t he wanted, he sd he had lost god and was seeking his god — An historicall account of the family of my honoured father Richard Hey wood of little Leaver in Bolton parish in Lanca- shire : begun June 9 1675 My dear and honoured father Richard Heywood was the first borne son of Oliver Heywood, by his wife Alice, he was born, as I suppose about the year 1596, he had a brother and a sister, his sister Mary being lame dyed about 40 yeares agoe, his brother John is yet aliue, [I am informed since that my grandfather had an elder son than my father called John, but dyed young] living at an house in little Leaver called the Chappel, because it was built of that wood that belonged to the chappel at little Leaver- hall, he hath been twice marryed, his first wife was Isabel the sister of Roger Barlow a good woman, who dyed of a sad disease of a cancer in her breast about the year 1667, his present wife is Joane the sister of James Mason, a young woman, yet he never had child by either of them : My father Richard Heywood, being brought up with his B 2 20 Heijwood Family . father in the ordinary way of working, and weaving fustions, (the trade of that country, though his father was a Carpenter,) in processe of time, god sent Mr Hubbert a godly minister to Cockey a chappel about a mile distant, by whose preaching many were convinced, and converted, it pleased the Lord to awaken the heart of my father at that time, and I hope to set his feet into the ways of peace, so that ever after that he asso- ciated himself with gods people, maintained days and dutys of fasting and prayer, conference, and other Christian excercises, so that I can remember that in my childhood there was many days of that nature in my fathers house, besides the real evi- dences he hath given of practicall piety, which I shall occasion- ally touch hereafter : He marryed my mother Alice Cretchlaw of Longworth in Bolton parish about the year, 1615 when he was about the age of 19 but my mother was 3 yeares older then he at their marriage good Mr Horrocks preacht a nuptiall sermon, after their marriage god that intended to build them high, laid their foundation low, by first taking from them their first-born son, John, when he was but about a year old, then afterwards brought them into debt and danger, occasioned by his answer- ing anothers debt, wherby he was often forced to skulk in holes and flee, they removed one year from his house to the walk-mill at water-side, for secrecy and security, but it was a sad and afflictiue year, partly for poverty, partly for debt and danger, partly for want of godly society, they fared bare, and workt hard, and were often put to shifts, but god had mercy on them, gaue them more children, made his father kind to them, and many other friends whom he raised up beyond ex- pectation, and at last the Lord was pleased to disingage and extricate them out of troubles, and my father being thrifty and carefull, began to make fustions, wch was then a very gainfull calling, and after a while god opened a way for his trading to London, and raised up friends and brought him into acquaintance with one Mr Cotton in Milkstreet, and Mr Cary who was Mr Cottons servant and afterwards marryed his daughter, these he traded with, many yeares and severall others, they got out of debt about the time I was born as I have oft heard my mother relate, and god did graciously blesse them in matters of the world, so that he grew to a considerable estate, and things succeeded comfortably far beyond expecta- Heytvood Family. 21 tion, and tis very strange to consider how god increased him in the world, even wildest his family was increasing, so that he was carryed on to doe much beyond expectation, wch I shall briefly touch, 1 the first thing he did was purchasing the house and land where he hues, formerly a tenement for liues, but now land, worth about 20li a year, wch cost about 400li — 2 his building houses, barnes, and severall translations wch was very costly, and took much of his mony and estate, 3 sinking colepits in the land, though very costly, for I may say they lay in many hundreds of pounds, and brought little profit, 4 he had 4 daughters whom he marryed and gaue them 601i a peece, and something more, and they were well disposed : 5 maintaining two sons at the University upon his own proper charges, (for we had no preferment,) for 4 yeares a peece, which could not be lesse then 300li at least, 6 my eldest and youngest brothers who were some time at London, and both wastfull, and lay him in well towards as much as we that were trained up schollars, 7 besides all this he laid out a great deal of mony, upon a paper-mill, wch he confesseth cost him 2001i — besides a walk-mill, wch cost much to put into frame, though for want of use it was presently lost s 8 He purchased large quantitys of land, wch he hath since parted with as followeth, 1 The walk-mill and land at water-side belonging to it, valued at 61i per annum, he made over to me by articles of marriage 20 yeares agoe when 1 was first marryed, 2 Scolcrofts, Partintons, and Richard Leavers wch come to lOli per annum, he settled upon me in consideration of 200li he had of my first wiues portion, being formerly paid as a rent charge out of the whole : now settled on these : 3 Grundys living my brother Nath: had settled upon him, as his portion, paying 301i for * lease in being, it comes to 81i a year, 4 Tong-house and land together with Balchy-medows my brother Nath bought of my father and paid him 140li — it comes to 7li — 10s a year 5 Taylours living he let goe to Mr Isaac Ambrose of Ormes- kirk for 140li wch he owed him. and tis his for ever, 22 Heyivood Family . 6 the 4 acres by it he sold to Mr Thomas Boardman for Bolton-schoole, worth 5li — a year — 7 Leadbelters ground he made over to Mr John Stirrup for 140li owing to him, worth 8li a year, 8 Hultons-ground, and mason-ground he sold for about 801i in order to the paying of debts and severall cottages besides, so that the whole by computation of yearly rent or worth it which he had in his power comes to aboue 50li a year which he hath thus disposed of, besides the land yet in his hands : I must confesse it is matter of great admiration to me to consider what an estate god gaue my father that he might accomplish these workes for the education of his children, and for training up my good brother and me at the university, and for doing god service in his church, and when he had done that work he gaue it him for, tooke it quite from him again : his intanglements and troubles in the world returned again upon him in his old age, after this manner, whilest my own dear mother was living he saw that the fustian-trade failed him, and he hauing a walk-mill in his hands, began to haue an itching mind to be dealing with wollen-cloath, which was an imployment wherin he had not been versed. So he came to Ratchdale every munday, bought cloth, got it milled, dressed, and sold it at London, he hath often told me, he knew how he bought, and how he sold, and was confident he got abun- dance of mony, and yet he says also that it went faster then it came, he saw it, but could not tell how to help it, for himself he hath always been exceeding sparing, provident and forecast- ing and witty enough for his calling, yet unawares was cast into l,200li debt, which I confesse is the strangest thing imaginable, and hath been the wonder of many how it should come to passe, But I shal giue my conjectures, and I may so guesse upon sufficient grounds from what I know and have observed, though I was at a distance, and altogather a stranger to his trading, yet these reasons I imagine might be given of his bringing into debt : 1 He sent up to London and imployed there a kinsman they call Adam Crompton, (whose mother and my father were couzen germanes) who hauing no subsistence, my father to doe him a courtesy and for his good disposed of him as factor, and he traded for him there many yeares, but spent wastfully of my fathers mony, made bad debts, unprofitable bargaines, neg- Heywood Family . 23 lected bills payment, yea (as hath been found out since) ordered bills to be paid twice over, and so like a wicked steward did wilfully wast his masters goods ; 2 my eldest brother John, (after my mothers death) kept house in the country, and traded upon my fathers account, and his wife was very expensiue in her house-keeping, and he himself too kind-natur’d (as they call it) abroad, and my brother Josiah too prodigal, and cost him a great deal, known and unknown to him : and besides all that my brother John would needs build a stately barn, of stone, wch cost near lOOli — and at dearest hand, out of the stock, 3 my father himself was grown ancient and not so capable of trading as formerly, he often forgot himself, and his busines, and therby was prejudiced, not being able to follow his busines himself, others were necessarily imployed who proved not so faithfull as they should haue been : 4 I looke principally at the hand of god, and that indeed is to be principally owned in this affair, partly for probation, partly for punishment, and he is righteous in all, as Job saith of his sons, I may say of my dear father and his family, it may be we haue sinned and offended god in our hearts, possibly my father, my dear and honoured father sinned in changing his calling, in too eager pursuit of the world, in unfaithful dealing in not keeping his word, in pleasing himself with hopes of riches, or imagining a kind of contentment in worldly injoyments ; However, this I obserue in him and others that when god sees persons haue some needful work to doe for god with estates god is pleased to lend them to them, but when men aim at the gratifying of a covetous design, if god aime them good he crosseth them herein : My dear father hath been battered with anxious thoughts in this perplexing state now this 13 yeares, his captivity hath run paralel with ministers, for god commenced a suit against him in the year 1662, the same year in wch ministers were turned out of their publick-imployment by an act of uniform- ity : and there seemes to be a proportion though not in the causes, yet in the nature of our sufferings, wherin my father hath two sons that haue born their share in this difficult province, 1 men haue prosecuted him, and men haue also per- secuted us ; 2 we haue been shut out of publick imployment in 24 Heywood Family . gods house, he hath been excluded the injoyment of publick ordinances, 3 it hath fallen heavy upon our estates, and this providence hath swept away his substance, 4 he hath been twice prisoner, so haue many of us ; 5 he fled from his house for fear of arrest, so haue we sometimes fled, sometimes been punisht, and haue been many times put to fear, and to flight,: 6 he hath been loaded with vile reproaches, as tis usuall in that case, and we haue been exceedingly filled with contempt, scorn, slanders, as the only seditious, factious, rebellious spirits in the land : 7 his affliction hath been, in a taking him off his calling, so hath ours quite cast us out of the workes of our heavenly function : 8 his trouble upon that account hath had great influence upon many others, not only relations that haue deeply shared with him, many ways, but work-folks that depended upon him, that are almost beggared, the same may be said of ministers, how many haue fallen, by our fall (many soules in danger to languish, perish by our being turned out of the Lords work) ; and as we haue run paralel in sufferings, so I hope in carriage and behaviour, using gods appointed meanes for deliverance, he hath had many days of fasting and prayer, wherin 1 haue discerned some kindly workings of humiliation, and self-condemning confessions, readines to justify god in all that is brought upon him, a willingnes to part with all he hath to satisfy credi tours, and an use of all honest endeavoures to extricate himself out of this labyrinth, and indeed he hath parted with all that he can part with, and god hath not been wanting in his gracious providences to him as wel as to us in our affliction, I must confesse tis matter of admiration to me to consider how strangely he hath been secured out of prison, in many eminent dangers, and how he hath had a way of escape found out in many desperate cases past the power of man to help him in, and yet god hath brought him off : as 1 At the first when this busines fell out, being at London, when his goods were attacht and himself in danger he could doe nothing, and yet owed some hundreds, and some to great men as lOOli to Lord Bridgman, afterwards lord keeper, and yet by the good hand of god, all these debts in due time satis- fied or hansomly compounded, himself delivered, and brought to liue quietly at home : 2 Mr John Stirrup of Winwick parish had sued out a Heywood Family . 25 statute of bankrupts agt him wch would have been terrible not only to him but to all that he had traded with for a whole year, I travelled hard in that busines, and he would not bate a farthing of the whole debt viz sevenscore pound ; we settled as much land on him as answered the whole — 3 Ralph Norris in Bolton sued him for James Monilex children, and arrested him at water side, a great company of women rescued him for wch many of them were indited at the sessions for a battery or riot, and a great uproar was in the country, but at last we composed it, R: Crompton, and brother Whitehead undertaking to pay the debt 30li in 6 yeares, and I suffered them to take my rents for that end till the whole was run up, and so he was freed : 4 Though I might mention many, strange providences yet I will but mention one more, wch fell out this last year viz Anno 1674 : he was arrested at the suit of Robert Harpur, for one Thomas Rivington deceased, for 40li carryed to Preston, when he was there, one Chadwick and another one Chorton clapt writs upon him, wheras he owed not all these one farthing, and yet in hazzard he was to goe to Lancaster, and they had laid desperate designes agt him, till he with much adoe pro- cured strong testimonys and acquittances for payment of two of them, and Harper was peremptory, demanding 40li — there was no remedy, though there was nothing due from him, if any thing was due it was from my brother John wn they were not partners, but they hired two fellows to swear positiuely that my father had taken it upon himself, but it was a false oath, as appeares since, however all was a case it must passe in law, and though he had a tryal at the Assizes, yet he was cast by these perjured wretches, and so he must either pay the debt or goe to prison, or they would fall upon the bonds men, viz his two grandchildren Richard Hey wood and William White- head, it was a matter of some trouble to us, my advise to him was to pay the mony rather then to goe to prison, or endanger them by forfeiting the bond, the young men were in little ease, so bound, we met about it, my father had secured them out of the lOOli to be [this Robert Harpur paid by his

talking to him, he would haue all, and it troubled my father to giue him 40li — and owed him nothing at all, There was one thing considerable at this time, the Bailiffs that were imployed to arrest my father knew not how to ac- complish their design, and therfore wrought subtilly, they had a pot-companion, one Luther Wood that marryed John Lords daughter in Darcy-Leaver, that was constable, at that time, thus they had laid their plot that Luther Wood must come to my fathers pretending to want a constable-ley, and when the door was opened, the Bailiffs must slip in after him and arrest my father, and as they contrived it so they effected their busines, for after that manner they did treacherously apprehend him, and led him away, wch proved an affliction, but behold a hand of god, this Luther Wood was catcht stealing geese, capons, ducks, and was sent to Mr Hulton of Park a justice of peace, who bound him to appear at the Assizes, and for his present punishmt ordered him to ride on horseback through Bolton with a goose tyed to him, exposed to shame and contempt, wch he did, and this was not aboue a moneth after he had so treacherously betrayed my father, and then for shame, guilt, or fear, ran away out of the country, — But to return to my father, whiles he was perplexing his thoughts and beating his braines to get this matter composed with Harpur, there was one Richard Wats, about Loten-com- mon a great tradesman intangled in a troublesom suit at London about an account betwixt him and another to the value of 4 or 500li — he lookt upon my father as a competent witnesse for him, and prevailed with him to goe with him, provided him a pretty pacing mare, bore his charges kept him well, and he travelled sometimes about 20 miles a day, most of his relations knew not of his journey till he sent a letter that he was at London : his letter came feb 1 1674, that he was well, and kindly entertained, when he was there, my Cozen Nath Hulton, (whom my father had sent up to London as his factor, and maintained him there, and now is groun a rich man), Spake comfortably to him askt him what he would haue done, my father told him nothing except he could make an end for him with Robt Harpur he answered him, they would compose 27 HeyivooA Family . that busines, Mr James Leaver (Robt Harpurs uncle, to whom he is much obliged) joyned in the same resolution to take off Harpurs rage, withall saying Harpur would at London shortly, he came up while my father was there, but would not meddle with any agreemt, because (as he pretended) the other Executor one Hartley of Dean-church was not there, so they referred it to Mr Tilsley, and Mr Bradshaw to agree it in the country, they met once or twice and could make no end, Harpur would haue every farthing, though Mr Tilsley silenced them in arguing, Lent assizes approacht, at wch my father must either pay or deliver up himself prisoner or forfeit his bond, and so insnare his bondsmen, they had another meeting about a day or two before the assizes, at wch they struck through sent him his bond, released him, but upon wt termes, my father did not know, and must never know, but Nath: Hulton cleared him, so the matter was comfortably ended, and he had notice, but about a day before he was to haue gone, the reason of their concealment of this agreemt was because my father was per- emptory he would not pay that mony as being none of his debt, (whether there was any or no) and was troubled to haue any body else pay it, because this Harpur pretends its for the fatherles and motherles children of Th: Revingtons, but spends it wastfully himself and is in abundance of debt, being dark of Bolton could not doe his office but was glad to skulk, blessed be god that the good old man is so safely delivered out of the hands of such an unreasonable man, I own it as no small mercy : Thus the Lord hath graciously preserved him in safety, and extricated him out of many snares, so that he not only walks abroad at liberty, but hath gone to the publick ordinances, he [was] at Cockey chappel May 30 1675 wch was the first time he hath appeared in church or chappel therabouts this many yeares, they hear not of any apparent hazzard, though there are some smaller debts not yet paid, but blessed be god they are brought into a narrow compasse : Though this hath been a sad trouble yet not all the trouble that my father hath met with in his pilgrimage, there was another antecedent to this that w T as a matter of great vexation, though of another nature : in the year 1647 or therabouts the Presbiterian government being settled at Bolton the ministers Mr John Harpur, and Mr Richard Goodwin, togather with the 28 Heyivood Family . Eldership made an order, (after examination and approbation of the communicants), that every time they were to come to the Lords supper every particular communicant should upon the friday before fetch a little ticket (as they called it) of lead, of the Elders, and shew it to the Elders again in the church before they were to receiue the Sacramt, that they might know that none but such as were admitted did intrude themselues, the Elders also took them of them at that time and they were to fetch them agt the next, now my father togather with several others, able Christians in the congregation were unwilling to submit to this practice, partly because they lookt upon it as an innovation, and a snare, partly because, it was cumbersome to the communicants, partly because it was an unceartain mean to attain the end, as experience testifyed, partly also because no other churches in the country used any such practice, these and such like reasons he exhibited to the Eldership in writing, and in his own practice refused to fetch or shew any such ticket when he came to the Sacrament, wherupon they sent for him, summoned him to appear before them, he came, and many disputes they had, they admonished him, and when he was still resolute persisting still in his schisme, as they pleased to call it, they suspended him from the Lords supper, but that was not sufficient for (as I remember) they did also excommunicate him, for contempt, because as they said he laught them to scorne, for hauing naturally a smiling countenance, it may be he might sometimes smile in his discourses with them, however he would not submit himself upon their admonition, nor ac- knowledg that he had done wrong, therfore they proceeded, my dear mother would haue had him to haue yeelded, for peace-sake, the rest, old Robt Crompton, Roger Roscow &c (though approving what he did and incouraging him, yet) held off and would not appear, so that he was alone in that con- troversy, being in this strait, shut out from communion with them, he appealed to the classical meeting of ministers and elders, where it was debated a considerable time, and though the Classes, were unsatisfy ed in the proceedings of the Eldership of Bolton agt my father, yet they were loath to censure them, only desired them to passe it by and admit him to the supper, but when they trifled about it and did nothing, my father made an appeal from the Classical presbitery at Bury to the provin- cial Assembly at Preston, and after the busines had been 29 Reywood Family. debated there they made an Order that the congregation all Eldership of Bolton should revoke their sentence of Suspension of my father from the Lords supper, admit him again into fellowship with them, exhorting both sides to a mutual accom- modation, &c (and (as I remember), the tickets, the occasion of this contention were by this time laid aside ;) when this came to the Ministers and Elders of Bolton-church, they some- thing stickled at his restauration without his submission, how- ever they were bound to obey the order of the provincial assembly, and at last framed a paper wch was read in the church wherin they freed R Heywood from his suspension, but withall made some hints therin as though he had submitted himself, which he did not, and so it was not at all satisfactory to him, and I think he never joyned with them at the Lords supper afterwards but was entertained at Cockey and all places about, this is in short an account of that troublesome busines, wch was afoot just at that time when I was at Cambridg, and I remember when I came into the country in the later end of 1648 I writ much for him, which was in way of reply to the Eldership of Bolton, and some appeales, which I haue now forgot, but the controversy was hot begot much bad blood many animositys amongst good people in that society, some taking one side, others another, so that it became a very heavy burden to the spirit of my dear mother, who was all for loue and peace, and was willing to haue yeelded to any thing rather then haue contended, but he stood upon his oun integrity wch he often said he would not remove as long as he lived quoting that of Job 27 2 3 4 5 6 : but however it was a great aflictian to him, which yet he bore with invincible courage and magna- nimity, and was not daunted with any thing, he had severall friends to consult with, among wch was Mr Peter Bradshaw minister of Cockey who helpt him what he could, and was the Scribe of the Classical meeting, Mr Goodwin (now my brother in law, then minister of Bolton), was something sharp with him, wch he tooke worse because my father was the only man that brought him from London into Lancashire and procured him a settlement at Cockey after good old Mr Rathbands silencing : but these things were long agoe, and forgotten, and I hope buryed and forgiven : I come now at last to the last Scene of my fathers life, he had injoyed his health very well most part of his days, only 30 Heywood Family . when he was at any time sick, he was sore sick and very hartles, had been at Leverpool upon busines this winter, he had often sd I will goe to my two sons, and be with them, a moneth with the one, and another moneth with the other, but put it off, my brother Nath: Heywood came about Christmas last and stayed near a fortnight on that side, lodged severall nights with him, preacht on Lords day in his house, conversed fami- liarly with him, and was longer with him (as he told me) then he had been this 20 yeares and upwards and was much affected in his company, — about this time my father got several ministers to spend the Lords day in his oun house in preaching and prayer, so that the Lords day before he dyed when he lay sick Mr Aspinall preacht in his house, and discoursed, prayed with him on that day and on munday-morning, and had good satisfaction from him : likewise, several moneths before he dyed, he was much drawn out with the sense of gods great goodnes to him, and therfore appointed several days of solemn thanksgiving, on wch he desired the help of Christian friends and neighbours, and was much inlarged upon those days, a good man told me that the last day he was with him upon that occasion he prayd, and praised god with so much affectionatenes and teares as did much affect his heart that joyned with him, and others, god hauing so signally appeared by his providence to extricate him out of those intanglements wherin he had been so long in- volved, and setting his feet in a large, that he might goe in and act with so much peace and safety — ;• I ihauing* occasion to 1 - travel into Lancashire, (hauing not been there since may>last)‘*to Denton Manchester, came to his hfeuse, the place, of :iny birth on feb 22 167G-7

abroad on the rnunday and thought he got some cold, by not putting on cloths enow, he had a sore cough and a stopping, yet got up much flegme, told me he was wonderfull weak how- ever it would be with him, that he was never in that condition « beforehand was waiting how it would please the Lord to deal with him, I askt him how it was with him as to the state of . his soule, he answered.

Verses made upon the death of those two gracious, now glorious saints, whose hues are herafter briefely described : Awake ye mournful guests, that doe attend the sable herses of beloved saints Let tender-hearted mourners passions lend and eccho out these mournful sad complaints These precious flowers of heaven thus are cropt these lilly-saints that never vertue wanted, These fruitful vines by death are quickly lopt or rather to a better soyle transplanted ; Oh saples trees that in gods orchyard stand moysten your roots with tears throughout ye land Such pleasant Rosebuds that at present were, both fresh and useful in their lower station And with delightful fruits adorn'd the year this year of patience and gods visitation. Yea those that did presage a plenteous crop of hopeful incomes by their precious seed, of fervent prayers, and plenteous teares, doe drop and fal apace in this our day of need : Both young and old, lament this dreadful losse and sadly think of our approaching crosse : The worlds foundations reel, and kingdomes shake when such strong pillars are removed hence, the lord of Hosts doth dreadful vengeance take when thus in anger he plucks up the fence : When in the graue god hides his hidden ones it is because some dreadful storm draws nigh When he lifts up the soule and leaues but bones those scattered bones unto us thus doe cry. Bow down your heads, lament your tottering state meet god betimes, for wrath waits at the gate : How many precious saints, who hence departed of latter years into gods presence-chamber, with tender hearts bespoke the brawny-hearted in melting language this day to remember : Weep not for us, sayd they, succeeding ages for safe we are aboue al sins and snares 40 Heywood Family. Weep for your soules and seed, let these presages of saddest woes awake your feares and cares : gods presence is with-drawing by degrees, and leaues you to condole these obsequys : Oh what heart-rouzing preachers haue of late, paid natures debt and slept the sleep of death What heaven-rending wrestlers changd their state loathing to liue when those tune-d out their breath Both these fore seeing foggy vapours rising from Englands crying crimson provocations And heavens thicken with black clouds devising to pour upon us doleful desolations they stept aside under the gloomy shade of death, and there in safety are close laid : These savoury quicksented saints espying a spiritual famine in this lower region, Put otf their flesh, took wings, departed flying to feast themselues with the caelestial legion : these actiue soules, observ’d a blow preparing to slay the witnesses against the beast and lest their useles Hues, or deaths, declaring what god hath done or wil doe with the rest, gaue us the slip and from the stroke wthdrew and did a civil death tlierby eschew 0 what endeared thoughts, and tender care, had these beloved female saints to those, that spiritual fathers and succesful were, soules to beget to christ and truths disclosed their armes and hearts were open to embrace, gods faithful preachers, and his saving word his house they loved, and his beauteous face, longing for more injoyments with the lord : At best they could but see here through a glasse and therfore longd to god by death to passe And now they are arrived at their port that joyful haven of eternal rest those staggering stormes at sea whose bare report astonish mortals, these from them are blest Heywood Family. 41 These happy soules are gone aboue the sun yea glorious suns are in heavens firmament no sun-light need they, glory is begun, grace perfect is, god is their sole content : o let us hasten to these blessed joys and leaue our sins, and loads, and worldly toys. per me 0 H The life of Alice Heywood, my dear and precious mother, observed and collected by 0 H She was born in Longworth near Walmesley chappel in Bolton parish in Lane: about the year 1594: she was the onely daughter of her father, she had four brothers, William, Francis, Hugh, and Ralph Critch-law, and most of these being effectu- ally wrought upon by grace while she was but yong she wondered at their zeal, and could not imagine what ailed them to keep such a stirre in praying, reading, and runing to sermons, &c Yet she liked them the better for their forwardnes in these ways of god and dutys of religion, tho she had little sense of these things as yet upon her own heart, for (as she hath often told me) she was as careles, carnal, and fro ward as any til she was about 19 years of age, at which time it pleased god to take to himselfe her gracious mother, whom she tenderly affected, and for whose death she made excessiue sorrow, well heart-breaking providence was seconded with an heart-convincing ordinance, and with gods blessing upon both, for at that time there lived a godly young minister at the place, one Mr Joshua Hill, whom the lord used as an instrument to open her blind eyes, to con- vince her heart of her dangerous estate by nature, and the dreadful guilt attending the commission of every actual sin, so that her heart was overwhelmed under sad apprehensions of divine wrath, she even roared by reason of the disquietnes of her spirit, oh the bitter pangs and torturing throws her soule felt in this spiritual travel, her very moysture was drved up with bitternes of soule, in wch selfe-lamenting plight (at the next door to despair) she continued too ful years, stil suffering gods terrours, and refusing to be comforted, thinking her con- dition without paralel, and far worse then ever any bodys else was, and that ther was no hopes of mercy for so vile a sinner And that wch lay very heavy upon her heart was that she had not been so careful to follow her dear, dead mothers example 42 Heywood Family . and instructions, for the things of her soule, tho she was very observant to please her in other things: it broke her heart exceedingly that her mother was gone to the graue with tears for her, and had not seen the return of her prayers and successe of her endeavours for her conversion : there were indeed many concentring causes of her excessiue soul-trouble, the sin of her nature, and the vile nature of her sins, therby dishonouring god, crucifying christ, grieving the spirit, and undoing her soule : and many aggravating circumstances that brought her soul to the gates of hel, and her body nigh unto the graue : one passage I haue often heard her relate that upon that day upon wch she used to goe to Bolton, and be most jocund with her companions, she did afterwards with-draw her selfe into a little out-house near her fathers, and took her bible with her and spent the whole day in reading and praying, self-examining and selfe-judging excercises, there she took her fil in bitter crys of godly sorrow, and hearty groanes for pardoning mercy, that fasting and solitarines being an holy revenge upon 2 cor 7 11] her selfe for her former mirth and vanity, though she had not been addicted to grosse prophanes, yet youthful wantones was her bitter affliction ; for a wounded spirit hath a fruitful fancy to multiply and magnify smallest circumstances, and render them intolerable : when her Brothers perceived her continuing too long in that little coat, some of them came to take her off and bring her home, telling her, she must pitty her body, and that god wil haue mercy and not sacrifice, she answered she cared not wt became of her body, so her heart might be laid low enough for sin : Her soul-troubles were so great, and her doubts so many that several experienced persons took great pains to comfort her, but almost in vain, Mr Hill who was the means of her casting down laboured much to raise her up, lest she should be swallowed up with over-much sorrow he had a tender respect to her, and sometimes in company would haue pointed to her and said, this is one of my lambes, wch expression wrought wonderfully upon her heart, Ah thought she, what am I that any of gods messen- gers should own such an unworthy wretch that I should be called a lamb that am liker a wolfe, and deserue not to come into christs fold among his people ; many selfe-abasing and self-condemning thoughts she had, and was nothing in her owne eyes, and if she perceived that any thought or spoke we! Heywood Family . 43 of her it did rather humble her then lift her up, yea it did the rather break her heart, because she thought she was not so good as they took her to be ; and if they knew how vile she was they would not praise her, for none had so bad an heart as she was burdened with : Amongst others of her spiritual helps her brothers contributed much, especially her youngest brother (Ralph) was more en- deared to her through suitablenes in age, but especially in soule-troubles for he also was wrought upon about the same time, and too precious gentlewomen living near, were her com- panions in this soul-tribulation (who afterwards were Mtris Barton and Ms Crosse) whose loue and friendship continued with much tendernes til death though removed far asunder : Another singular assistant to her in her soule-troubles was that auncient and eminent servant of god James Horrocks, whose advice in those days was as an oracle, and the lord bless- ing him for abundance of good to many soules. She complained of back-wardnes to duty and that she came so unwillingly to god sometimes that she had better let all alone, for god loues chearful worshippers : this he satisfyed by telling her it was a state incident to the best of gods children, and could she expect to be better then David, who said, since then o lord 1 forget my selfe (as tis in the meeter, and as he quoted it) : and that this is but the struggling of the flesh agt the spirit, wch cannot be conquered by yeelding but by fighting, and god wil own in and crown the soul after the combate &c But tho she was sensible of her inward backwardnes, yet that good old man took notice of her outward forwardnes in dutys of religion, and he used to say, Alice, thou art mad, this wil not last long, the fire-edge will soon be taken off, thou art just like one that hath been long in prison, who when he is got out, cares not which way he runs so he get far and fast enough from his old prison, or like a man yt hath been long in darknes, and coming into light he admires at it, and lookes on himselfe as in a new world ; just so art thou, looking upon thy condition as strange and uncouth but after a while we shal see thee more sober and solid lesse fiery and passionate, tho indeed she main- tained a wel-tempered zeal al her days, however she might part with that froth and frolick that might be incident to youthful zeale. Yet that true spiritual force was not abated but increased in age : she kept aliue that coale of zeale and maintained a 44 Heywood Family . constant tenure of savour and fervour of spirit, suffering as few decays and eclipses as most doe of so long a profession : I haue often heard her say, that after the lord gaue her assurance she never lost it, but had some degrees therof, tho not always equal comfort or confidence, and tho this may be an arbitrary act of free grace, yet it may be the privilege of close-walkers, for peace is upon them that walk according to the rule [gal 6 of the new creature : The first time her wavering soule got any anchor or satisfac- tion after these tempestuous tossings was at and by meanes of a sermon preached upon that text, cant 2 16 my beloved is mine, and I am his, wch text her soule was exceedingly affected with, and desired it might be preacht upon at her funeral, or that in psal 42 5, why art thou cast downe — which also she took great pleasure in, for she used often to bespeak her own heart in the language of that text, and receiue comfort therby in al her soul-conflicts, and outward pressures, al her days : these too scriptures she injoyned my brother and me to preach upon, (for she ingaged us to preach togather at Cockey every year a day while she lived) and whiles we were preparing and purposing to preach on those subjects the lord removed her hence, yet we kept our promises and performed our resolutions, and shall doe whiles we Hue if the lord grannt oppertunity and restore our libertys. this I can say, through gods mercy, yt having spent many serious thoughts upon both those texts, I haue seldome met with so much inlargement in preparation and delivering the matter I intended thereupon, as upon those subjects, both to my own satisfaction and (I hope) others edification : But to returne to my relation, when the lord had thus betrothed and maryed my dear mother to himselfe in righteous- nes, judgement loving-kindnes and mercys, he provided for her a suitable husband, my dear and honoured father, of whose piety and sincerity she had undoubted evidence, she hath often said that was the principal end of her choyce, and her heart was more endeared to him as an heir of the same grace of life, then for any other endowments : they were contracted first and then maryed (as I remember I haue heard them say) by good old Mr Horrocks, that famous light and precious instrument of god, to whom she had an endeared affection : But no sooner was she linked in that relation and ingaged in the world, but behold a Gad, a troop, yea an army of troubles 45 Heywood Family . broke in and assaulted her, the lord seeing good to cast her down first that he might raise her np, as he dealt with her in spirituals so in outwards, intending to raise a great structure and fabriek of blessings in matters of this life and a better, he laid the foundation low in inward perplexitys and outward miserys : One of the first encounters she met with was the death of her first-born son, wch how great an affliction it was let experience and scripture tes- [zach 12 10 tify : yet this was but the beginning of her troubles, for the lord excercised them under that distracting and heart-breaking providence of debt and danger thereby, occasioned by my fathers ingagement in a way of sureti-ship for others and this brought them very low, by suits and pur- suits, to take the advantage against them : besides, at the same time there lay a very grievous famine upon at the countrey what her pressures were, and sad thoughts of heart in those days cannot easily be expressed, tho she hath pathetically related them to me, and kept a due sense of those troubles upon her heart al her days, that her soule might [lam 3 19 20 be humbled within her in al her future prosper- ous condition : In these straits the lord raised up for them many Christian friends, whose hearts were moved to be very tender and affec- tionate towards them, and were very instrumental for their comfort and incouragement : amongst wm I haue often heard her own her father in-law, my grandfather (after whose name I was called) as a special means of her support, he was indeed eminent for godlines, tho converted when he was at least 60 years of age, and hee was as amiable for natural disposition, for he was made up of loue as I haue heard her often say, he often spoke lovingly to her, and acted the pa.rt of a faithful friend in strengthening her hands in god, helping her as if she had been his owne onely child, telling her that he and she would be equal sharers in comforts and crosses, and whitest he had it she should not want it : But at length the lord took away this stay also, removing him by death to himselfe who was so great an help to her, yet about the same time the lord did also remoue that affliction, and did graciously deliver them out of the snare and did set their feet in a safe and large place, in that year wherin I was born (as I haue heard her often say) were they freed from debt, and afterwards by the lords blessing did abun- 46 ffeywood Family , dantly increase in the world, and did grow to a very good estate in the world, affording us children a liberal education, and tho these be but left-hand blessings yet deserue to be observed and recorded to the glory of god, and the incouragement of god- fearing soules : besides tis a more blessed thing to giue then to receiue, and oh how good are these mercys with a blessing. Tho god delivered out of these straits yet she was a woman of sorrows, wch she bore with invincible courage, and incredible patience, chearfnlnes and selfe-denyal, for she had a speedy remedy for every malady, and that was prayer, oftentimes, when her heart was as ful of cares and fears as it could hold, and she was ready to be swallowed up, she was wont to goe to the lord and open her case and state to him in secret prayer and therby found present ease and future successe, and she was very conver- sant with the lord alone in holy, humble retirements, selfe-con- ference, meditation, and recollecting sermons (wch she heard :) and working them upon her own heart, wherby she had attained to a notable faculty in remembring, for tho by age her natural memory was decayed, and she was not expert in the art of memory yet she had the spirit of remembrance, and would mention much of what she had heard many years before ; it was her constant course in the night when she lay waking to roll them in her mind, and rivet them there, so that in her I haue often observed the truth of that maxime, a good heart helpes a bad memory : She was exceeding frequent and fervent in secret prayer, she took it as her greatest delight and recreation when she could get alone and poure out her soule before the lord, nor was this a bare formal performance meerly to satisfy the clamours of an anxious conscience, but it was her meat and drink, eating ashes as it were like bread and mingling her drink with teares, for her soules nourishment and refreshment, she did (as Heb 5 7] her sweet saviour before her) offer up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and teares : — her prayers were wel rooted in a right principle, wel regulated according to the rule, wel watered with many tears, and wel preferred through the merits of a saviour, and they were abun- dantly answered with a sweet and satisfying return, she begged grace principally for her children and god let her see that good work upon several of them, she much desired that some at least of the fruit of her body might be dedicated to the service of 4t , Beywood Family . the sanctuary, and she saw too of us preachers, and her main end in desiring this good work for us was that we might be instruments to bring soules to cht. she hath often said, oh where shal I put my head when my sons goe up into the pulpit to preach ? How unworthy am I of this high honour? if they may doe god any service it is a greater honour then if they had been the greatest princes upon earth : she often begged too things of god for us, viz the gifts and graces of his spirit, and a successe of our labours : How many fervent prayers hath she put up for this poore congregation of Coley, and what good hath been done by this worthies worme, I owne as a returne of her prayers : One passage I cannot but obserue, and remember whiles I Hue. At one time upon a lords day in the afternoon I found a fill tide of more then ordinary inlargements in publick, the week after going into Lane : I askt her if she did not keep house the lords day before, and upon further inquiry I haue found that at that instant of my assistance she was before the lord in secret, tis true I must own the intercession of christ alone as onely meritarious, yet this to me is an experi- ment that the effectual fervent piayer of a righteous person availes much : She intirely loved al godly ministers, and accounted their feet beautifull that brought the glad-tidings of the gospel of peace, she would haue put them in her bosome, and was even ravisht wn any of the lords embassadours came under her roofe, an oppertunitv of serving them or entertaining such, was more worth to her then great worldly gaines, I haue often heard her say that every bit of meat wch a good minister eat at her table she thought nourisht her ; and as she did Reverence them, so they respected her she had a friendly correspondence wth the best ministers in the country, who were ordinarily willing to condescend to her request for preaching, which good excercises she was very forward to promote, she had prevailed with my father Angier and Mr Gee for their pains at Bolton or Cockey, wch was done some time before their death and the summer after : her heart was so endeared to godly ministers, that she hath admired at gods free-grace that vouch-safed to dignify her seed with that office, especially having approbation and ordina- tion by ministers to that work in a regular way : and for her loue to, care of, and prevalency with ministers a Reverend divine used to cal her the mother of the Clergy : 48 Beytvood Family. Her earnest desire and constant care was to wait at the posts of wisdome She hath in her time taken intolerable paines to hear sermons, scarce any publick excercise stated or occasional within many miles but she went to it, she was (as it were) the center of news for knowing the time and place of week-days sermons, she thought it a great affliction to misse of any oppor- tunity for the good of her soule, she moved in dutys and ordi- nances as in her proper element, and hath often said, she was never right, but when she was reading, or hearing, or praying, or meditating or conferring, she loved to breath in a religious aire, and thought she could never be weary of gods service, there was scarce ever a week wherin she spent not one day or more in the communion of saints, those of her own sex keeping up appointed seasons of conference, and private fasts, in days of pr
