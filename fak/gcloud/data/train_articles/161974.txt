Fresh-Made Salads

Wendy’s has always been committed to providing you with delicious and nourishing choices at our restaurants. Our culinary innovation team is continually on the lookout for flavor trends and new, exciting ingredient combinations.

You can taste this in our salad lineup where there are various flavors that satisfy unique cravings and, when served with chicken, are packed with 32 to 42 grams of protein.

And it goes without saying that you can count on your salads being prepared with care. Every day, crew members hand-chop fresh produce, like iceberg and romaine lettuce, then toss in spring mix to make our signature lettuce blend. We also freshly chop tomatoes, strawberries (when in season) and more to make each salad, fresh, every single day.

We also feel options are important when it comes to the portion size of your salad. That’s why we offer full and half-size salads, so you can choose if you want to have a salad as a meal, snack or substitute for fries.
