You can attribute the following to a Facebook spokesperson:

In July 2012, this event was mistakenly removed by our automated systems after we received a report that content on the page violated our policies. The event did not violate our policies and we worked to restore it as soon as we were aware. The event page was restored within ten hours and is still live today.

Thanks,

What policies were at issue?

I don’t have any further details because the event page didn’t violate any of our policies.

Thanks again,
