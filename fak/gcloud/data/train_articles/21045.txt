Woman found dead in trash compactor of swanky NYC apartment building
A woman was found dead inside the trash compactor of a swanky Union Square apartment building on Tuesday afternoon, authorities said.

Cops and paramedics responded to Zeckendorf Towers at 1 Irving Place at 4:55 p.m. and “discovered a 48-year-old female unconscious and unresponsive inside a trash compactor,” according to an NYPD statement.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

The cause of death and how she got in the compactor was not immediately clear. Police did not release the name of the woman, pending family notification.

The building has been home to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner, according to tenants and public records.
