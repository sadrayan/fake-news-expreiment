Southerland Votes to Prevent Government Shutdown, Defund Obamacare
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, II voted today for a Continuing Resolution (CR) to keep the government running, protect America’s credit rating, and defund Obamacare. The House bill, which was approved by a 230-189 margin, now advances to the Democrat-controlled Senate for consideration.

“I do not want to see a government shutdown,” said Southerland. “Today’s vote is a decisive step forward in our fight to ensure that the federal government is properly funded and that all Americans, including our military, seniors and the truly vulnerable among us, continue to receive the vital services they expect and deserve. We’ve also ensured that our nation’s credit rating will be protected, while moving one step closer to a permanent delay and dismantling of government-run health care. It’s my hope that the Democrat-controlled Senate will now put politics aside and join the House in acting in the best interests of the American people.”
