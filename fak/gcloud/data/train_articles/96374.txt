Ceremony at Wisconsin State Capitol honors 9/11 victims - WKOW 27: Madison, WI Breaking News, Weather and Sports
MADISON (WKOW) -- A ceremony at the state Capitol brought Wisconsin state leaders together to honor the 9/11 victims on Sunday.



Hundreds gathered at the Capitol to pay tribute to the nearly 3-thousand who were killed. Gov. Scott Walker and top military leaders spoke about the aftermath of the attacks and the guard members here in Wisconsin who were ready to defend their country against any further attacks.

The governor also talked about remembering the victims every day, not just on the anniversary of the attacks.

"While we remember those individuals at ceremonies like this here in Wisconsin and in all 50 states across this country on days like today, those families remember their loved ones every single day," says Walker.

To help the families of those firefighters, retired Milwaukee Fire Department Captain Greg Gracz started a fund that has since raised nearly a million dollars. He has been to the site personally and was given a piece of glass from the towers in honor of his contributions and his support for the New York Fire Department.

"When does this end? Well, there is no end. as long as there's a piece of glass, an American flag, and 9/11 comes around, it will never end. We will always remember," he said at the ceremony.
