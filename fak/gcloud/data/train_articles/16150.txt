Emails, Mischelle Diaz, director of communications, St. Edward’s University, Jan. 20, 2017

2:13 p.m.

I know you've had a couple of conversations with TAB since you and I last spoke, so I want to update you - and make clear - the university's position regarding the student research study so that you can proceed with your story. I realize some of the back & forth as been frustrating for you, as you are just trying to gather the facts. You have my permission to use any, or all, of the information below to write your article if its useful to you. You can attribute the information to me, Mischelle Diaz, Director of Communications and university spokesperson.

Different groups of MBA students at St. Edward’s University have conducted 4 studies for TAB since 2015. Two of those studies were supervised by a faculty member who is now retired. The other two studies were supervised by a faculty member who is still employed.

Both faculty members and all students who participated in the class assignment signed non-disclosure agreements and contracts, which prevent them from sharing details related to the consulting project undertaken for TAB, but which also clarify that research provided should not be interpreted as the official position of the university, but rather that it contains views and opinions of the student teams based on discussions, observations, and analysis.

The university’s role was to provide a learning opportunity for MBA students and the product of that learning opportunity was an economic impact study for TAB. The research concluded in the fall of 2015. The university’s involvement in this issue ends there.

Recent media coverage has overstated, and even misrepresented, the involvement of St. Edward’s University in research now being used in the political debate at the state legislature.

The university will not participate in discussing or explaining the research. To do so at this time would only further the misperception that St. Edward’s has a position, or opinion, on the political issues now being debated, and we do not.

For these reasons, the faculty member who supervised the research will not comment on the methodology or details of any of the student projects. TAB has been provided with the raw data and final reports, and it may share and use that information in accordance with its policies.

This contradicts what TAB told me yesterday. At that time, the remaining professor was drafting replies to my written questions. What changed?

If the professor is able to answer the questions (some are related to the study conducted by the retired professor), he will provide those details to TAB. He said he would work on it this weekend.

OK; so your email is not an indication I won't get a study-specific reply?

3:14 p.m.

The faculty member will answer the questions he can and provide those details to TAB. Whether or not you get a study-specific reply will be up to TAB. I just wanted to clarify why you won't hear directly from the faculty member or other members of the university.
