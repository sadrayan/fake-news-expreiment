Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin and three other moon walkers have reportedly 'PASSED' a lie detector tests over claims they encountered alien life during their 1969 space mission.

The Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in Ohio, US, carried out complex computer analyses of the astronauts' voice patterns as they told of their UFO experiences in interviews, according to the Daily Star .

Experts allegedly claim the results prove Aldrin and his colleagues - including Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper - were "completely convinced" their claims were genuine.

In 2005, while being interviewed for documentary First on the Moon: The Untold Story, Aldrin told an interviewer the group saw a UFO.

He has since claimed his comments were edited, cut and taken out of context.

The now 88-year-old did claim he believes in aliens in a shock Good Morning Britain interview in 2017 - but he was referring to humans during a discussion about the "complicated" subject.

However, after careful analysis, lead expert Sharry Edwards claims voice patterns suggest the moon walkers truly believed their extra-terrestrial reports.

Sharry told the Daily Star their tests revealed Aldrin is sure he saw the UFO even though his logical mind "cannot explain it".

Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were the first two humans to land on the moon.

Aldrin set foot on its surface at 3:15am on July 21, 1969, nine minutes after Armstrong.
