Is this 179-year-old Indian the oldest man alive?
Mahashta Murasi claims that he was born in January 1835, which make him the oldest man alive till date. Murasi, if born on the same day he claims, will be the oldest man alive on earth and the oldest man to have ever lived according to Guiness Book of World Records.

According to the officials, Murasi was born and brought up in Bangalore, and is recorded to have lived in Varanasi since 1903.

He worked as a cobbler in the city until 1957, when he retired at the already venerable age of 122.

The manâ€™s birth certificate and identity cards all seem to confirm his version, but unfortunately no medical examination can confirm his saying for now.
