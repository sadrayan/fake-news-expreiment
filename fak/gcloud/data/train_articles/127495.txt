Everything we know so far about the Stockholm terror attack
His Facebook page shows he was following a group called "Friends of Libya and Syria", dedicated to exposing "terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals" of the United States, Britain and Arab "dictatorships".

It also showed he liked Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. The page suddenly became unavailable over the weekend.

Sweden's prime minister Stefan Lofve has called for tougher measures on rejecting asylum seekers.

He said he was "enormously frustrated" that Sweden's liberal immigration policies had failed to eject Akilov before the attack .

"Sweden will never go back to the mass immigration we had in 2015.

"It's only through the EU that we can create a sustainable system for immigrants," he added.

Sweden's prosecution authority said a second person had been arrested on suspicion of having committed a terrorist offence through murder, but police said they were more convinced than ever that Akilov was the driver of the truck.

Another five people were being held for questioning after raids and police said they had conducted about 500 interviews.

Police across the Nordic region went on heightened alert after the attack and in neighbouring Norway police set off a controlled explosion of a "bomb-like device" in central Oslo on Sunday and took a suspect into custody.
