What we do
NICE's role is to improve outcomes for people using the NHS and other public health and social care services. We do this by:

Producing evidence-based guidance and advice for health, public health and social care practitioners.

Developing quality standards and performance metrics for those providing and commissioning health, public health and social care services.

Providing a range of information services for commissioners, practitioners and managers across the spectrum of health and social care.

Evidence-based guidance and advice

Since 1999, we have provided the NHS, and those who rely on it for their care, with an increasing range of advice on effective, good value healthcare. We have gained a reputation for rigour, independence and objectivity. In April 2013 we gained new responsibilities for providing guidance for those working in social care.
