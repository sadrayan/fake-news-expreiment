Subject: Urgent Fact-Checking Inquiry, Texas Reporter

Professor Smart:

Good evening.

I write on behalf of a Texas newspaper because I urgently seek your thoughts for publication as we check a claim by the U.S. senator from Texas, Ted Cruz.

Cruz, opposing the “Obamacare” law, said on the Senate floor this week: "If we go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany--look, we saw it in Britain. Neville Chamberlain told the British people: Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them."

Is this accurate, factually speaking?

If so, why? If not, why not?

What primary resources would you recommend we consider?

Any fellow authorities?

Thank you very much.

Dear W Selby Gardner,

No NS did not sqy this - to anyone, let alone 'the British people'. There's nothing like it in his diaries, speeches, or in any of the biographical treatments of him I have read.

He was disappointed when war broke out - but thought the entente would win because, as the French slogan had it, '....nous sommes plus fort'.

Yours Ever

Nick Smart
