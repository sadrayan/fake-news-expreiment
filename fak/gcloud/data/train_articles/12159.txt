FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE RSC Unveils a Solution for Affordable, Quality Health Care





Washington, Jul 30, 2009 - Republican Study Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-GA) issued the following statement after introducing the Empowering Patients First Act. This comprehensive solution for health care reform would ensure that patients control their own health care decisions and provide access to affordable, quality health care for all Americans. A one page summary of the bill can be found here.



“No matter the challenges facing the country, the Republican Study Committee is dedicated to offering positive solutions,” said Chairman Price. “Today, we present a solution for health care reform that offers more patient-centered choices and care of the highest quality. The Empowering Patients First Act is a budget neutral proposal based on the fundamental principle that personal medical decisions should be made by patients in consultation with their doctors rather than unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington. Our plan will make insurance providers responsive to you, the patient, and coverage more affordable, accessible, and innovative.



“Throughout the debate on health care reform, the President has unfortunately insisted on presenting Americans with a false choice between either a continuation of the status quo or a government-takeover of health care. In reality, there has always been a third way that increases patients’ control over their own health care. With the Empowering Patients First Act, we can achieve reform that lowers costs and provides all Americans access to quality health care without placing Washington bureaucrats between you and your doctor.” ###
