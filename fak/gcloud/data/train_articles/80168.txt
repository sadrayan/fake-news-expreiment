Public Act 0538 100TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY
conformance with the legal standards set forth in the decisions

of the United States Supreme Court of January 22, 1973. Without

in any way restricting the right of privacy of a woman or the

right of a woman to an abortion under those decisions, the

General Assembly of the State of Illinois do solemnly declare

and find in reaffirmation of the longstanding policy of this

State, that the unborn child is a human being from the time of

conception and is, therefore, a legal person for purposes of

the unborn child's right to life and is entitled to the right

to life from conception under the laws and Constitution of this

State. Further, the General Assembly finds and declares that

longstanding policy of this State to protect the right to life

of the unborn child from conception by prohibiting abortion

unless necessary to preserve the life of the mother is

impermissible only because of the decisions of the United

States Supreme Court and that, therefore, if those decisions of

the United States Supreme Court are ever reversed or modified

or the United States Constitution is amended to allow

protection of the unborn then the former policy of this State

to prohibit abortions unless necessary for the preservation of

the mother's life shall be reinstated.

It is the further intention of the General Assembly to

assure and protect the woman's health and the integrity of the

woman's decision whether or not to continue to bear a child, to

protect the valid and compelling state interest in the infant
