MPI Estimates of Unauthorized Populations That Could Benefit under Different DREAM Legalization Bills
The DACA Program and its Recipients

In June 2012, the Obama administration launched the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that provides a temporary reprieve from deportation to qualified unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States as children. The research here offers a detailed demographic portrait of this population. And this innovative data tool includes estimates of the populations potentially eligible for deferred action at U.S., state, and top county levels, comparing them against actual application rates.
