Clinton Foundation in Haiti
More About the Clinton Foundation in Haiti

The Clinton Foundation has been actively engaged in Haiti since 2009, focusing on economic diversification, private sector investment, and job creation in order to create long-term, sustainable economic development. After the 2010 earthquake, President Clinton formed the Clinton Foundation Haiti Fund and raised $16.4 million from individual donors for immediate relief efforts. Since 2010, the Clinton Foundation has raised more than $30 million for Haiti, including relief funds as well as funds for projects focused on restoring Haitiâ€™s communities, sustainable development, education, and capacity building. Today, the Clinton Foundation focuses on creating sustainable economic growth in the five priority sectors: agriculture, energy, environment, tourism, and artisans/manufacturing. The Foundation also works to develop full-cycle investing, bringing together producers, investors, and markets in a way that is socially, environmentally and economically impactful. The Haiti team has helped facilitate more than $120 million in foreign direct investment into Haiti, and has continued to provide capacity building and access to markets for Haitian businesses. The full cycle investing model that launched in late 2012 has continued to develop, and companies in the agricultural, artisan, and environmental sectors, such as Belzeb and Papillon Enterprise, are all benefiting and demonstrating positive results.
