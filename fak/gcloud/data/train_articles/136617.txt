Kroger's explanation of unisex bathroom goes viral
ATHENS, GA - A sign on the door of a unisex restroom at an Athens Kroger store was posted on social media this week, which has since gone viral.

The sign says the unisex facility is in place "because sometimes gender specific toilets put others into uncomfortable situations."

The sign went on to note that it is in place for "Dads with daughters, Moms with sons, Parents with disabled children, Those in the LGBTQ, Adults with aging parents who may be mentally or physically disabled."

The Facebook post by Tonya Owens Saturday on Kroger's page showed the sign with the caption that said simply "Nice job Kroger.
