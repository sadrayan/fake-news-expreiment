BREAKING: First NFL Team Declares Bankruptcy Over Kneeling Thugs
The Jacksonville Jaguars are quietly maneuvering behind the scenes to file a Chapter 11 reorganization of debt bankruptcy in the 3rd District Court of Atlanta next week. The team, already in a market saturated with Dolphins, Bucs and Falcons fans, made the unfortunate mistake of drafting developing and hiring almost exclusively black players, leaving them vulnerable to the latest round of “we’ve been treated unfairly” protests from millionaires.

This particular protest, unfortunately, happened on national TV and pissed off every God-fearing, country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag.

last week, 31 of the 42 men on the Jacksonville roster took a knee during the national anthem. The coaches just stopped paying attention and went on with their game planning while the few patriots who braved the picket lines to make sure someone was there to respect the flag and our veterans stood and sang the song with pride.

Jacksonville is a dead stick. It’s been obvious for several years now that an expansion franchise there was a bad idea. The front office isn’t responding to comment but an insider tells us that the reorganization will allow the team to stay above water while they pitch a move to the now-empty St. Louis market.

What they don’t understand is that their market isn’t the main problem. They could survive as another Cardinals or expansion Browns team if they didn’t have the issue with the players. Our insider tells us that’s being taken care of as well. The selling power of the team is the organization and equipment. Salaries won’t be covered in the bankruptcy. After this season as many as 24 players will be on their own.

Karma. It’s a wonderful thing.
