Celebrity Weight Loss: Melissa McCarthy Shows Off Slimmer Body
Standards of celebrity weight loss can sometimes seem unrealistic—stars swear by restricting diets, new moms are pressured to drop weight just months (or weeks!) after having a baby. That's why we loved seeing actress Melissa McCarthy—who's risen to Hollywood’s A-list in spite of the industry's "skinny standard"—step out showing off a more realistic vision of weight loss, with a new slimmed-down figure. The star looked confident and healthy at a fundraiser yesterday for P.S. ARTS, an organization that supports arts education in underserved public schools and communities in Santa Monica, CA.

McCarthy has reportedly lost 45 pounds by following a high protein and low-carb diet. But is she finally folding to Hollywood’s image of thin? No way! A source told reporters that McCarthy wants to set a good example and stay healthy for her kids, and to live longer. We like this kind of smart perspective on a woman's body, her health, and her weight. But we especially love how happy she looks—and we're betting she loves it, too!
