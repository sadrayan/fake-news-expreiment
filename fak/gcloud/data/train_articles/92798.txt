PAC launches to push solar power amendment

A political action committee that launched Wednesday is banking on support from a diverse array of groups as it fights against Florida's utility companies.

The PAC, Floridians for Solar Choice, hopes to pass a constitutional amendment in 2016 that would allow people and businesses to buy and sell solar power to one another without going through utility companies.

Passing the amendment would introduce competition to the energy market and boost renewable energy usage in Florida, said PAC Chairman Tory Perfetti and leaders of other supporting groups.

Taking on the utility companies will likely prove expensive. Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, estimated that it could cost Floridians for Solar Choice around $10 million to pass the amendment.

Utility companies are already heavily invested in politics. In the 2014 election, the state's largest power company, Florida Power and Light, made more than $7.5 million in contributions to candidates, parties and PACs.

But Floridians for Solar Choice has brought together groups that rarely -- if ever -- align, including clean energy activists, the Christian Coalition of America and the Libertarian Party.

"It is long overdue that we all come together," Smith said. "And how rare is it that we can come together on an issue that people do not have to get rid of their convictions, where people can come with their convictions?"
