Transgender State Lawmaker Resigns Because Of Crimes Committed While She Was A Man
A state representative in New Hampshire who made history for being the legislature's first transgender lawmaker has resigned after crimes from her past life came to light.

Rep. Stacie Laughton resigned her seat Thursday after it was revealed she had several felony convictions while she was still Barry Charles Laughton, Jr., The Nashua Telegraph reported Friday.

“I am deeply saddened that it had to come to this,” Laughton said, adding she "would’ve made a brilliant state representative."

Laughton was sentenced in 2008 to seven and a half to 15 years for conspiracy to commit credit card fraud and three and a half to seven years for falsifying physical evidence, according to The Telegraph.

However, it's unclear whether Laughton's conviction actually barred her from running for office.

New Hampshire prohibits convicted felons from holding office until their final discharge from prison, but the definition of final discharge is still unclear.

When Laughton ran for office, she was still serving "suspended" sentences for the crimes, meaning she was essentially on probation.

The attorney general's office is still investigating the case and expects to release a letter of opinion by early next week, according to the Telegraph.

But even if it's found she didn't break the law, Laughton doesn't believe she'll fight to regain her seat.

"Given the climate of how this has taken on a life of its own, if it’s found that I am legally eligible to serve, I don’t believe over the next two years I could get anything done," she said, according to The Telegraph.
