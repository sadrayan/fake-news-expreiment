Rosie O’Donnell: “I’d Like To Take My Period Blood And Smear It All Over Christians’ Faces”
Trump was being specific, not misogynist. She’s a pig.



Excerpted from Life News: Today, comedian Rosie O’Donnell said “women’s rights“ are under attack in America and that politicians are undoing all the advances abortion activists have made. The Hill reports that O’Donnell told Jenny Hutt on SiriusXM’s radio program that she believes there is a war on women. She said, “Bigger than any specific people, there is a war on women that is happening in this country. Women fought for equality in this country, and right now, politically, it’s being taken away from us.”

Then, unbelievably, O’Donnell said she would like to do this to pro-lifers: “I’d like to take my period blood I no longer have and write, ‘you’re all assh—s.’ I’d like to smear it all over some people’s faces.”

Additionally, during the interview with Hutt, she said that London Marathoner Kiran Ganhi’s decision to run without a tampon while menstruating is a critical demonstration for women’s rights.

Although O’Donnell didn’t mention the Planned Parenthood scandal specifically, it is likely she is referring to pro-life Senate Republicans who tried to defund the abortion company in light of videos showing their top executives haggling over the price of aborted babies’ body parts. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats defeated the legislation even though the videos expose Planned Parenthood’s complete disregard for human life and countless potential violations of federal law.
