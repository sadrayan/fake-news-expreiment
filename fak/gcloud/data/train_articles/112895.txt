Meghan McCain To Join Fox News Channel As Contributor – Variety
Meghan McCain, the political scion who has won public fame as a blogger, commentator and TV-show host, will join Fox News Channel as a contributor, Variety has learned.

A representative for the network confirmed the hire. McCain is expected to contribute to the network’s primetime and daytime programming.

McCain, the oldest daughter of U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), joins as Fox News Channel, like other news outlets, heads into a frenzied pre-season for the 2016 election for U.S. president. Already, more than a dozen different candidates for the Republican nomination have thrown their hat into the ring.

Meghan McCain, who has identified as a Republican in the past, could well offer the viewpoint of a different member of that political party: one hailing from the millennial generation. She has in the past championed gay rights and come out against anti-immigration legislation, and has publicly challenged commentators like Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham. In her writings she’s expressed ambivalence about Sarah Palin, the former Fox News contributor who ran for U.S. vice president alongside her father, and admiration for Hillary Clinton, who is now vying for the Democratic nomination for U.S. president.

McCain most recently was a host for “TakePart Live,” a talk show on cable’s Pivot network that urged viewers to get involved with various social causes. She was also the focus of “Raising McCain,” a Pivot talk show that took her on the road. Both were cancelled.

McCain has written a campaign memoir, “Dirty Sexy Politics,” as well as “America, You Sexy Bitch: A Love Letter to Freedom,” a collaboration with comedian Michael Ian Black. She has also contributed to the Daily Beast and interned at Newsweek magazine. She earned her bachelor’s degree from Columbia University.
