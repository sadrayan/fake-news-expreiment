Pittsburgh Steelers: William Gay fined by NFL for purple cleats
Pittsburgh Steelers safety William Gay has been fined $5,787 for wearing purple cleats in Week 7 in honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, reports NFL.com’s Aditi Kinkhabwala.

Gay’s mother was killed in an act of domestic violence. He was fined because the purple cleats violate the NFL’s uniform code.

Gay is the third Steelers player to run into conflict with the NFL’s uniform policies this season. Running back DeAngelo Williams was told he could not wear pink after October to honor breast cancer victims such as his mother and aunts, while defensive lineman Cameron Heyward was fined for writing messages on his eye black to honor his late father, who died of cancer.

Williams was also fined $5,787 for printing “We will find a cure” and the breast cancer ribbon on his eye black during October.

According to Gay’s agent Jerrold Colton, Gay appeared in a public service announcement shown during NFL games raising awareness for domestic violence. Gay now plans to ask the NFL to ease uniform restrictions for one weekend so players can support causes of their choice, reports Kikhabwala.

William Gay very frankly told me: "I broke the rule." Said he hopes the NFL will send his entire fine to a domestic violence cause. — Aditi Kinkhabwala (@AKinkhabwala) October 28, 2015

Those purple cleats William Gay has been wearing, btw? They're official Vikings cleats. But b/c he plays for the Steelers, it's a violation — Aditi Kinkhabwala (@AKinkhabwala) October 28, 2015
