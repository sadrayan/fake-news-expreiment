OFCC Endorsing Taylor for Governor
Fellow pro-gun Ohioans,

The filing deadline for the May primary election is this week. Thus, we no longer have to worry about who is in which race. Now we can all focus on electing the most pro-gun candidates.

For governor, the choice between the two remaining candidates is simple. One is consistently pro-gun while the other is consistently anti-gun. Don't listen to their words, watch their actions. Votes, not voices, matter.

In action - it is all Mary Taylor. When she was in the statehouse she was an original co-sponsor of Ohio's original concealed handgun licensing bill HB12. The next session she co-sponsored statewide preemption; the very law that we used JUST LAST WEEK to beat back the anti-gun forces in Cleveland.

Meanwhile her opponent, Mike DeWine, has a horrible record on guns. He has been endorsed by the virulently anti-gun Brady Campaign in the past. While he may now claim to have "seen the light" on the gun issue we at OFCC firmly believe that this is the usual campaign trail lie.

Today, OFCC issued a press release endorsing the Taylor/Estruth ticket for Governor/Lt.Governor of Ohio in the May 2018 Republican primary.

Mark down Sunday April 29th on your calendars. That's when we'll be holding our annual Fun & Gun event! The Fun & Gun is our big annual fund raiser, and the money raised helps OFCC continue to fight for your rights. Details are in the registration link here:
