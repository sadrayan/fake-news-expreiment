YPO Global Pulse
The YPO Global Pulse focuses on gathering insights from chief executives around the world on the topics that influence businesses and drive leadership decisions.

YPO is an independent organization with no inherent bias or issue-advocacy agenda. Our Global Pulse survey is statistically relevant across the globe and not focused on a single country, industry or type of business. Because we do not focus on just the largest companies, our survey of chief executives provides perspectives across a wider portion of the global economy.

The 2019 YPO Global Pulse focuses on whatâ€™s on the minds of chief executives around the world when asked about innovation and how it impacts their business.
