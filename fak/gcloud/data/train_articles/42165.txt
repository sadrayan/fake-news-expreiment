Concerned Veterans for America, a group underwritten by billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch, said Tuesday it will be out with two ads attacking Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin over past problems at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

The ads feature Mark Fink, who is identified as a patient and former nurse at the facility, and his wife, Jean. The ads accuse Baldwin of sitting on a key report about the facility, which was dubbed Candyland because of easy access to opioids.

The group said it will spend $1.6 million airing the 30-second TV spots.

After the death of a Marine veteran at the Tomah facility, Baldwin came under fire when it came to light that her aides sat on an inspection report showing hospital officials were prescribing high amounts of opiate pain pills to patients. A whistle-blower also raised the issue with Baldwinâ€™s staff without success.

Baldwin later acknowledged that her office mishandled the issue, prompting her to fire one staffer, demote another and cut the pay for her chief of staff.

Since then, Baldwin co-sponsored legislation, named after deceased Marine veteran Jason Simcakoski, that toughened opioid prescription guidelines and pushes education for VA providers.

Outside groups have already spent several million dollars in ads against Baldwin, who faces re-election.

Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield are running for the GOP nomination.
