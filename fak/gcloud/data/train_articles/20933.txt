Las Vegas, NV — On Monday, January 15, at 9:30AM PT, Congresswoman Jacky Rosen, State Senator Yvanna Cancela, and Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui will participate in a press conference on the TrumpTax’s disastrous effects on working Nevada families. The event is the latest stop on the nationwide ‘Repeal the TrumpTax‘ Tour to demand the repeal of the recently passed Republican tax breaks for the ultra wealthy and wealthy corporations at the expense of working families.

The Tax Policy Center found that more than half of American households – 100 million of them – will pay more in taxes, while the richest 0.1 percent will get a nearly $150,000 tax break with the TrumpTax. Millions will see a 10 percent increase in health insurance premiums and seniors will pay more from forced cuts to Medicare.

After Monday’s event, the 100-day tour will continue hosting events around the country, featuring senators, congressional representatives, local elected officials, and people affected by the law. The tour will next travel to Reno, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.
