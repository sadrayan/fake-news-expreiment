Voter ID law opponents ask U.S. Supreme Court to hear case
Opponents of Wisconsin's requirement that voters show photo ID asked the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday to hear their case and strike down the law.

In September, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago upheld the voter ID law. But the measure was put on hold the following month by a divided Supreme Court out of concerns that there was not enough time to implement it before the November elections.

"Throughout years of litigation, Wisconsin has failed to identify a single instance of the type of fraud this law purportedly seeks to prevent. At the same time, it is absolutely clear this law would prevent thousands of voters from exercising the most fundamental right in our democracy," said Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Supporters of the law say it's a common-sense way to ensure voters' confidence in the outcome of elections.

U.S. Supreme Court observers have expected the justices to take up the issue of voter ID at some point. The filing by the ACLU ruling sets up the possibility that it will be Wisconsin's law they decide to review.|Wisconsin's voter ID law was in place for one election — a low turnout primary in February 2012 — before it was blocked by a series of lower court orders in four cases. Two of the legal challenges were in state court and two in federal court.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the voter ID law this summer in the two state cases, but modified how the state Division of Motor Vehicles handles ID requests from people who don't have birth certificates. The law remained blocked at that time because of the federal litigation, however.
