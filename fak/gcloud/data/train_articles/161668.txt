Americaâ€™s reddest and bluest places
When 2015 rolls around and all the lame ducks have waddled off to K Street, more than 180 of our 435 House districts will have something in common. Their representatives, both of their senators and their governors will all be from the same party.

That's fewer than half of the House districts, yes, but it's more than half of the actual continental United States. How it's distributed, though, is interesting.

So we're assuming, on this map, that Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) loses her reelection bid (because, you know) and that Republicans will win the two House races in Louisiana that are going to runoffs on Saturday. We also gave the still-undecided race in Arizona to Martha McSally (R). Giving us:

The places that are solid blue mostly hug the coasts (or, in the case of one of the Democrats' 100 percent blue states, are floating out in the Pacific Ocean). Minnesota is the notable exception, as are a few inland districts in blue states -- like the one in New York that almost flipped last month.

Republicans control Dixie, almost entirely. We talked about the Deep South earlier this week, but Republican control of the rest of the old Confederacy is overwhelming, too. The isolated pockets that have non-single-party representation are usually around cities; Dallas can be seen from space.

A slew of states are entirely red, including Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. Democrats have Hawaii, as well as Connecticut and Rhode Island.

This doesn't include state-level representation outside the governorship, of course, but it's still remarkable. For people in the blue parts of the map, their decision-makers in Congress and in executive positions at the national and state levels all share their political ideology, to a person.
