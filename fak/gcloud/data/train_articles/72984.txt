Birth-18 Years Immunization Schedule
Administer recommended vaccines if immunization history is incomplete or unknown. Do not restart or add doses to vaccine series for extended intervals between doses. When a vaccine is not administered at the recommended age, administer at a subsequent visit. The use of trade names is for identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the ACIP or CDC.

Notes

Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule for ages 18 years or younger, United States, 2019

For vaccine recommendations for persons 19 years of age and older, see the Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule.

Additional information

Consult relevant ACIP statements for detailed recommendations.

For information on contraindications and precautions for the use of a vaccine, consult the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization and relevant ACIP statements.

For calculating intervals between doses, 4 weeks = 28 days. Intervals of ≥4 months are determined by calendar months.

Within a number range (e.g., 12–18), a dash (–) should be read as “through.”

Vaccine doses administered ≤4 days before the minimum age or interval are considered valid. Doses of any vaccine administered ≥5 days earlier than the minimum age or minimum interval should not be counted as valid and should be repeated as age-appropriate. The repeat dose should be spaced after the invalid dose by the recommended minimum interval. For further details, see Table 3-1, Recommended and minimum ages and intervals between vaccine doses, in General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization.
