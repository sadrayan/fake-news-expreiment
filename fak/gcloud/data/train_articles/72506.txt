Catholic League: For Religious and Civil Rights
HAGEE GOES OFF THE RAILS; McCAIN MUST ACT



March 4, 2008



Pastor John Hagee has amended his news release from yesterday. He now has a new paragraph, part of which reads as follows: Ive learned that some have accused me of referring to the Catholic Church as the great whore, of Revelations. This is a serious misinterpretation of my words. When I refer to the great whore, I am referring to the apostate church, namely those Christians who embrace the false cult system of Jew-hatred and anti-Semitism. He says this would include some Protestants as well as Catholics. Catholic League president Bill Donohue wasnt buying it: Anti-Catholic Protestants have long labeled the Catholic Church The Great Whore, and no amount of spin can change that reality. No one who knows anything about the term would suggest otherwise. Indeed, the Catholic League has a whole library of anti-Catholic books wherein such demonizing language is used. Moreover, just go to Yahoo and type in The Great Whore and here is what you get. The first site, thegreatwhore.com, not only identifies the Catholic Church with The Great Whore, it has pictures of Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II as presiding over the City of Rome wherein The Great Whore lives. Site number two is wikipedia, and it correctly says that Most Reformation writers and all Reformers themselves, from Martin Luther John Calvin, and John Knox identify the Roman Catholic Church with the Whore of Babylon. The third site is jesus-is-savior.com, and it has a picture of Our Blessed Mother, with the inscription, Mary (the mother of Jesus) is not the great whore; Catholicisms Mother Mary (the Catholic religion) is the Great Whore! [My italics.] John McCain is not an anti-Catholic, but he has shown horrendous judgment in buddying up to this bigot and spin doctor. Maybe he didnt know this side of Hagee before, but he sure knows it now. Time for the Straight Talk Express to leave the station before Hagee goes off the rails again.
