Trump: My Private Club Shows No One’s ‘Done So Much For Equality As I Have’ (VIDEO)
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Tuesday that the fact his Mar-a-Lago resort is open to “everybody” proves his commitment to equality.

During an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he would “make a clear and unequivocal statement renouncing” support from white supremacists like former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke.

“Of course, I am, of course I am,” Trump said.

Taking it one step further, Trump then said his business acumen evidenced his commitment to equality.

“There’s nobody that’s done so much for equality as I have,” he said. “You take a look at Palm Beach, Florida. I built the Mar-a-Lago club, totally open to everybody. A club that, frankly, set a new standard in clubs and a new standard in Palm Beach and I’ve gotten great credit for it. That is totally open to everybody.”

Members to the Mar-a-Lago must pay a $100,000 initiation fee and annual fee of $14,000, according to the Washington Post.
