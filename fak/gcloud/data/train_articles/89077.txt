Putnam campaign rips opponent as a ‘lobbyist bottom feeder’
The law firm for Democrat Scott Maddox, the party’s leading contender for the state agriculture commissioner nomination, is one of two firms representing Panhandle fishermen and seafood restaurants in a lawsuit filed today in U.S. District Court in Pensacola against BP et al.

Maddox, like others, has turned the oil spill in a political issue. Maddox hopes to embarrass his probable Republican opponent, Adam Putnam, for supporting off-shore drilling. “He maintains his hubris even in the face of new proof that even rigs that are hundreds of miles away can threaten Florida’s beaches,” Maddox said.

Putnam’s campaign manager, Trey McCarley, used the lawsuit to shoot back today:

“When in doubt, sue. As a result of his multiple losing campaigns for 3 of Florida’s 4 available cabinet positions, Scott Maddox has confused job descriptions for the one he’s running for this time. While oil continues to pour out of the earth at a rate of 210,000 gallons per day, Scott Maddox runs to the courthouse to sue someone, anyone, in a desperate attempt to make money from misery. The job of the Commissioner of Agriculture is to solve problems, to reduce our dependency on countries who hate us with homegrown crops that fuel our cars and power our homes and businesses. Once again Scott proves he’s a lobbyist bottom feeder running for a job he knows little about and cares for even less.”
