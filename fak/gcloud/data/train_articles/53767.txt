The day after his victory in the Nevada caucuses, Donald Trump has nabbed his first congressional endorsements.

Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., got behind the Republican front-runner Wednesday morning. Shortly after, Politico reported that Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said he is lining up behind Trump.

"We don't need a policy wonk as president. We need a leader as president," Hunter said. "I'm in, and I've been in.”

Who are members of Congress backing? Collins endorsed Trump's "guts and fortitude."

"Donald Trump has clearly demonstrated that he has both the guts and the fortitude to return our nation’s jobs stolen by China, take on our enemies like ISIS, Iran, North Korea and Russia, and most importantly, reestablish the opportunity for our children and grandchildren to attain the American Dream," Collins said in a statement.

Collins is represents a district that includes suburbs of Buffalo. Trump has previously said "I'm like the most popular person that has ever lived," in the area.

Collins is a former supporter of Jeb Bush and the 19th wealthiest member of Congress, according to Roll Call's Wealth of Congress Index.
