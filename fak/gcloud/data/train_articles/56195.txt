Program Status
On December 19, 2014, Treasury announced that it had sold its remaining stake in Ally Financial, effectively ending the Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP). In total, Treasury invested approximately $80 billion in the automotive industry and recovered $70.4 billion, including the proceeds from the final sale of Ally Financial common shares. The final cost of the program is far less than anticipated when the program began. Moreover, the program succeeded in its goal of rescuing the American automotive industry and saving a million jobs. For the latest cost estimates, see the most recent Monthly Report to Congress or the TARP Tracker .

The Big Three automakers (GM, Chrysler, and Ford) have returned to profitability. An estimated one million jobs were saved by the assistance provided under TARP. This assistance made it possible for them to restructure and compete more effectively. As a result, since 2009 the auto industry has continued to rebound.

GM

On December 9, 2013, Treasury announced that it had fully exited its equity investment in GM following the sale of all of its remaining shares of GM common stock. In total, Treasury collected proceeds of $39 billion from all of its investments in GM through repayments, sales of stock, dividends, interest, and other income.

Treasury's Disposition of GM Common Stock

In November 2010, GM completed an initial public offering, which yielded $13.5 billion in net proceeds for Treasury and reduced its stake in GM to 500.1 million remaining shares of GM common stock. In December 2012, as part of its continuing efforts to wind down TARP, Treasury announced its intent to fully exit its remaining investment in GM within the following 12-15 months, subject to market conditions. As part of that announcement, GM agreed to purchase 200 million shares of GM common stock from Treasury at $27.50 per share â€“ a transaction that closed on December 21, 2012. In January 2013, Treasury began the process of selling its remaining 300.1 million shares through pre-arranged trading plans.

On April 11, 2013, Treasury completed its first pre-arranged trading plan for the sale of its GM common stock. Under this plan, Treasury sold 58.4 million shares of GM common stock for total gross proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion.

On June 6, 2013, Treasury commenced its second pre-arranged written trading plan and sold 30 million additional shares of GM common stock at $34.41 per share, in an underwritten public offering in conjunction with GM's inclusion in the S&P 500 index. The aggregate proceeds to Treasury from the sale were approximately $1.03 billion. The UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust (VEBA) also sold 20 million shares in the offering, making the total offering size 50 million shares. Aggregate proceeds to VEBA from the common stock offering were approximately $688 million.

On November 21, 2013 Treasury announced that the third pre-defined trading plan was complete with the sale of 70.2 million shares of GM common stock.

On December 9, 2013 Treasury completed the sale of all its remaining GM common stock thus exiting this investment.

Chrysler

In May 2011, Chrysler repaid its outstanding TARP loans six years ahead of schedule. More than $11.2 billion of the $12.5 billion committed to Chrysler has been returned to taxpayers through principal repayments, interest, and cancelled commitments. Treasury has exited its investment in Chrysler Group LLC (New Chrysler) and is unlikely to fully recover the difference of $1.3 billion owed by Old Chrysler.
