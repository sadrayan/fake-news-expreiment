Josh Keyes - The Hermit
The Hermit - is the 3rd sculpture by Josh Keyes from our Signature Series.

Have you ever wanted to look into an artists mind, see how they envisions the world? Well with the world famous creationist Josh Keyes you don't have too! His art truly speaks for his mind. Keyes art is interesting because he places his subjects in fictional situations in a way one is not used to. It is as if humans left Earth, leaving behind what was left of our existence, man made things. Very apocalyptic.

Original painting - 19"x24", acrylic on birch panel, 2012
