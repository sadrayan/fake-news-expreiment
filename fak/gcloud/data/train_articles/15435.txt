Hello again.

I write because the PGA commissioner, Tim Finchem, said Sunday: “Austin’s the fastest-growing city in the country the last five years.”

Thanks.

The new data that just came out is county and metro. We’d be the fastest growing among the top 100 metros between 2010 and 2015. But among all metros, Midland, TX, Odessa, TX, and The Villages, FL grew faster.

If you’re fact checking cities, the latest Census Bureau data is still through 2014. Among the top 100 metros, Irvine, CA grew faster than Austin between 2010 and 2014. But if you ranked the 50 largest cities, Austin would be fastest.

Here’s the Census table with April 2010 to July 2015 growth calculated and ranked (all and top 100). When I replied before, I was quoting from my ranking of Jul 2010 to Jul 2015 growth. But the Census Bureau’s custom with these annual estimates releases is to calculate the last 12 months and the growth from the last Census, so that’s what I ranked on in the attached. So, that makes Austin third behind The Villages and Midland.
