Organizational Priorities

Organizational Priorities Priority 1 Type Program(s) Maintain readiness and successfully deliver the 42nd general election in 2015 New Electoral Operations

Regulation of Electoral Activities

Electoral Engagement

Internal Services Description Delivering elections is at the core of Elections Canada’s mandate. The 42nd general election is scheduled to take place on October 19, 2015. Elections Canada achieved election readiness by March 1, 2015. The agency has largely implemented amendments to the Canada Elections Act and completed the vast majority of its three-year plan of administrative changes aimed at improving services to electors. Deploying resources for conducting and wrapping up the general election will be the agency's sole priority in 20152016. Elections Canada’s efforts in delivering the next general election are guided by the following objectives: strengthen Canadians' confidence in the reliability of election results and the agency's administration and regulation of the event

enhance the electoral experience of electors and political entities within the parameters of the Canada Elections Act

administer and regulate an increasingly complex electoral event in a transparent and effective manner Over the reporting period, progressive deployment activities will consist of: hiring and training additional personnel required for the conduct of the election

staging field material and equipment

setting up call centres

conducting pre-election advertising for voter registration

printing manuals and various geographical products

provisioning technology to field offices Once the writs are issued, the main delivery activities will entail: informing Canadians on when, where and the different ways to register and vote

registering electors and preparing the preliminary lists of electors

supporting political entities and keeping them informed

opening 338 local offices and 240 additional points of service

receiving, assessing and confirming candidate nominations

hiring, assessing and training election workers

conducting targeted revision

delivering voter information cards to some 25 million electors

opening over 70,000 polling stations in approximately 20,000 polling sites

counting the votes and reporting results to headquarters and to the media consortium Close-out activities following the general election will include: validating election results

participating in judicial recounts as required

evaluating and reporting on the conduct of the election and internal programs

releasing an audit report on the performance of poll workers

auditing political entities' financial returns and reimbursing election expenses of eligible political parties and candidates

Risk Analysis

Key Analysis Risk Risk Response Strategy Link to PAA General election called before October 19, 2015 The 42nd general election is scheduled for October 19, 2015, but a general election could be called at an earlier date. To mitigate this risk, Elections Canada achieved election readiness by March 1. It will continue to monitor its operating environment and begin deploying event delivery resources when and if required. Electoral Operations

Regulation of Electoral Activities

Electoral Engagement

Internal Services Insufficient time to fully implement changes in Bill C-50 within the proposed 60 days for its coming into force Bill C-50, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act , was introduced on December 10, 2014, and remains before Parliament. While every effort will be made to implement this bill, 60 days following royal assent is insufficient time for the agency to fully implement the changes. As and when required, the agency will determine how it can proceed to implement the bill and inform parliamentarians. Electoral Operations

Regulation of Electoral Activities

Electoral Engagement

Internal Services Electoral event delivery impacted by a compromise of information and communications technology systems or services Information and communications technology systems and services have a significant role to play at all times, but especially during an election period and on election day. Numerous measures have been and will continue to be taken as part of an agency-wide mitigation plan, including risk and vulnerability assessments and contingency planning. Electoral Operations

Regulation of Electoral Activities

Electoral Engagement

Internal Services Non-compliance by poll workers with rules and procedures prescribed by the Canada Elections Act Voting processes and procedures are complex. To reduce the impact of this complexity, Elections Canada invested in a new election officer recruitment and training program. The agency also reviewed forms and processes with a view to making them more user-friendly. Finally, to help returning officers recruit competent staff, the agency is proceeding with a Treasury Board submission to increase the fees paid to poll workers and other local office staff.

*20152016 Main Estimates and Planned Spending are significantly higher than in previous years because of the 2015 general election.

**Forecast spending for the Electoral Operations program is higher in 20142015 as a result of the activities required to achieve operational readiness for the 2015 general election.

***The reduction in spending on the Regulation of Electoral Activities program from 20122013 to 20142015 primarily results from the phase-out of quarterly allowances to political parties, as set out in An Act to implement certain provisions of the 2011 budget as updated on June 6, 2011 and other measures. The increase in 20152016 results from the expected reimbursements that will be paid to eligible political parties and candidates for expenses in the 2015 general election.

****Internal Services spending for 20122013 and 20132014 includes one-time expenditures for the Office Consolidation and Relocation project. The project ended in 20132014.

Departmental Spending Trend

Departmental Spending Trend Graph – Text version

Forecast spending is higher in 20142015 as a result of the activities required to achieve operational readiness for the 42nd general election, which is to be held on October 19, 2015. The fall election also explains the significant increase in planned spending in 2015–16.

The reduction in spending between 2012–13 and 2017–18, two non-general election years, is largely explained by the phase-out of quarterly allowances to political parties and the completion of Elections Canada's office consolidation in Gatineau.

The reduction from 2016–17 to 2017–18 is explained by the expected completion of activities closing out the 42nd general election.

The reduction of planned spending in the Voted authority mainly results from transferring the Commissioner of Canada Elections to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada.

Elections Canada's Financial Framework

Elections Canada's unique dual funding mechanism and planning practices are a function of its mandate. The agency is funded in part by an annual appropriation that covers the salaries of its permanent staff and is not affected by the electoral cycle. Given the unpredictability of electoral events, the agency also has a statutory authority that allows it to draw directly from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

Under Canada's parliamentary system, general elections are scheduled to take place on fixed dates but can still be called in advance. This is particularly the case in a minority government situation. By-elections held to fill vacant seats in the House of Commons are also unpredictable.

As a result of these varying circumstances, Elections Canada does not include the incremental costs of election activities in its planned expenditures.

However, being in the third year of a majority government, the agency has included the estimated statutory funding requirements for the next general election in its planned spending. Related planned spending is also shown for 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18.

Planned spending related to the 2015 general election is an estimate based on detailed forecasts and assumptions. A number of factors can impact the planned spending. These include but are not limited to the following: the actual duration of the campaign (the Act sets a minimum of 36 days); the level of spending by political entities, which impacts reimbursements; adjustments to election worker fees and allowances; market forces for expenses such as the media buy, local office rents, furniture and equipment; outstanding procurement processes; and the actual level of staffing in the field to meet requirements.
