Clinton: McCain Has More Experience Than Obama
Hillary Clinton continued her heated attacks against frontrunner Obama, claiming that the likely Repubican nominee John McCain has more experience than the Illinois senator. Hillary told reporters yesterday:

"I think that I have a lifetime of experience that I will bring to the White House. I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience to the White House. And Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002."

Keith Olbermann was less than pleased with the attack that would surely return in a McCain-Obama general election, calling the statement, "unbelievable."
