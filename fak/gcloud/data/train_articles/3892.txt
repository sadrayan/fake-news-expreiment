BREAKING: Illegal Aliens In California Able To VOTE, New Bill Just Signed
Governor of California, Jerry Brown, recently signed Assembly Bill 1461, the New Motor Voter Act.

What does this mean exactly? It means those people with a driver’s license will automatically be registered to vote. In essence, this could result in Illegal aliens being allowed to vote, because illegal aliens are already allowed to obtain a driver’s license.

From Breitbart:

Brown and the California Democratic party know exactly what they are doing; as a Public Policy Institute survey showed, among unregistered adults, 49% lean toward the Democratic Party and 22% toward the Republican Party. Any bill permitting illegal immigrants to vote would cement the Democratic Party’s hold on California.

Oregon was ahead of California with this type of bill. Earlier this year, Oregon also signed the bill allowing driver’s license holders to be automatically registered to vote.

Not that California was ever in any real danger of letting Republicans take over the liberal state, but this single act will virtually guarantee the Republican party will never win the state in an election.

The real frightening part is if swing states and even states that are conservative follow suit in some weird twist of events.

Not only are illegal aliens population already used in calculating the number of electoral college votes each state gets, but this systematic change to the voting registration process could single handedly change the landscape of the country.
