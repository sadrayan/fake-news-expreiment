Oakland University
Grow Oakland is a new tool to connect donors with projects that inspire them.



Grow Oakland exists for crowdfunding projects that benefit the Oakland University community and mission.



Projects can be proposed by alumni, students, employees and friends of Oakland University. Personalized project sites allow them to share their passion for their project with others.



Some past projects include:

$5,000 for a hoop house at the Student Organic Farm

$10,000 for travel to a competition in England for the OU Brass Band

Over $11,000 for OU student organizations and club sports

OU has tools you can use to make the process easy and fun!



Oakland University staff work with project leaders to create a plan and a personalized crowdfunding page so project leaders can concentrate on spreading the word and running a successful campaign!
