CBS and CNN are both reporting that the full contents of the Mueller Report were anonymously posted online overnight.

It may have only been a matter of time for someone in Washington to leak the report. Using the online platform scribd.com, an anonymous source uploaded the full “Report from the Special Counsel Investigation into Russian Interference During and Before the 2016 Presidential Election.”

The document is very quickly being shared via social media.
