As you know, when it comes to allocations from the state budget there’s no distinction between state general revenue and federal aid or other sources of revenue. It’s all lumped together as revenue (All Funds) for the purposes of spending allocations. This point is reinforced by reporting from your paper (“Texas Legislature Adopts $209 Billion Budget”) and others (below).

And as you noted, he said “close to a third of the Texas government budget.” He did not say “close to a third of the Texas government’s appropriations,” or “close to a third of the Texas government’s general revenue.” He said the overall budget.

Thanks,

Drew

Subject: RE: Update

What was his source for the claim? Cornyn said in what looked like his scripted remarks that Medicaid accounted for “a third of all state spending.”

4:23 p.m.

The sources for the claim you told me a reader flagged and you’re checking (“close to a third of the Texas government budget.”) are the Texas LBB report you sent me plus the news accounts I provided. If you misspoke and are checking something different, please let me know.
