Will Donald Trump get an invite to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding?
When Meghan Markle weds Prince Harry she will be the first American to become a member of the Royal Family. The forming of such an historic transatlantic union would, on the face of it, be an apposite occasion for the US President to attend.

Kensington Palace said today the guest list is in the early stages of being compiled and that the Prince and Miss Markle would have the primary input.

Yet a former senior UK diplomatic source told the Telegraph he would be “surprised” if President Trump received an invitation for the royal wedding in May.

There are a number of stumbling blocks to Mr Trump receiving an invite, not least Miss Markle’s own public views about the President and the potential controversy he could bring to the happy occasion.

Presidential precedent

There is precedent for US presidents not attending royal weddings. When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married in 2011 many heads of state attended, but the majority were from Commonwealth and European nations.
