Sen. Nelson supports deal with Iran; Sen. Rubio bashes it
Reaction to the deal on Iran's nuclear capabilities brought a stark range of opinion from Florida's Senators

Sen. Bill Nelson: “It is a choice between a pause or imminent war. I choose a verifiable pause.”

Sen Marco Rubio: "This agreement makes a nuclear Iran more, not less, likely. Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a "rabid dog" and accusing the United States of war crimes. Yet today the President is asking us to accept the pledges of a regime that still refuses to end it support for terrorism and admit the illicit nature of its past nuclear work. Despite assertions to the contrary, this agreement will not "freeze" Iran's nuclear program. Iran will not be required to suspend all enrichment as required by multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and will retain a sizable nuclear infrastructure.



This agreement is also a blow to our allies in the region who are already concerned about America's commitment to their security and it sends the wrong message to the Iranian people, who continue to suffer under the repressive rule of their leaders who have only their own self-preservation in mind. In sum, this agreement shows other rogues that wish to go nuclear that you can obfuscate, cheat, and lie for a decade and eventually the United States will tire and drop key demands. Iran will likely use this agreement and any that follows that does not require real Iranian concessions to obtain a nuclear weapons capability.



I intend to work with my colleagues in the Senate to increase sanctions until Iran completely abandons its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities."
