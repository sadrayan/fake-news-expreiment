Frequently Asked Questions
What is apportionment? back to top

Apportionment is the process of dividing the 435 memberships, or seats, in the U.S. House of Representatives among the 50 states.



Who is included in the apportionment population counts? back to top

The apportionment calculation is based upon the total resident population (citizens and non-citizens) of the 50 states. In the 2010 Census, the apportionment population also includes U.S. Armed Forces personnel and federal civilian employees stationed outside the United States (and their dependents living with them) that can be allocated, based on administrative records, back to a home state. This is the same procedure used in 2000.



Do the apportionment population counts include Americans overseas? back to top

Yes, the apportionment counts include those overseas federal employees (military and civilian) and their dependents living with them that can be allocated back to a home state. Included in these counts are members of the U.S. Armed Forces on military vessels assigned to a home port in a foreign country and their dependents overseas living in port near them. Private U.S. citizens living abroad, who are not employed by the Federal government are not included in the overseas counts for apportionment.



What is the source of the overseas population counts? back to top

Overseas counts by home state were provided by the employing federal departments and agencies from their administrative records.



Are the overseas population counts used for redistricting? back to top

No, the overseas counts are used solely for reapportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The home state data for the overseas population do not meet the substate geographical precision required to conduct redistricting (i.e., blocks).



Which overseas groups were assigned to a home state for purposes of apportionment? back to top

Home state could be allocated for overseas U.S. Armed Forces and their dependents living with them and most overseas federal civilian employees and their associated dependents, except those overseas civilian employees and dependents of the Department of Defense (DOD).

On what basis are the components of the apportionment population counted? back to top

This is the place where they live and sleep most of the time (most of the week, month, or year). The other component of the apportionment population, overseas federal employees (military and civilian) and their dependents, is allocated back to the home state they report. These data are provided to the Census Bureau by the employing federal departments and agencies from their administrative records.
