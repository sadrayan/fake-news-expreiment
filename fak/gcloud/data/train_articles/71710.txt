For release 10:00 a.m. (EST) Thursday, February 28, 2019 USDL-19-0327 Technical information: (202) 691-6392 * lausinfo@bls.gov * www.bls.gov/lau Media contact: (202) 691-5902 * PressOffice@bls.gov REGIONAL AND STATE UNEMPLOYMENT -- 2018 ANNUAL AVERAGES In 2018, annual average unemployment rates decreased in 25 states, increased in 1 state, and were little changed or unchanged in 24 states and the District of Columbia, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Employment-population ratios increased in 9 states, decreased in 1 state, and were little changed or unchanged in 40 states and the District. The U.S. jobless rate declined by 0.5 percentage point from the prior year to 3.9 percent, and the national employment-population ratio rose by 0.3 point to 60.4 percent. Regional Unemployment All four census regions had unemployment rate decreases from 2017: the Northeast and South (-0.5 percentage point each), Midwest (-0.4 point), and West (-0.3 point). The Midwest had the lowest jobless rate, 3.7 percent in 2018, while the West had the highest rate, 4.2 percent. No other region had a rate significantly different from that of the United States. In 2018, the unemployment rates in the South (3.8 percent) and West (4.2 percent) were the lowest in their respective series. All region, division, and state series begin in 1976. (See table 1.) Eight of the 9 geographic divisions had over-the-year unemployment rate changes in 2018, all of which were decreases. The largest of these declines occurred in the South Atlantic (-0.6 percentage point). The lowest jobless rate was in the West North Central, 3.0 percent, followed by the New England and South Atlantic divisions, 3.5 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively. The highest rates were in the Middle Atlantic and Pacific, 4.2 percent each. The remaining four divisions had rates that were not significantly different from that of the United States. Three divisions recorded new series-low unemployment rates in 2018: the East South Central (4.0 percent), Pacific (4.2 percent), and West South Central (3.9 percent). State Unemployment Twenty-five states had statistically significant unemployment rate decreases in 2018, the largest of which occurred in New Mexico (-1.0 percentage point). Colorado had the only over-the-year rate increase (+0.6 percentage point). The remaining 24 states and the District of Columbia had annual average jobless rates in 2018 that were not appreciably different from those of the previous year, though some had changes that were at least as large numerically as the significant changes. (See table A.) Hawaii had the lowest unemployment rate in 2018, 2.4 percent, followed by Iowa and New Hampshire, 2.5 percent each. Alaska had the highest jobless rate, 6.6 percent. Overall, 20 states had unemployment rates significantly lower than the U.S. figure of 3.9 percent, 12 states and the District of Columbia had higher rates, and 18 states had rates that were not substantially different from that of the nation. Fourteen states newly recorded the lowest annual average unemployment rates in their respective series in 2018: Alabama (3.9 percent), California (4.2 percent), Idaho (2.8 percent), Iowa (2.5 percent), Mississippi (4.8 percent), Missouri (3.2 percent), New York (4.1 percent), North Dakota (2.6 percent), South Carolina (3.4 percent), Tennessee (3.5 percent), Texas (3.9 percent), Vermont (2.7 percent), Washington (4.5 percent), and Wisconsin (3.0 percent). (See table B.) Regional Employment-Population Ratios In 2018, three census regions had statistically significant changes in their employment-population ratios--the proportion of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years of age and over who are employed-- all of which were increases. These increases occurred in the Northeast (+0.5 percentage point), West (+0.4 point), and South (+0.3 point). The Midwest had the highest ratio, 62.5 percent, while the South, at 59.2 percent, had the lowest. These two regions had the only ratios that were notably different from the national figure of 60.4 percent. (See table 2.) Four of the 9 geographic divisions had increases in their employment- population ratios from 2017 to 2018. The largest of these increases was in New England (+1.0 percentage point), followed by the Mountain (+0.5 point) and Pacific and West South Central (+0.4 point each). The remaining five divisions had little or no change in their ratios over the year. The division with the highest employment-population ratio in 2018 was the West North Central, 65.3 percent, followed by New England, 64.4 percent. These two divisions, along with the Mountain and East North Central, at 61.7 percent and 61.2 percent, respectively, had employment-population ratios significantly above that of the United States. The East South Central had the lowest proportion of employed persons, 56.4 percent. This division, along with the Middle Atlantic and South Atlantic, at 59.2 percent and 59.3 percent, respectively, had ratios appreciably below the national average of 60.4 percent. State Employment-Population Ratios In 2018, the largest employment-population ratio increase among the states occurred in Massachusetts (+1.6 percentage points). Eight other states also had significant increases in their ratios. North Dakota was the only state with an over-the-year decrease in its employment- population ratio (-1.2 percentage points). The remaining 40 states and the District of Columbia had ratios that were not notably different from those of the previous year, though some had changes that were at least as large numerically as the significant changes. (See table C.) Minnesota had the highest proportion of employed persons in 2018, 67.8 percent, followed by North Dakota and Nebraska, 67.7 percent and 67.3 percent, respectively. West Virginia had the lowest employment-population ratio among the states, 51.0 percent. (West Virginia has had the lowest ratio each year since the series began in 1976.) Overall, 22 states and the District of Columbia had employment-population ratios significantly higher than the U.S. ratio of 60.4 percent and 17 states had ratios that were appreciably below it. Alaska and Wyoming each had the lowest employment-population ratios in their series (60.9 percent and 62.1 percent, respectively).
