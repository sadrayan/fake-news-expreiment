Gardner:

Below is the transcript of what Mr. Jones said.

He was answering a question (in bold below) regarding a specific relationship between CTE and playing football...not the relationship between football and traumatic brain injury as was stated in the story you quoted in your inquiry.

No data in your mind, to have a relationship between CTE and playing football?

No, that's absurd. There's no data that in any way creates knowledge. There's no way that you can have made a comment that there's an association or some type of assertion. In most things, you have to make it up by studies...

We are very supportive of research, continuing for years being involved to make it safer as it pertains to head injuries and we have millions who have played this game and he have millions of people are at various ages right now that have no issues at all. So that's where we are. It didn't alter at all what we're doing about it. We're doing everything we can to understand it and make it safer.

Thanks. Can you provide a full transcript of this event? Was it a press conference or something else?

Also, how did Jones reach his conclusion about there being no data establishing a relationship between CTE and playing football?

It took place at the NFL owners meeting in Florida.

I do not have a full transcript. His comments were made to a few reporters at the meetings.

That's all I know.

He made his comments to reporters at the NFL owners meeting in Florida and I don't think there will be any follow up.
