Meanwhile, In England, Drunk Man Suffers From Frostbite After Trying To Have Sex With A Snowman
So this happened in England. A drunken man was trying to have sex with a snowman. Kenneth Guillespie, 64, was found with trousers down and in apparently in a great deal of pain after he drunkenly defiled a snowman, according to bustedinacadiana.com.

Just so you know, this story gets worse-much worse.

The snowman was obviously ruined, as was the innocence of the children who erected the thing (poor choice of words, we know). The community is understandably raging mad over the incident (again, another poor choice of words).

But the perhaps the biggest victim in this all–who along with the snowman is the only other casualty in this whole fiasco–is little Kenneth, if you catch our drift, who is now suffering from frostbite. And by the way, being that it was a snowman, as in biting cold, little Kenneth must have been extremely little Kenneth, if you know what we mean.
