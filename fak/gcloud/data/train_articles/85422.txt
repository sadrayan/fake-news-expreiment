Las Vegas Shooting Exposed as Antifa-led False Flag Attack

Devastating massacre organized by Antifa to create civil war

With over 50 people killed and hundreds more injured, evidence begins to emerge that the horrific shooting attack in Las Vegas today was actually a false flag orchestrated by violent leftist group Antifa in a bid to incite a civil war in the United States.

With the number of people killed currently standing at 58 and another 515 injured, when a gunman, or gunmen, opened fire on a crowd at a music festival from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, the attack has been classed as the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history.

One witness described "non-stop gunfire" that sent more than 22,000 country music fans scrambling for their lives.

Police raided a room believed to be used by a gunman where they found a combination of rifles and handguns at the scene and a suspect who had killed himself before police arrived.

A source working closely with the investigation said there were 19 weapons in the room.

The dead suspect has been identified as Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas.

Authorities searched his home Monday and found weapons and ammunition, but Mesquite police spokesman Quinn Averett did not give details.

According to US President Donald Trump, the FBI has uncovered evidence that Paddock has strong ties with Democrats and George Soros-funded "anti-fascist" group Antifa.
