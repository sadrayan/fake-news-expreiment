Selective Concern & Outrage
I am sure some of you might not find this amusing as I do, but sometimes the truth isn’t amusing. This was sent to me me earlier today and while I did not fact check it, there really is no need to as the point is easy to understand.

During a recent press conference, a reporter with MSNBC hollered from the press corps, “Where is President Trump hiding his tax returns?

Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, astutely responded, “We’ve found a very secure place that I’m certain won’t be discovered.”

“And just where is that?,” said the reporter, sarcastically.

Mr. Spicer grinned sardonically and said, “They are underneath President Obama’s college records, his passport application, his immigration status as a student, his funding sources to pay for college, his college records, and his Selective Service registration.”
