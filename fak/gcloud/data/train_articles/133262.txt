The Cullen Reports
The Cullen Report can refer to one of three reports of public inquiries into disasters that were overseen by William Cullen, Baron Cullen of Whitekirk.

Piper Alpha [ edit ]

The first Cullen Report was prompted by Occidental Petroleum's Piper Alpha disaster on 6 July 1988,[1] in which gas condensate ignited, killing 167 of the 229 people on board the oil platform in only 22 minutes.[2]

Dunblane [ edit ]

In 1996, Lord Cullen led the inquiry into the massacre at Dunblane Primary School.[3]

Ladbroke Grove [ edit ]

The third Cullen Report was a result of Lord Cullen's appointment to chair the 1999 Ladbroke Grove Rail Inquiry.[4]
