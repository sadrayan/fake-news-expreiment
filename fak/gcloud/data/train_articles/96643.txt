Georgia has highest flu activity in country
Doctors say you should get a flu shot now since they take a few weeks to work.

It is early in the season but Georgia is already seeing the most flu activity in the country.

A map from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts Georgia in the low range, but that is above minimal like the rest of the country.

The report is based on the number of people who go to the doctor with flu-like symptoms.

Doctors we spoke with this week say you need to get your flu shot now since they take a few weeks to work.

They say it is impossible to predict how severe the flu season will become.

While the peak is usually after the holidays, it can happen earlier.
