This guide is compiled by staff at the Minnesota Legislative Reference Library on a topic of interest to Minnesota legislators. It is designed to provide an introduction to the topic, directing the user to a variety of sources, and is not intended to be exhaustive.

Since 1987, starting with Florida, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of states changing over to a "shall issue" permit system. Over 30 states now have "shall issue" firearm carry laws. In addition, Vermont allows the carrying of a concealed weapon without a permit.

In Minnesota, a person may not carry a pistol in a public place unless they are in possession of a "permit to carry". Exceptions to the permit requirement include law enforcement officers and other defined instances (Minnesota Statutes, section 624.714). In 2003, the movement to change the permit application process from "may issue" (discretionary) to "shall issue" succeeded with the passage of Laws of Minnesota 2003, Chapter 28, Article 2. The "shall issue" application process limits the local law enforcement discretion provision and requires the granting of permits to all applicants who meet minimum requirements.

Efforts to change Minnesota from a "may issue" to a "shall issue" state took place over several years.

During the 2001 Minnesota Legislative Session, Minnesota came close to becoming a "shall issue" state. House File 1360, a "shall issue" bill, passed in the House of Representatives on April 9th, 2001. Governor Ventura indicated his support for the House language (Star Tribune, April 10, 2001). A companion bill in the Senate (Senate File 1395) failed in several committees but the issue was resurrected as a floor amendment to Senate File 1481. However, in the Senate floor debate, the "shall issue" amendment was changed to "discretionary issue" through further amendment. This action caused the "shall issue" sponsor to withdraw the original amendment, ending further action on the issue for the 2001 Session. See the Journal of the Senate for May 15, 2001, beginning on page 3604, for further 2001 Session information regarding Senate File 1481. On February 11, 2002, a motion to take Senate File 1481 from the table, which would revive the bill, failed with a 33 to 33 vote.

During the 2003 Session, there were several firearm carry bills introduced. See the House of Representative's and Senate's Legislation and Bill Status webpages for further information on these bills. In April of 2003, the House of Representatives amended the Department of Natural Resources technical bill, Senate File 842, Article 2, with the "shall issue" language from House File 261. The Senate subsequently passed Senate File 842 as amended and the governor signed the bill into law (Laws of Minnesota 2003, Chapter 28) on April 29, 2003.

On July 13, 2004, Ramsey County District judge, John Finley, ruled that the 2003 changes to the firearm carry law were unconstitutional. Minnesota's Constitution requires that bills deal with a single subject and the judge ruled that by amending the firearm carry language to a Department of Natural Resources bill, the law violated that requirement. Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch stated that he would appeal Finley's decision. See Ramsey County court decision, Unity v. State of Minnesota.

On January 13, 2005, the Minnesota Court of Appeals heard arguments on the Ramsey County court decision. On April 12, 2005, the Minnesota Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's decision, thereby striking down the Minnesota Citizens' Personal Protection Act of 2003. See Minnesota Court of Appeals decision, Unity Church of St. Paul, et al., Respondents; Adath Jeshurun Congregation, et al., Respondents; City of Minneapolis, Respondent; People Serving People, Inc., et al., Respondents, vs. State of Minnesota, Appellant. (A04-1302)(4/12/2005).



During the 2005 Session, several firearm carry bills were introduced to address the court decisions regarding the 2003 Minnesota Citizens' Personal Protection Act of 2003. In May of 2005, Senate File 2259 was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Governor Pawlenty signed Senate File 2259 into law (Laws of Minnesota 2005, Chapter 83) on May 24, 2005. This act makes no distinction between "open carry" versus "concealed carry" and persons with a valid permit are allowed to carry using either method.

On September 9, 2005, Hennepin County District Court Judge, LaJune Thomas Lange, issued a temporary injunction that allowed churches to post signs of their own wording and to completely ban firearms from all church property, including parking lots. This temporary injunction was the initial result of a lawsuit filed by two churches who argued that the firearm carry law interferes with their religious practices. On November 14, 2006, Hennepin County District Court Judge William Howard extended this temporary injunction by making it permanent. On February 5, 2008, the Minnesota State Court of Appeals ruled that churches have the right to ban guns from their property and can decide how to notify people of weapons prohibitions. See: Edina Community Lutheran Church, Respondent, Unity Church of St. Paul, Respondent, vs. State of Minnesota, Appellant. (A07-131)(2/5/2008).

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety has posted permit to carry information on their website.

Legislative History

The Minnesota Citizens' Personal Protection Act of 2001, House File 1360/Senate File 1395, was an attempt to extend permissive firearm carry legislation to Minnesota. The issue was also discussed in the Senate on May 15, 2001 during debate on Senate File 1481.

Minnesota Citizens Personal Protection Act of 2003 Senate File 842 was signed by the governor on April 28, 2003.

Several new bills called Minnesota Citizens Personal Protection Act were introduced in April 2005. In May of 2005, Senate File 2259 was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Governor Pawlenty signed Senate File 2259 into law (2005 Session Laws, Chapter 83) on May 24, 2005.
