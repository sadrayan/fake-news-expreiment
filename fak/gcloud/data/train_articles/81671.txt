Mrs. Idaho America pushes for breastfeeding law
Mrs. Idaho America 2016 is working with the Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition to attempt to pass a new law. It would exempt nursing mothers from being discriminated against or cited for public indecency or public nudity.

Idaho is the only state in the nation that doesnâ€™t have a law protecting nursing mothers and their right to nurse in public. Christi Van Ravenhorst says this bill is so important because 84% of Idahoan mothers breastfeed, versus 76% of mothers nationally.

The coalition is working on their strategy to present the bill to legislators.

Van Ravenhorst encourages nursing mothers who have been discriminated against to send letters to her at mrsidahoamerica2016@yahoo.com.
