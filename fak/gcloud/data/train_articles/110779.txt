Relation between blood vitamin B12 levels with premature ejaculation: case–control study
Summary

The aim of this study was to investigate whether vitamin B12 levels are associated with premature ejaculation (PE). A total of 109 subjects (56 PE and 53 controls) were included in this study. PE was defined as self-reported intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria and those who had had an IELT of <2 min was considered as PE. All participants were evaluated using premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The vitamin 12 levels were measured in all subjects. The mean age between the PE and controls was comparable (p = .084). Mean IIEF and BDI scores between the two groups did not statistically differ. The mean IELT values in the PE group were significantly lower than in the control group (p < .0001). PE patients reported significantly lower vitamin B12 levels compared with the controls (213.14 vs. 265.89 ng ml−1; p < .001). The ROC analysis showed a significant correlation between the diagnosis of PE and lower vitamin B12 levels. This study has demonstrated that lower vitamin B12 levels are associated with the presence of PE. This work also shows a strong correlation between vitamin B12 levels and the PEDT scores as well as the IELT values.
