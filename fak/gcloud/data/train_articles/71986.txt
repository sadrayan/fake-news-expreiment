Poll: Americans Overwhelmingly Support Voter ID Laws
A new poll by Rasmussen Reports finds that a strong majority still favors a requirement for voters to show a photo ID before being allowed to vote.

Following several years of similar results, the June poll finds that Americans overwhelmingly support Voter ID laws.

Rasmussen found that 76 percent of respondents favor voter ID laws and even a majority of Democrats, 58 percent, agree that voter ID is a good idea.

The new poll hews closely to last year’s findings that fully 78 percent favored proof of citizenship before being allowed to vote.

Voter ID laws have been a particular target of derision among Democrats and liberals, but with numbers like this it appears that they have not yet won over the American populace to rejecting Voter ID laws.

The new survey of 952 “Likely Voters” was conducted by Rasmussen Reports on May 27-28, 2015.
