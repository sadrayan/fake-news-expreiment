Stephen Glass is still retracting his fabricated stories â€” 18 years later
Giulia Melucci, the spokeswoman for Harper's, says the magazine has left the article in its archives, with the retraction note, so the archive could remain "a true and complete record of the magazine." She says that in 1998, the editors asked Glass, through his lawyers, to "give us an accounting of what was true or false but there was no response. Until now." (The Supreme Court noted in its ruling that Glass was evasive about whether he had come clean with Harper's, saying that he had relied on his lawyers to do so but hadn't checked up with them.)
