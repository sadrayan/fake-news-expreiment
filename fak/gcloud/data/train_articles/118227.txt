Networks Christopher Blair Network
A collection of “satirical” websites that post false and extremely inflammatory articles intended to gain social media shares by gullible conservatives. Most of the sites use a very similar design (built upon the MH Magazine WordPress theme) and disclaimer text.

These stories are often copied verbatim by Eastern European fake news websites, vastly expanding their reach.

Most of all the sites’ content is written by “Flagg Eagleton,” a pen name for veteran internet troll Christopher Blair. Blair also goes by the names:

Christopher Lyman

“Busta Troll”

Ezekiel Wilekenmeyer

Frank Wilekenmeyer

Stryker
