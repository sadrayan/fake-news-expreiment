Jennifer Meyer
Created by hand & designed with love; fine jewelry born and raised in Los Angeles.

Founded on the idea that jewelry could be more than an accessory, the Jennifer Meyer collection is designed to become an extension of the woman wearing it.

When Jen started her eponymous brand over a decade ago, it was the realization of a dream. Founded on the idea that jewelry could be more than an accessory, the Jennifer Meyer collection is designed to become an extension of the woman wearing it - a symbol of luck, celebration & love - a way for every woman to reflect on the important milestones in her life.

After working in communications for visionaries like Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani, in 2005, the time finally came to share her own creative vision - to start telling her unique story. More than a business endeavor, making jewelry has been a part of Jen's life since learning to make pieces from enamel at the age of six from her grandmother, California artist Edith Meyer.

As an adult, Jen made pieces to mark important milestones in her life; to celebrate friends, and remember family. The brand started as a way for Jen to not only reconnect to her roots, but also pay homage to the women who inspired her along the way.

We began with simple shapes in the best materials, making pieces that shared Jen's philosophy on life - be authentic, be unique and always sparkle. In 2012 Jennifer Meyer was awarded runner-up in the CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund, and in 2013 she was nominated for the CFDA Swarovski Award for Accessories Design. Jen believes in the creative power of supporting fellow artists, and continues to foster community and collaboration in the industry.

Today, we still hand make every piece in our Los Angeles studio, with master jewelers who share our commitment to quality and our passion for innovation. We believe that true luxury is effortless, that sophistication is sexy, and that everything is infinitely more stylish when it's worn with a smile.
