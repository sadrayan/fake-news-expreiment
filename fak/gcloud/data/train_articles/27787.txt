Facts and Figures

AFSP's latest data on suicide is taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Data & Statistics Fatal Injury Report for 2014.

Suicide Deaths

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects data about mortality in the U.S., including deaths by suicide. In 2014 (the most recent year for which full data are available), 42,773 suicides were reported, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death for Americans (Figure 1). In that year, someone in the U.S. died by suicide every 12.3 minutes on average.

After cancer and heart disease, suicide accounts for more years of life lost than any other cause of death.

To measure changes in the prevalence of suicide over time, the CDC calculates the countryâ€™s suicide rate each year. The suicide rate expresses the number of suicide deaths that occur for every 100,000 people in the population for which the rate is reported.

Over the last ten years, the rate has generally increased, and by 2014 it stood at 12.9 deaths per 100,000 (Figure 2).

Are Suicide Rates Still Rising?

CDC figures for death by suicide are currently lagging by more than a year. Information is not yet available for 2015.

Who is Most at Risk for Death by Suicide?

Suicide death rates vary considerably among different groups of people. The CDC reports suicide rates by four key demographic variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region/state.

Suicide Rates by Age

In 2014, the highest suicide rate (19.3) was among people 85 years or older. The second highest rate (19.2) occurred in those between 45 and 64 years of age. Younger groups have had consistently lower suicide rates than middle-aged and older adults. In 2014, adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 had a suicide rate of 11.6 (Figure 3).

Suicide Rates by Sex

For many years, the suicide rate has been about 4 times higher among men than among women (Figure 4). In 2014, men had a suicide rate of 20.7, and women had a rate of 5.8. Of those who died by suicide in 2014, 77.4% were male and 22.6% were female.

Suicide Rates by Race/Ethnicity

White males accounted for 70% of all suicides in 2014.

In 2014, the highest U.S. suicide rate (14.7) was among Whites and the second highest rate (10.9) was among American Indians and Alaska Natives (Figure 5). Much lower and roughly similar rates were found among Hispanics (6.3), Asians and Pacific Islanders (5.9), and Blacks (5.5).

Note that the CDC records Hispanic origin separately from the primary racial or ethnic groups of White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander, since individuals in all of these groups may also be Hispanic.



Suicide Rates by Geographic Region/State

In 2014, the five U.S. states with the highest age-adjusted suicide rates were Montana (23.8), Alaska (22.0), New Mexico (21.0), Wyoming (20.7) and Utah (20.6). The five locales with the lowest suicide rates were District of Columbia (7.7), New York (8.1), Massachusetts (8.3), New Jersey (8.3) and Connecticut (9.7). (Figure 6).

Suicide Methods

In 2014, firearms were the most common method of death by suicide, accounting for a little less than half (49.9%) of all suicide deaths. The next most common methods were suffocation (including hangings) at 26.7% and poisoning at 15.9% (Figure 7).

Economic Impact of Completed Suicides

The economic cost of suicide death in the U.S. was estimated in 2010 to be more than $44 billion annually. With the burden of suicide falling most heavily on adults of working age, the cost to the economy results almost entirely from lost wages and work productivity.

Suicide Attempts

No complete count is kept of suicide attempts in the U.S.; however, the CDC gathers data each year from hospitals on non-fatal injuries resulting from self-harm behavior.

In 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, 494,169 people visited a hospital for injuries due to self-harm behavior, suggesting that approximately 12 people harm themselves (not necessarily intending to take their lives) for every reported death by suicide. Together, those harming themselves made an estimated total of more than 650,000 hospital visits related to injuries sustained in one or more separate incidents of self-harm behavior.

Because of the way these data are collected, we are not able to distinguish intentional suicide attempts from non-intentional self-harm behaviors. But we know that many suicide attempts go unreported or untreated, and surveys suggest that at least one million people in the U.S. each year engage in intentionally inflicted self-harm.

As with suicide deaths, rates of attempted suicide vary considerably among demographic groups. While males are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. The ratio of suicide attempts to suicide death in youth is estimated to be about 25:1, compared to a about 4:1 in the elderly.

Economic Impact of Suicide Attempts

Non-fatal injuries due to self-harm cost an estimated $2 billion annually for medical care. Another $4.3 billion is spent for indirect costs, such as lost wages and productivity.
