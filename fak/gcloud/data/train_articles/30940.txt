Since peaking in December 2012, the number of people participating in SNAP has declined by more than 6 million people.Nationally, SNAP caseloads grew substantially between 2007 and 2013 as more households qualified due to the steep recession and sluggish initial recovery and because a larger share of eligible households applied for help. Since peaking in December 2012, the number of people participating in SNAP has declined by more than 6 million people, or 13 percent, reflecting the programâ€™s responsiveness to an improving economy, as well as the effects of the returning three-month time limit for unemployed childless adults.

Almost every state follows the same general pattern: SNAP increased over the recession years, beginning in 2008, growth began slowing by 2012, and subsequently caseloads began to fall. This interactive helps illustrate the differences across the states in the timing and the magnitude of SNAP caseload change.
