The committee reported on Monday, 11 January, and the following address was adopted in response to Washington's speech: We the Senate of the United States, return you our thanks for your speech delivered to both Houses of Congress. The accession of the State of North-Carolina to the Constitution of the United States, gives us much pleasure; and we offer you our congratulations on that event, which at the same time adds strength to our Union, and affords a proof that the more the Constitution has been considered, the more the goodness of it has appeared.—The information which we have received that the measures of the last session have been as satisfactory to our Constituents as we had reason to expect from the difficulty of the work in which we were engaged, will afford us much consolation, and encouragement in resuming our deliberations in the present session for the public good; and every exertion on our part shall be made to realize, and secure to our Country those blessings which a gracious Providence has placed within her reach.—We are persuaded that one of the most effectual means of preserving Peace, is to be prepared for War; and our attention shall be directed to the objects of common defence, and to the adoption of such plans as shall appear the most likely to prevent our dependence on other Countries for essential supplies.—In the arrangements to be made respecting the establishment of such Troops as may be deemed indispensable, we shall with pleasure provide for the comfortable support of the officers, and soldiers, with a due regard to economy.—We regret that the pacific measures adopted by Government with regard to certain hostile tribes of Indians, have not been attended with the beneficial effects toward the inhabitants of our Southern and Western frontiers, which we had reason to hope; and we shall cheerfully co-operate in providing the most effectual means for their protection; and if necesssary, for the punishment of aggressors.—The uniformity of the currency, and of weights and measures, the introduction of new, and useful inventions from abroad, and the exertions of skill, and genius in producing them at home, the facilitating the communication between the distant parts of our country by means of the Post-Office, and Post Roads, a provision for the support of the department of foreign affairs, and a uniform rule of naturalization, by which Foreigners may be admitted to the rights of Citizens, are objects which shall receive such early attention as their respective importance requires.—Literature and Science are essential to the preservation of a free Constitution: The measures of Government should therefore be calculated to strengthen the confidence that is due to that important truth.—Agriculture, Commerce and Manufactures forming the basis of the wealth, and strength of our confederated Republic, must be the frequent subject of our deliberation; and shall be advanced by all proper means in our power.—Public credit being an object of great importance, we shall cheerfully co-operate in all proper measures for its support.—Proper attention shall be given to such papers and estimates as you may be pleased to hy before us.—Our cares and efforts shall be directed to the welfare of our Country; and we have the most perfect dependence upon your co-operating with us on all occasions in such measures as will insure to our fellow citizens, the blessings which they have a right to expect from a free, efficient, and equal government.

House of Representatives Reply On 9 Jan. the House of Representatives appointed a committee of William Loughton Smith, George Clymer, and John Laurance to prepare an answer to Washington's address, and on 12 January a committee of the whole approved the following reply: The Representatives of the people of the United States, have taken into consideration your Speech to both Houses of Congress at the opening of the present session. We reciprocate your congratulations on the accession of the State of North Carolina, an event, which, while it is a testimony of increasing good will towards the Government of the Union, cannot fail to give additional dignity and strength to the American Republic, already rising in the estimation of the world in national character and respectability. The information that our measures of the last Session have not proved dis-satisfactory to our Constituents, affords us much encouragement at this juncture when we are resuming the arduous task of legislating for so extensive an empire. Nothing can be more gratifying to the Representatives of a free people than the reflection that their labours are rewarded by the approbation of their fellow citizens: Under this impression, we shall make every exertion to realize their expectations, and to secure to them those blessings, which Providence has placed within their reach. Still prompted by the same desire to promote their interests which then actuated us, we shall in the present Session diligently and anxiously pursue those measures, which shall appear to us conducive to that end. We concur with you in the sentiment that Agriculture, commerce and manufactures are entitled to legislative protection; and that the promotion of Science and literature will contribute to the security of a free government: in the progress of our deliberations, we shall not lose sight of objects so worthy of our regard. The various and weighty matters which you have judged necessary to recommend to our attention, appear to us essential to the tranquility and welfare of the Union, and claim our early and most serious consideration. We shall proceed without delay to bestow on them that calm discussion which their importance requires. We regret that the pacific arrangements pursued with regard to certain hostile tribes of Indians, have not been attended with that success which we had reason to expect from them. We shall not hesitate to concur in such further measures, as may best obviate any ill effects which might be apprehended from the failure of those negotiations. Your approbation of the vote of this House, at the last Session, respecting the provision for the public Creditors, is very acceptable to us: the proper mode of carrying that resolution into effect, being a subject in which the future character and happiness of these States are so deeply involved, will be among the first to deserve our attention. The prosperity of the United States is the primary object of all our deliberations, and we cherish the reflection, that every measure, which we may adopt for its advancement, will not only receive your cheerful concurrence, but will at the same time, derive from your co-operation, additional efficacy in ensuring to our fellow-citizens, the blessings of a free, efficient and equal government.
