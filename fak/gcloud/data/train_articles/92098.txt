Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg on Wednesday clarified the focus of her investigation into the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.

“The CPRIT investigation is ongoing and aggressive,” she said. “Chairman (Jimmy) Mansour and other current CPRIT board members are not under suspicion in the investigation.”

Lehmberg’s comments followed a statement on Tuesday by Mansour’s representatives, saying prosecutors had told him that the cancer organization and the board were no longer under suspicion. Prosecutors had objected to the broad sweep of that statement.

While Lehmberg cleared the 11 board members, she did not include the whole organization in her remarks.

“Let me emphasize the investigation is very serious,” Lehmberg said. “And we are far from finished in our efforts.”

Travis County prosecutors opened an investigation last month after reports that the board two years ago had approved an $11 million grant to a Dallas start-up, Peloton Therapeutics, without the required scientific and business reviews.

Three top executives have resigned and left the cancer agency. Typically those executives would have been involved, along with others, in preparing a slate of grant applicants for the board to consider.

It remains unclear how Peloton made it on the board agenda, but prosecutors are studying agency emails about that controversial award.

“Chairman Mansour has pledged ongoing cooperation from himself and from the CPRIT board,” Lehmberg said.
