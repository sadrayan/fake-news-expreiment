4.5 stars



I finally read "Boys of Summer" before the baseball season began and loved it. Over three weeks of Army duty this June, I read "October Men" (brilliant take on the '78 Yankees, one of the most interesting teams ever), "A Season in the Sun" (about Kahn's baseball travels all around America to all kinds of leagues during the '76 season), and most recently, "The Era."



The "Era" covers the Giants and Yankees, in addition to the Dodger teams that Mr. Kahn covered in "Boys of Summer." He had great access then, and because he had such good relationships with the players, managers, and owners, was able to get incredible quotes over the years, right up to the time this was published in the early 90s. A few stories from "Boys of Summer" are repeated here, but there are many more that aren't.



The only criticism, and it's the first one in four great books that I've read, is that Mr. Kahn is very biased towards these teams during this era, and frequently calls it the best time for baseball. Additionally, he criticizes the modern game (he doesn't need to do this...he should allow his readers to determine this). A very good book, just not as good as the immortal "Summer" or "October."
