Vitter: What the Flip… Obamacare Fix for Congress Only

(Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) today reacted to the administration’s decision to fix Obamacare for Members of Congress and staff. Vitter says Congressional leaders were part of the private decision. Vitter has introduced legislation to reiterate that Members of Congress and their staff must enroll into the Obamacare exchanges and eliminate a loophole exempting the President, Vice President, political appointees and some Congressional staff from being forced into the health care insurance exchange.

“This is exactly why America rightly hates Washington. Obamacare's a train wreck, even for Congress. So it gets fixed . . . FOR CONGRESS ONLY. What the flip about fixing it for America?”

“And this behind-closed-doors deal, announced right after Congress is safely away from the crime scene on break, was fully supported by establishment Republicans. When it comes to protecting their own, they find a way to work just beautifully with the Democrats,” Vitter said.

Last night it was reported that the Office of Personnel Management, under heavy pressure from Congressional leaders, will issue regulations saying that the government can continue to make the employer contribution to the health plans of congressional members and staff.
