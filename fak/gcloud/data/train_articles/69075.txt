Breaking: Trump Authorizes Congress To Pursue Criminal Charges Against Hillary
President Donald Trump has finally authorized the Congress to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton.

Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told the committee that he had a meeting with President Trump and he hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening.

Here is what Chaffetz said:

“President Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session.

I went backstage with the President here’s what he said:

‘You do a great job. Listen, I understand I’m the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. Don’t slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.’

If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of ‘don’t slow down,’ I think was a good message.”

The news that President Trump supports the investigation comes days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary Clinton’s email server.

Hopefully, without Obama to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton will be indicted. After all, she committed treason against America. She has to answer for that.

Thank you for reading.
