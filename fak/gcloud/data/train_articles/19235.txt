2016 Methodology Changes

A note that the data on shootingtracker.com will now comply with the standard Gun Violence Archive methodology on how mass shootings are counted.

Gun Violence Archive has always used the FBI derived definition:

FOUR or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident], at the same general time and location, not including the shooter.

This difference is that we do not count the shooter among the victims when determining if a shooting reaches the threshold of Mass Shooting. It insures a clear separation between victims of a shooting and those who perpetrate the crime. GVA also does not parse the definition to exclude any type of gun violence such as gang shooting or domestic violence. The definition is purely numerical and reflects ALL shootings which reach that statistical threshold.

Important notice about the future of ShootingTracker.com

Over the past three years both ShootingTracker.com and Gun Violence Archive have had a singular mission of providing unbiased, raw statistics, all with verified sourcing to inform society of the number of Mass Shootings that occur in the United States each year, no matter the cause or intent of the toll of victims. To that end, both ShootingTracker.com and Gun Violence Archive have put considerable effort to insure accurate, timely information.

On December 5, 2015 the principals of ShootingTracker.com and Gun Violence Archive came to an agreement to consolidate our resources at Gun Violence Archive's established website in order to best serve the publicâ€™s right and need to know the extent of gun violence in this country. Going forward, interested parties from academia, journalism, and advocacy groups will be able to go to www.gunviolencearchive.org for both mass shooting information or all other types of gun violence statistics, collected in near real time nationally and providing only verifiable, sourced incident reports.
