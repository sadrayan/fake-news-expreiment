Agricultural Employment

In farm work, permissible jobs and hours of work vary by age.

Parental exemption: Minors of any age may be employed by their parents at any time in any occupation on a farm owned or operated by his or her parent(s).

All exemptions to agricultural employment rules are statutory in nature and the Department's regulations reflect laws enacted by the U.S. Congress.

Many states statutes and regulations place tighter restrictions on farm work hours performed by minors. Consult your state department of labor for specific information.
