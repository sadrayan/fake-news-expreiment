Bush Signs Last Budget
TALLAHASSEE â€” Before signing his last state budget into law on Thursday, Gov. Jeb Bush firmed up his conservative credentials by vetoing more spending than ever in his eight-year tenure.

Bush axed $448.7 million from the $73.9 billion budget that takes effect in July and which also sets aside record savings for emergencies.

Ousted are dozens of South Florida projects -- including tens of millions of dollars that were headed for Broward and Palm Beach counties.

"It's never easy," Bush said of the vetoes. "You always hurt people's feelings. I don't enjoy that. And I'm always surprised that people are surprised. I've been consistent. There should be no surprises. And the people who really follow the budget knew that."

Many of the projects Bush cut were of only local interest, and Bush said, didn't have a statewide purpose or would be better paid for by local governments.

In Broward and Palm Beach counties, some of the vetoes include taking away state funds for police vehicles in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood, a handful of water and sewer improvements in both counties, as well as job training and school programs.

The governor insisted that his decisions were not influenced by whether the projects were supported by Republicans or Democrats, or involved retaliation to legislators who angered him, such as those who opposed his efforts to restore class size and school voucher laws.

Reaction among South Florida legislators to the budget vetoes largely fell along partisan lines, with some Democrats responding angrily and Republicans by and large extending Bush credit for leaving many projects untouched and setting aside almost 10 percent of the budget in reserve funds for unforeseen future needs.
