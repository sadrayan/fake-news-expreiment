M1

The M1 is a north-south arte­r­ial route stretch­ing the 193.6 miles between Lon­don to the north of Eng­land at Leeds.

The first sec­tion of the M1 opened in Novem­ber 1959 and boasted the first motor­way ser­vice area at Wat­ford Gap, or the Blue Boar as it was known at the time.

The M1 was extended south into Lon­don in 1977 and north of the M62 to Aber­ford at the A1(M) in 1999. It now links a num­ber of major cen­tres includ­ing Luton, Leices­ter, Derby, Not­ting­ham and Sheffield.
