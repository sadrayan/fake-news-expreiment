Ben & Jerry's co-founders on arrests at Capitol: You have to take a stand
The co-founders of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, who were arrested at the Capitol on Monday while demonstrating for voting and campaign reforms, say they were in Washington, D.C., to take a stand on issues they care about. "The history of our country is that nothing happens until people start putting their bodies on the line and risk getting arrested," co-founder Ben Cohen said before getting arrested, according to a post on the company's website ADVERTISEMENT The post said the two co-founders, Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, haven't been "shy about taking a stand on issues that we care about, even when they're controversial."

The post said their actions Monday came down to a "simple idea."

"If you care about something, you have to be willing to risk it all — your reputation, your values, your business — for the greater good."
