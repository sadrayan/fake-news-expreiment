Regarding property taxes, we currently plan to release the 2014 state and local government tables (which would contain updates to the property tax information) on December 9th. We do not have that information yet. Your 2013 figures are still the most current.

As for home-ownership, I did find some new data for you. It may take a while to sort and determine where Texas ranks. I am providing the latest American Community Survey data, from the 2015 annual data. I will attach that to this e-mail, and the pdf will give a suggested citation for any report you publish. Here is the link as well:
