Mexican State Reportedly Providing Charter Buses To Drive Migrant Caravan Closer To US Border
The migrant caravan originating from Central America reportedly has a new method of reaching the U.S. border with Mexico: professional charter buses.

Fox News reporter Griff Jenkins reported Tuesday from Mexico that the thousands-strong migrant caravan is now being chartered to the U.S. border by tour bus. Jenkins showed multiple professional buses lined up and boarding migrants to take them to their next destination on the path to the American border.

“Something new that’s developing here,” Jenkins said as he wandered the bus loading zone. “We’ve seen the 5,000 strong caravan walking to the border but now they’re waiting for a ride to the border. This is the first time I have seen an organized bus operation from the state of Oaxaca actually getting volunteer buses to put people … on them and take them to their next location.”

Getty Images has previously shown the migrant caravan traveling by raft and flatbed truck.

Jenkins said that this is a reversal from the previous Mexican policy of attempting to dissuade the caravan from reaching the U.S.:

That’s very significant now because these towns continue to help them. When we began this way back a week or so – Mexican police were trying to dissuade them from going across the Guatemala-Mexico border. At least some of the towns are assisting them to make their way.

Jenkins said that more buses were coming to pick up the migrants, but could not determine where the buses were coming from or who were paying for them.

President Donald Trump has sent more than 5,200 troops to the border.
