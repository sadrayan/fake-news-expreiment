ATLANTA—Murang Pak, Acting Special Agent in Charge (A/SAC), FBI Atlanta Field Office, announces the results of Operation Safe Summer (OSS), a collaborative effort by 38 local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, led by the FBI’s Metro Atlanta Child Exploitation Task Force (MATCH).

From May 1, 2018 to May 25, 2018 the operation’s goal was to combat child exploitation and child sex trafficking and make our community safer for our children heading into the summer months.

158 Judicial actions (arrests/citations/indictments/sentencing)
