Problems with using the General Social Survey to measure gun ownership - Crime Prevention Research Center
UPDATE: In addition to the ABC News/Washington Post and Gallup polls indicating that gun ownership rates are above 40%, similar results are obtained from CNN poll conducted on January 5-6, 2016 that finds 40% live in a household owning a gun with 9% unwilling to state an opinion, implying that the true rate is above 40%. The CNN poll shows this.

PEW polls, which had a drop in the percent of households that owned gun to 37% in February 2013, showed that was 44% of Americans in August 2016, and that it was 42% in March to April 2017.

Quinnipiac University (Dec. 16-20, 2015. N=1,140 registered voters nationwide) asked “Do you personally own a gun or does someone else in your household own a gun?” They found that 46% either owned a gun or lived in a household with a gun.

ORIGINAL POST on the General Social Survey: The New York Times cites the General Social Survey to claim that the gun ownership rate is low and falling.

It is an impressive drop, and many have used it to claim that while gun sales have increased, the increase has taken the form of more guns being owned by a smaller and smaller number of people. In a July 31 article, CNN stated it this way:

A decreasing number of American gun owners own two-thirds of the nation’s guns and as many as one-third of the guns on the planet — even though they account for less than 1% of the world’s population, according to a CNN analysis of gun ownership data. The data, collected by the Injury Prevention Journal, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the General Social Survey and population figures from the U.S. Census Bureau, found that the number of U.S. households with guns has declined, but current gun owners are gathering more guns. . . .

Yet, the GSS survey shows a large drop that you don’t see in many other surveys. According to Gallup, in October 2011, they wrote: “At 47%, reported gun ownership is the highest it has been in nearly two decades — a finding that may be related to Americans’ dampened support for gun-control laws.” Here is the Gallup survey data since 1991.

The latest Gallup poll claims that household ownership of guns in 2014 stands at 42 percent. This implies that about 134 million Americans live in households with guns. Gallup also reports the data a little differently elsewhere.

Or take the ABC News/Washington Post Poll

Surveys always have problems with them, but in many cases surveys are the only way to determine gun ownership rates. One measure is to look at licensed gun owners, though there have only been a few states that have licenses and haven’t changed the rules for getting the permits. Most notable is the state of Illinois. Over the last six years the GSS survey implies that legal gun ownership has fallen in Illinois, but FOID cards, which are necessary to legally own a gun, have been rising.

Whereas a few years ago, 1.2 million Illinoisans held Firearm Owners Identification cards, the number has jumped to 1.6 million, state police spokeswoman Monique Bond said. Soon after the court decreed in December that Illinois couldn’t ban public carry anymore, demand for FOID cards jumped precipitously. In January alone, Bond reported, there were 61,000 FOID applications, nearly double the 31,000 in January 2012. . . .

The 1.2 million FOID card holders appear to be true for 2009. From the Illinois State Police we have these data:

2010 1,316,508 2011 1,395,114 2012 1,476,408 9/6/13 1,633,039 12/31/15 1,942,008

There is additional hard data that indicates more people are owning guns. The number of concealed handgun permits also provide some information, with the number of permits increasing from about 4.6 million in 2007 to well over 9.3 million at the beginning of 2013 to about 13 million in 2015.

The GSS survey has raised concerns for some time. Here is something that John Lott wrote in his 2003 book The Bias Against Guns.
