PORTSMOUTH — Police are looking for a 4-foot tall sex offender — convicted for fondling a woman while she slept — for his alleged failure to register as an offender.



Wanted on a felony count of “duty to report” is Adam Anderson, 39, with a last known address of 514 Lilac Lane, Dover. Police say Anderson was most recently registered as a sex offender in Dover, but believe he's been staying “at different locations in Portsmouth.”



In addition to his short stature, Anderson is described as being bald, having blue eyes and weighing 105 pounds.



Police say he was convicted for two counts of sexual assault in October of 2012, which requires him to register as a non-public sex offender for ten years. At the time of Anderson's arrest, police said he fondled a sleeping woman in a Gosling Meadows apartment.



State law requires sex offenders to report permanent and temporary residences, with a temporary residence defined by law as “staying at a residence for more than a total of 5 days during a one month period,” police said.



Anyone with information about Anderson's whereabouts, is urged to call detective Kristyn Bernier at (603) 610-7529, or Portsmouth police dispatch at (603) 436-2145.
