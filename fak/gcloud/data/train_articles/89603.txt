Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has double-digit leads over either of Florida's favorite sons, former Gov. Jeb Bush or U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in an early look at the 2016 presidential election, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.





By a 91 - 8 percent margin, consistent with margins found in other states surveyed by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University, Florida voters support universal background checks for gun purchases. Voters in gun-owning households support universal background checks 88 - 11 percent.





Mrs. Clinton, who shows the most strength of any potential 2016 aspirant in Quinnipiac University's national polls, leads Jeb Bush 51 - 40 percent and bests Sen. Rubio 52 - 41 percent in a poll of Sunshine State registered voters.





Clinton is viewed much more favorably than either man, 62 - 33 percent favorable for Clinton, compared to 50 - 35 percent favorable for Bush and 41 - 34 percent for Rubio.





"We probably won't know for some time whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016, but if she decides to make the race, she begins with a sizable lead in a state that Republicans cannot win the White House without," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "Florida voters have a very positive view of Mrs. Clinton and it's not just Democrats who feel that way."





Mrs. Clinton is viewed favorably by 26 percent of Republicans, not bad for a Democrat who's had her share of battles with the GOP, and gets a 57 - 35 percent favorability among the key voting group, independents. Not surprisingly, she gets 93 - 5 percent favorability among Democrats. She has a 10-point gender gap: 66 percent of women and 56 percent of men view her favorably.





In a head-to-head with Jeb Bush, Mrs. Clinton would get 10 percent of Republicans while he would only get 4 percent of Democrats. Independent voters are divided 42 percent for Clinton and 41 percent for Bush.





President Obama remains slightly above water in Florida, with a 50 - 45 percent job approval rating.





Gun-Control





Florida voters support 51 - 44 percent stricter statewide gun-control laws, with gun owners opposed 61 - 33 percent. Attitudes on specific gun measures are:

56 - 41 percent support a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons, with gun- owners opposed 57 - 41 percent;

53 - 43 percent support a nationwide ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds, with gun-owners opposed 56 - 40 percent;

59 - 36 percent support placing armed police officers in schools;

57 - 33 percent that gun ownership in Florida does more to protect people from crime than to put them at risk;

60 - 31 percent say allowing people to own assault weapons makes the country more dangerous rather than safer, with gun owners divided 44 - 44 percent.

President Barack Obama better reflects their views on guns, 44 percent of Florida voters say, while 45 percent say the National Rifle Association better reflects their views.





"Floridians' views on guns are pretty much in line with results seen in other states surveyed by Quinnipiac University," Brown said. "Women are more likely to support restricting guns than men; blacks more than whites and Democrats more than Republicans. The idea of requiring background checks on those who want to buy guns has overwhelming support, 91 - 8 percent, in a country where getting a majority to agree on anything is often difficult."





From March 13 - 18, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia and the nation as a public service and for research.
