August 21, 2017

[Madison, WI]— While Madison Bureaucrat Tony Evers prepares to launch his campaign for governor this Wednesday, the Republican Party of Wisconsin is launching a digital ad campaign today, aimed at informing voters of Evers’ failure to lead when children and parents needed him most.

“Madison bureaucrat Tony Evers failed to lead when parents and children needed him most,” said Alec Zimmerman, spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin. “While Governor Walker has fought for hard-working Wisconsin families and delivered results, Tony Evers won’t take a stand – even when families are in danger. Wisconsin can’t afford his weak leadership.”
