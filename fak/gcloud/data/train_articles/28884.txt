Justin Bieber, who's already voiced approval for March for Our Lives, is now encouraging his followers to take action and sign a petition in support of the movement.

"Help these kids and sign their petition now," the singer tweeted Saturday evening (March 3). His tweet included a link to the March for Our Lives petition, described as "an act to protect and save your children" in response to the tragedy that unfolded in the Feb. 14 mass shooting that took 17 lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

The petition, created by students, asks elected officials to pass a law to ban the sale of assault weapons, prohibit the sale of high-capacity magazines and close loopholes in background checks that allow "dangerous people who shouldn't be allowed to purchase firearms to slip through the cracks." It accompanies the upcoming March for Our Lives event on March 24, when protestors will take to the streets of Washington D.C. to demand stricter gun control in the United States.

Earlier in the week, Harry Styles told fans to sign the petition as well. "I just signed the @AMarch4OurLives petition, and you should too," he tweeted.

Hundreds of events around the country are being organized to take place alongside the D.C. march on March 24. Find out more about getting involved with the movement at the March for Our Lives website.
