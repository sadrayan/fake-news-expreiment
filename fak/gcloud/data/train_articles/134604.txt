Healthy Lives
CONTEXT

Every New Yorker deserves to be healthier, but not every resident has that opportunity because where they live within New York City has a strong influence on health. Health outcomes can differ significantly between geographically close neighborhoods, according to the New York City Community Health Profiles. In addition, not all neighborhoods have equal access to clean air, affordable and nutritious food, or safe and well-maintained housing and public spaces. A neighborhoodâ€™s built environment can impact how much people exercise, or even the quality of their relationships with neighbors.

Inequities in neighborhood conditions have been shaped over decades by historical and ongoing racism. Discriminatory policies such as redlining, as well as a lack of investment in neighborhood sustainability, have historically disadvantaged many communities, particularly low- income communities of color, leaving these communities without adequate local services, housing, parks, or playgrounds, which contribute to health.

Studies show income inequality and high rates of poverty are connected to poorer health outcomes such as reduced life expectancy, and increased infant mortality, obesity, and mental illness. Life expectancy in East Harlem, where residents are predominantly black and Hispanic, and poverty is more prevalent, is 8.6 years shorter than on the Upper East Side, a predominantly white community with lower poverty just a few blocks south. Black women are eight times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, and babies born to black mothers are three times as likely to die in their first year of life as babies born to white mothers.

By adopting a holistic approach with OneNYC, we will address a range of factors that impact our health. These include gun violence and traffic fatalities, intensive heat waves due to climate change, and air pollution that exacerbates heart and lung problems, particularly for children with asthma.
