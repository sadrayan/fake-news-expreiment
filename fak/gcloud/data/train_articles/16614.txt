Subject: Texas reporter, quick query

Good afternoon. I write afresh to see if you can share more about the figures that played into this 2013 TRAC web post and chart. In particular, I am interested in learning more about the basis of the figure “44” in the chart for 2012. As ever, I’d be happy to visit by phone or email.

We are fact-checking this recent claim by Sen. Ted Cruz: “In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns.” The Obama administration “prosecuted only 44 of them.”

Thanks,

g.

The figure of 44 is compiled from case-by-case internal data of federal prosecutors obtained under FOIA that track each prosecution by “lead charge.” It would not include every time a person was charged under this provision (since a person can be prosecuted with several counts), only when that provision was the lead charge. We have not compiled figures for how often a person is charged so unsure of how much of a difference that would make. -- Sue
