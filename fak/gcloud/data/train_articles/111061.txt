About Tiffany & Co.
RETURN TO TIFFANY®

One of Tiffany’s greatest legacies is the Return to Tiffany® key ring. Introduced in 1969, each piece was inscribed with the message, “Please Return to Tiffany & Co. New York,” and assigned a unique registration number, ensuring that if owner and keys were ever separated, they would be reunited at the Fifth Avenue flagship store.

This everyday accessory became a symbol of quality and craftsmanship, the hallmarks of Tiffany & Co. for over 175 years. Later, the Return to Tiffany® motif was expanded to include contemporary jewelry that is today a global icon.

The now legendary Return to Tiffany® heart tag bracelet leads a collection that includes multi heart and oval-shaped tags suspended from necklaces and pendants, bracelets and bangles. Cuffs, rings and earrings too are emblazoned with this famous phrase.

The collection is designed in sterling silver, along with 18k yellow, white and rose gold, some with sparkling diamonds. In colors warm or cool, the jewelry mixes beautifully, extending an invitation to visit Tiffany & Co., the ultimate destination of style, located at the very heart of New York.
