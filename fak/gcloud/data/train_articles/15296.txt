In 2011, Senator Davis called White’s appointment to the commission, “the classic fox in the henhouse.” She said, “It’s really disgusting that an industry that profits from the poor by charging 1,000-plus interest is put at the head of the state’s financial regulatory agency. It’s saying, ‘It’s not only OK, but we’re going to put them in charge.’ ”

Greg Abbott is one of the top Texas recipients of funds from the payday lending industry.
