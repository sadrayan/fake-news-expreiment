San Juan City Council Votes Unanimously To Impeach Trump-Hating Mayor
When Donald Trump hinted that he may end aid to Puerto Rico over the mayor of San Juan’s decision to withhold aid from the rest of the country, the city’s other leaders finally took action.

While Puerto Rico’s Governor has praised Donald Trump’s efforts to quell the suffering of the people affected by Hurricane Maria, many of those efforts have been in vain because supplies come in to San Juan, and the mayor has been stingy with distribution.

“We simply don’t have the staff or resources to distribute countrywide,” mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told a local newspaper, adding that “anyone can come to San Juan if they need supplies.”

Unfortunately, that explanation was not good enough for her peers. In an emergency meeting on Thursday, the city council held an emergency meeting to initiate impeachment proceedings which begin on Monday.

Donald Trump has helped Puerto Rico and other hurricane-affected areas much more efficiently than any previous President, and Puerto Rico needs to replace their leadership with someone who understands and appreciates that before they lose the aid we aren’t even required to give them.
