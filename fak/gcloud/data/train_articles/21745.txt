Future 45, a conservative super PAC, claims that Hillary Clinton "gave speeches to the biggest banks on Wall Street after one of the worst financial crises in American history," the narrator says. "But Hillary wonâ€™t tell us what she said to those banks who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her." PolitiFact rules the claims as "Half True." Clinton has reporting earning $4 million from Wall Street firms, about half of that from big banks. However, the five big Wall Street banks have contributed $628,435 to her campaign and allied outside groups, far less than "millions."
