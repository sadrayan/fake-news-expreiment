Statistical Summaries
The New York State DMV maintains statistical data about motor vehicle crashes from 1995 - 2014 on the Archives of Statistical Summaries page. Crash data from 2015 and moving forward is housed in a publicly-accessible, searchable, Internet-based archive called the Traffic Safety Statistical Repository (TSSR). The most recent data about vehicle registrations and drivers is available on this page. All statistical summaries maintained by DMV are PDF documents and require Adobe Acrobat Reader®.

New York State Open Data Portal

In addition to the statistics accessible on the New York State Open Data Portal page, the DMV has also made a number of data sets available for public viewing on DMV data sets at New York’s Open Data Portal. Data viewable on the Open Data Portal include vehicle repair shops & vehicle inspection stations across the state, the number of electric cars registered in each NY county, the most popular vehicle makes and body types registered in New York, comprehensive motor vehicle crash data, and much, much more.

We encourage you to view all the data sets made available to you on New York’s Open Data Portal and urge you to submit your ideas on additional data sets you’d like to see available by suggesting a data set at the bottom of the Open Data page!

You can find DMV data at the Institute for Traffic Safety Management and Research (ITSMR) on the Traffic Safety Statistical Repository website.
