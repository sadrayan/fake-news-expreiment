I propose a government that makes counter-semitism central to all aims of the state. A government:

1) Of a People, for that people, free from jews

2) That cannot revoke the right to bear arms, such that this people can remain free from jews

3) that forbids all immigration except of biological kin, where no person of jewish origin may live, vacation, or traverse
