Dear Friends,

You’ve probably seen how estactic the far-left has been the last 24 hours. First there was a poll showing Francis “Beto” O’Rourke within 2pts(!) of Senator Cruz. Then last night came the announcement that O’Rourke raised a record $10.4 MILLION in the last three months. That’s more than double what Senator Cruz raised!

And, according to Variety magazine, Beto is headed to the west coast to pick up contributions from far-left enthusiasts in Hollywood.
