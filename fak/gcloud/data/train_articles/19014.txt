Grothman: House Republicans Should Support Spending Cuts in Budget
Congressman Glenn Grothman (R-Glenbeulah) today released the following statement about the U.S. Senate’s vote to remove $200 billion in mandatory spending cuts from the budget:

"For eight years, Republicans have promised to reign in out-of-control spending and scale back expanding deficits,” said Grothman. “Now that we’re in control, we have the chance to deliver on these promises. Unfortunately, the Senate budget did not include the $200 billion in mandatory spending cuts that were included in the House budget.

“That is why I today submitted an amendment to the House Rules Committee to include the House-passed $200 billion mandatory spending cuts in the Senate budget. While the amendment was not agreed to, it is something that I will continue fighting for in future budget discussions.”

Background

Mandatory spending is government spending on certain programs, like entitlement programs, that’s required by current law.

The Senate approved a budget plan that removed spending cuts on Thurs., Oct. 19, 2017.
