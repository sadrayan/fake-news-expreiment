AD SCRIPT:

Alison: “I’m Alison Lundergan Grimes and I approved this message.”

Narrator: “What can happen in thirty years?

A senator can become a multimillionaire in public office …

While voting 17 times against raising the minimum wage …

Three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas …

And 12 times against extending unemployment benefits for laid off workers.

And when asked about it … just laughs.

30 years of Mitch McConnell is long enough.”

These votes kept in place “tax deductions for outsourcing expenses incurred in relocating a U.S. business outside the United States.” In 2010, McConnell voted to block the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. This vote supported maintaining a “tax deduction…or tax credit for the cost of an American jobs offshoring transaction…in which the a taxpayer reduces or eliminates the operation of a trade or business in connection with the start-up or expansion of such trade or business outside the United States.” [Vote 249, 7/30/14; Vote 181, 7/19/12; Vote 242, 9/28/10]

MCCONNELL [still slightly laughing]: Yeah. Thanks Lars.” [McConnell Interview With Lars Larsen, 1/8/14, 8:21-8:29]
