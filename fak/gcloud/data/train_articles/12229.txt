How about a nice game of chess?

IG Horowitz (“Justice” Dept) speech – ‘whistleblowers’

https://oig.justice.gov/about/meet-ig.htm

CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF THE INSPECTOR GENERALS ON INTEGRITY AND EFFICIENCY?

“Since 2015, he has simultaneously served as the Chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), an organization comprised of all 73 federal Inspectors General.”

Think yesterday.

What was learned?

Robert Storch confirmed NSA IG?

https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/press-releases/2017/robert-storch-nsa-ig.shtml

First presidentially-appointed IG for NSA?

Dept of “Justice” [background] important?

Federal prosecutor in N. District of NY [background] important?

CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF THE INSPECTOR GENERALS ON INTEGRITY AND EFFICIENCY [BACKGROUND] IMPORTANT?

“Prior to joining NSA, Mr. Storch served in several positions at the Department of Justice's OIG, including as Senior Counsel to the IG and Acting Deputy IG prior to his 2015 appointment as Deputy IG. He also served as chairman of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) Whistleblower Ombudsman Working Group. The Whistleblower Ombudsperson program he helped establish is widely seen as a leader in the field.”

“Earlier in his career, Mr. Storch also worked as a federal prosecutor in the Northern District of New York, most recently serving as the Deputy Criminal Chief and Counsel to the U.S. Attorney. He was also posted overseas for two years as a Department of Justice Resident Legal Advisor in Ukraine.”

“The CIGIE is comprised of all Inspectors General whose offices are established under section 2 or section 8G of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.), those that are Presidentially-appointed/Senate Confirmed and those that are appointed by agency heads (designated federal entities).”

How might this benefit ‘possible’ ongoing investigations across inter-intra federal agencies?

HUBER >> HOROWITZ >> STORCH

US ATTORNEY (PROSECUTOR) >> DOJ/FBI INSPECTOR GENERAL (INVESTIGATOR) >> SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE (SIGINT) AND INFORMATION ASSURANCE (IA) PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

NSA been pushed since the beginning?

Logical thinking.

The "Experts"

But… SESSIONS should appoint a 2nd SC in DC aka THE CORRUPT SWAMP

But… SESSIONS should appoint a 2nd SC in DC aka THE CORRUPT SWAMP [team of less than 20 typically] & wait 2-4 years [take a gamble]

But… SESSIONS should appoint a 2nd SC in DC aka THE CORRUPT SWAMP because unlike the CLINTON EMAIL CORRUPT CASE [as demonstrated by the FBI/DOJ people FIRED/REMOVED] this will be conducted faithfully and honestly [like MUELLER]

But… HUBER has not ‘directly’ interviewed several witnesses therefore the appointment of HUBER by SESSIONS [and therefore the IG] is not genuine

But… SESSIONS & HUBER are following standard DOJ open/ongoing investigation policy by not discussing [making public] so therefore nothing must be happening [FIRE SESSIONS!]

But… HUBER [ability to prosecute + empanel a grand jury outside of DC [90%+ voted HRC (2016)], who already began the investigation(s) late last year w/ assigned team of 470 investigators (attorneys) + IG + legal jurisdiction across all 50 states, is not a ‘special counsel’ so therefore nothing is being done

But… POTUS is attacking SESSIONS via TWITTER so therefore he is not working on behalf of the people’s interest (or POTUS’) [D’s/LEFT LOVE/TRUST SESSIONS!]

But… interestingly, if nothing is being done behind the scenes, why are so many FBI & DOJ senior officials being FIRED and/or REMOVED from their respective positions of power? Who is AG? Who must sign off on each removal? DOJ in charge of FBI?

But… interestingly, if nothing is being done behind the scenes, why are there 50,000+ sealed indictments across the US [what % = USA v. X?]? Coincidence vs. HUBER start?

But… interestingly, if nothing is being done behind the scenes, why are many ‘powerful’ CEOs, members of Congress/ Senate, resigning? Coincidence? Example: Pre_POTUS did the SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE indicate wanting to leave politics?

But… interestingly, if nothing is being done behind the scenes, why are human trafficking arrests SURGING?

Nothing to See Here.
