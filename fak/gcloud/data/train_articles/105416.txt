Disney announces that Woody will be "openly bisexual" in Toy Story 4 …
We were all excited to see the new trailer for the long awaited Toy Story 4. Our hearts warmed at the sight of all of our favorite childhood toys coming back to the big screen as we patiently wait for June to approach – but there’s something else that makes Toy Story 4 even more special. Disney announced that Woody, the main character in the Toy Story franchise, will come out as openly bisexual during the movie!

This is great news since nothing is more inclusive than making our childhood heroes into symbols of the LGBTQAIP community.

When Toy Story 4 releases in June 2019, the world will see how wonderful and overall better a movie can be when the main character is retroactively made to be a part of the LGBTQAIP community. It’s the start of something great – and Toy Story 4 is only the beginning. Diversity is our strength.
