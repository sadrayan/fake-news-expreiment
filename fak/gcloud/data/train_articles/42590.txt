1934. Appendix D -- Grounds For Judicial Deportation
The alien must be convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after the date of entry, and sentenced to confinement or confined therefor for one year or longer. Although the conviction must occur within five years of entry, any entry into the United States may be used to support the charge of deportability.

Chu v. Cornell, 247 F.2d 929 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 355 U.S. 892 (1958). Administrative case law has characterized moral turpitude as "a nebulous concept, which refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience." Obviously, offenses such as murder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnaping, robbery, and aggravated assaults involve moral turpitude. However, assaults not involving dangerous weapons or evil intent have been held not to involve moral turpitude. Conspiracy, attempt, or being an accessory involves moral turpitude if the underlying offense involves moral turpitude. There is administrative and judicial case law holding that any crime having as an element the intent to defraud is a crime involving moral turpitude. See Gordon and Mailman, Immigration Law and Procedure, ยง 75.05[1][d].

A sentence of confinement of one year or more is sufficient even if the sentence is entirely suspended. However, a single crime of moral turpitude in which a sentence of less than one year is imposed would not be a ground for deportation under section 1252(a)(2)(A)(i), but the same offense might provide a basis for deportability as an aggravated felony.
