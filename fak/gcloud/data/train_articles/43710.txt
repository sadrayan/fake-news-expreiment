Statement on Marco Rubio’s Callously Opportunistic Gun Bill
Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. — In response to Marco Rubio’s transparent attempt to paper over his record of vehemently opposing all real forms of gun violence prevention, Patrick Murphy released the following statement:

“Floridians won’t be fooled by Marco Rubio’s transparent attempt to paper over his relentless opposition to legislation that prevents gun violence,” said Rep. Murphy. “After the tragedy in Orlando, Rubio used the deaths of 49 innocent Floridians to run for re-election while voting against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the No Fly List from purchasing guns.

“For Marco Rubio to introduce this bill now is an embarrassment. Floridians deserve better than Marco Rubio’s callous political opportunism as he continues to stand side by side with the gun lobby instead of keeping Floridians safe.”
