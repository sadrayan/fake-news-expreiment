Ray Lewis: Colin Kaepernick's girlfriend played role in him not getting Ravens' quarterback job
"This is the only thing that frustrates me a little bit," Lewis said. "I lived police injustice â€” I lived it. So for somebody to tell me that I'm racist? No, what I found out was, I found out that all cops are not bad cops. And I found out that all people that work for the system are not bad people. You can't put everybody in one box. There's not one word you can ever find where I criticized and said, 'I don't like Colin Kaepernick, and I think it's terrible.' I never said it."
