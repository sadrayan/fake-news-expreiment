Topic: The Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism (PAP-T)
In 2011, NATO foreign ministers endorsed a new partnership policy at their meeting in Berlin in order to establish a more structured role for NATO’s operational partners in shaping the strategy of NATO-led operations to which they contribute.

Moreover, at the Chicago Summit in 2012, NATO leaders endorsed new policy guidelines for Alliance work on counter-terrorism, which focus on improving threat awareness, developing capabilities to prepare and respond and enhancing engagement with partner countries and other international actors.

Together, the reform of the partnership policy and NATO’s counter-terrorism policy guidelines supersede the 2002 PAP-T, providing cooperation opportunities for partners and NATO.
