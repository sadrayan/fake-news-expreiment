BREAKING: Over 500 ‘Migrant Caravaners’ Arrested With Suicide Vests
Over 500 members of the “Migrant Caravan,” a massive collection of refugees and immigrants moving towards our southern border, have been arrested by Mexican authorities after an early morning raid on their camp. According to Eduardo El Guapo Cardinal, his troops went tent by tent, waking the occupant when something fishy was found:

“What we found were more than 500 ISIS soldiers posing as ‘immigrants’ fast asleep with their suicide belts right next to them. We’re lucky nobody was blown up in the raid.”

Another 10-20K “refugees” are expected to show up to apply for asylum in the next day or two. How many of them will be wearing a suicide vest?

It is well-known that people with brown skin tend to be able to blend in with others that look like them. These “refugees” are supposedly from Central America, somewhere just south of Brazil, so the Middle-Eastern men just have to shave their jihad beards and separate their unibrows to fit in.

President Trump is calling the mission by the Mexicans “proof that those people are up to no good.” He added that they also would have been caught weeks ago had Mexico stayed out of our way. This is what happens when you don’t support President Trump.
