Email responses to PolitiFact Texas, Matthew Chandler, press secretary. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, April 2012

410 pm, April 18, 2012

A 5-year department-wide contract was awarded to Federal Cartridge, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATK. The contract allows the department-wide purchase of up to 450 million rounds of this ammunition, which is the quantity projected to be used over the next five years. The contract is one of a number of department-wide contracts for duty ammunition, but it is the primary vehicle for .40 cal. S&W 180 grain ammo. This contract is intended to be used by all components, except USCG, who uses DoD ammo contracts. This contract is part of the Department’s strategic sourcing efforts to combine multiple previous contracts in order to leverage the purchasing power of the entire Department, including the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center which trains nearly all federal law enforcement personnel, to efficiently procure equipment and supplies.

How much ammunition does DHS contract to buy each year? How many agencies get these rounds? Why this kind of ammunition?

This contract is part of the Department’s strategic sourcing efforts to combine multiple previous contracts in order to leverage the purchasing power of the entire Department. It is different than previous contract vehicles. It does not purchase 4500 million rounds, it allows the department-wide purchase of up to 450 million rounds.
