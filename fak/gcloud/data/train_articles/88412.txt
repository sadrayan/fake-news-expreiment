Herman Cain: I'm the 'real black man' - Juana Summers
Herman Cain said Wednesday that the media is scared "a real black man may run against Barack Obama."

Cain's comments, while in Florida for events in Coral Springs and Palm Beach, came in response to a question as to whether he could unseat Obama and become the second black president.

In response, Cain said electing him president gives "voters a chance to be batting .500" with black presidents. "Get rid of him and elect me."

He went on to decry the media's treatment of his potential rivals, Michele Bachman and Sarah Palin, saying the "liberal mainstream media" is trying to destroy them, according to video of his remarks posted by a local political site.

"You know why they go after those two ladies more viciously? Because they know that Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin is going to draw a lot of the women vote away from the Democratic party," Cain said. "They are scared to death of that if [Bachmann or Palin] were to run and get the nomination. They are doubly scared that a real black man may run against Barack Obama."

Cain spokeswoman Ellen Carmichael told POLITICO that Cain's race remarks had nothing to do with him challenging Obama's racial origin.

"He was referring to himself in the first person," she said. "He was saying that there could be a general election with two black men."
