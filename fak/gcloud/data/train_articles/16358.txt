Statement, U.S. Justice Department, received by email from Dena Iverson, spokeswoman, Office of Public Affairs, July 29, 2013

3:55 pm

“The department is aware that DOJ Pride, an employee association, sent informational material, on its own behalf, to some DOJ employees. The material was clearly identified as a DOJ Pride product. We have also recently learned one component’s diversity official distributed the information via email to its employees on behalf of DOJ Pride. The single page document was produced on a DOJ computer and involved limited use of a DOJ printer to make a few dozen copies, in line with the department’s de minimis use policy allowing employees to make minimal personal use of their DOJ computers when the cost to the government is negligible.”

Best,

Dena
