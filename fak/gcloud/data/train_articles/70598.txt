Prior Year Annual Reports and Consolidated Financial Statements

Subsequent to the issuance of its audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2012, Amtrak identified and corrected several errors in its accounting for capital leases, deferred taxes, and other, which impacted its audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2012 and prior years. Accordingly, Amtrak removed the audited financial statements from this website. For details, including the impact on the financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2012, see Note 2 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements - Fiscal Year 2013.
