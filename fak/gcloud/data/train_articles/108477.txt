Secondly, I agree that such a joke is rather distasteful at this point in time. As for the shark actually being spotted . . . . I doubt it. Snakes, yes . . . sharks, no. Find me a news link and then I might believe it.

The reports are undocumented as far as I know. I did post the undocumented reports as sharks do exist in lake Pontchartrain. If you are not from this area I assume you would not know. This Lake is the one that flooded New Orleans.

A cut and paste..

Our species sample nets catch lots of bull sharks in Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain. A few years ago in one set we had 17 sharks in the net," said LDWF biologist Mark Lawson. "Recently we had a Lake Pontchartrain fishermen call to tell us that just as he was pulling up a 22 inch speckled trout to the surface, a shark severed it behind the gills with one pass. That was no little sand shark (Atlantic sharpnose)."

Yes, it is quite possible a shark was spotted.
