What I Do

My primary focus stands in paleoart, creature and character design.

If you look for someone who can design, illustrate, model, texturize or render dinosaur, creature, character or something of that nature, I might be the guy to do it.

I enjoy working on projects trough all the stages of creation, from initial concepts to the final image, model, animation.

Primary tools I depend on are Z-brush, 3ds Max and Photoshop.

If you've seen my work, you may have noticed lots of dinosaurs and reptile like creatures.

Couldn't explain why I prefer these, but I'm into dinosaurs for as long as I can remember. Jurassic Park book and movie reafirmed my passion for paleoart early on, which now makes up most of my work to this point.
