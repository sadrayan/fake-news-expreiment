The presentation which you forwarded to me was prepared by Jim Duncan (a planning consultant) and was presented to the Code Next Advisory Group on September 22, 2014. It’s posted on the CodeNEXT blog page because it was included as support material for the group’s meeting. Here’s a link to the blog page, which puts the report in context:

Mr. Duncan was working with the neighborhood in opposition to the PUD. It looks like the traffic numbers were taken from the developer’s consultant’s study. Our understanding is that the project is being revised and the City will be provided new / revised traffic studies based on the updated plan for review. A timeline for review of the plan will be determined once we receive the revised TIA.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

I just learned that a revised TIA was submitted last week and is currently being reviewed by transportation staff in the Development Services Department and Austin Transportation Department. It is anticipated that the review will be completed in 4-6 weeks.
