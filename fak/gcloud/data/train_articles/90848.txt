Section 1-10-20. (A) To honor and recognize the history and heritage of this State and the many contributions of its diverse citizenry, it is necessary and appropriate to codify the placement of certain symbols on the Capitol Complex and within the State House which salute the contributions and sacrifices of our constitutional history. On July 1, 2000, or thirty days after the effective date of this section, whichever occurs last, the only flags that shall fly atop the dome of the State House are the United States Flag and the South Carolina State Flag.

(B) The Infantry Battle Flag of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia (Confederate Battle Flag) must be displayed on the State House side of the Confederate Soldiers' Monument on the State House grounds. This flag is square with a St. Andrews Cross of blue, edged with white, with thirteen equal five-pointed stars, upon a red field, with the whole banner bordered in white. The total outside measurement of the flag shall be fifty-two inches square, inclusive of the white border. The blue arms of the cross are seven and one-half inches wide and the white border around the flag proper is one and one-half inches wide. The stars are five-pointed, inscribed in a circle six inches in diameter and are uniform in size. The Confederate Battle Flag shall be flown on a flagpole approximately equal in height to and immediately adjacent to the Confederate Soldiers' Monument.

Section 1-10-30. The Infantry Battle Flag of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia (Confederate Battle Flag) displayed on the Confederate Soldiers' Monument on the State House grounds, and any monument, marker, memorial, school, or street erected or named in honor of the Confederacy or the civil rights movement located on any municipal, county, or state property shall not be removed, changed, or renamed without the enactment of a joint resolution by a two-thirds vote of the membership of each house of the General Assembly approving same. This provision shall not apply to the maintenance and repair of the monument, marker, memorial, school, or street.

Section 1-10-40. (A) On July 1, 2000, or thirty days after the effective date of this section, whichever occurs last, the Confederate Flag (Naval Jack) must be removed from atop the State House, from the front ground floor foyer of the State House, and from the chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives and simultaneously therewith the Confederate Battle Flag must be placed at its place at the Confederate Soldiers' Monument.

(B) The Confederate flags displayed in the respective chambers of each house of the General Assembly shall be transferred to the custody of the Department of Archives and History for presentation and display as the department shall deem appropriate.

(C) There must be erected around the Confederate Soldiers' Monument appropriate decorative iron fences to keep secure the Confederate Battle Flag.

(D) The Division of General Services of the Budget and Control Board shall replace the flag displayed at the Confederate Soldiers' Monument as necessary to avoid its being displayed in a ragged or faded condition."

(B) The provisions of subsection (A) of this section may only be amended or repealed upon enactment of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on one of its readings in each house of the General Assembly. "
