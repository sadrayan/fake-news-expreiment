Gov. Rick Scott signs downsized tax cut package into law
Gov. Rick Scott on Wednesday signed a modest tax cut package into law, and ceremonially signed the bill again at a jobs event in Jacksonville. The bill (HB 7099) passed both houses overwhelmingly in the 2016 session.

In a release, Scott repeated the much-disputed claim that he has cut taxes by $1 billion over two years. A fellow Republican, Sen. Tom Lee, R-Brandon, said Scott "technically" reached the $1 billion goal but only after including a rollback in local property taxes to pay for schools -- an idea that Scott strongly opposed when senators first proposed it.

Scott initially asked for $1 billion in tax cuts. The House offered $991 million over two years and the Senate proposed $250 million, then about $400 million when the property tax cut rollback was included.

Highlights of the final package include a permanent repeal of the sales tax on on certain manufacturing equipment; a three-day back to school sales tax holiday; and repeal of sales tax on food and drinks sold by veterans organizations to their members.
