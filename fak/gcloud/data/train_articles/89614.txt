Florida (FL) Poll * April 6, 2011 * Florida Voters Turn Thumbs Dow
April 6, 2011 - Florida Voters Turn Thumbs Down On Gov. Scott, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Voters Back Drug Tests For State Workers Almost 4-1



Word format



The number of Florida voters who disapprove of Gov. Rick Scott has more than doubled, pushing him from a positive 35 - 22 percent job approval February 2 to a negative 35 - 48 percent approval in a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Voters also say 53 - 37 percent that his state budget proposals are unfair to them.





Gov. Scott's proposed budget cuts go "too far," 47 percent of voters say, as 16 percent say they don't go "far enough" and 29 percent say they are "about right," the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds.





By 78 - 20 percent, voters say Scott's order that newly-hired state government workers undergo drug testing and that those already on the job be spot-checked is a good idea.





A proposal working its way through the Legislature that would end the government's practice of collecting union dues from state workers is a bad idea, voters say 47 - 43 percent. But voters support 74 - 22 percent the provision of that same bill which would require unions to get individual members' approval before using dues payments for political purposes.





Voters disapprove 57 - 39 percent of a new law that will tie teachers' pay to student performance on standardized tests, and split 47 - 47 percent on the part of that law that would eliminate tenure for public school teachers hired after July 1.





"While his approval rating is unchanged, Gov. Rick Scott's disapproval rating has jumped from 22 percent to 48 percent, perhaps not surprising given the magnitude of the changes he is proposing," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "Today, Scott is a four-letter word to many Florida voters, but political popularity can change with time. The experience of Scott's predecessor, Charlie Crist, who had 70 percent approval ratings at this point in his tenure, shows how fickle public opinion can be."





"Nonetheless, the fact that Scott is as unpopular as the State Legislature, which has a 47 - 35 percent disapproval rating, is evidence of the depth of his problem. It is exceedingly rare for an unindicted governor or president to ever be seen as poorly by the electorate as his legislature or Congress," said Brown.





Voters disapprove 55 - 36 percent of the way Scott is handling the budget. They say 52 - 41 percent that Scott should not have pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes and by 64 - 24 percent they say he will not be able to keep that no-tax pledge.





Voters prefer 65 - 29 percent not raising any taxes and balancing the budget only through spending cuts, rather than raising some taxes in order to reduce the number of spending cuts.





"The one piece of good news for Gov. Scott seems to be that voters agree with his no- new-taxes strategy," said Brown. "Actually, there's another piece of good news: He has almost four years left to turn around public opinion."





Scott's problems run deeper among women, who disapprove of the job he is doing 55 - 26 percent, than among men who approve 45 - 41 percent. He gets a 58 - 25 percent approval among Republicans, but Democrats disapprove 74 - 12 percent and independent voters turn thumbs down 48 - 33 percent.





By 49 - 44 percent, voters say Scott's plan to cut $2 billion in property and business taxes is a bad idea.





"One key metric that Scott will need to turn around if he is to be successful politically is voter perception that his proposed budget is unfair to them," Brown said. "Men are split, saying 46 - 44 percent it is unfair but women find it unfair by 59 - 30 percent."





"It would be rare that a governor who is perceived by the electorate as unfair gets re- elected. A total of 95 percent of Florida voters say the state's budget problems are very or somewhat serious. They know something has to be done, but they want someone who treats them fairly in that process."





From March 29 - April 4, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,499 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.
