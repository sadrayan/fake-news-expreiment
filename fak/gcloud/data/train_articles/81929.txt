Trump left his mark on Atlantic City â€” for better and for worse
At one point, Trump sued to have his name taken off the casinos. At the end of the Atlantic City Expressway, at the old Trump Plaza, a giant white wall now greets cars entering the city. Trump struck a deal to leave his name on the Taj Mahal, where the massive casino floor is now mostly deserted, and Trump's portrait still gazes out over a few customers in a gift shop.
