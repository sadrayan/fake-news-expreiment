New Clinton ad attacks gun lobby
The daughter of the principal killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting appears in an emotional Hillary Clinton advertisement lauding her plan to reform gun laws.

The ad, set to hit the Rhode Island market Wednesday, shows clips from Erica Smegielski’s wedding. She said it was the last event she planned with her late mother Dawn Hochsprung.

Smegielski says she’s voting Clinton because “but she has made it her mission to advocate for common sense gun safety reform.” An outline of her plan, which includes holding gun dealers and manufacturers accountable, and strengthening background checks, is available on Clinton’s campaign website.

“She is the only candidate who has what it takes to take on the gun lobby,” says Erica Smegielski in the clip. “She reminds me of my mother: she isn’t scared of anything.”

The ad will air in Connecticut, and New York markets as well.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s opponent in the Democratic race, has taken a more moderate view on gun control, advocating for "common sense" gun laws in interviews and debates. His plan is not specifically outlined on his website.

Republican frontrunner Donald Trump outlines his view on his website, saying “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.”

Sen. Ted Cruz also says he supports “second amendment rights” on his page. Gov. John Kasich takes a similar stances, outlined on his campaign website.
