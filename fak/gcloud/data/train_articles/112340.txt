Bill Nye Contributes to Transgender Insanity
We are all familiar with Bill Nye the so-called “Science guy.” His overtly political stance on what he calls science is often shared in middle and high school classes across the country. He has taken hard left positions on the topic of global warming and now seems to be embracing the transgender movement as well.

The left is trying to solidify in the minds of young people that transgenderism is hard, proven science.

In reality, it is a mental disorder whose biggest proponents are severely suffering.

This video which aired on the “Bill Nye Saves the World” show is a perfect example.
