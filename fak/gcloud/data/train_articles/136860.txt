Butina In Negotiations With Prosecutors Over ‘Potential Resolution’ To Her Case
Accused Russian agent Mariia Butina is in talks with federal prosecutors to reach a “potential resolution” to the case, according to a court filing Friday.

In the filing, prosecutors and Butina’s defense attorney jointly asked the judge in the case to delay hearings and filings in the case for two weeks to allow the two sides to continue “negotiations regarding a potential resolution of this matter.”

Butina’s defense team also told the judge that it would withdraw a motion to dismiss filed yesterday, should the two-week negotiation period be granted.

Federal prosecutors charged Butina with failing to register as a foreign agent in July. Prosecutors were forced in September to withdraw claims that Butina had offered sex for access to information.
