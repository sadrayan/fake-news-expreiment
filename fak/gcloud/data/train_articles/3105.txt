Making Change at Walmart (MCAW) is a campaign run by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) to change Walmart into a more responsible employer and to improve the lives of Walmart workers. Walmart is owned by one of the richest families in the country but its workers still struggle with poverty wages, erratic schedules, understaffed and under-stocked stores, and mistreatment from management. We believe Walmart can afford to do better and that change at Walmart would mean change for retail employees everywhere.
