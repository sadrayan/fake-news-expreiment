As for your second question, the reference refers to Sen. Patrick's proposed legislation SB 126, which was introduced prior to the the 82nd Legislative Session. SB 126 stated: "A peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws (sic)."

Arizona's SB 1070, which was signed into law on April 23, 2010, included language authorizing police officers to check immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe that someone is here illegally and, before it was struck down by the Court, to arrest without a warrant, anyone "the officer has probable cause to believe … has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States."
