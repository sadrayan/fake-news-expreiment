Supporting Lasting, Sustainable Change in Haiti
After Haiti was impacted by a series of hurricanes in 2008, President Clinton called on the CGI community to respond at the Annual Meeting that year. 31 Commitments to Action were made to assist the country, valued at more than $100 million when fully implemented, amplifying the already robust efforts of CGI members’ in Haiti over the last several years. At the 2009 CGI Annual Meeting, members made additional Commitments to Action and came together to share progress and discuss new opportunities for positive impact. At this meeting, the Haiti Action Network was created to drive coordination, collaboration, and results. Denis O’Brien, Chairman of Digicel, stepped forward to chair the Network, and has continued to do so for the past four years.

Just a few months later, Haiti was struck by a devastating earthquake on January 12, 2010 that claimed more than two hundred thousand lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Infrastructure in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and surrounding areas was destroyed, leaving a vast portion of the population without homes, hospitals, schools, electricity, water, sanitation, and other basic services.

In response, members of the Haiti Action Network intensified their efforts in the region, merging expertise and resources across sectors to provide immediate relief and long-term strategic investment. On the fourth anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti, CGI would like to reflect on some of the more than 60 Commitments to Action made by the CGI community in Haiti since 2010, which are valued at $353 million when fully implemented. From engaging local artists and building new schools, to empowering social entrepreneurs, these CGI commitment-makers are demonstrating the power of partnerships to strategically support lasting and sustainable change in Haiti.
