ECOT sues state to block effort to track log-ins of students
Facing the potential loss of tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, Ohio's largest online charter school sued the state today in an attempt to block its upcoming attendance audit. The Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow is suing to "prevent and enjoin the Ohio Department of Education from completing a bait and switch by which it seeks to evaluate and 'readjust' ECOT's funding for the 2015-2016 school year based on an improperly promulgated rule," according to the lawsuit.

Facing the potential loss of tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, Ohio's largest online charter school sued the state Friday in an attempt to block an upcoming attendance audit.

The Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow filed the lawsuit in an attempt to stop the Ohio Department of Education from requiring that the school provide records of daily student log-in times, which the lawsuit calls "a bait and switch." The state's preliminary attendance review of ECOT in May raised questions, noting that �most log-in times from these files did not substantiate 5 hours per day of log-in time for the students reviewed.�

The accuracy of attendance figures is crucial because they are the key factor in determining how much state money a school receives. ECOT gets about $107 million per year for more than 15,000 students.

The lawsuit was filed in Franklin County Common Pleas Court just three days before the department was scheduled to begin a final ECOT attendance review, poring over records to ensure that students are completing the minimum 920 hours required by the state. A similar review a year ago forced the small online Provost Academy to pay back $800,000 to the state, equal to about 80 percent of its total funding.

But ECOT argues that using log-in times to calculate attendance violates a funding agreement the school signed with the Department of Education in January 2003 after an attendance dispute. That agreement, ECOT argues, doesn�t say that students must attend 920 hours of classroom time but �must be presented with at least 920 hours of learning opportunities.�

�We have a contract, and you can�t unilaterally end a contract,� said Neil Clark, a consultant for ECOT.

Senate Education Committee Chairwoman Peggy Lehner, R-Kettering, said she is not familiar with such a contract, but if one exists, it needs to be reviewed.

"To pay ECOT for merely offering something and not delivering it is not a good bargain for taxpayers," Lehner said. "We have a huge number of kids not taking advantage of an opportunity to learn, and we need to fix that."

Clark said the Education Department also broke a promise made at a Feb. 28 meeting involving ECOT and legislative, gubernatorial and department staff members in which concerns about the new attendance-audit standards were discussed. Clark said the department promised not to require five hours of log-in time per day for the 2015-16 school year.

�We were misled through the whole process,� Clark said. �Up until a week ago, I think ODE (the Department of Education) was an agency running amok.�

Mike Dittoe, chief of staff for House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger, R-Clarksville, confirmed that version of the February meeting, adding that some legislators have been surprised by how the Education Department has conducted recent attendance audits.

Department of Education officials declined to address ECOT's allegations. The department "remains committed to completing our regulatory duty to conduct the final attendance review and ensuring that appropriate funding is distributed to all charter schools," spokeswoman Brittany Halpin said in a statement.

As scrutiny and criticism of Ohio�s charter-school system has heightened in recent years, questions about attendance have been raised by several officials, including state Auditor Dave Yost, a Republican, and Senate Minority Leader Joe Schiavoni, D-Boardman, who introduced an online-attendance bill.

At online schools, students work on computers from home or other locations instead of a classroom. The Provost audit found that the school's average student logged in for less than an hour per day.

Schiavoni said he doesn�t believe that ECOT is unable to track daily student log-in times.

�At the root of the lawsuit is they want to do very little and get a lot of money for it,� Schiavoni said.

He noted ECOT's poor academic performance, including a New York Times report that more ECOT students drop out or fail to finish high school within four years than at any other school in the country.

�The Department of Education is simply trying to figure out how many kids are in the process of learning every day.�

Rep. Andrew Brenner, R-Powell, chairman of the House Education Committee, said it�s time for state officials to seriously look at alternative ways of counting students, particularly those in high school.

�I�d rather switch to a model where we�re paying based on performance than a model that pays to sit kids in classrooms,� he said. �I think that should be done of all schools.�

The Department of Education audits charter-school attendance every five years. ECOT noted that its most-recent review, in 2011, produced only minor issues.

But things are different this year, and ECOT has pressed lawmakers for changes in the law to aid its situation. ECOT founder William Lager is a top donor to Republican legislators.

The lawsuit says that part of state law says that attendance should be based on what ECOT makes available to its students, not on log-in times. Some say that other parts of the law specifically refer to the 920-hour requirement.

According to the lawsuit, the state had �never requested or sought documentation of log-in durations� to determine funding. But, the school argues, the state is trying to retroactively apply new standards to ECOT.

Clark said the lawsuit was filed after ECOT became aware recently, through comments from a school-board member, that the department was going to aggressively audit the charter school's attendance.
