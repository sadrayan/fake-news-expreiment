NV Dems Chair: Enthusiastic Turnout Points to a Strong 2016 for Democrats
Las Vegas, NV – Nevada State Democratic Party Chair Roberta Lange released the following statement on today’s First in the West presidential caucus:

“Today, Nevadans gathered with their friends and neighbors to make their voices heard about the future of the Democratic Party and our nation. I want to congratulate Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for running vigorous and engaging campaigns all across our state. An estimated 80,000 Nevadans participated today, and an enthusiastic turnout that points to a strong 2016 for our party. More than 31,000 Nevadans successfully pre-registered online using our innovative new Caucus Express tool. Thousands of Nevadans used our online caucus locator tool. Our field organizing team secured 250 caucus locations statewide, recruited more than 1,000 energetic volunteers and hosted more than 300 mock caucus trainings.

“Iowa and New Hampshire might be the first two states in this process, but Nevadans made clear today why we earned our early spot on this calendar. Nevada is the only early state that truly reflects America’s diversity. We are proud that the Latino caucus participation increased in 2016. We’re the only early state with a diverse workforce, where organized labor – the backbone of the Democratic Party – has a significant presence.

“We are looking forward to harnessing this energy and building momentum for November. Nevada Democrats are poised to win Nevada for our Democratic presidential nominee, elect Catherine Cortez Masto as the first Latina U.S. Senator in history, re-elect Dina Titus, pick up seats in Congress and reclaim our Democratic majorities in the state Senate and Assembly.”
