Robert E. Lee's Funeral

Mourners, many of them in uniform, congregate outside Lee Chapel on the campus of Washington College for the October 15, 1870, funeral of fomer Confederate general Robert E. Lee. After the Civil War, Lee served as president of Washington College in Lexington, Virginia, from October 1865, until his death in 1870. At his widow's request, Lee's remains were buried in a cement-lined brick vault in the basement of the chapel, which had been built under Lee's direction and opened only two years prior.
