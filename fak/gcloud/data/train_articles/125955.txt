FACT CHECK: Recording Captures Tim Kaine Yelling at His Mistress
On 29 October 2016, the Twitter account @OMFG_America published an audio recording of a man yelling at a woman along with the claim that it featured Vice Presidential candidate Tim Kaine and an unnamed mistress:

DEVELOPING: New headaches for VP nominee Tim Kaine as alleged mistress comes forward with tape of threats, verbal abuse. h/t @JerseyJ0E pic.twitter.com/Pd8Ltsol2x — OMFG’ngton SHITPOST (@OMFG_America) October 29, 2016

Tim Kaine is not the man speaking in this audio recording. The dialogue was taken from an infamous recording of actor Mel Gibson yelling at his former girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, which was first made public in 2010.

It should also be noted that Tom Kaine has not been accused of having a mistress or of verbally abusing a woman. This Twitter account launched a baseless accusation at Kaine and backed it up with an unrelated piece of audio.

This is the second time that a piece of famous audio has recirculated with Tim Kaine’s name attached to it. On 13 October 2016, audio of Alec Baldwin yelling at his daughter was shared as if it featured the voice of Kaine.
