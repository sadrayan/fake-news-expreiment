Looks like a raid !!!! But as person that grew of here Chicago, gun violence is everywhere. The kids don't have any guidance, all the ppl that is killing is someone's son nephew cousin grandson and they lost. No jobs here. City not hiring, they laying

off, all the other jobs that was here when our grandfathers came here are gone or outsourced to China or to some other country! Drug and gangs left a tremendous hole In the community. Gentrification has already begun. They tore down the projects and gave them section 8 to go wherever. Then those ppl moved to different neighborhoods, where they made it to opposing gangs neighborhoods. And with a endless supply of guns and drugs....well what you think is gonna. Criminals fighting for a small piece of real estate and that's how they feel they gonna put food on the table. In my time as a teenager here either you sold drugs or got a job. Plug in or plug out. I chose to plug out. But I was lucky. I had family support, I didn't wanna disappoint nobody. A lot of kids today don't have any option. The street code is basically like the bible, they would rather snatch your soul out your body to do otherwise. The streets is watching and these kids is hungry. Today a two year old was murdered while riding in a vehicle. My heart is broken. When are we gonna stop blaming white ppl and live accordingly To the word of God, and instead of word of what we think is right. I'm fighting to stay on my sons about life. Love and peace black ppl , let's do better.
