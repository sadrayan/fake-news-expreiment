“UPS Uniforms *** UPDATE ***” from LAPD
Community

Unfortunately the info re: UPS Uniforms came from another Law Enforcement Agency in the State of California purporting the validity of the information. This "INFO" is, apparently an Internet myth.



However, the advice is good in that you should always verify the delivery service has arrived with their own company vehicle.
