No, 19 ICE agents didn‚Äôt write a letter asking to abolish ICE, but the media ran with that anyway
Multiple news outlets, including Fox News‚Äô Christopher Carbone, claimed that 19 senior ICE agents had written a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) be ‚Äúabolished‚Äù or ‚Äúdisbanded.‚Äù The misleading news was mass-reported by the anti-Trump media, which were eager to claim that agents wanted to abolish ICE.

In reality, the agents asked that ICE be split and restructured into two separate agencies, so they can focus on the dual DHS duties of protecting homeland security and deporting illegal aliens.

In their letter to Secretary Nielsen, investigators with the Department of Homeland Security said the realignment is necessary because the media fomenting of anti-ICE outrage has caused the public to confuse DHS‚Äô national security work with its illegal-immigration work.

The Department of Homeland Security was created in 2003 in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ICE is an arm of DHS.

Because of the media-fomented outrage among the public that‚Äôs now protesting ICE, many jurisdictions refuse to cooperate with DHS agents because they‚Äôre virtue-signaling to protect illegal aliens.

As a result of irresponsible media coverage, DHS said they ‚Äúhave been perceived as targeting undocumented aliens, instead of the transnational criminal organizations that facilitate cross border crimes impacting our communities and national security.‚Äù

The DHS agents said the realignment of its agency would enable them to do their job better by improving ‚Äútransparency, efficiency and effectiveness.‚Äù

Many people on Twitter called out Fox News reporter Christopher Carbone for his misleading story. Other media outlets also gleefully disbursed the fake news, but Fox News fans were upset that FNC also did so without verifying the underlying claims.

@christocarbone I thought your article on Foxnews was very misleading. Alonzo Pe√±a had nothing to do with the letter and they did not call for ICE to be "abolished." They wanted it to be reorganized. ‚Äî Daily Trite ÔøΩ? (@realDailyTrite) July 2, 2018

@christocarbone 19 ICE investigators call for agency to be DISBANDED??? NOT!!! 19 ICE investigators suggested splitting ICE into two separate agencies that focus separately on homeland security and deportation‚Ä¶. That's Misleading CLICKBAIT!!! FAKE NEWS!!! Go write for CNBC. ‚Äî Andrew Solow (@Lambo_Man_) July 2, 2018

@christocarbone The headline of this piece on Fox News is a a ridiculous case of fake journalism, "19 ICE investigators call for agency to be disbanded in letter amid 'abolish ICE' protests". The piece it self says "The letter suggests splitting ICE into two separate agencies‚Ä¶" ‚Äî Freedom Reigns (@USAFUBAR) July 1, 2018

It‚Äôs obvious that liberals demanding that ICE be abolished have no idea what ICE actually does. Jerry Robinette is a former special agent in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement‚Äôs homeland security investigations in San Antonio.

Robinette told Fox & Friends that the left is deliberately promoting a false narrative to demonize ICE, because if the public really knew what ICE and DHS does on a daily basis, they would not want it abolished.

‚ÄúICE is composed of basically two components: enforcement removal operation and HSI (Homeland Security Investigations),‚Äù Robinette explained. ‚ÄúHSI is the investigative arm of ICE. It‚Äôs just unfortunate when you see what‚Äôs on TV. The only thing they‚Äôre reporting is the administrative arrests and housing and deportation of illegal aliens. And the [real] work of the agents is not being covered or reported on.‚Äù

Robinette continued (video above):

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs irresponsible, considering that these agents risk their lives. We have agents that have lost their lives in the performance of their duties. We have agents that put their jobs in front of their families. [The media] come to the border for a few hours. They have a field trip, they spend a few hours at the border and pretend they know what happens at the border. They have no clue. And honestly, I think they do have a clue but it‚Äôs not to their benefit to acknowledge the work that‚Äôs being done.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs some of what ICE and Border Patrol (both arms of the Department of Homeland Security) do.

Every day they protect our communities by preventing violent criminals like MS-13 & 18th Street gang members, child molesters, and smugglers from entering the United States and infiltrating your neighborhood.

This week, #USBP agents & #CBP officers arrested MS-13 & 18th Street gang members, child molesters & smugglers. Every day they protect our communities by preventing dangerous people from entering the US. https://t.co/fb3NdIiI3b https://t.co/A0IJsyvrxP https://t.co/zQn2EyX2tr pic.twitter.com/ekf6KENgoR ‚Äî CBP (@CBP) June 30, 2018

Homeland Security Investigations (an arm of ICE) stamps out human trafficking, including the sex trafficking of young girls.

ICE and DHS stop the flow of dangerous illegal drugs from pouring into the United States.

ICE prevents terrorism.

Most ICE offices & programs have a role in preventing terrorism. Several are on the front lines, either IDing dangerous persons before they enter the US or finding them as they violate immigration or customs laws. https://t.co/Qfccvgdrm8 pic.twitter.com/88GxSi8pFZ ‚Äî ICE (@ICEgov) June 30, 2018
