"In December 2017, I was asked to meet Harvey and support him in completing his rehab program," Polish said. "I want it absolutely clear that I do not condone or support any of his behaviors. I agreed to help him in his recovery because I believe that the opportunity for healing could play a role in shifting the cycles of abuse in our culture so that no other women are abused again."
