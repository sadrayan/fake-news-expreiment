Awakened Melanated Supremeness
I just did a little cursory research on this. Ice Cream is primarily milk and cream (which are typically whitish) with whatever else to give it flavor.



Common vanilla ice-cream is made with artificial flavors that don't have much pigmentation, real-v

anilla ice cream has black specks in it, and expensive high-quality vanilla ice cream is sort of grayish.



If you're using vanilla extract, the flavor of it is extremely strong, so you will be using a very small ratio of it (the dark colored ingredient) to the light-colored ingredients. When they mix, it will get darker, but barely.



You can make your own ice cream fairly easily and know that you aren't "adding preservatives" or anything that would take away the color, but it will not look like this.



I mean, what kind of logic does it take for color to matter in a particular flavor of ice cream but not any other popular food? Steak and burgers are brown, chocolate is brown, coke is brown (they even tried selling it without the false color, but people didn't like it), etc. This is such an arbitrary place to draw the line in the racist-sand.
