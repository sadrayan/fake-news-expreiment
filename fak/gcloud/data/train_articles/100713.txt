Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who attended her first official meeting on Thursday, said she was new to the political business and was going to Uttar Pradesh not just for 2019 Lok Sabha polls but for a long term.

Priyanka was appointed as the general secretary of the Congress party for Uttar Pradesh (East) a few weeks ago.

Thursday's meeting was presided over by Congress president Rahul Gandhi. He discussed the party's strategy for the Lok Sabha polls with All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretaries and in-charges of various states at the meeting.

The spotlight at the meeting was on Priyanka Gandhi, who took charge as AICC general secretary on Wednesday. She arrived at the party headquarters and headed straight for the meeting.

Sources told India Today that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, at the meeting, said she would abide by whatever the Congress president -- her brother, Rahul Gandhi -- decides. I am new and can only learn with your guidance, she added.

Sources added the party's overall strategy for the Lok Sabha polls and booth-level organisation were discussed during the meet.

At the meeting, Priyanka was seated next to Jyotiraditya Scindia, who also took charge on Wednesday as AICC general secretary in-charge Uttar Pradesh (West).

Priyanka Gandhi has been allotted an office adjacent to that of her brother's at the party headquarters.

Rahul Gandhi has also called a meeting of state chiefs and Congress Legislature Party leaders on Saturday in the national capital, to review preparedness for the general election.
