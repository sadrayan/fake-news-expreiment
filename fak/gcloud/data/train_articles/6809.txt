U.S. House of Representatives
Heller Calls on President and Congress to Walk the Walk on Healthcare Reform

July 23, 2009

(Washington, DC) – Today U.S. Congressman Dean Heller (R-NV) issued the following statement on the President’s and the majority party’s refusal to require elected federal officials to enroll in the newly proposed government-run healthcare plan.

“I call on the majority party and the President to lead by example and include provisions in their legislation that requires both the President and members of Congress to enroll in any new government-run healthcare system. If the government-run ‘public plan’ is good enough for millions of our constituents, then it should be good enough for Members of Congress and the President. I do not believe the federal government should be running healthcare in our country and levying massive tax increases on America’s small businesses. However, what better way to monitor a government-run healthcare system than to make federal officials participate in the plan,” said Heller.

Heller offered an amendment to the America’s Affordable Health Choices Act (H.R. 3200) during the House Ways and Means Committee markup that would require members of Congress enroll in the government-run healthcare program. This amendment was defeated by a vote of 21 to 18. Heller’s letter to President Barack Obama has been included with this release.
