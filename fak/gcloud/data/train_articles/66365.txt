#HelpIsOnTheWay - John Cox for CA Governor 2018
Published on Aug 5, 2018

John Cox wasn’t supposed to beat a former LA Mayor, or the State Treasurer. He's not part of the political class. He was raised by a single mom, a public-school teacher on the South Side of Chicago.



Entitled politicians and the special interests who fund them -- they’ve rigged the game, trading favors and enriching themselves, while the forgotten Californians have been left behind.



We don’t have to accept that vision anymore - and the good news is - help is on the way. John Cox wants to be your next Governor. Watch the first ad of the General Election campaign!
