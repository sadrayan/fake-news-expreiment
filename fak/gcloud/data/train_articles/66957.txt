Voting record an issue ahead of Texas runoff
A vote he didn't cast could cause trouble for Republican Bill Flores ahead of the April 13 runoff election for the GOP nod to face Rep. Chet Edwards (D-Texas).

Flores claimed during a March debate that he voted for fellow Republican Rob Curnock in his 2008 race against Edwards. But records indicate that's not true, according to the Waco Tribune-Herald.

Flores spokesman Matt Mackowiak told the paper that Flores had in fact "been in meetings in Houston and couldnâ€™t get back to the Bryan-College Station area in time to vote." In a recent radio interview, Flores claimed he was joking when he talked about voting for Curnock.



Flores was recruited to run by the National Republican Congressional Committee. He raised some $214,000 and spent close to $300,000 since the March 2 primary. He has about $50,000 more cash on hand than Curnock for the final stretch of the campaign.



There was some good news for Flores on Monday -- former Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) announced he's backing the retired oil executive.
