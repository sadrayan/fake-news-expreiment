Paul Davis for Kansas
Meet Paul

“When I launched this campaign, I visited all 25 counties in Kansas’ second Congressional district. I kept hearing the same stories of fear, frustration, and disappointment. Kansans no longer see our values reflected in Washington. They’re worried that Washington has forgotten them. Or worse…that Washington simply doesn’t care. Kansans deserve a leader who will fight for them.”
