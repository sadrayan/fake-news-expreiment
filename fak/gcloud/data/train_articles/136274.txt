FDA discovers that '100% real' Parmesan cheese you're eating may be wood
Who doesn’t like a little sprinkling of tasty parmesan cheese from time to time? You might think you’re familiar enough with the taste of parmesan cheese to detect a fake, but a recent investigation by the FDA indicates that you might have been enjoying a lot more wood pulp in your cheese than you expected. In fact, there might not have been any parmesan cheese in your “cheese.”

A recently released document pertaining to an ongoing cheese-related FDA investigation makes clear how widespread cheese fraud has been. It’s common for manufacturers to use a small amount of wood pulp (cellulose) as a bulking agent. The acceptable limit set by the FDA is just 2% of the total weight. Several manufacturers were using much, much more.

Cellulose is the main sugar in plants — a polysaccharide that humans aren’t equipped to digest. It’s the main constituent of paper and cardboard, and cotton fiber is 90% cellulose. Most of the offenders caught by the FDA had cellulose content higher than allowed, but not by much. Cheese from manufacturer Jewel-Osco was 8.8% cellulose and Walmart’s Great Value brand was 7.8%. Those were still mostly parmesan cheese, though.

Castle Cheese Inc. was producing fake parmesan cheese and distributing it to some of the largest grocery chains in the US including Target. Acting on a tip, the FDA inspected a Castle Cheese facility and found that it’s 100% grated parmesan cheese was actually equal parts swiss, mozzarella, white cheddar, and cellulose. Castle President Michelle Myrter is due in court this month to plead guilty to charges that she directed the adulteration. She could face up to a year in prison and $100,000 in fines. The world is again safe for lovers of hard Italian cheese.
