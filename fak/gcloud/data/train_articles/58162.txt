Trump is falling further behind on confirmations
As the Senate leaves town for August recess, President Trump remains behind on filling the government with political appointees to oversee core government functions and to implement his policy agenda.

The Washington Post and Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, are tracking the presidentâ€™s progress on putting forward nominees who require Senate consent before assuming a role.

The White House has often blamed Democrats for the slow pace of confirmations. While Senate delays have played a role, the White House has also been slow to put forward nominees for consideration.
