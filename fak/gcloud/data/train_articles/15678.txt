Emails, Shawn Turner, deputy press secretary, the White House, July 16, 2014

1:40 p.m.

The 2012 letter from Gov. Perry was a statement of his position and concerns about the situation on the boarder and while it did not make any requests of the President, we did respond to his concerns. We thought it was important to expand our dialogue with the Governor and his staff so we held a number of briefs and engaged in several conversations with the Governor's team.

The briefs and discussions were intended to give the governor’s team a clear understanding of the administrations focus on the immigration issues at the border and discuss steps we’re taking to deal with the situation.
