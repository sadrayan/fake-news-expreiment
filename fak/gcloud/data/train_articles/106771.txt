ASM Inventory
Notes:

Numbers of artisanal and small-scale miners were estimated from published sources believed reliable (see below).

Sources date from different years, with the first comprehensive inventory published already back in 1999. Estimations take this partly into account, adjusting the numbers to recent changes of the ASM context (e.g. correlation of attractivity of ASM with commodity prices, where applicable, according to main ASM commodities of the countries; or demographic changes).

Another issue is related with the underlying definition of ASM. Only recently a broad description of ASM was formulated by OECD that has the potential to be widely accepted as a generic ASM definition. Data from past inventories were assessed using different ASM definitions and sometimes even mixed approaches (i.e. respecting different country-specific assessment methods) related to what is considered ASM.

Finally assessments by different sources also vary in their focus on minerals extracted by ASM. Some assessments focus more on gold, as the most emblematic ASM commodity, other assessments take a more holistic approach covering also minerals extracted artisanally for local supply such as construction materials.

The dataset currently (last update May 2018) contains quantitative data from 77 countries, qualitative data on proven but not quantified ASM in 15 countries and 18 countries which are considered likely to host ASM activities. Based on these data, a number of 43.5 million ASM miners (+/- 25%) is considered plausible. To improve data consistency, more work is needed, particularly benchmarking ASM country data with contemporary ASM definitions such as from OECD (see below), disaggregating by gender, and aligning criteria for counting ASM miners.
