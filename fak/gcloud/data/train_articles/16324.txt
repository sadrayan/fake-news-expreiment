If nothing untoward was going on, then applying for and receiving a 2-S student deferment (prior to the introduction of the lottery in december 1969) was totally legal and millions of men did it. That's not draft dodging, certainly not in the way that emigrating to Canada or faking a physical/mental ailment or getting an influential father to pull strings with the draft board would be considered draft dodging.

I've never encountered anyone who received a 2-S after the lottery was introduced and, indeed, everyone I've interviewed formally or informally who was a college student in those years was certain that if they received a low number they'd be inducted - whether they were still enrolled in college or not.
