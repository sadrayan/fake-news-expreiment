SNAP Food Benefits
SNAP

What it offers

Helps people buy the food they need for good health. People also can buy garden seeds with SNAP benefits.

SNAP food benefits are put on to the Lone Star Card and can be used just like a credit card at any store that accepts SNAP.

SNAP can’t be used to:

Buy tobacco.

Buy alcoholic drinks.

Buy things you can't eat or drink.

Pay for food bills you owe.

Who is it for?

People who don’t have a lot of money as long as they meet program rules.

Most adults age 18 to 49 with no children in the home can get SNAP for only 3 months in a 3-year period. The benefit period might be longer if the person works at least 20 hours a week or is in a job or training program. Some adults might not have to work to get benefits, such as those who have a disability or are pregnant.
