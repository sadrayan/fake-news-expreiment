Atiku’s Reveals his plan for peace with Boko Haram in exchange for limited autonomy in Borno state and oil

A memorandum titled “New Deal for Security of the Nation” issued by Abubakar’s Campaign Team spokesperson, Prince Kassim Afegbua, gave the first glimpse of Atiku’s plan for peace with the terrorist organization.

The memorandum reveals in broad terms a plan to hand over a swathe of land comprising of some 30,000 square kilometers in Borno state into a semi-autonomous government headed by Boko Haram. In order to ensure the fulfillment of security requirements, the future Boko government will be limited in various aspects such as foreign relations, procurement of arms, and access to the international banking system. Additionally, the handover of territories will be conducted gradually over the span of 3 years and depend on Boko Haram’s full compliance with the peace agreement. Funding for the new administration will be based on a profit sharing scheme with the federal government that will allocate as much as a 2% stake in the nation’s oil proceeds.

This new plan is in line with previous statements by Atiku regarding Boko Haram where he expressed his familiarity with the history and motives of the terrorist group. In such a statement in November, Abubakar said “I happen to know how Boko Haram came into being. They were offshoots of political thuggery. Politicians used those boys in Boko Haram to win elections and then abandoned them and then there were no jobs for them.”
