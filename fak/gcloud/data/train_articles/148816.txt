Michael Jordan Enters the GOAT Discussion for... Sunday Night Football ?
Over the weekend, NBC rolled out a promo for next week's Sunday Night Football game between the New England Patriots and the Green Bay Packers, which will feature two of the best quarterbacks of all time, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. They both happen to wear the same jersey number, and that's the setup for a wink-wink ad starring ... Michael Jordan. Take it away, MJ:

The joke is that Jordan also shared a jersey number with a legend, in this case LeBron James, who most basketball fans agree is at least in the conversation for GOAT. (And for the record: This is a good commercial! It's funny! For about 20 seconds you actually wonder if Jordan bought airtime to challenge LeBron to a game of one-on-one! Which is not exactly an impossible scenario.)

So why, exactly, is Michael Jordan appearing in an NFL commercial? Ad Week provided the alleged answer.

Because the former NBA star is close with NBC Sports president of programming, Jon Miller, the company was able to successfully pitch him on the idea.

A few hours after the promo dropped, King James weighed in with a tweet:

Again: A good tweet! Also funny!
