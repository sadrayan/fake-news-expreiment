Petition · Outfit 7 : Return chat option to Talking Angela · Change.org
Talking Angela was a great app by Outfit 7 that let you actually talk to her. It is clear it's just a computer and there is no person watching you. There was an investigation that proved the rumors false. Many fans are now complaining why the chat option was removed from the game.

The game is now a shell if its former self, but, with your support, we will tell Outfit 7 we want it back! My goal is at least 200 signatures!
