Drug war death toll in Mexico since 2006 exceeds 28,000, official says
Calderon said in April that more than 22,700 people had died in drug violence since he took office.

The Mexican attorney general's office said a few weeks ago the death toll for the same time period stood at 24,826.

"Calderon and party probably never thought it would get this high," said Samuel Logan, founding director of Southern Pulse Networked Intelligence, an online information network focused on Latin America. "The acceleration year to year is an indication that things are likely to get worse before they get better. We are still on that footing."

Still, Logan cautioned that 90 percent to 95 percent on the fatalities are "bad guy versus bad guy."

The latest tallies were revealed at a summit Calderon held Tuesday called "Dialog for Security, Evaluation and Strengthening."

The president and other high functionaries, academics and security experts met in Mexico City and sat around a large table, calmly discussing the bloody struggle for control of the nation. They painted it as a matter of regaining control and rooting out corruption.

Around the same time, firefights broke out in Reynosa, a city in the border state of Tamaulipas. Residents there sat around their computers and posted comments on Twitter about the violence outside their doors.

"Shootouts, chases & several blocked highways in Reynosa," wrote Sergio Chapa, a reporter at KGBT-TV in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, who covers the border region.

Said a Twitter user who identified herself as DianaOlga, "Reynosa is in chaos at this moment there is no nextel, the streets are closed you can only hear the bullets."

Another person noted that his father had been shot and he was leaving for Reynosa first thing in the morning.

Many residents posted photos of blocked roads or people taking refuge during a gun battle.
