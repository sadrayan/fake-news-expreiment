Campaign Finance Database

Updated: February 14, 2018

Welcome to Wisconsinâ€™s premier searchable digital database of campaign contributors to candidates for state office in Wisconsin. Regularly updated, this database includes records of contributions of $100 or more from individuals to candidates for the Wisconsin Legislature as well as governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, state school superintendent and state Supreme Court justices.

The contributor records in this database generally date back to 1993, although in limited cases contributions dating as far back as 1989 are included. As of 2016, a new state law requires the disclosure of only the occupation of donors who give more than $200 in a calendar year. Previous state law required disclosure of both the occupation and employer of donors who gave more than $100 in a calendar year. Please note that, in general, contributions returned by the candidates are excluded from search results. (Click here to see a description of recent updates to the database.)

You have two options when searching for individual contributors. Use the simple search below to search by contributor, employer, city or candidate or use the advanced search to search by more varied criteria.

Contributions from political action committees (PACs) can be found elsewhere on our website.
