ONTX
Distress Centres is a service provide of Ontarioâ€™s Online and Text Crisis and Distress Service (ONTX).

The Online Chat & Text (ONTX) service allows individuals in the community to communicate with us without having to speak over the phone on one of our crisis lines. It is a safe, confidential, one-on-one conversation with a highly-trained volunteer responder.

Service users are able to take the time that they may need to process what they want to say, work through how they are feeling, and communicate with privacy in a way that is comfortable for them. It also ensures that others cannot overhear them while they are connecting with us.

We encourage those who would prefer to communicate with someone online or by text about their feelings, concerns or problems, to access our ONTX service which is available between 2pm to 2am each day and can be accessed via our website in the chat window or by texting 741741.

Our Responders Are Here To Help

Please remember that high-quality support is a two-way street and there is a code of conduct that we and you will adhere to. You will see it in the terms and conditions section you can agree to before your online chat session starts.
