He pulls out a Stag M4 with a Tru Glow scope on it. He got it so he could shoot coyotes!! Not really the right set up but anyway..

I said Stag makes a nice gun I got a few myself..

Then he said it.. "Best part is you can make it FULL-AUTO by just pushing out 1 pin"

I said "NO YOU CANT"

He argues with me a bit..

I tell him I will give him $1000.00 if he can do it right now.

Well my brother knows how he is in the Military.

I said NO HE CANT EITHER..



Any way he finally gave up then told me how he could make a 1911 Full-Auto..

I almost pulled my 1911 from my Crossbread Supertuck and said go for it but just shook my head and laughed..



I can shoot mine full auto with out any mods I can shoot mine full auto with out any mods
