2016: Annual Lecture 2016: Ideas to change the world
The Cabot Institute is the University of Bristol’s first flagship cross-disciplinary research institute, conducting world-leading research on the challenges arising from how we live with, depend on and affect our planet.

For each of our Annual Lectures to date, we’ve brought in speakers from around the world; this year we are showcasing some of our own researchers’ most exciting findings, many of which have occurred in partnership with you – our local, national and global collaborators.

Over the past six years our colleagues have made important discoveries, transformed our understanding of the environment, and helped save lives by improving responses to natural disasters around the world. Now we share some of the latest solutions to global-scale problems, developed by Cabot Institute researchers.

University, Community and City leaders will open by discussing their ambitions for a more sustainable Bristol and a more sustainable world. Cabot Institute experts will then present some of their most exciting ideas for tackling the environmental and social challenges we face in the 21st century. This will be followed by an open Q&A during which time we'll invite you to put your questions to the presenters.

Specifically-featured will be the unveiling of a new technology to generate electricity, with a prototype on display.
