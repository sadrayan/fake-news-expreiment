Today Burger King Is Offering An ‘Adult Meal’ With ‘Adult Toys’ For Some Saucy ‘Adult Fun’
Getting kid’s meals used to be the best thing ever. We all got to beg our parents to take us to shitty fast food restaurants so we could receive a two cent piece of plastic that would probably end up in the trash by spring cleaning. But the thrill was great, right?

The idea of getting a toy with a meal is like a double dose of dopamine for our simple-minded human brains. We get food, AND some kind of new material possession.

Well, this Valentine’s Day, Burger King decided that they shouldn’t just limit the “toy with meal” concept to just kids. They’ve created the “adult meal” that includes some “adult toys.”

The meal is exclusively offered to those 18-years-old and up, and is only available after 6:00pm. The possible “toys” include a blindfold, a feather duster, and a head massager.

It definitely looks like the “adult toys” aren’t a much higher quality than the kids toys. The meal also includes two beers, so you’ll basically have everything you could ever need for a fancy date night with your boo.

Tragically, if you thought that this great Valentine’s Day package might be your last minute V-Day plan, the King is being super stingy about where it is offered. It seems like this deal is exclusive to Burger King locations in Israel.

Because there would’ve been nothing better than dusting off your special someone with a sexy feather duster from…Burger King.
