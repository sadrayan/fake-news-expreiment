Perry defends letter to Hillary on Hannity show, Politico reports
Rick Perry responded on Sean Hannity’s radio show to a story Tuesday in the Daily Caller claiming he’d once sent a letter to Hillary Clinton praising her effort at pushing health care reform during her husband’s administration, according to Politico:

Perry said that the message he’d written to then-first lady Clinton had urged her to keep farmers in mind as a health care law came together, not endorse the measures the Clinton administration ended up proposing.

“If you’ll read that letter, it was straight out. Obviously, I was representing the agricultural rural interests in Texas,” Perry said. “It says listen, I hope as you go through this process for reforming health care in America, which I’m for, I didn’t want them collectively to overlook a very important constituency. My wife’s a nurse, her dad’s an old country doctor….I had no idea that was going to be the end product. What I thought they were going to work toward was trying to reform health care. Now we’ve got Obamacare.”
