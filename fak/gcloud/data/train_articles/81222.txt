Veterans call for end to asbestos lawsuit bill
Madison â€” Veterans opposed to a bill affecting asbestos-exposure lawsuits in Wisconsin urged Gov. Scott Walker on Monday to stop the measure, arguing that it would deny justice to asbestos victims.

The heavily lobbied proposal would require plaintiffs who have suffered from asbestos exposure to reveal how many businesses their attorneys plan to sue. They would also have to go after money from an asbestos trust before they could sue for more in court.

Proponents, including Wisconsin's chamber of commerce and Republican sponsors, argue the bill is needed to prevent filing multiple claims against both trust funds set up to pay victims of asbestos exposure as well as individual businesses.

Opponents who gathered Monday strongly disagreed.

"If you think that the bill is protecting the rights of victims, it is not. It is about protecting corporations," said a tearful Renee Simpson, state commander of the Wisconsin Veterans of Foreign Wars. She held up a picture of her dad, a U.S. Army veteran, who died in 2013 nine months after being diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer caused by asbestos exposure.

The Senate passed the bill last week on a narrow 17-16 vote. A similar version previously passed the Assembly and it's expected to pass again Thursday, the last day of the session, which would send it to Walker.

Walker said Monday in Milwaukee that he has heard from veterans on both sides of the issue, and he's waiting to see what happens in the Legislature.
