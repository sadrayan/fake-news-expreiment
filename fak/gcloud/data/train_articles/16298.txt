You have the right set of numbers, but of course we do not have comparable figures going back all that far in history especially given the limits of polling before the 1950s and 60s. But it certainly seems clear that the last two congresses are at the very low end of the spectrum since we've been recording these things systematically.

I’ve been peeking into the congressional approval results here and wondering how to pin the accuracy of a House member’s claim this week that the current Congress is the least popular in U.S. history.

Would you have a way to break this down?

Anyone else you’d recommend we consult?

Further thoughts?
