Correction --- Kuwait already had its own Trump-esque visa ban in place for five Muslim-majority countries

US President Donald Trump's

is nothing new to the rulers of Kuwait.

Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, Pakistanis and Afghans were not allowed to obtain visit, tourism or trade visas to Kuwait in 2011, in a move which pre-empted US restrictions on seven

.

Passport holders from the countries were not allowed to enter the Gulf state while the blanket ban was in place, and had been told not to apply to visas.

Kuwaiti sources originally told local media at the time that the restrictions were in place due to the "instability" in the five countries and that the ban would be lifted once the security situation improves.

Pakistan and Afghanistan continue to witness violence from extremist groups, while Syria and Iraq are embroiled in internal conflicts.

The ban, which was covered by a number of outlets including the BBC, appears to have been imposed unofficially. Local sources have told us that in 2011 and 2012, they attempted to bring in speakers from these countries for various events and were told that they could not. In certain instances, personal favours were granted by senior government officials allowing some visitors.

Although mainly peaceful, tensions between Iran and the Gulf have ratcheted up over the past year, with the GCC powers accusing Tehran of attempting to destabilise the region.

The State of Kuwait

reports that it planned to stop issuing visas to certain countries, but made no mention of what was reported by a number of agencies in 2011.
