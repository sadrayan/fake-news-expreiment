Anne Graham Lotz: 9/11 Was Warning From God About Evolution, Church-State Separation
Anne Graham Lotz, the daughter of evangelist Billy Graham, visited Iowa talk radio host Steve Deace today to discuss her new book, “The Daniel Prayer,” and once again urged Americans to turn to God in order to avoid divine wrath caused by things like church-state separation and the theory of evolution.

Lotz told Deace she was praying that “some of this craziness would settle down” in a nation that “seems to be shaking its fist in God’s face and telling him to get out of our politics, get out of our schools, get out of our businesses, get out of our marketplace, get off the streets” and is “basically abandoning God as a culture and as a nation.”

When we abandon God, she said, “the Bible says God abandons us and He backs away and takes His hand of favor, blessing, His hand of protection away from us and He abandons us.”

If Americans repent, she said, then “there will be peace on our streets” and God will begin to “reveal the plots of our enemies and terrorists before they are carried out” and “control the weather patterns and protect us from these violent storms that are taking human life.”

She added that “God allows bad things to happen” like the September 11 attacks and the mass shooting in San Bernardino “to show us that we need Him, you know, we’re desperate without him.”

She later told Deace that the U.S. is under the judgment of God in part because of the embrace of the theory of evolution, which started “this downward spiral away from God.”

If America does not return to God, she said, we’ll keep seeing “just the chaos at every level”… such as the Justice Department’s lawsuit against North Carolina for its new discriminatory anti-LGBT law, which she said is “evidence that God has backed away and he’s removed His hand of blessing, favor, protection, and he’s just turning us over to ourselves.”
