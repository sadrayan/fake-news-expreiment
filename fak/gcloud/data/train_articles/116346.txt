Trump's 2019 defense budget request seeks more troops and firepower to deter threats
The Trump administration's national security budget of $716 billion in fiscal 2019 would add more troops, combat aircraft and start rebuilding the Navy fleet while also supporting modernization of the nuclear triad and boosting research spending for cyber, electronic warfare, artificial intelligence and space.

"Clearly, this budget is targeted at high-end capabilities to deter and dissuade Russia and China," said Cowen defense analyst Roman Schweizer.

Defense officials briefing reporters Monday said the increased investment in defense was needed to confront new threats from rival superpowers as well as a more dangerous international security situation with rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. They also said the president's fiscal 2019 budget request was based on several key priorities, including accelerating warfighter readiness, cost-effective modernization and strengthened alliances, as well as a secure and effective nuclear deterrent.

"The United States faces an increasingly competitive and dangerous international security environment, characterized by the reemergence of great power competition with China and Russia, dangerous new technologies, empowered non-state actors, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction," the White House said in its budget document for the Department of Defense. "The budget requests resources needed to compete with great powers and others, deter conflict, and win the nation's wars."

The administration's fiscal year 2019 budget proposal of $716 billion for national security includes the Pentagon's budget request of $686 billion and funding for Department of Energy nuclear weapons programs. The Department of Defense's base operations budget is $617 billion and the overseas contingency operations fund is $69 billion.
