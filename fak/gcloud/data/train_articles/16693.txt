For a fact-check, what was Sen. Cruz’s basis for his statement here that Facebook shut down a Chik-Fil-A Appreciation Day?

Thanks,

So it looks like Huckabee’s posts about the appreciation day disappeared from Facebook July 24 and then returned by July 25. Am I reading the Huffington Post account correctly?

You are reading the same things we are. From reports, Facebook censored the event and after an uproar added it back. You’ll notice the other examples we listed are the same- censoring diamond and silk, catholic groups, etc. there have been several concerning examples about Facebook trying to silence conservatives yet zuckerberg could not give any examples of leftist groups being censored. Our goal is to ensure that Facebook remains neutral and a place where people of all backgrounds are free to speak and engage.

Below, I’m sharing responses from a Facebook spokeswoman, Sarah Pollack. It’s easiest read from the bottom up. We haven’t yet heard back from Mike Huckabee. I expect we’ll try to wrap this up about Wednesday or so of next week.

Anything more to consider?

Thanks,

HI Gardner,

I don’t have any further details because the event page didn’t violate any of our policies.

Thanks again,

Sarah

What policies were at issue?

Are (or were) the policies posted?

Hi Gardner,

You can attribute the following to a Facebook spokesperson:

In July 2012, this event was mistakenly removed by our automated systems after we received a report that content on the page violated our policies. The event did not violate our policies and we worked to restore it as soon as we were aware. The event page was restored within ten hours and is still live today.

Thanks,

Sarah

hey there, thanks - sure, this is exactly why Sen. Cruz raised the example in the hearing. The post should have never been taken down in the first place.

Catherine:

It looks to me like Huckabee’s events page devoted to the appreciation day was taken down by Facebook for 10-12 hours before it was restored where it remains.

It doesn’t yet look to us like the Aug. 1, 2012 appreciation day was shut down. According to the relevant events page, 653,000-plus people participated.

Anything else for us to consider?

I don't understand your question. Cruz said that an appreciation page was taken down, and it was, and Facebook admitted it was taken down and then restored after complaints.

There was no reason for the page to have ever been censored in the first place, which is why Sen. Cruz included it as one of several examples of conservative people/organization/efforts being wrongly targeted. His comments made in the hearing are factual.

I think we are squared away, if there's something i'm missing, let me know, thanks!

He said the day itself was shut down, per his Fox News commentary.

Hahahahaha! Are you serious?

Our oped cited examples of Facebook censoring conservatives, and yes one of those examples was them shutting down a page calling for a chick fil a appreciation day. Which indeed did happen and has been widely cited, and admitted to by Facebook.

Be my guest and nit pick our words all you’d like, anyone following this or reading this material understands that our claims are based in fact. Thanks Gardner, have a good day.
