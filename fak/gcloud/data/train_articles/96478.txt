HPBAs Wood Stove Changeout Program: HPBAs Wood Stove Changeout Program
Overview of Wood Stove Changeout Programs:

The Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association (HPBA)  in partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), local governments and industry partners  supports the Wood Stove Changeout Program.

Across North America, government officials and community leaders have begun to discover a cost-effective clean air solution that reduces excess smoke from old wood stoves and has a real impact on the lives of citizens by improving neighborhood air quality. This innovative program helps communities reduce emissions by providing consumers with incentives to remove old, dirty-burning wood stoves or wood heating appliances, and replace them with clean, efficient new heating appliances.
