PROGRESS: Harvard To Hold Blacks-Only Graduation Ceremony
I'm not "strawmanning your argument", I'm correcting you based on your own definitions.

You said that "racism is simply practical". I have provided the definition of racism and shown that, far from being practical, it is always impractical, because it is wrong.

It is in fact you that has provided the strawman. I never thoght you said that "race makes an outcome set in stone". I said that racism says that "all members of each race possess characteristics... so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race". This means that racism makes a judgement about someone's character based on their race, whereas that person could be an astronaut for all we know. Racism is a deterministic judgement which is inherently incorrect, therefore can never be practical. Another strawman is that I said it's immoral to be racist. In fact it's incorrect to be racist.

I think your problem comes about through a misunderstanding of what the word racism actually means. I see this a lot in Americans (I'm from UK we don't have our identity politics as bad as you do). I was trying to say that if you're making assessments on what the "average man" is within a certain area, you can come to conclusions that aren't racist. Saying it's a bad idea to indiscriminately let in hundreds of thousands of Sub-Saharan black people into the US, because they have an average IQ of 70 IS NOT racist. It would be racist to say that all black people from Sub-Saharan Africa should be stopped from coming, because there will be black people with 150 IQs in that population.

I'm not trying to cut you down, it was actually a big relief for me to figure out what the word racism actually meant, so I could stop people who wanted to tell me that certain sentiments I had were racist when they're not.
