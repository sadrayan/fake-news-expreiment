Al Gore’s sequel to his film “An Inconvenient Truth” will be released this Friday.

It’s called, “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power”, and The Daily Caller is previewing its release with another “inconvenient sequel” of a similar kind.

Check it out:

In just this past year, Gore burned through enough energy to power the typical American household for more than 21 years, according to a new report by the National Center for Public Policy Research. The former vice president consumed 230,889 kilowatt hours (kWh) at his Nashville residence, which includes his home, pool and driveway entry gate electricity meters. A typical family uses an average of 10,812 kWh of electricity per year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

But that’s only the beginning.

Gore won an Academy Award for “An Inconvenient Truth.”

In some months, I discovered, his residence gobbled up to 20 times more electricity than the average American household.

One day later, Drew Johnson of the National Center for Public Policy Research revealed “Gore’s hypocritically high electric bills.”

Those 33 solar panels generate about 12,000 kWh of electricity a year – way more than enough energy to power a typical American household. Gore is such an enormous energy hog, however, that his gigantic rooftop solar array produces just 5.7 percent of the electricity he uses in his home, or enough to power his home for a measly 21 days a year.

When Gore’s hypocrisy was revealed, he added 33 solar panels (costing him approximately $60,000) to his property and updated his home’s windows, ductwork, insulation, amongst other “energy-saving” projects.
