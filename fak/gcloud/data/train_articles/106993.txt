Friends of Black Rock High Rock
UPDATE (6/10/16): The Fly Ranch property, on which Fly Geyser resides, has been purchased by Burning Man. To find out more details about the purchase and plans for the property, please visit Burning Man’s blog. The blog includes a Q & A section to answer your questions. Please direct any inquiries about Fly Geyser to Burning Man.

Friends of Black Rock-High Rock DOES NOT have open access to Fly Geyser.

PLEASE DO NOT TRESPASS. Fly Geyser is still on private property.



Per Burning Man’s blog:

6. Can I go there?

Eventually, but not yet!

Purchasing the property is just the first step in a very long process.

Immediate access to the property is not possible (lots of scoping and planning must be completed first), but our intention is for it to be accessible in the future in an ongoing and sustainable way. The Black Rock Desert, home to Black Rock City, provides ample space but a shortage of time. Fly Ranch is a much smaller space, but with potential year-round access, it offers the gift of time. Eventually we’ll be able to create more opportunities spread out throughout the year.

Note: Do not try to visit Fly Ranch during Burning Man 2016. Seriously. Access will not be permitted. In the interest of personal safety, environmental protection, and liability, please stay in Black Rock City. We’re just not there yet, folks.

We will continue to post updates on Fly Geyser as they are relevant to our activities.
