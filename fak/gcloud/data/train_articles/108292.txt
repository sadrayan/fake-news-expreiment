Motshekga: Only 15% of South Africans read
The basic education minister says the top reasons why South Africa’s education system continues to rank low is because of violence, absenteeism and a poor reading culture.

JOHANNESBURG – The Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says the number one reason why South Africa’s education system continues to rank low in the international community is because of the absence of a reading culture.

Motshekga spoke after Transport Minister Dipuo Peters at the hope restoration ministries church in Kempton Park.

The education minister says its important faith based organisations encourage young people to read.

“South Africans don’t read. We don’t read in our homes and we don’t encourage our children to read. Even those who are educated don’t read.”

Motshekga says in South Africa research shows only 15% of the population reads.

“Besides just learning and teaching and getting these bright stars, there are lots of social issues. Education is a societal issue.”

Not so different from the department of transport, education has also highlighted the importance of engaging people through faith based organisations to speak to people.
