Sources:

2017 birth data come from National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 67, No. 8; leading cause of death data, including firearm, homicide, and drug poisoning mortality data, and infant mortality data come from CDC WONDER and rankings and rates are based on 2017 age-adjusted death rates. For more information on age-adjustment, refer to this report. States are categorized from highest rate to lowest rate. Although adjusted for variations in age-distribution and population size, differences by state do not take into account other state specific population characteristics that may affect the level of the birth characteristic or mortality. When the number of deaths or births events is small, differences by state may be unreliable due to instability in rates. When the number of deaths is small, rankings by state may be unreliable due to instability in death rates. Marriage and divorce data come from unpublished tables from the Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, CDC.
