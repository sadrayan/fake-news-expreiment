J.D. to Rick Scott: name names, show me “legal authority” for state plane sale
Gov. Rick Scott is on a political crash course with the Florida Senate’s powerful budget chief, J.D. Alexander, who wrote a letter Tuesday asking the governor to cite the “legal authority” for the way he sold two state planes.

Sen. J.D. Alexander said he believed the Feb. 11 transaction was unlawful because the governor failed to get the Legislature to sign off on the $3.67 million deal and kept some of the money from reaching the state treasury – a highly unusual transaction.

Alexander, who wrote a letter last week saying the deal wasn’t legal, wrote his follow-up Tuesday so that Scott would tell him specifically who advised the governor.

“In your response, please state specifically why this transaction did not violate Article VII, Section 1(c) of the Florida Constitution and Sections… [of] Florida Statutes,” Alexander wrote Tuesday. Alexander says he supports the sale of the planes, but opposes the way the governor handled the deal.

The governor’s office said Tuesday that Scott stands by his previous statements that the transaction was lawful.

“I reviewed that project step by step with our general counsel and we did the right thing,” Scott said Friday. “And it’s exactly what the taxpayers of this state want: they want to make sure that, as governor, I’m going to watch how you spend every dollar.”
