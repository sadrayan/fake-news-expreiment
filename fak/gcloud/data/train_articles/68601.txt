Child Care in America: 2016 State Fact Sheets
Families continue to struggle to afford quality child care. In addition, the child care workforce is underpaid and in need of critical professional development opportunities. These issues have been validated as a national priority by our current president and have also emerged as major themes for presidential candidates this election year. Finding solutions to these issues should be a priority for everyone across the country. The 2016 State Fact Sheets provide community leaders and policymakers with important data regarding the state of quality child care and early learning in their respective states.

This yearâ€™s Child Care in America: 2016 State Fact Sheet report (pdf) includes an introduction with an overview of the child care landscape and child care state fact sheets for each state plus the District of Columbia.

In addition, each state that responded to our survey will have three fact sheets (links to PDFs are under each state name):

2016 Facts about Child Care

2016 Facts about Child Care Resource and Referral Agency Activities

2016 Facts about State Initiatives (includes information on state initiatives for QRIS, family engagement, health, and emergency services)

Finally, we are pleased to include the 2016 Share Toolkit (doc), which includes social media content for Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, as well as shareable graphics.

We encourage you to use the 2016 State Fact Sheets to inform state and local policymakers on child care issues in your state and take action now by visiting our action center to advocate for child care with our state and national leaders!
