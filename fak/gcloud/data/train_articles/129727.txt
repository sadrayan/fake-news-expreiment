The Salvation Army Western Territory
Assess the Need FIRST, we assess the needs of each community in which we serve. We work to understand the obstacles, hardships and challenges native to the area's particular population.

Build the Programs NEXT, we build local programs designed to offer immediate relief, short-term care and long-term growth in the areas that will best benefit the community.
