League of Conservation Voters Applauds Senators for Signing Onto Sanders-Boxer Global Warming Bill

Obama and Clinton Add Momentum To Growing Support To Address Global Warming

WASHINGTON, DC – League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Legislative Director Tiernan Sittenfeld issued this statement following news that Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have signed onto the Sanders-Boxer Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act (S. 309):

“The League of Conservation Voters applauds the growing list of Senators who have signed on to co-sponsor the Sanders-Boxer Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act. This week, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton added momentum to the increasing number of Senators who support the bill, including Senators Sanders, Boxer, Akaka, Dodd, Feingold, Inouye, Kennedy, Lautenberg, Leahy, Menendez, Reed and Whitehouse.

Global warming and clean, renewable energy are emerging as the most important environmental, national security and economic challenges we face – and this science-based legislation puts a comprehensive framework for addressing these issues into place.

The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act requires an 80 percent reduction in global warming emissions by 2050, establishes a renewable electricity standard, reduces pollution from cars and trucks and improves energy efficiency. The bill also offers a “cap and trade” program that provides flexibility for companies meeting global warming pollution reduction goals.

We applaud the Senators who are cosponsoring this important bill --- and we urge other members of the Senate to sign onto this legislation to curb global warming and help our country secure a brighter future.”
