Alabama Crimson Tide's streak of 72 straight games as favorite in jeopardy
The No. 12 Crimson Tide allows just 92 yards of offense from the Louisiana Monroe Warharks, while Jacob Coker throws for three touchdowns in a 34-0 win.

Georgia will open as a 1-point favorite over Alabama on Sunday afternoon, a Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook spokesman told ESPN.

If Georgia remains the favorite for Saturday's kickoff, it will end Alabama's streak as a favorite for 72 consecutive games, stretching over five years. It's the longest streak in college football history.

The last time Alabama was an underdog was in the 2009 SEC title game against Florida. Alabama, a 5-point underdog, upset Florida 32-13.

Since Nick Saban arrived at Alabama in 2007, the Crimson Tide have been favored in 106 of 114 games. Alabama won four of its eight games as an underdog, all in 2007 and 2009.
