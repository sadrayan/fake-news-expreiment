Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Graces the August Cover of ESSENCE
He's got tree-trunk arms, granite thighs and enough strength to lift a grown man over his head. Still, action star Dwayne Johnson's best feature may be his irresistable charm.

The summer just got a little steamier! Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is the cover star of the August issue of ESSENCE, wearing a form-fitted T (yum!) and a smile that will leave you weak in the knees.

The sexy star is having a very big year thus far, releasing back-to-back blockbusters in several months, starring in Snitch; G.I. Joe: Retaliation; Pain & Gain; and Fast & Furious 6. While we're happy for his success, we're more interested in more, ahem, intimate affairs of the heart.

Johnson tells our senior writer Jeannine Amber that "engaging in good conversation" is essential in a healthy relationship, but "embracing the power of kissing" doesn't hurt.

What else does the sexy brother need in a relationship? "I want someone who can trust that my big hands are going to take care of them."

Johnson also describes how divorce helped him be a better man. "I want to be a man who is truthful and who won't let pride get in the way of my ripping myself open to my partner and saying, 'Here I am. This is me.' I feel there's something powerful when a man reaches a point in his life when he can be completely vulnerable."
