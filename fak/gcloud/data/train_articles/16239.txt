To recap, more pro-life legislation has passed under Byron Cook’s leadership as Chairman of the State Affairs Committee than during any prior time in Texas’ past. Blake Rocap wasn’t able to stop any of a long list of measures that passed:

2011: Sonogram law, PP de-funded, Choose Life license plates passed

2013: HB 2

2015: reformed parental consent laws, added training to abortion clinic personnel to recognize sex trafficking victims, passed a bill to provide helpful (non-abortion) referrals to protect babies with Down syndrome from abortion and reformed Texas Advanced Directives Act to protect food and water for critically ill patients.

Blake Rocap was not successful in stopping any of this legislation, and Chairman Byron Cook was a tremendous help in passing this legislation, from recruiting bill authors and shepherding the bills all the way through the process.

So, pants on fire to both Rocap who claimed he stopped pro-life legislation AND pants on fire to both Conway for suggesting Republicans are blocking pro-life legislation.
