Influenza Virus Characterization:

Close monitoring of influenza viruses is required to better assess the potential impact on public health. CDC characterizes influenza viruses through one or more tests including genomic sequencing and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (i.e., hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and/or neutralization assays). These data are used to monitor for changes in circulating influenza viruses and to compare how similar currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing influenza vaccines. Antigenic and genetic characterization of circulating influenza viruses can give an indication of the influenza vaccine's ability to produce an immune response against the wide array of influenza viruses co-circulating, but annual vaccine effectiveness estimates are needed to determine how much protection has been provided to the population by vaccination.

For nearly all influenza-positive surveillance samples received at CDC, next-generation sequencing is performed to determine the genetic identity of circulating influenza viruses and to monitor viruses for evidence of genetic changes. Viruses are classified into genetic clades/subclades based on analysis of the genetic sequences of the HA gene segments. However, genetic changes do not always result in antigenic change. Extensive genetic variation may exist in circulating viruses, with no evidence of substantial antigenic drift. Antigenic drift is evaluated by comparing cell-propagated circulating viruses with cell-propagated reference viruses representing currently recommended vaccine components.

CDC has antigenically or genetically characterized 1,365 influenza viruses collected during October 1, 2017 – February 3, 2018, and submitted by U.S. laboratories, including 276 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 695 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 394 influenza B viruses.

A (H1N1)pdm09: Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes from 276 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed that all belonged to clade 6B.1. Two hundred five A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized, and all were antigenically similar (analyzed using HI with ferret antisera) to the reference 6B.1 virus A/Michigan/45/2015, representing the recommended influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 reference virus for the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.

A (H3N2): Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes from 695 A(H3N2) viruses revealed extensive genetic diversity with multiple clades/subclades co-circulating. The HA genes of circulating viruses belonged to clade 3C.2a (n=577), subclade 3C.2a1 (n=108) or clade 3C.3a (n=10). Two hundred sixty-two influenza A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized, and 257 (98.1%) A(H3N2) viruses tested were well-inhibited (reacting at titers that were within fourfold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera raised against A/Michigan/15/2014 (3C.2a), a cell propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like reference virus representing the A(H3N2) component of 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.

Influenza B Viruses

B/Victoria: Phylogenetic analysis of 56 B/Victoria-lineage viruses indicate that all HA genes belonged to genetic clade V1A, the same genetic clade as the vaccine reference virus, B/Brisbane/60/2008. However, a number of viruses had a 6-nucleotide deletion (encoding amino acids 162 and 163) in the HA (abbreviated as V1A-2Del). Seventeen (58.6%) B/Victoria lineage viruses were well-inhibited by ferret antisera raised against cell -propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008 reference virus, representing a recommended B virus component of 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Twelve (41.4%) B/Victoria lineage viruses reacted poorly (at titers that were 8-fold or greater reduced compared with the homologous virus titer) with ferret antisera raised against cell-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008, and these viruses had the V1A-2Del HA.

B/Yamagata: Phylogenetic analysis of 338 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses indicate that the HA genes belonged to clade Y3. A total of 202 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were antigenically characterized, and all were antigenically similar to cell propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013, the reference vaccine virus representing the influenza B/Yamagata-lineage component of the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent vaccines.

The majority of U.S. viruses submitted for characterization come from state and local public health laboratories. Due to Right Size Roadmap considerations, specimen submission guidance to laboratories is that, if available, 2 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 2 influenza A(H3N2), and 2 influenza B viruses be submitted every other week.. Therefore, the numbers of each virus type/subtype characterized should be more balanced across subtypes/lineages but will not reflect the actual proportion of circulating viruses. In the figure below, the results of tests performed by public health labs are shown on the left and CDC sequence results (by genetic clade/subclade) are shown on the right.

Antiviral Resistance:

Testing of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B virus isolates for resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) is performed at CDC using a functional assay. Additional influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A (H3N2) viruses from clinical samples are tested for mutations known to confer oseltamivir resistance. The data summarized below combine the results of both testing methods. These samples are routinely obtained for surveillance purposes rather than for diagnostic testing of patients suspected to be infected with antiviral-resistant virus.

High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A (H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented below.

Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Testing Results on Samples Collected Since October 1, 2017

Oseltamivir Zanamivir Peramivir Virus Samples tested (n) Resistant Viruses, Number (%) Virus Samples tested (n) Resistant Viruses, Number (%) Virus Samples tested (n) Resistant Viruses, Number (%) Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 376 4 (1.1) 265 0 (0.0) 376 4 (1.1) Influenza A (H3N2) 903 0 (0.0) 903 0 (0.0) 638 0 (0.0) Influenza B 387 0 (0.0) 387 0 (0.0) 387 0 (0.0)

On December 27, 2017, a Health Advisory was released by CDC providing: 1) a notice about increased influenza A(H3N2) activity and its clinical implications; 2) a summary of influenza antiviral drug treatment recommendations; 3) an update about approved treatment drugs and supply this season; and 4) background information for patients about influenza treatment. More information is available at https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00409.asp

The majority of recently circulating influenza viruses are susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications, oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir; however, rare sporadic instances of oseltamivir-resistant and peramivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been detected worldwide. Antiviral treatment as early as possible is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for serious influenza-related complications. Additional information on recommendations for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza virus infection with antiviral agents is available at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/index.htm

Based on National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality surveillance data available on February 8, 2018, 10.1% of the deaths occurring during the week ending January 20, 2018 (week 3) were due to P&I. This percentage is above the epidemic threshold of 7.3% for week 3.

Background: Weekly mortality surveillance data include a combination of machine coded and manually coded causes of death collected from death certificates. Percentages of deaths due to P&I are higher among manually coded records than more rapidly available machine coded records. There is currently a delay in manual coding for deaths occurring in 2018. Because of this delay initially reported P&I percentages will be lower than those calculated from the final data.

Region and state-specific data are available at http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/mortality.html.

Ten influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC during week 5. Four deaths were associated with an influenza A(H3) virus and occurred during weeks 3 and 4 (the weeks ending January 20, and January 27, 2018, respectively). Three deaths were associated with an influenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed and occurred during weeks 52, 4, and 5 (the weeks ending December 30, 2017, January 27, and February 3, 2018, respectively). Three deaths were associated with an influenza B virus and occurred during weeks 2 and 4 (the weeks ending January 13, and January 27, 2018, respectively).

A total of 63 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the 2017-2018 season.

The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in children younger than 18 years of age (since the 2003-2004 influenza season) and adults (since the 2005-2006 influenza season).

The FluSurv-NET covers more than 70 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states (CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM, NY, OR, and TN) and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. The IHSP began during the 2009-2010 season to enhance surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. IHSP sites included IA, ID, MI, OK and SD during the 2009-2010 season; ID, MI, OH, OK, RI, and UT during the 2010-2011 season; MI, OH, RI, and UT during the 2011-2012 season; IA, MI, OH, RI, and UT during the 2012-2013 season; and MI, OH, and UT during the 2013-2014, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18 seasons.

Data gathered are used to estimate age-specific hospitalization rates on a weekly basis, and describe characteristics of persons hospitalized with influenza illness. The rates provided are likely to be an underestimate as influenza-related hospitalizations can be missed, either because testing is not performed, or because cases may be attributed to other causes of pneumonia or other common influenza-related complications.

A total of 17,101 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported between October 1, 2017 and February 3, 2018. The overall hospitalization rate was 59.9 per 100,000 population. The highest rate of hospitalization was among adults aged ≥65 years (263.6 per 100,000 population), followed by adults aged 50-64 (63.1 per 100,000 population) and children aged 0-4 years (40.0 per 100,000 population). Among 17,101 hospitalizations, 14,770 (86.4%) were associated with influenza A virus, 2,251 (13.2%) with influenza B virus, 43 (0.3%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 37 (0.2%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 3,308 (86.1%) were A(H3N2) and 533 (13.9%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

Among 1,955 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 1,325 (67.8%) had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, obesity, and chronic lung disease. Among 192 hospitalized children with information on underlying medical conditions, 97 (50.5%) had at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were asthma, neurologic disorder, and obesity. Among 151 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-44 years) with information on pregnancy status, 36 (23.8%) were pregnant.

Data from the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), a population-based surveillance for influenza related hospitalizations in children and adults in 13 U.S. states. Cumulative incidence rates are calculated using the National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) population estimates for the counties included in the surveillance catchment area.

FluSurv-NET data are preliminary and displayed as they become available. Therefore, figures are based on varying denominators as some variables represent information that may require more time to be collected. Data are refreshed and updated weekly. Asthma includes a medical diagnosis of asthma or reactive airway disease; Cardiovascular diseases include conditions such as coronary heart disease, cardiac valve disorders, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension; does not include isolated hypertension; Chronic lung diseases include conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, chronic aspiration pneumonia, and interstitial lung disease; Immune suppression includes conditions such as immunoglobulin deficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, HIV/AIDS, and individuals taking immunosuppressive medications; Metabolic disorders include conditions such as diabetes mellitus; Neurologic diseases include conditions such as seizure disorders, cerebral palsy, and cognitive dysfunction; Neuromuscular diseases include conditions such as multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy; Obesity was assigned if indicated in patient's medical chart or if body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2; Pregnancy percentage calculated using number of female cases aged between 15 and 44 years of age as the denominator; Renal diseases include conditions such as acute or chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, and impaired creatinine clearance; No known condition indicates that the case did not have any known high risk medical condition indicated in medical chart at the time of hospitalization.

(ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) and cough and/or sore throat.) Nationwide during week 5, 7.7% of patient visits reported through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) were due to influenza-like illness (ILI). This percentage is above the national baseline of 2.2%.

Additional ILINet data, including national, regional and select state-level data, are available at http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html

On a regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 3.4% to 12.5% during week 5. All 10 regions reported percentages of outpatient visits for ILI at or above their region specific baselines.

Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state. Activity levels are based on the percent of outpatient visits in a state due to ILI and are compared to the average percent of ILI visits that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation. Activity levels range from minimal, which would correspond to ILI activity from outpatient clinics being below, or only slightly above, the average, to high, which would correspond to ILI activity from outpatient clinics being much higher than average.

During week 5, the following ILI activity levels were experienced:

New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 43 states experienced high activity (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming).

Three states experienced moderate ILI activity (Hawaii, Idaho, and Washington).

Two states experienced low ILI activity (North Dakota and Utah).

Two states experienced minimal ILI activity (Maine and Montana).

*This map uses the proportion of outpatient visits to health care providers for ILI to measure the ILI activity level within a state. It does not, however, measure the extent of geographic spread of flu within a state. Therefore, outbreaks occurring in a single city could cause the state to display high activity levels.

Data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a state, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the whole state.

Data displayed in this map are based on data collected in ILINet, whereas the State and Territorial flu activity map is based on reports from state and territorial epidemiologists. The data presented in this map are preliminary and may change as more data are received.

Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some state health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the state likely being the more complete.

The influenza activity reported by state and territorial epidemiologists indicates geographic spread of influenza viruses, but does not measure the severity of influenza activity.

Additional data can be found at https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/FluView8.html

During week 5, the following influenza activity was reported:

Widespread influenza activity was reported by Puerto Rico and 48 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming).

Regional influenza activity was reported by two states (Hawaii and Oregon).

Local influenza activity was reported by the District of Columbia and Guam.

Sporadic activity was reported by the U.S. Virgin Islands.
