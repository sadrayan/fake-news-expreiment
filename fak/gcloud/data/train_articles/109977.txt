Daily Debate results: Did Dillon Danis get a fair punishment for UFC 229 brawl?
Bellator welterweight Dillon Danis was cageside at UFC 229 this past October in Las Vegas supporting Conor McGregor.

It’s been well documented what happened after Khabib Nurmagomedov forced McGregor to tap in the fourth round to retain his lightweight title. Nurmagomedov leapt the cage and went after Danis in the stands, touching off a post-fight melee that has caused numerous suspensions and fines.

Monday, Danis was the latest fighter to be issued a fine and suspension by the NEvada State Athletic Commission. Despite his claim that he merely was defending himself, Danis was suspended seven months and fined $7,500. He’ll be eligible to return in May.

In January, McGregor was suspended six months and fined $50,000 for his role in the brawl. Nurmagomedov, by instigating the melee, received a nine-month term and $500,000 fine.

In our latest Daily Debate, we wondered if you think Danis’ punishment was fair. He got a month more than McGregor and just two months less than Nurmagomedov, and if Nurmagomedov agreed to do a PSA for the NSAC, his suspension would’ve been just six months. (Both Nurmagomedov and McGregor’s fines were signifcantly higher than Danis’ $7,500.)
