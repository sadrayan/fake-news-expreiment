Debate Commission Fires Back After Trump Criticizes Schedule
The Commission on Presidential Debates signaled Sunday that it does not intend to reschedule the upcoming presidential debates, despite complaints from Republican nominee Donald Trump about conflicts with NFL football.

“It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles,” the commission said in a statement. “A debate has never been rescheduled as a result.”

The statement went on to note, “The CPD believes the dates for the 2016 debates will serve the American public well.”

Trump on Saturday took to Twitter to criticize the schedule of debates between him and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!”

The commission has scheduled three debates between the nominees — Sept. 26, Oct. 9 and Oct. 19. The first two debates would conflict NFL games.

Trump told ABC News Saturday, “I got a letter from the NFL saying, ‘This is ridiculous. Why are the debates against?’ ‘Cause the NFL doesn’t wanna go against the debates.” An NFL spokesperson later denied that the league had sent Trump any such letter.
