The agencies funded through this bill provide oversight of executive branch agencies, including objective, nonpartisan, and timely audits and analysis of Federal programs. The funding in this bill also ensures that the public has permanent access to printed and electronic information products of the Federal Government. All accounts in the bill have been examined in detail to ensure that the funding provided is appropriate for the agencies to carry out their responsibilities and to continue to respond to Congress in a timely and accurate manner. Details on the accounts, the funding levels provided, and the Committee's justification for the funding levels are included in the report. Conforming to longstanding practice under which each body of Congress determines its own housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without intervention, funds for the House are included in the bill at the level approved by the House on May 1, 2014 in H.R. 4487. The Committee recommends new budget (obligational) authority of $4,300,000,000 for the legislative branch for fiscal year 2015. This total is $164,900,207 below the budget request and $41,652,000 above the fiscal year 2014 appropriation. The bill includes $869,663,732 for the operations of the Senate, which is $37,608,700 below the fiscal year 2015 request. The bill includes $600,000,000 for the Architect of the Capitol to maintain, improve, and construct buildings and facilities for the Congress. The recommendation for the Architect of the Capitol is $76,631,000 below the fiscal year 2015 request, but includes $21,222,000, the total amount of funding requested, for completion of Phase IIC of the plan to restore the U.S. Capitol Dome. The recommendation would allow for comprehensive repairs and life-safety systems improvements to remain on schedule in a manner that does not interfere with Presidential Inaugurals. The bill also includes $344,047,998 for the Capitol Police; $523,153,499 for the Government Accountability Office; $586,032,498 for the Library of Congress; and $122,109,273 for the Government Publishing Office, which is renamed from the Government Printing Office in section 2 of the bill. Reprogramming Guidelines.--The Committee expects all agencies to notify the Committee of any significant departures from budget plans presented to the Committee in any agency's budget justifications. In particular, agencies funded through this bill are required to notify the Committee prior to each reprogramming of funds in excess of the lesser of 10 percent or $500,000 between programs, projects or activities, or in excess of $500,000 between object classifications (except for shifts within the pay categories, object class 11, 12, and 13 or as further specified in each agency's respective section). This includes cumulative reprogrammings that together total at least $500,000 from or to a particular program, activity, or object classification as well as reprogramming of FTEs or funds to create new organizational entities within the Agency or to restructure entities which already exist. The Committee desires to be notified of reprogramming actions which involve less than the above-mentioned amounts if such actions would have the effect of changing an agency's funding requirements in future years or if programs or projects specifically cited in the Committee's reports are affected. The Committee directs each entity funded by this act to submit an execution plan, within 60 days of enactment, to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate to establish a baseline for reprogramming and transfer authorities for fiscal year 2015.

SENATORS' OFFICIAL PERSONNEL AND OFFICE EXPENSE ACCOUNT Appropriations, 2014.................................... $390,000,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 429,724,200 House allowance......................................................... Committee recommendation................................ 390,000,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation for fiscal year 2015 of $390,000,000 for the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account [SOPOEA]. The recommendation is equal to the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $39,274,200 below the fiscal year 2015 request. Of the funding provided, $19,109,214 is available until September 30, 2017. This account funds salaries and benefits of Senators' staffs as well as the office expense allowance for Senators' offices. The SOPOEA is comprised of three components. Two of these are for salaries of personnel in Senators' offices. The allowance for administrative and clerical assistance is based on the population of States, beginning with States with a population of fewer than 5 million people to States with a population of 28 million or more. The table illustrates the allowances per population category and the States which fall into those categories. The estimate for fiscal year 2015 totals $256,833,548. The second component of the salaries allowance is for legislative assistance to Senators, as authorized by Public Law 95-94. This allowance provides funding for three positions in each Senator's office for a total of $477,874 per office, or $47,787,400 for all 100 Senators. The third component of the SOPOEA account is for official office expenses and totals $18,921,204. Each Senator's office is allocated an amount for office expenses, as displayed in the following table. In addition, an amount of $200,000 is provided to cover additional expenses that may be incurred in the event of the death or resignation of a Senator, and to provide for transitional expenses during election years subject to regulations set by the Committee on Rules and Administration with respect to official mail. It should be noted that the amounts provided for the various components of the SOPOEA are interchangeable. Amounts provided for salaries may be used for expenses, and vice versa, subject to regulations set by the Committee on Rules and Administration with respect to official mail. It should also be noted that the figures in the following table are preliminary, and that official notification of member budgets is issued by the Financial Clerk of the Senate after enactment of this bill. The following table illustrates the several components of the SOPOEA.

TOTAL............................... 256,833,548 47,787,400 18,921,204 323,542,152 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- According to the most recent employment data compiled by the Secretary of the Senate, as of April 30, 2014, there were 4,139 individuals employed in Senators' offices throughout the United States and covered by this appropriation. In addition to providing funds for compensation of employees within Senators' offices, this appropriation also provides for agency contributions for those employees; that is, the Senate's share, as an employer, of the various employee benefit programs for which Senate employees are eligible. These payments are mandatory, and fluctuate according to the programs in which employees are enrolled, the level of compensation, and the degree of participation. Budget requests for this account prepared by the Financial Clerk must be based on both experience and evaluation of trends. The fiscal year 2015 funding level for this account anticipates $126,750,000 in agency contribution costs. The amount recommended by the Committee for the SOPOEA is less than would be required to cover all obligations that could be incurred under the authorized allowances for all Senators. The Committee is able to recommend an appropriation of a lesser amount than potentially necessary because Senators typically do not obligate funds up to the absolute ceiling of their respective allowances. SENATE OFFICIAL MAIL COSTS Appropriations, 2014.................................... $281,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 300,000 House allowance......................................................... Committee recommendation................................ 300,000 For the official mail costs of the Senate, the Committee recommends an appropriation of $300,000 which is equal to the fiscal year 2015 request. Administrative Provisions Sec. 1. This provision eliminates an outdated requirement that the Secretary of the Senate purchase newspaper advertisements to solicit bids for procuring stationary products for the Senate. This provision also eliminates the requirement that the Secretary of the Senate follow a specific, yet outdated, procurement process. In lieu of the outdated process, this provision enables the Secretary of the Senate to utilize the competitive procurement process administered by the General Services Administration. This provision will decrease Federal spending by eliminating spending on newspaper advertisements and also potentially by lowering the cost of Senate stationary products because such products will be purchased through a procurement process designed to maximize competition and minimize price. Sec. 2. This provision eliminates the requirement that Senate candidates submit campaign filings the Secretary of the Senate. Under current law, the Secretary of the Senate compiles filings, which are submitted in paper, and transmits them manually to the Federal Election Commission [FEC]. FEC staff manually key the information into electronic databases in order to post the information online, consistent with campaign finance disclosure requirements. This provision eliminates the requirement for paper submissions and manual processing by requiring Senate candidates to submit campaign filings directly to the FEC in electronic format, identical to current requirements for candidates for the House of Representatives and the Presidency. This provision will eliminate the need for one full time equivalent [FTE] position within in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, decreasing Federal spending by $88,000. The funding recommendation for ``Salaries, Officers, and Employees, Office of the Secretary'' has been reduced by $88,000 to reflect this provision. House of Representatives Appropriations, 2014.................................... $1,180,910,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 1,200,509,775 House allowance......................................... 1,180,736,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,180,736,000 In keeping with the longstanding tradition of comity between the Houses on matters pertaining solely to one House, the Committee has included funds for the House of Representatives, and five administrative provisions related to the House of Representatives, as recommended by the House in H.R. 4487, as passed by the House on May 1, 2014. As this item pertains solely to the House, the Committee makes no independent judgment on the House allowance. JOINT ITEMS Joint Economic Committee Appropriations, 2014.................................... $4,203,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 4,270,000 House allowance......................................... 4,203,000 Committee recommendation................................ 4,246,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $4,246,000 for the Joint Economic Committee [JEC]. The recommendation is $43,000 above the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $24,000 below the fiscal year 2015 request. The Joint Economic Committee was created by the Employment Act of 1946. The primary tasks of the JEC are to review economic conditions and to recommend improvements in economic policy. The JEC performs research and economic analysis, and monitors and analyzes current economic, financial, and employment conditions. Joint Committee on Taxation Appropriations, 2014.................................... $10,004,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 10,149,000 House allowance......................................... 10,004,000 Committee recommendation................................ 10,095,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $10,095,000 for salaries and expenses of the Joint Committee on Taxation. The recommendation is $91,000 above the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $54,000 below the fiscal year 2015 request. Of the funding provided, $9,091,000 is for salaries, as requested, and $1,004,000 is for expenses. The Joint Committee is established under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to: --investigate the operation and effects of internal revenue taxes and the administration of such taxes; --investigate measures and methods for the simplification of such taxes; --make reports to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance (or to the House and the Senate) on the results of such investigations and studies and to make recommendations; and --review any proposed refund or credit of income or estate and gift taxes or certain other taxes set forth in Code section 6405 in excess of $2,000,000. In addition to these functions that are specified in the Internal Revenue Code, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the Joint Committee to provide revenue estimates for all tax legislation considered by either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Office of the Attending Physician Appropriations, 2014.................................... $3,400,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 3,371,000 House allowance......................................... 3,371,000 Committee recommendation................................ 3,371,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,371,000 for the Office of the Attending Physician. The recommendation is $29,000 below the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and equal to the fiscal year 2015 request. The Office was first established by House Resolution 253, adopted December 5, 1928. Office of Congressional Accessibility Services Appropriations, 2014.................................... $1,387,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 1,405,000 House allowance......................................... 1,387,000 Committee recommendation................................ 1,400,000 The Committee recommends $1,400,000 for the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services. This office is a successor to the Special Services Office following enactment of the Capitol Visitor Center Act of 2008. The Office of Congressional Accessibility Services [OCAS] provides and coordinates accessibility services for individuals with disabilities, including Members of Congress, staff, and visitors to the U.S. Capitol complex. These services include sign language interpreting, adaptive tours, and wheelchair loans. OCAS also provides information regarding accessibility for individuals with disabilities, as well as related training and staff development to Members of Congress and employees of the Senate and House of Representatives. CAPITOL POLICE Appropriations, 2014.................................... $338,459,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 355,663,000 House allowance......................................... 347,959,000 Committee recommendation................................ 344,047,998 The United States Capitol Police [USCP] is charged with the protection of the United States Congress, its legislative processes, Members, employees, visitors and facilities within the U.S. Capitol complex from crime, disruption or terrorism, so that the Congress may fulfill its constitutional responsibilities in a safe and open environment. The Committee recommends $344,047,998 for the USCP. The recommendation is $5,588,998 above the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $11,615,002 below the fiscal year 2015 request. Salaries Appropriations, 2014.................................... $279,000,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 291,403,000 House allowance......................................... 286,500,000 Committee recommendation................................ 284,588,499 The amount provided covers salaries, benefits, and overtime costs. USCP personnel are also eligible for hazardous duty pay and comparability pay similar to locality pay adjustments granted other Federal law enforcement personnel in the Washington, DC, area. The Committee recommends $284,588,499 and 2,145 FTEs for USCP salaries, which is $5,588,499 above the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $6,814,501 below the fiscal year 2015 request. The total staffing level is expected to be approximately 1,775 sworn and 370 civilian staff under the Committee recommendation. USCP Office of Inspector General.--The Committee values the work of the USCP Office of Inspector General to investigate and report on waste, fraud, and abuse and to identify and make recommendations to improve USCP operations. The Committee includes funds to support not less than six FTEs within the USCP Office of Inspector General. The Committee notes that additional oversight of the USCP is conducted by the Government Accountability Office to supplement the work of the USCP Office of Inspector General, as needed. Overtime.--The Committee recommends no more than $23,425,000 for overtime in fiscal year 2015. This provides for approximately 394,756 hours of additional duty. The Committee notes that overtime pay is a standard practice law enforcement entities utilize to respond to unscheduled and unanticipated events. However, the Committee finds that keeping overtime pay at a minimum should continue to be a goal of the USCP. The Committee appreciates the efforts of the USCP to better track and manage overtime pay in order to keep overtime costs to a minimum. The Committee directs the USCP to continue to keep the Committee apprised of these efforts. The Committee directs the USCP to provide for overtime in accordance with the budget request, as provided for in the following table. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Funding Hours (est.) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Scheduled, (including training)........ $22,009,000 371,056 Unscheduled............................ 1,195,000 20,000 LOC--non-reimbursable events........... 221,000 3,700 -------------------------------- Total............................ 23,425,000 394,756 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The recommendation includes $1,000,000 for USCP overtime within the AOC account for requirements associated with the restoration of the U.S. Capitol Dome. The Committee expects the USCP to operate within that funding level for requirements associated with these projects. The Committee directs the USCP to provide for any additional requirement costs beyond that allocation. General Expenses Appropriations, 2014.................................... $59,459,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 64,260,000 House allowance......................................... 61,459,000 Committee recommendation................................ 59,459,499 Expenses include office supplies and equipment, communications, motor vehicles, uniforms and equipment, investigations, training, and miscellaneous items. The Committee recommends $59,459,499 for general expenses, which is $499 above the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $4,800,501 below the fiscal year 2015 request. OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE Salaries and Expenses Appropriations, 2014.................................... $3,868,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 4,020,000 House allowance......................................... 3,959,000 Committee recommendation................................ 3,959,000 The Office of Compliance [OOC] is an independent nonpartisan agency established to administer and enforce the Congressional Accountability Act [CAA]. The OOC administers the dispute resolution system established to resolve disagreements that arise under the CAA; carries out an education and training program for the regulated community on the rights and responsibilities of the CAA; and advises Congress on needed changes and amendments to the CAA. The OOC General Counsel has independent investigatory and enforcement authority for certain violations of the CAA. The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,959,000 for the salaries and expenses of the OOC, which is $91,000 above the fiscal year 2014 enacted level and $61,000 below the fiscal year 2015 request. Administrative Provision Sec. 1001. This provision allows the Office of Compliance to send certain notifications to employees electronically. The Office of Compliance reports that enacting this provision will save over $10,000 annually. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE Salaries and Expenses Appropriations, 2014.................................... $45,700,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 46,078,000 House allowance......................................... 45,700,000 Committee recommendation................................ 46,057,000 The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] is responsible for providing to the Congress objective, nonpartisan, and timely analyses to aid in economic and budgetary decisions on the wide array of programs covered by the Federal budget, and the information and estimates required for the congressional budget process. The Committee recommends an appropriation of $46,057,000 for the CBO. The recommendation is $357,000 above the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $21,000 below the fiscal year 2015 request. The reduction to the request solely represents updated technical assumptions and therefore the Committee recommendation fully funds CBO's request for fiscal year 2015. Federal Savings and Costs of Energy Savings Performance Contracts and Utility Energy Services Contracts.--The Committee supports the use of Energy Savings Performance Contracts [ESPCs] and Utility Energy Services Contracts [UESCs] to implement energy efficiency projects that reduce emissions, energy consumption, and energy costs. The Government never pays more for energy as a result of entering into an ESPC--the cost of making energy efficiency upgrades is paid back over time out of the Government's monthly energy savings. Once the term of an ESPC or UESC is complete, the Government retains all energy savings. Within the legislative branch, the Architect of the Capitol [AOC] has reduced energy consumption by 25.2 percent over the last 10 years, exceeding the statutory goal of 21 percent for Federal facilities, largely by utilizing ESPCs. The Committee finds that the AOC's experience should be a model for other Federal agencies to implement other energy efficiency projects at no increased cost to the taxpayer for energy consumption. The Committee notes that the term of many ESPCs and UESCs extend beyond the timeframe CBO is required to consider when providing estimates of Federal costs and savings. The Committee is concerned that the long-term benefits to taxpayers of ESPCs and UESCs are therefore not fully reflected in CBO's estimates of savings and costs over the standard 10-year period. The Committee directs CBO, within 90 days of enactment, to report to the Committee on the budgetary consequences of representative ESPCs and UESCs. The report should include the full costs and savings to the Federal Government for implementing ESPCs and UESCs over the useful life of energy efficiency projects, including both mandatory spending and spending subject to appropriation. ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL The Office of the Architect of the Capitol [AOC] is responsible to the United States Congress for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of 16.5 million square feet of buildings and more than 450 acres of land throughout the Capitol complex. This includes the Capitol, the Capitol Visitor Center, the House and Senate office buildings, the Library of Congress buildings, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Power Plant, and other facilities. The AOC also provides professional expertise with regard to the preservation of architectural and artistic elements entrusted to its care, and provides recommendations concerning design, construction, and maintenance of the facilities and grounds. The Committee has recommended a funding level of $600,000,000 for all activities of the Architect of the Capitol. The recommendation is $2,029,946 below the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $76,631,000 below the fiscal year 2015 request. The following table compares the Committee recommendation for the AOC accounts to the fiscal year 2015 request. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal year 2015 Committee Item request recommendation Difference ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- General Administration.................................... $96,433,000 $93,348,000 -$3,085,000 Capitol Building.......................................... 57,545,000 53,313,000 -4,232,000 Capitol Grounds........................................... 14,366,000 11,973,000 -2,393,000 Senate Office Buildings................................... 109,221,000 100,272,000 -8,949,000 House Office Buildings.................................... 178,934,000 \1\141,622,000 -37,312,000 Capitol Power Plant....................................... 94,990,000 94,768,000 -222,000 Library Buildings and Grounds............................. 62,756,000 47,628,000 -15,128,000 Capitol Police Buildings, Grounds, and Security........... 25,605,000 20,659,000 -4,946,000 Botanic Gardens........................................... 15,686,000 15,573,000 -113,000 Capitol Visitor Center.................................... 21,095,000 20,844,000 -251,000 ----------------------------------------------------- Total............................................... 676,631,000 600,000,000 -76,631,000 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\Level recommended by the House in H.R. 4487, as passed by the House on May 1, 2014. The Committee made no alteration to this amount. Energy Efficiency.--The Committee commends the AOC for its efforts to improve energy efficiency on the Capitol campus. The AOC has reduced energy consumption by 25.2 percent over the last 10 years, exceeding the statutory goal of 21 percent for Federal facilities. Much of these energy savings were accomplished by utilizing Energy Savings Performance Contracts [ESPCs]. The Committee finds that ESPCs are a common sense approach to reducing both energy emissions and energy costs. The Government never pays more for energy as a result of entering into an ESPC--the cost of making energy efficiency upgrades is paid back out of the Government's monthly energy savings. Once the term of an ESPC is complete, the Government retains all energy savings. The Committee appreciates that the AOC continues to seek out opportunities for further improving energy efficiency, including by entering into additional ESPCs. In fact, the Committee notes that the AOC is planning a Cogeneration project at the Capitol Power Plant using a Utility Energy Services Contract, which is essentially a special type of ESPC that will be administered by a utility company. Cogeneration is an advanced, highly-efficient technology that will improve energy efficiency and reduce electricity costs while also reducing emissions. The Committee directs the AOC to continue its efforts to improve energy efficiency and to consider the use of alternative financing vehicles like ESPCs and UESCs whenever practicable to meet their energy goals. Outdoor Recycling.--The Committee commends the efforts of the Architect of the Capitol and the United States Capitol Police [USCP] for implementing outdoor recycling programs on the Capitol grounds while maintaining security of the complex. The Committee encourages the Architect of the Capitol and the USCP to continue to collaborate and work together to expand these efforts where appropriate in high-traffic areas across the Capitol complex. Financial Management.--The Committee commends the AOC for earning an ``unqualified'' audit opinion, without any material weaknesses, on its financial statements for fiscal year 2013. An unqualified opinion is the highest rating that may be received from an external auditor, and the AOC has earned this rating for 8 consecutive years. The AOC also successfully eliminated material weaknesses that were identified in the AOC's financial controls in prior years. This positive independent assessment of the agency's financial stewardship of taxpayer resources demonstrates the agency's strong financial foundation as it embarks on major restoration and renovation projects, including the multi-year, multi-phase restoration of the Capitol Dome. General Administration Appropriations, 2014.................................... $90,276,946 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 96,433,000 House allowance......................................... 91,555,000 Committee recommendation................................ 93,348,000 The General Administration appropriation provides funding for salaries and related benefits of the Architect, officers, administrative and support staff, including engineering and architecture employees. This account also provides for administrative items such as agency-wide contractual services; surveys and studies; information technology; and safety engineering operations. The Committee recommends an appropriation of $93,348,000 for general administration. The recommendation is $3,071,054 above the fiscal year 2014 appropriation and $3,085,000 below the fiscal year 2015 request. Of the amount recommended, $1,617,000 shall remain available until September 30, 2019. The following table displays the budget detail.

Capitol Dome Restoration.--The recommendation includes $21,222,000 for the final phase of the Capitol Dome Restoration. This phase will complete the project by restoring the interior of the Capitol Rotunda. The Rotunda has sustained significant water damage and is in need of upgrades to mechanical and electrical systems to meet current codes and building standards. The Committee appreciates the AOC's efforts to keep the Committee apprised of the status of the Dome Restoration project, including the major activity and key milestone schedule prepared for Phase IIA of the project. The Committee directs the AOC to continue to provide detailed updates on the project, with particular emphasis on alterations to cost and schedule. The Committee also directs the AOC to submit major activity and key milestone schedules for each remaining phase of the Dome Restoration as those phases begin implementation. Of the amount made available for Dome Restoration, no more than $1,000,000 shall be available for reimbursement to the USCP for overtime costs. Miscellaneous Improvements Notifications.--The Committee appreciates the AOC's efforts to document and notify the Committee of ``Miscellaneous Improvements'' projects, which are completed projects that costs less than $5,000 for labor and materials. The Committee directs the AOC to provide quarterly reports on Miscellaneous Improvements projects, including a description and cost of each project and the status of total funding set aside for this purpose.

As this item pertains solely to the House, the Committee makes no independent judgment on the House allowance. Capitol Power Plant Appropriations, 2014.................................... $116,678,000 Budget estimate, 2015................................... 94,990,000 House allowance......................................... 93,152,000 Committee recommendation................................ 94,768,000 The Committee recommends an appropriation of $94,768,000 for the operations of the Capitol Power Plant.
