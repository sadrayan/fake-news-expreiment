Homeless man found dead in Central Park near Columbus Circle
A homeless man was found dead in Central Park on Thursday — just paces from the Columbus Circle entrance, officials said.

Parkgoers didn’t realize that the unidentified victim, believed to be about 50, was dead — until they saw the flies, according to witness Joseph Hurt.

“I was alarmed when I saw all the flies going into his nose and mouth,” said Hurt, 40, who discovered the dead man about 1:45 p.m. “There was definitely no breathing going on there.”

There were insects all over the dead man’s face, Hurt said.

Hurt, who rents bicycles near the park, was on a break when he discovered the body. He remembered seeing the man lying down against the park wall earlier in the day.

“If I could choose where I would spend my last, it would be Central Park,” Hurt said. “But, if you come into the greatest park in the world you don’t want to see a dead body. This is where the magic happens.”

Police said the body showed no signs of trauma. An autopsy was slated to determine how he died.
