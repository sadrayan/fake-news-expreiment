FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

AUGUSTA – On a vote of 23 – 12, a measure to restore the tip credit in Maine garnered bipartisan support on the initial vote in the Senate, following a record-breaking 12-hour public hearing and a strong bipartisan vote out of committee.

“This is excellent news for servers and restaurant owners all across Maine,” said Sen. Roger Katz (R-Kennebec), sponsor of LD 673. “Hundreds of restaurant workers have spoken, and we have listened.

“Over the session it has become abundantly clear that those working in the restaurant industry overwhelmingly favor the tip credit system that has allowed many Mainers to earn a very decent wage working in restaurants and bars for tips. I am hopefully optimistic that we will be able to reinstate this system that so many rely on to earn a respectable living ahead of the height of the summer tourism season.”

LD 673 will now go to the House for initial consideration before returning to the Senate for enactment. As an emergency measure, LD 673 will require the approval of 2/3 of both the House and Senate to proceed.
