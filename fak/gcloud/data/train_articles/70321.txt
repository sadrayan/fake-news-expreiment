AHI Statement on CDC Report Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013

September 16, 2013

Today’s antibiotic resistance report from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is consistent with what research has shown for a long time: The largest antibiotic resistance threats are not connected to the use of antibiotics to keep food animals healthy. Of the 18 specific antibiotic resistant threats discussed in the report, only two have possible connections to antibiotic use in food animals.

The report also provides support for FDA’s policy of phasing out growth promotion uses of medically important antibiotics and phasing in veterinary oversight. We have long stated our support for this policy and companies are currently working with FDA on implementation. Along with other stakeholders, we would like FDA to publish final guidance as soon as possible.

Antibiotic resistance is an important public health threat that animal drug sponsors, veterinarians and food producers take seriously. Antibiotics used in food animals receive intense scrutiny before they are approved by FDA. Once approved, use is scrutinized through programs intended to protect public health, including the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s residue testing program. We are encouraged by the indications in today’s report that these layers of protection are working to allow us to use antibiotics to keep food animals healthy while protecting public health.
