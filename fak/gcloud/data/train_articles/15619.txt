The 1985 legislation is the codification of the Election Code -- nothing substantive. It looks like the provision to have someone in high schools registering new voters is HB 210 from 1983. Here is the bill file:

There are a couple of bill analyses included, as well as the minutes from the committee hearings -- those are less than helpfulâ€¦. The subcommittee met and presented a committee substitute -- no minutes on this, but you may be able to extrapolate why they did this by comparing the two versions.

I checked clips at this time and forward, and there really isn't anything.

Sorry not to find more. There may be some hints of what was being considered by looking that the Texas Administrative Code sections on high school registrars. I can send that if you need it!!
