Heart attack and cardiac arrest: the key differences

A heart attack and a cardiac arrest are two different conditions. If left untreated, a heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest.

A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying blood to the heart becomes blocked; this is a circulation problem. This blockage reduces the amount of oxygen getting to the heart muscle and, without treatment, the heart muscle will begin to die, leading to permanent heart damage. Heart attacks can be fatal. If you are, or someone you know is, experiencing heart attack symptoms, you should immediately call 000.

A cardiac arrest occurs due to an electrical problem in the heart. This means the heart stops beating properly and is unable to pump blood. A person experiencing cardiac arrest will be unconscious and will stop breathing or will not be breathing normally. Cardiac arrest is often fatal if a normal heart rhythm is not quickly restored. If someone is unconscious and not breathing, call 000 and start CPR.
