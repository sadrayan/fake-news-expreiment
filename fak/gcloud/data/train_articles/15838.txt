Subject: Seeking explanation for a fact check in Texas

Good afternoon.

A reader brought to our attention a Dec. 17 press release from Rep. Brady in which he said "Texas families have kept more than $10 billion on their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas’ sales tax deduction a year ago.” Can you guide us on specifically how Brady reached this figure and this conclusion?

I’d be happy to visit by phone if that’s easier. We don’t do background or off the record. Thanks.

According to the state comptroller (quoted in the Dallas Morning News on September 22, 2014), “Texas taxpayers used the provision last year. If Congress doesn’t restore it, they’ll owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April.”

How did the congressman get to his $10 billion figure?

If it’s $1.2 Billion a year, extrapolate that over ten years and what do you get?

I on a learning curve. Why would anyone assume it’s the same amount every year?

That number appears consistent. This is from 2007 http://www.susancombs.com/media/comptroller-lobbies-congress-sales-tax-deduction
