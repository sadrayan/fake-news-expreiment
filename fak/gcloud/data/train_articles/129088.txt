Mastoiditis (Acute & Chronic): Symptoms, Causes, Treatment
Mastoiditis Treatments

Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for both acute and chronic mastoiditis.

If you or your child is diagnosed with acute mastoiditis, you may be put in the hospital to receive treatment and care by an otolaryngologist, a doctor who specializes in ear, nose, and throat disorders. Antibiotics will be given through an IV (intravenous line) to treat the infection.

Surgery may also be needed to drain the fluid from the middle ear, called a myringotomy. During a myringotomy, the doctor makes a small hole in the eardrum to drain the fluid and relieve pressure from the middle ear. A small tube may be inserted into the middle ear to to keep the hole from closing so as to allow for continued drainage. Typically, the tube will fall out on its own after six to 12 months.

If the symptoms donâ€™t quickly improve on IV antibiotics, or complications, like an abscess or bone erosion are present, surgery to remove the infected mastoid bone may be recommended. This is called a mastoidectomy.

Chronic mastoiditis is treated with oral antibiotics, eardrops, and regular ear cleanings by a doctor. If these treatments do not work, surgery may be necessary to prevent further complications.

If left untreated, mastoiditis can cause serious, even life-threatening, health complications, including hearing loss, blood clot, meningitis, or a brain abscess. But with early and appropriate antibiotic treatment and drainage, these complications can usually be avoided and you can recover completely.

If you have an earache, discharge or trouble hearing, see your doctor. He will decide if you need antibiotics to help prevent mastoiditis and other serious health complications.
