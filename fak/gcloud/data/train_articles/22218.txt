Putting an End to Obamacare

Sign the petition if you agree.

Obamacare is bad for America. On October 1, the federal government began forcing Obamacare upon the American people whether we like it or not. I have opposed Obamacare from day one and even sued the federal government in an attempt to stop it while I was Governor. As a U.S. Senator, I will vote to repeal Obamacare.

Obamacare is a train wreck that is going to increase the cost of individual health insurance 29% in South Dakota which is over $1,100 every year for the average individual insurance plan. Obamacare will also cut Medicare spending per South Dakota Medicare enrollee by over $9,500 over the next ten years. In addition, expanding Medicaid under Obamacare would cost South Dakota taxpayers $95 million through 2022.

Obamacare is going to hurt our economy and result in job cuts. Businesses are going to be forced to pay much more money to provide healthcare coverage for their employees. As a result, many will have to either reduce hours or cut employees. Bureau of Labor statistics data already show that only one full-time job is being created for every four new part-time jobs- a complete reversal from historical trends. According to a survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 71% of small businesses say Obamacare will make it more difficult to grow their business.

Moreover, Obamacare is going to decrease the quality of the American health insurance system while increasing prices. Doctor shortages are expected to increase significantly as a result of Obamacare at a time when America is already suffering from a doctor shortage. Obamacare does nothing to solve the problem.

Republicans donâ€™t have the votes right now to repeal Obamacare. We must take over control of the Senate which will require Republicans to pick up six seats this cycle. That is why this U.S. Senate race is so important. Please join me in the fight to repeal Obamacare. Our families deserve better.
