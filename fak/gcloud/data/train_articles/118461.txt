Martha Stewart Coca Cola Ham Adapted For Lazy People) Recipe
While watching Martha and her friend Jane prepare this ham for Easter a few years ago, I adapted the recipe slightly and now just eyeball the ingredients and make it with whatever I have on hand. I made it for a potluck with Dr. Pepper, forgot to baste it, dumped cloves randomly in it, and it still turned out great. Mostly foolproof, which is good for foolish college students and klutzy cooks alike. I am posting this mostly for my own reference, so I don't have to go hunting for a handwritten note every time I make this. I'm guessing at the yield, but it was enough to serve several (5-6) at a small potluck. I serve it throughout the year for special occasions, not just Easter. Steps 1-11 are for the regular way; Steps 12-18 are for the lazy adaptation of this recipe.
