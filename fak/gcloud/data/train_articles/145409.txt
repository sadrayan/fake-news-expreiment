Profile

Dr Ricardo Sabates Aysa is Reader in Education at the University of Cambridge. He has published widely on the social benefits of education in the UK and internationally, access to education in less developed nations, and educational inequalities over the life course. His research interests include issues of education in the context of development, in particular the role of parents, schools and other institutions in narrowing educational inequalities over time. Ricardo is a Research Fellow at the Centre for International Education, University of Sussex, and previously a Reader in International Education and Development also at the University of Sussex.

Ricardo has produced important evidence in the field of education using large scale datasets, applying quantitative methods to policy relevant questions. His paper ‘Who gets what? Is improved access to basic education pro-poor in SSA?’ (with Professor Keith Lewin) published in the International Journal of Educational Development, was awarded the Joyce Caine award in 2012 for outstanding scholar article exploring themes related to Africa.

Ricardo lived and worked in Rwanda between 2012 and 2014 where he was engaged in supporting national and international NGOs with the design of project evaluations. He reviewed proposals for the Innovation for Education Fund Rwanda, and assisted DfID and the Government of Rwanda with the selection of relevant innovative projects.
