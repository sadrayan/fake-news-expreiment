Hillary Rodham Clinton, Melinda Gates, and Chelsea Clinton Join International and Community Leaders for Official Release of the No Ceilings Full Participation Report on Status of Women and Girls
More than 20 years of global data compiled by No Ceilings shows that while progress is possible, more must be done to achieve ‘full and equal participation’ of women and girls worldwide

New York, NY – Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gates Foundation Co-Chair Melinda Gates and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton will join global and community leaders for the official release of the No Ceilings Full Participation Report on Monday, March 9, in New York City. The event will coincide with the start of the 59th session of the United Nations’ Commission on the Status of Women.



The No Ceilings Full Participation Report is the culmination of a year-long, global data aggregation effort by the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, in collaboration with The Economist Intelligence Unit, UCLA WORLD Policy Analysis Center and Fathom Information Design. The report identifies the significant gains women and girls have made – and the gaps that still remain – since the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, when Secretary Clinton called on the international community to ensure “women’s rights are human rights.�? Benchmarking process since that landmark event, No Ceilings is making the data open and accessible, and is pairing the report with an interactive, shareable collection of data visualizations. The data visualizations will highlight key findings from the data through interactive stories, as well as allow users the ability to explore the data on their own.
