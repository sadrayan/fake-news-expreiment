Trump: The Deals and the Downfall: Wayne Barrett: 9780060167042: Amazon.com: Books
Veteran writer Wayne Barret first wrote a series about Donald Trump in the village Voice during the 1970s. He expanded it into a book covering the rise and fall of Trump from the 70s through the 80s. Barrett managed about 10 hours of interviews with Trump before Trump cut him off. Trump tried to both bribe and threaten Barret, offering to get him an apartment while boasting that he had already destroyed one writer. Barret manages to piece together an interesting and compelling story with interviews of those associated with Trump and those who did battle with him. Bribes and intimidation are just one pair of tools in Trump’s tool box. Trump rose benefiting from his father’s money and business connections, by wildly inflating his assets, benefiting from associations with somewhat shady characters, buying influence, hiring close friends and aides of those whose approval he needed, bullying those he can, battling for every petty advantage, and creating an enormous commercially useful personality. The same qualities that propelled Trump to the top – his uncompromising belief in himself and his determination to win at all costs and by any means necessary prove, in the early 90s to be his undoing. In the end, it is a story both fascinating and sad of a person I would rather avoid than know.
