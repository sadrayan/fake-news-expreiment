Supreme Court Reversal Gives Trump A HUGE Win Over Illegals!
In a shocking 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that illegal aliens do not have the automatic right to sue anyone who they feel has mistreated them. The company in Detroit who Öred illegal migrant workers for not turning up, the illegal migrants who are suing the government for trying to deport them… all these cases will no longer be valid.

The Left are naturally apoplectic in their rage and demanding that all people be granted “Human Rights”. But the right to sue someone in a country that you have broken the law to enter is not a Human Right. The rights and protections enjoyed by US citizens are exactly that: Rights for US Citizens.

Citizenship is a privilege, not an automatic right for anyone who happens to jump a border or overstay a visa. The protection of the law, the right to an education and the possibility of Welfare in hard times are something that have come about as an investment by our parents, grand parents and beyond. When we start providing them to people who have no legal right to be in the country, where does it stop?

Should the US be providing education and welfare to people in other countries? Or is it a purely geographical beneÖt? The decision made today in the Supreme Court is a good start in protecting the future of all American citizens. And it is likely that Neil Gorsuch was the deciding vote.
