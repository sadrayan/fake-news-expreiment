Ohio State Attacker May Have Been ‘Inspired’ by Al Qaeda, F.B.I. Says
COLUMBUS, Ohio — The student who wounded 11 people this week at Ohio State University, plowing his car into a cluster of pedestrians and then slashing some of them with a butcher knife, may have been inspired by Anwar al-Awlaki, a Qaeda recruiter and propagandist, or by the Islamic State terrorist group, investigators said on Wednesday.

The assailant, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, who was shot dead by a police officer during the attack on Monday, bought a knife earlier that morning at a Walmart store, but it was not clear whether it was the weapon he used to wound people, officials said at a news conference in Columbus. They appealed for help from the public in tracing his movements in the hours between leaving the store and arriving on campus.

Investigators are going through “the detailed analysis of electronic devices, social media accounts and other materials” related to Mr. Artan, a Somali-born Ohio State student, and “have conducted dozens of interviews with family members, co-workers, neighbors and others,” said Angela L. Byers, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. office in Cincinnati.

Ms. Byers cautioned that the investigation would take time and that it was too early to say whether the attack was an act of terrorism.
