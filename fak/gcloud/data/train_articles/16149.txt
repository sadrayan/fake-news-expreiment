As you know population growth is a result of natural increase (the excess of births relative to deaths) and net migration (between Texas and all other states and nonUS [international] areas). Examining such data for the 39 month period from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013 one finds that Texas added 1,092 people each day (taking into account that this period included one leap year). However it was not all from people moving to Texas. Of that 1092, 515 per day was from net inmigration into Texas from abroad and from other states and 577 was from natural increase. These data are from the Population estimates from the U.S. Bureau of the Census for April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013. There is one hedge here. The American Community Survey for 2012 (the most recent available) does indicate that the net migration involves about 1,391 moving into Texas each day (from other states) but also 1,102 moving out of Texas each day (to other states) for a net inmigration of 289. It provides data showing 531 per day moving into Texas from abroad. They do not report how many people moved from Texas to other nations. These data are from the American Community Survey for 2012.
