A Conversation with Assemblymember Travis Allen
About the Program

Please join us for a conversation with Assemblymember Travis Allen, candidate for governor. He will talk with PPIC president Mark Baldassare about important issues facing California, from improving K-12 and higher education, to addressing inequality, to navigating federal-state tensions over health care and immigration.

Register soon because we expect this event to reach capacity. There is no charge to attend and lunch will be provided.

As part of our Speaker Series on Californiaâ€™s Future, PPIC is inviting all major candidates for governor to participate in a public event. The purpose is to give Californians a better understanding of how the candidates intend to address the challenges facing our state.
