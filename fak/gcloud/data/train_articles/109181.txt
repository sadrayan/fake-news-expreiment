After Decades, Disney Resurrects Darkwing Duck - [Update: No, It's Not]
Darkwing Duck, which aired its last new episode in 1992, will return to TV in 2018. Plenty of time to get dangerous.

Update 10:30 am: It looks like we, and TV Overmind, were tricked by an old April Fool’s post dated April 2, 2015. Sorry about that. Thanks to Chris Guanche for letting us know.

The new version of the show will air on Disney XD, which promises both the “same energy and bumbling crime-fighting spirit” and a new “gritty look that this generation of kids love.” The gritty look is an interesting comment, since, if anything, Disney XD has been much lighter and softer in its programming than Disney animation of years past. Just three years ago, the channel replaced the excellent Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes with the much gentler Avengers Assemble.

If they’re really looking to make sure that Darkwing Duck has a dark tone, that could be great. Of course, we’re going to have to wait two years to find out. Which is plenty of time for us to get dangerous.
