21st Annual Highway Report's State-by-State Results
Reason Foundation's Annual Highway Report is based on spending and performance data submitted by state highway agencies to the federal government for 2012 except on urban Interstate congestion. The federal government has not made the necessary urban Interstate congestion data available since 2009, so this report uses 2011 (the most recent year available) congestion data from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute. The report's dataset includes Interstate, federal and state roads but not county or local roads. Each ranking represents a percentage. For example, the state ranking first in deficient bridges has the smallest percentage of deficient bridges, not necessarily the smallest raw number of deficient bridges. Click on a state below for its overall ranking and performance in each category. The complete Annual Highway Report is here.
