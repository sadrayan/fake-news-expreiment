SNAP Over-the-Year Participation Dropped By More Than 1.9 Million People in September 2016

Trends Factors: Some Economic Improvement But Also Jobless Worker Cutoffs, Weak Energy Sector and Disaster Assistance for Flood Victims

September 2016 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year Change, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

SNAP participation totaled 43,493,667 persons in September 2016, a drop of 132,656 persons compared with August 2016 and a drop of 1,921,778 persons compared with September 2015. Some of those receiving SNAP benefits in September 2016 were Louisiana flood victims.

The over-the-year downward SNAP participation trend in September 2016 likely reflects a mix of factors: on the one hand, improved economic conditions have lessened financial need among some households; on the other hand, harsh time limits have pushed certain jobless adults off the rolls. SNAP matters for many Americans across the country as they struggle to recover from natural disasters and against problems of underemployment and stagnant wages, particularly in states experiencing sharp job losses in the energy sector.

Research findings in a December 2015 White House Report confirm SNAP’s effectiveness in promoting good health, education and food security outcomes. The White House report findings, however, suggest that current SNAP benefit amounts are inadequate for households. FRAC’s Plan to End Hunger in America includes recommendations to increase SNAP benefit levels and strengthen SNAP’s positive effects further.

State Trends

SNAP participation declined between September 2015 and September 2016 in 39 states and the District of Columbia, mostly reflecting improved economic conditions, but in some states three-months (out of 36 months) time limits on SNAP benefits for certain jobless adults also likely contributed to steep participation declines. The ten states with the sharpest over-the-year declines in SNAP participation either had no waivers to preserve SNAP eligibility for unemployed adults in areas with insufficient jobs (Arkansas, Indiana, Mississippi, Florida, North Carolina, Missouri, and Kansas) or had only partial area waivers of the time limit (Kentucky, Tennessee, and Washington State).

In the 11 states registering over-the-year increases in SNAP participation in September 2016, likely factors included economic need exacerbated by a weak energy sector, and/or progress in closing SNAP participation gaps. SNAP participation increased in Louisiana at least in part due to a temporary response to flooding. Six of the eight states with the largest over-the-year SNAP participation increases in September 2016—Louisiana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Texas, North Dakota, and Oklahoma—ranked among the eight states with the biggest job loss in oil and gas rigs as a share of total employment.

SNAP Still Misses Eligible People Experiencing Food Hardship

Food hardship and need for food assistance remain relatively high. In September 2016, about one in seven people in the U.S. received SNAP and about one in ten were unemployed or underemployed, according to USDA data and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics U-6 measure. A FRAC analysis using the Healthways Well-Being survey collected by Gallup showed that 16 percent of respondents did not have enough money to feed themselves or their family in 2015.

Despite growth in SNAP caseloads since the onset of the Great Recession, about 17 percent of those eligible go unserved and SNAP is missing nearly six in ten eligible elderly persons. SNAP policies that improve program access and increase staff capacity to process applications as well as SNAP outreach can help communities, families and businesses maximize federal dollars.

The Positive Effect of SNAP Benefits on Participants and Communities

Economic Impacts

For struggling families and communities, SNAP is making a huge difference in their economic well-being and health. For example, SNAP is good for local economies – each dollar in federally funded SNAP benefits generates $1.79 in economic activity.

Census Bureau data also show the crucial importance of federal nutrition programs and other supports for low-income families. When looking at the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which serves as an indicator of economic well-being, SNAP lifted 4.6 million people out of poverty in 2015.

Health Impacts

Numerous studies demonstrate that SNAP participation and the amounts of monthly SNAP benefits received by households affect the health and well-being of families and children. For instance, a Children’s HealthWatch brief documents health improvements for young children who live in households that received increased SNAP benefits provided by the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Following the increase, “children in families receiving SNAP were significantly more likely to be classified as ‘well’ than young children whose families were eligible but did not receive SNAP.�?

The same study also found that the ARRA SNAP boost also had a positive impact on Medicaid costs. “Medicaid cost growth fell in Massachusetts after SNAP benefits increased, especially for people with chronic illnesses with high sensitivity to food insecurity.�?

Food Security Impacts

There is strong evidence of SNAP’s effectiveness in alleviating food insecurity. Two studies included in the recent “Long-Term Benefits of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program�? White House Report demonstrate this point. Mabli and Ohls (2015) compared households’ state of food security before and after receiving SNAP benefits and found that “SNAP participation reduced the overall fraction of households that were food insecure and the fraction that were very low food secure by around 17 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Mabli and Worthington (2014) find even larger impacts on children’s food security in low-income households with children, showing that food insecurity among children fell by roughly 33 percent after their families had been receiving benefits for about six months.�?

Furthermore, the ARRA SNAP benefit boost was terminated effective November 2013 with negative impacts on families. In the wake of that cut, new research from Children’s HealthWatch finds that low monthly SNAP benefit levels and the November 2013 rollback in SNAP benefits have had “a measurable, negative effect on household and child food insecurity.�?

SNAP Over-the-Year Participation Dropped By More Than 1.8 Million People in August 2016

Trends Factors: Some Economic Improvement But Also Jobless Worker Cutoffs, Weak Energy Sector and Disaster Assistance for Flood Victims

August 2016 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year Change, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

SNAP participation totaled 43,625,286 persons in August 2016, an increase of 294,562 persons compared with July 2016 but a decrease of 1,839,147 persons compared with August 2015. Much of the over-the-month increase in August 2016 is attributable to temporary Disaster SNAP (D-SNAP) payments to Louisiana flood victims.

The over-the-year downward SNAP participation trend in July 2016 likely reflects a mix of factors: on the one hand, improved economic conditions have lessened financial need among some households; on the other hand, harsh time limits have pushed certain jobless adults off the rolls.

In states registering over-the-year increases in SNAP participation in August 2016, likely factors included economic need exacerbated by a weak energy sector and progress in closing SNAP participation gaps in traditionally low participation states. Seven of the 12 states with over-the-year SNAP participation increases in August 2016 (Louisiana, Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania) ranked among the eight states with the biggest job loss in oil and gas rigs as a share of total employment.

SNAP Over-the-Year Participation Dropped By More Than 2 Million People in July 2016

Trends Factors: Some Economic Improvement But Also Jobless Worker Cutoffs and Weak Energy Sector

July 2016 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year Change, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

SNAP participation averaged 43,369,684 persons in July 2016, a decrease of 1,056 persons compared with June 2016 and a decrease of 2,137,387 persons compared with July 2015. This is the lowest SNAP national participation level since October 2010.

June 2016 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year Change, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

SNAP participation averaged 43,376,981 persons in June 2016, a decrease of 101,217 persons compared with May 2016 and a decrease of 2,133,170 persons compared with June 2015. This is the lowest SNAP national participation level since October 2010.

Read the full Brookings Institution analysis here.

Of the 10 states with over-the-year SNAP participation increases in June 2016, seven (Wyoming, Nevada, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, Nebraska and Oklahoma) ranked among the 13 worst states in reaching SNAP eligible people, according to the most recent year for which such data are available (2013).

May 2016 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year Change, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

SNAP participation averaged 43,478,196 persons in May 2016, a decrease of 92,772 persons compared with April 2016 and a decrease of 2,017,088 persons compared with May 2015. This is the lowest SNAP national participation level since October 2010.

SNAP Over-the-Year Participation Fell by Over 773,000 People in April 2016 to Its Lowest Level in Five and a Half Years

Research Shows SNAP’s Effectiveness But Underscores A Need for Increasing Benefits to Achieve Even Stronger Outcomes

April 2016 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year Change, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

SNAP participation averaged 43,571,080 persons in April 2016, a decrease of 773,134 persons compared with March 2016 and a decrease of 1,867,711 persons compared with April 2015. This is the lowest SNAP national participation level since October 2010. Still, SNAP matters for many Americans across the country, particularly as they struggle against problems of underemployment and stagnant wages.

Research findings in a December 2015 White House Report (pdf) confirm SNAP’s effectiveness in promoting good health, education and food security outcomes.

FRAC’s Plan to End Hunger in America (pdf) includes recommendations to increase SNAP benefit levels and strengthen SNAP’s positive effects further.

State Trends

SNAP participation declined between April 2015 and April 2016 in 39 states and the District of Columbia, mostly reflecting improved economic conditions, but in some states (Florida, Indiana, Mississippi and Wisconsin) time limits on SNAP benefits for certain jobless adults also likely contributed to steep participation declines. In Kentucky in April 2016 SNAP participation increased over the prior month, after the state corrected the access glitches in the new “Benefind�? eligibility system it launched in March 2016.

Of the 11 states with over-the-year SNAP participation increases in April 2016, six (Wyoming, Nevada, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Texas, and Nebraska) ranked among the 15 worst states in reaching SNAP eligible people, according to the most recent year for which such data are available (2013). SNAP outreach and access initiatives in more recent years as well as economic factors impacting need are contributing to those states’ increased participation levels. In Massachusetts, the over-the-year increase largely reflects actions the state initiated in early 2015 to correct systemic problems that had led to closures or denials of many client cases without an eligibility determination in 2014.

Economic Factors

Despite some improvements in economic conditions, food hardship and need for food assistance remain relatively high. In April 2016, about one in seven people in the U.S. received SNAP and about one in ten were unemployed or underemployed, according to USDA data and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics U-6 measure. A FRAC analysis (pdf) using the Healthways Well-Being survey collected by Gallup showed that 16 percent of respondents did not have enough money to feed themselves or their family in 2015.

SNAP Still Misses Eligible People Experiencing Food Hardship

Despite growth in SNAP caseloads since the Great Recession, about 17 percent of those eligible go unserved and SNAP is missing nearly six in ten eligible elderly persons. SNAP policies that improve program access and increase staff capacity to process applications as well as SNAP outreach can help communities, families and businesses maximize federal dollars.

The Positive Effect of SNAP Benefits on Participants and Communities

Economic Impacts

For struggling families and communities, SNAP is making a huge difference on their economic well-being and health. For example, SNAP is good for local economies – each dollar in federally funded SNAP benefits generates $1.79 in economic activity.

Census Bureau data also show the crucial importance of federal nutrition programs and other supports for low-income families. If SNAP benefits are counted as income, 3.6 million people were lifted out of poverty in 2014, according to the Census Bureau. And, when looking at the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which serves as an additional indicator of economic well-being, SNAP lifted 4.7 million people out of poverty in 2014.

Health Impacts

Numerous studies demonstrate that SNAP participation and the amounts of monthly SNAP benefits received by households affect the health and well-being of families and children. For instance, a Children’s HealthWatch brief documents health improvements for young children who live in households that received increased SNAP benefits provided by the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Following the increase, “children in families receiving SNAP were significantly more likely to be classified as ‘well’ than young children whose families were eligible but did not receive SNAP.�?

The same study also found that the ARRA SNAP boost also had a positive impact on Medicaid costs, according to newly published analysis of data from MA. “Medicaid cost growth fell in Massachusetts after SNAP benefits increased, especially for people with chronic illnesses with high sensitivity to food insecurity.�?

Food Security Impacts

There is strong evidence of SNAP’s effectiveness in alleviating food insecurity. Two studies included in the recent “Long-Term Benefits of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program�? White House Report demonstrate this point. Mabli and Ohls (2015) compared households’ state of food security before and after receiving SNAP benefits and found that “SNAP participation reduced the overall fraction of households that were food insecure and the fraction that were very low food secure by around 17 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Mabli and Worthington (2014) find even larger impacts on children’s food security in low-income households with children, showing that food insecurity among children fell by roughly 33 percent after their families had been receiving benefits for about six months.�?

Furthermore, the ARRA SNAP benefit boost was terminated effective November 2013 with negative impacts on families. In the wake of that cut, new research from Children’s HealthWatch finds that low monthly SNAP benefit levels and the November 2013 rollback in SNAP benefits have had “a measurable, negative effect on household and child food insecurity.�?

SNAP Over-the-Year Participation Dropped by Nearly 1.3 Million People in March 2016 to Its Lowest Level in Five Years

Research Shows SNAP’s Effectiveness But Underscores A Need for Increasing Benefits to Achieve Even Stronger Outcomes

March 2016 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year Change, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

SNAP participation averaged 44,344,259 persons in March 2016, a decrease of 38,667 persons compared with February 2016 and a decrease of 1,297,492 persons compared with March 2015. This is the lowest SNAP national participation level since February 2011. Still, SNAP matters for many Americans across the country, particularly as they struggle against problems of underemployment and stagnant wages.

Research findings in a December 2015 White House Report (pdf) confirm SNAP’s effectiveness in promoting good health, education and food security outcomes. The White House report findings, however, suggest that current SNAP benefit amounts are inadequate for households. The U.S. Conference of Mayors survey on hunger and homelessness (pdf) released in December 2015 also points to increasing SNAP benefits as one of the strategies to address hunger. FRAC’s Plan to End Hunger in America (pdf) includes recommendations to increase SNAP benefit levels and strengthen SNAP’s positive effects further.

State Trends

SNAP participation declined between March 2015 and March 2016 in 39 states and the District of Columbia, mostly reflecting improved economic conditions. However, the double-digit declines in Kentucky in March 2016, compared with February 2016 and March 2015, reportedly are attributable to widespread access problems after the state implemented its new “Benefind�? eligibility system.

Of the 11 states with over-the-year SNAP participation increases in March 2016, six (Wyoming, Nevada, North Dakota, Texas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma) ranked among the 15 worst states in reaching SNAP eligible people, according to the most recent year for which such data are available (2013). SNAP outreach and access initiatives in more recent years as well as economic factors impacting need are contributing to those states’ increased participation levels. In Louisiana, Disaster-SNAP and other relief in the wake of March 2016 floods contributed to significant SNAP participation increases over-the-month and over-the prior March. In Massachusetts, the over-the-year increase largely reflects actions the state initiated in early 2015 to correct systemic problems that had led to closures or denials of many client cases without an eligibility determination in 2014.

Economic Factors

Despite some improvements in economic conditions, food hardship and need for food assistance remain relatively high. In January 2016, about one in seven people in the U.S. received SNAP and about one in ten were unemployed or underemployed, according to USDA data and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics U-6 measure. A FRAC analysis (pdf) using the Healthways Well-Being survey collected by Gallup showed that 17 percent of respondents did not have enough money to feed themselves or their family in 2014.

October 2015 Marked Fifth Straight Monthly Decline in SNAP Participation

SNAP Over-the-Year Participation Dropped by More Than One Million People in October 2015

Research Shows SNAP’s Effectiveness But Underscores A Need for Increasing Benefits to Achieve Even Stronger Outcomes

October 2015 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

A Recent White House Report Shows SNAP’s Effectiveness But Underscores A Need for Increasing Benefits to Achieve Even Stronger Outcomes

September 2015 Participation Tables — 1-Month Change, 1-Year, 5-Year Change, and State-by-State Analysis (pdf)

SNAP participation averaged 45,415,445 persons in September 2015, a decrease of 48,988 persons compared with August 2015, and a decrease of 1,044,485 persons compared with September 2014.

Still, the program matters for many Americans across the country. Research findings in a December 2015 White House report (pdf) ) confirm SNAP’s effectiveness in promoting good health, education and food security outcomes. The report findings, however suggest that current SNAP benefit amounts are inadequate for households. FRAC’s Plan to End Hunger in America (pdf) includes recommendations to increase SNAP benefit levels and strengthen SNAP’s positive effects further.
