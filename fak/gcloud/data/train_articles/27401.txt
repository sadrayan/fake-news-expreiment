Balderson and O'Connor Face the State in primetime special
The special election was decided by less than 1 percent of the vote, now it’s time for Round 2 as Republican Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O’Connor turn their focus to November and sit down with 10TV for a Face the State primetime special.

U.S. Representative Troy Balderson, the incumbent of just over one month, is seeking to fill the full term left vacant by fellow Republican Pat Tiberi.

Franklin County Recorder Danny O’Connor is trying to be the first Democrat to hold the 12th District since 1982 when John Kasich won the seat.

Scott Light visited the 12th to meet the people who will ultimately decide who wins in November, and you’ll hear them question the candidates directly as they make their best pitch for your vote.
