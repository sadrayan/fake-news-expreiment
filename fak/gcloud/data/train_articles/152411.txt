Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.

You may ask for clarification of a removal by messaging the moderators with a link to your post or comment.

Generally, we have a "three strikes and you're banned" policy, but we reserve the right to not do that if you're being particularly bad.

To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message.

Users who delete offending content are dumb because we, as moderators, can still see it and it just makes us think you think we're stupid.

Users who reply to ban messages with abuse will never be unbanned, and we will spam them with copypasta to the point wherer they get tired of us.
