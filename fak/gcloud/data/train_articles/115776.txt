Donald Trump's 9/11 "haters and losers" Tweet deleted
Two years ago, Donald Trump's Twitter account sent a public message out to the world to "even the haters and losers" -- on September 11, the twelve-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.

Trump's tweet read: "I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th."

But on Friday, with Trump currently leading the pack of Republican presidential candidates, the original tweet from the morning of September 11, 2013 vanished from his account.

Then a manual re-tweet of the message -- dated later in the afternoon that same day -- remains.

"@realDonaldTrump: I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th." — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2013

Trump frequently sends greetings to the "haters and losers" on holidays, like the Fourth of July:

Happy 4th of July to everyone, including the haters and losers! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2014

And Father's Day:

I would like to wish all fathers, even the haters and losers, a very happy Fathers Day. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2014

The billionaire businessman has made a campaign trademark of attacking his fellow conservatives -- even those who aren't running against him in 2016 -- for being "losers."

Trump has called right-wing commentator Erick Erickson a "proven loser," has tweeted that conservative pollster Frank Luntz is a "total loser," and has said that he doesn't "like losers" when speaking of former Republican presidential candidate John McCain.

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
