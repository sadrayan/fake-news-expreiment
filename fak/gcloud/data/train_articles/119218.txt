Review: YUMBO Hot Ham & Cheese from Burger King

I don’t need to write much of anything for you to have a good idea that the YUMBO Hot Ham & Cheese from Burger King is awful. It looks pretty bad doesn’t it? Burger King describes their YUMBO Hot Ham & Cheese like this:

YUMBO Hot Ham & Cheese features slices of savory black forest ham, topped with American cheese, crisp lettuce, and creamy mayo, all served heated on a toasted hoagie bun.

So besides having a stupid name, the YUMBO Hot Ham & Cheese has other qualities that make it a poor product. Considering the last two BK reviews, disappointment should be my expectation now… (see Four Cheese Whopper and Mushroom Swiss Big King).

The YUMBO Hot Ham & Cheese is priced at $3.69 for the sandwich alone. It’s a part of the 2 for $5 Mix and Match Deal so I paired it with the Original Chicken Sandwich. The Original Chicken Sandwich isn’t very good, but next to the YUMBO it looks a whole lot better. The black forest ham wasn’t piled high like Arby’s and since the ham is nothing but salty, I was fine with that. Zero sweetness to balance the super salty ham. Two slices of processed American cheese adds to the mess but some color and that semi-sour artificial flavor. The “crisp lettuce” was indeed crisp, but no more appealing than leftover pieces of salad that should be tossed in the trash. Globs of mayo… should I continue. This will sound very sad… I think the only decent part of this sandwich was the toasted hoagie bun.

Avoid this mess and don’t fall into the “lowest common denominator pit”. I know this is just fast food, but the YUMBO Hot Ham & Cheese is an example of very little effort by Burger King. Save your money.
