Chick-fil-A Manager Allegedly Not On Fleek After Banning Slang at Work
Eric the manager is fed up! According to one Reddit user, a group of Instagram-loving, Vine-sharing, Twitter-tweeeting teens have been accusing their Chick-fil-A co-workers of being "3hunnid" and "on fleek." Management, it would seem, is against not only teens empowering other teens but true love (to paraphrase scholar Max Muller: "A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without bae"). If this is just a Redditor's hoax, he's captured the poetry of an aggrieved fast food manager perfectly. To this, and all other memos condemning the use of internet speak in the workplace, we say: Bruh!?

UPDATE: Because everything on the internet is terrible, it looks like this is a fake. Still, this is a pretty impressive (and hilarious) cheat sheet of slang words used by teens in 2014. Parents and disgruntled fast food managers of America, take note.
