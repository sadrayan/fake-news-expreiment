Post-Combustion CO2 Capture
Post-combustion Capture refers to capturing carbon dioxide from flue gas after the fossil fuel (e.g., coal, natural gas, or oil) has been burned. Of the 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity generated in the U.S. in 2015, about 33% was from coal (2016, EIA). In conventional coal-fired power plants, coal is burned with air in a boiler producing steam to rotate a turbine generator and produce electricity.

The biggest challenge in post-combustion capture is separating CO 2 generated during combustion from the large amounts of nitrogen (from air) found in the flue gas. In this area, the R&D; effort is focused on advanced solvents, solid sorbents, and membrane systems. In addition, novel concepts, for instance hybrid technologies that efficiently combine attributes from multiple key technologies (e.g., solvents and membranes) are being investigated.
