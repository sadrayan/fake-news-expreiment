McDonald’s Unleashes Ungodly Nutella-Slathered Burger on Italy
Because nothing in this world is sacred — especially not fast food — McDonald’s unleashed its latest unholy experiment in processed calorie engineering on Italy this week. This time instead of drizzling carbohydrates with milk chocolate, the fast food giant is piping sliced bread full of chocolate-hazelnut spread to create what is essentially a Nutella “burger.”

Dubbed the “Sweety with Nutella,” the chocolate sandwich is served as part of Italy’s McCafe menu according to Brand Eating and comes packaged in the traditional burger box. While it by all appearances looks like a burger from the outside complete with a brown patty-like stripe around the exterior, the Nutella sandwich is meat-free.

The chocolate sandwich announcement quickly gained traction on social media, and has receive more than 60,000 shares. Some Nutella loving heathens in Italy have already made the journey to Mickey D’s for their dessert sandwich fix.

Europe’s love affair with Nutella is strong and has inspired the company to occasionally offer personalized jars of the beloved spread. Others have gone further in marking their Nutella turf by creating a special lock for the jars.
