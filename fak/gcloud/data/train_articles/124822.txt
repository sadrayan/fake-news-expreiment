(1841-1918) US lawyer and author whose Baron Trump sequence, an unusually EQUIPOISAL mixture of sf and fantasy, even at a time before the use of commonly adhered-to distinctions between these modes of the fantastic, in a manner that anticipates L Frank BAUM's inspired opportunism in the Oz books. The sequence comprises The Travels and Adventures of Little Baron Trump and His Wonderful Dog Bulgar (1890) and Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey (1893), the second of which being a FANTASTIC VOYAGE into the HOLLOW EARTH, where domains of various surreally described races are found, including the Transparent Folk and the Rattlebrains. The Extraordinary Experiences of Little Captain Dopplekop on the Shores of Bubblehead (1892) and Wonderful Deeds and Doings of Little Giant Boab and His Talking Raven Tabib (1891), both similar to the Trump books, both also involved FANTASTIC VOYAGES; the young protagonist of the latter benefits from his abnormal strength. 1900: Or, the Last President (1896 chap) is a NEAR FUTURE political SATIRE.

As lawyer for Mrs Margarette Todd, who died under suspicious circumstances in 1905 soon after changing her will in order (it seems) to exclude him, Lockwood was in conflict with a second lawyer, George Gordon Hastings (almost certainly the author George Gordon {HASTINGS}), who represented (and later married) Todd's daughter, herself married to Frank {TOUSEY}, and who had become the beneficiary of her mother's substantial estate as well as the Tousey publishing enterprise.
