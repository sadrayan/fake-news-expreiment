Pre-Combustion CO2 Capture
Pre-combustion Capture is applicable to gasification including integrated gasification combined cycle power plants (IGCC), where solid fuel (i.e., coal) is converted into gaseous fuel (hydrogen and carbon monoxide, or “syngas”) by applying heat under pressure in the presence of steam and oxygen. The syngas is used to fuel a gas turbine generator to produce electricity. The recovered heat is used to produce steam that also drives a turbine generator designed to generate electricity. The carbon is captured from the syngas before it is combusted in the gas turbine.

In order to facilitate carbon capture and increase the hydrogen production, the syngas is shifted in a water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction to produce additional hydrogen and convert the carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). In this case, the carbon is captured from the shifted syngas and afterward, the remaining hydrogen (H 2 ) is combusted in a gas turbine that generates power.
