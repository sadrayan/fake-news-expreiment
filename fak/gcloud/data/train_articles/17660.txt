Measuring Global Economic Activity. A number of economic studies have used a proxy for world real economic activity derived from shipping costs. The measure turns out to depend on a normalization that has substantive consequences of which users of the index have been unaware. This note describes alternative measures that avoid this and other problems with the commonly used proxy. Data and replication code. Presentation slides. Updated data on world industrial production index (Jan 1958 to Dec 2017).

A Skeptical View of the Impact of the Fed's Balance Sheet, prepared for the 2018 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, coauthored with David Greenlaw, Ethan Harris, and Kenneth West. We review the recent U.S. monetary policy experience with large scale asset purchases (LSAPs) and draw lessons for monetary policy going forward. Most previous studies have found that quantitative easing (QE) lowered long term yields, with a rough consensus that LSAP purchases reduced yields on 10-year Treasuries by about 100 basis points. We argue that the consensus overstates the effect of LSAPs on 10-year yields. We use a larger than usual population of possible events and exploit interpretations provided by the business press. We find that Fed actions and announcements were not a dominant determinant of 10-year yields and that whatever the initial impact of some Fed actions or announcements, the effects tended not to persist. In addition, although the Fed began the transition to a smaller balance sheet sooner than the market had expected, the announcements and implementation of the balance-sheet reduction do not seem to have affected rates much. These observations lead us to conclude that the effects of LSAP are likely more modest than generally claimed. Going forward, we expect the Federal Reserveís balance sheet to stay large. This calls for careful consideration of the maturity distribution of assets on the Fedís balance sheet. Our conclusion is that the most important and reliable instrument of monetary policy is the short term interest rate, and we discuss the implications of this finding for Fed policy going forward.

Why You Should Never Use the Hodrick-Prescott Filter (forthcoming, Review of Economics and Statistics). Here's why. (1) The HP filter produces series with spurious dynamic relations that have no basis in the underlying data-generating process. (2) Filtered values at the end of the sample are very different from those in the middle, and are also characterized by spurious dynamics. (3) A statistical formalization of the problem typically produces values for the smoothing parameter vastly at odds with common practice, e.g., a value for λ far below 1600 for quarterly data. (4) There's a better alternative. A regression of the variable at date t+h on the four most recent values as of date t offers a robust approach to detrending that achieves all the objectives sought by users of the HP filter with none of its drawbacks. Summaries of the paper for a nontechnical audience can be found on Voxeu and Econbrowser. Data and code to replicate are available in Matlab, RATS, Stata, and R.

Structural Interpretation of Vector Autoregressions with Incomplete Identification: Revisiting the Role of Oil Supply and Demand Shocks, coauthored with Christiane Baumeister. Traditional approaches to structural vector autoregressions can be viewed as special cases of Bayesian inference arising from very strong prior beliefs. These methods can be generalized with a less restrictive formulation that incorporates uncertainty about the identifying assumptions themselves. We use this approach to revisit the importance of shocks to oil supply and demand. Supply disruptions turn out to be a bigger factor in historical oil price movements and inventory accumulation a smaller factor than implied by earlier estimates. Supply shocks lead to a reduction in global economic activity after a significant lag, whereas shocks to oil demand do not. See Econbrowser for a short summary of the paper. Data and code to replicate: results from baseline model, results from Kilian (AER, 2009), and results from Kilian and Murphy (2012). Updated data on world industrial production index (Jan 1958 to Dec 2017).

Inference in Structural Vector Autoregressions When the Identifying Assumptions are Not Fully Believed: Re-evaluating the Role of Monetary Policy in Economic Fluctuations (forthcoming, Journal of Monetary Economics), coauthored with Christiane Baumeister. Reporting credible sets or error bands for structural vector autoregressions that are only set identified is a very common practice. However, unless the researcher is persuaded on the basis of prior information that some parameter values are more plausible than others, this common practice has no formal justification. When the role and reliability of prior information is defended, Bayesian posterior probabilities can be used to form an inference that incorporates doubts about the identifying assumptions. We illustrate how prior information can be used about both structural coefficients and the impacts of shocks, and propose a new distribution, which we call the asymmetric t distribution, for incorporating prior beliefs about the signs of equilibrium impacts in a nondogmatic way. We apply these methods to a three-variable macroeconomic model and conclude that monetary policy shocks were not the major driver of output, inflation, or interest rates during the Great Moderation.

Heterogeneity and Unemployment Dynamics, coauthored with Hie Joo Ahn. This paper develops new estimates of flows into and out of unemployment that allow for unobserved heterogeneity across workers as well as direct effects of unemployment duration on unemployment-exit probabilities. Unlike any previous paper in this literature, we develop a complete dynamic statistical model that allows us to measure the contribution of different shocks to the short-run, medium-run, and long-run variance of unemployment as well as to specific historical episodes. We find that changes in the inflows of newly unemployed are the key driver of economic recessions and identify an increase in permanent job loss as the most important factor.
