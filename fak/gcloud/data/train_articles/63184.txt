Baldwin starts ‘cheesy’ TV ad
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin today started running a “cheesy” new TV ad featuring Holland’s Family Cheese in Thorp.

The spot opens with the family’s five children warning it’s going to be a “cheesy ad” before one says “then again” and they all chime in, “this is Wisconsin.”

Baldwin says when “federal bureaucrats wanted to prohibit the use of wooden cheese boards, which help makes tens of millions of pounds of cheese a year, something had to be done.”

The spot then switches to cheesemaker Marieke Penterman, aka Marieke Gouda.

“Tammy Baldwin stepped in, helped eliminate regulations and stood up for businesses like ours,” she says.

The narrator says, “Tammy Baldwin, doing right by Wisconsin” before the senator closes the ad saying she approves “this message and this cheese” before a cow moos at the end of the spot.

The ad is running in the Milwaukee, Green Bay, Wausau and La Crosse/Eau Claire markets.
