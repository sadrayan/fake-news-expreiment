Company that price gouged EpiPen is Clinton Foundation donor
The pharmaceutical company under fire for increasing the cost of its life-saving EpiPen has been criticized by Hillary Clinton — despite the fact that the manufacturer donated to the Clinton Foundation.

Records available on the website of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation reveal Mylan, the company that manufactures the EpiPen, has donated up to $250,000.

On Wednesday, Clinton released a statement blasting her family foundation’s donor.

“Over the last several years, Mylan Pharmaceuticals has increased the price of EpiPens by more than 400%. They’re now charging up to $600 for a two-EpiPen set that must be replaced every 12-18 months. This both increases out-of-pocket costs for families and first responders, and contributes to higher premiums for all Americans and their employers,” Clinton said in a statement released to reporters by her campaign.

“That’s outrageous — and it’s just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers … [I]t’s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them.”

The Associated Press reported that the CEO of Mylan, Heather Bresch, is the daughter of West Virginia’s Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.

Manchin, a supporter of Clinton’s presidential campaign, received $60,650 from Mylan’s PAC and employees, the Washington Post reported.
