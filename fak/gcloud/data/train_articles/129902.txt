GIVE ME NIGERIA AND GHANA TO RECOLONIZE AND IN ONE YEAR THEY BECOME FIRST CLASS COUNTRIES
North Korean President, Kim Jong Un has described Nigeria and Ghana as the backbone of Africa , because according to him, “they have all the natural resources in abundance to make them the most important and sought after countries in the world but corruption is a major problem and a curse to them”.

“Give me just a year and i will transform these two countries into first class countries that will attract businesses all over the world.

Nigeria should give in, Ghana should give in and let us colonize them for the second time so they will eventually learn how to run a country .

These two countries are on a mission of proving to the whites that blacks are only good at crimes and having the power of having long lasting sex .

Sit up Africa ,Sit up Ghana and sit up Nigeria or just sell the countries to us”
