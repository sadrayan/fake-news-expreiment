The Quiet Revolution In Achievement

A critical mass of schools is establishing that children can achieve at high standards regardless of race of economic disadvantage.

We have yet to take sufficient note of a historic development in public education: A critical mass of schools is establishing, with more assurance than ever, that children can achieve at high standards regardless of race or economic disadvantage. The wall is coming down as both method and mind-set have converged to work their magic.

How we respond to these new realities will both define us and redefine the democratic experiment.
