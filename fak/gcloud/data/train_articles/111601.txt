Target : Company : Salvation Army
A Partnership for Good. The Salvation Army. Doing the Most Good

Making a Difference Every Day Target proudly supports The Salvation Army as it serves more than 30 million people across the United States each year. Some of our year-round efforts include grants to local chapters, volunteerism and in-kind donations to help those that need it most. Target also partners with The Salvation Army to support its disaster relief efforts in communities across the country.

Target Volunteers Target team members, retirees, families and friends have volunteered millions of hours to community projects.

Holiday Programs

Every year, Target proudly supports The Salvation Army’s holiday programs. Our tradition of giving continued in 2010. We participated in The Salvation Army toy drives around the country, contributing toys and Target GiftCards® to children in need.

Target School Spree As part of our commitment to education, Target supports the back-to-school efforts of The Salvation Army by hosting Target School Spree events. In 2011, Target provided Target GiftCards for 11,700 children selected by The Salvation Army. 492 Target stores participated nationwide. Each child received an $80 Target GiftCard® and one-on-one shopping assistance to meet all of their back-to-school needs.

Disaster Preparedness, Providing Basic Needs and Much More

Target continues to assist local Salvation Army divisions in responding to disaster needs. The Salvation Army social service programs meet the basic needs of daily life for those without the resources to do so themselves. Often, the programs provide food, shelter, clothing, financial assistance to pay utilities, and other essentials.

The Salvation Army provides many services to those in need, including:

Disaster relief services

Child care centers

Summer camps

Holiday assistance

Services for the aging

AIDS education and residential services
