Actor Kurt Russell falsely quoted praising President Trump
CLAIM: Actor Kurt Russell praised President Donald Trump as “dedicated & determined” and says he wishes he could be as courageous.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The quote is fabricated.

THE FACTS: A photo of Russell is circulating on social media with the quote: “Donald J. Trump is relentless. I’ve never seen a man so dedicated & determined. I’d like to think I would be as courageous as he is, but I just don’t know. The world is after him & he stands there in the face of pure evil, rock solid and ready to fight for us. God bless this brave man.” The false quote was shared widely with the hashtag #VoteRedToSaveAmerica.

A representative for Russell told The Associated Press that the actor did not say that.
