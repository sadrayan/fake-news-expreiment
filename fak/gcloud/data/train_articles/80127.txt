1 valuation of all taxable property in a school district is owned

2 by a person or corporation that is the subject of bankruptcy

3 proceedings or that has been adjudged bankrupt and, as a result

4 thereof, has not paid taxes on the property, then the district

5 may amend its general State aid or evidence-based funding claim

6 (i) back to the inception of the bankruptcy, not to exceed 6

7 years, in which time those taxes were not paid and (ii) for

8 each succeeding year that those taxes remain unpaid, by adding

9 to the claim an amount determined by multiplying the assessed

10 valuation of the property on which taxes have not been paid due

11 to the bankruptcy by the lesser of the total tax rate for the

12 district for the tax year for which the taxes are unpaid or the

13 applicable rate used in calculating the district's general

14 State aid under paragraph (3) of subsection (D) of Section

15 18-8.05 of this Code or evidence-based funding under Section

16 18-8.15 of this Code, as applicable . If at any time a district

17 that receives additional State aid under this Section receives

18 tax revenue from the property for the years that taxes were not

19 paid, the district's next claim for State aid shall be reduced

20 in an amount equal to the taxes paid on the property, not to

21 exceed the additional State aid received under this Section.

22 Claims under this Section shall be filed on forms prescribed by

23 the State Superintendent of Education, and the State

24 Superintendent of Education, upon receipt of a claim, shall

25 adjust the claim in accordance with the provisions of this
