St. Pete Poll adjusts numbers in mayor's race
Poll tweaks in favor of mayoral candidate in St. Pete's far southern neighoboods

Earlier in the week, an independent poll showed former mayor Rick Baker leading Mayor Rick Kriseman by a 44-39 margin.

For political nerds, the various breakdowns, by race, age, political party and gender were of interest.

On Friday, St. Pete Polls released a new geographic spread, showing Baker winning all areas outside of downtown. The previous version showed Kriseman winning areas of south St. Petersburg below Lake Maggiore and toward the beaches, including Pinellas Point and Maximo Moorings.

The new poll now shows a dead heat in that part of town.

An interesting side note: The largest bloc of undecided voters reside in Midtown, which is widely seen as the part of town that will determine the election either in August or November. Nearly 15 percent of voters there haven't made up their minds.

Coincidentally, Kriseman is officially opening his Midtown campaign office, 833 22nd St. S, tomorrow at noon. There will be a cookout.
