AETHAER: Clean Air Supplies
naturally occurring, lovingly bottled

A ETH A ER

Our heritage jars contain pure, clean and fresh AETHAER, collected from a range of pristine locations from around the UK. Each jar is part of a limited edition set of enviro-political artworks, and while the contents can be inhaled, our jars of AETHAER are often sought as a luxurious gift for others, or are bought to be admired and function as a thought provoking display in your own office or home.
