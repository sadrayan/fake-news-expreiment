President Obama Just Cant't Stop Dropping Jay Z Verses

Do those lines sound like Jay's verse from the "My President" remix?

We've seen President Obama brush the dirt off his shoulder and confirm that he has "some" Jay Z on his iPod. Maybe you saw his special message to the crowd at Jay's Made in America festival in 2012.

But we never saw Obama going back to the Jigga well on Sunday when he led a historic march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama, to mark a pivotal spot in the nation's civil rights history. Maybe we didn't see it, but "The Nightly Show" host Larry Wilmore totally called it.

On Monday night's show, after running down the latest twists in the Bill Cosby sexual assault saga, Wilmore wondered whether parts of Obama's speech sounded a bit familiar. "We honored those who walked so we could run," Obama said. "We must run so our children soar!"

Hmm, Wilmore thought, that quote sounds awfully familiar... oh right, Jay verse on Jeezy's "My President" remix! "Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk/ Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run/ Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly," Jay said.

"Wait, Obama, did you just sample Jay Z?" Wilmore wondered. Yup.
