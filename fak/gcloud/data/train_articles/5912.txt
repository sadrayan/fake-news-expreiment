The Auto Club, the Rubber Manufacturers Association, representing the tire industry, the California Highway Patrol and Yokohama Tire Company joined forces during National Tire Safety Week, April 20-26, to draw drivers' attention to the safety and economic benefits of basic tire care. The groups also are distributing 13,500 "tire tread depth cards" to consumers this week through the Auto Club's local offices and Roadside Assistance providers. They fit easily into a wallet and can be used to check tire tread regularly. The Auto Club and RMA are also distributing "Tire Smart" brochures in AAA offices. AAA Approved Auto Repair facilities also will check tires and pressure free of charge for members and the public during the promotion week. A list of repair facilities can be found at AAA.com.
