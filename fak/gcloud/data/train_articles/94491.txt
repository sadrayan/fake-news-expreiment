Sensenbrenner, voters take part in contentious town hall meeting over federal debt

WHITEFISH BAY - Voters in Southeastern Wisconsin have expressed anxiousness about the debt crisis in Washington, D.C. and events here at home.



That spilled over into a town hall meeting with Menomonee Falls Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner in Whitefish Bay.



Inside the packed hall, people were worried about proposed changes to medicare and how Congress was going to avoid a debt crisis, among other things.



"How about the Club for Growth that's not from Wisconsin?"



"How about the AFL-CIO?"



"You're not answering the question."



"What about the AFL-CIO?"



That was part of the give and take between people before Sensenbrenner walked into the meeting.



Some suggested tax increases - instead of tax cuts - were needed to reduce the deficit, but Sensenbrenner fired back.



"I'll disagree with you," said Sensenbrenner.



"The labor report that came out last week had an anemic 18,000 created in this country, but half of them came here in Wisconsin. Something we are doing here must be working."



Cheers came from supporters after that statement.
