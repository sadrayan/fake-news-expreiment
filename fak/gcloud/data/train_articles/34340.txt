Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act
On May 22, 2015, the president signed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 into law. The bill was authored by Senator Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and requires congressional review of any final nuclear agreement with Iran before the president can waive sanctions imposed by Congress. The bill passed the Senate 98 to 1 and the House of Representatives 400 to 25.

As negotiators from the P5+1 nations and Iran attempt to meet a June 30 deadline for a final agreement, the committee is holding a series of briefings and hearings this month to prepare members for congressional review of a final deal if one is reached.

“After more than a year of bipartisan work and a veto threat from the White House, I am pleased to see this bill become law so that any final nuclear agreement with Iran will have to go through Congress where the American people will have a say and lawmakers will have a vote,” said Corker. “I appreciate the strong bipartisan support for this effort that demonstrates Congress’s determination to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. With the role of Congress now guaranteed, the administration must address the many significant concerns raised by Congress, and our negotiators should take advantage of the added leverage to force further concessions from the Iranians so that any agreement reached is verifiable, enforceable and can assure the American people Iran will not be able to develop a nuclear weapon.”

The legislation was coauthored by Senators Corker, Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.).
