Judge declines to reduce his bail from $10 million

Los Angeles (CNN) Former rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder and all other charges related to a fatal hit-and-run incident in January in Compton, California.

His attorney asked the court to further reduce Knight's bail, now set at $10 million, but Los Angeles County Judge Ronald Coen denied the request.

The judge lowered Knight's bail earlier this month, to $10 million from $25 million, after defense lawyers called the $25 million figure excessive for the circumstances.

Knight faces one count of murder for the death of Terry Carter, one count of attempted murder in the case of Cle "Bone" Sloan, who was maimed in the incident, and one count of hit-and-run.

Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted.
