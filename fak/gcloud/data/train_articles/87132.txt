On Point : Senator Joe Biden
Senator Joe Biden Aired: Thursday, August 09, 2007 10-11AM ET



By host Tom Ashbrook:



Joe Biden of Delaware has served in the US Senate through seven presidencies and three wars. He was there as the Vietnam War wrapped, there for the Iran hostage crisis, for the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union, for the Gulf War, for Bill Clinton, for Ronald Reagan.



Now he's chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and running -- for the second time -- for the Democratic Party's nomination for the US presidency.



A shoo in? Far from it. But he wants your ear.



This hour On Point: Senator Joe Biden on the country, the Iraq War, and his run for the White House.







Â· Joe Biden, (D) Senator from Delaware, presidential candidate. His new memoir is "Promises To Keep: On Life and Politics"
