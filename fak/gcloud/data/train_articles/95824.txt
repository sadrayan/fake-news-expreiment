Indiana Congressman: Manufacturing Sector Not As Weak As Trump Says It Is
Indiana voters will cast ballots in their state’s presidential primary today. The state could help cement Donald Trump’s bid for the Republican nomination or help Ted Cruz force a contested convention in July. But Republican Congressman Todd Rokita, who represents Indiana’s 4th District, isn’t committing to a candidate yet. As a delegate to the national convention, he says he wants to see what the will of the state’s voters will be. Rokita, who represents two major manufacturing cities, also says the state’s industrial sector is more robust than Donald Trump is making it out to be.

His opponent in the primary, Trump backer and financial adviser Kevin Grant, says Rep. Rokita is out of touch with the people in his district.

Rokita and Grant speak with Here & Now's Robin Young.
