Texas comptroller downplays effect of low oil prices on state...
Texas’ new comptroller on Friday all but dismissed worries that falling oil prices will drag down the state’s economy in the near future.

In his first remarks after being sworn into office, former state Sen. Glenn Hegar emphasized the benefits that low fuel prices bestow on consumers and noted that sales tax receipts — which make up a much larger portion of state tax collections than those that come directly from oil production — have remained healthy even as the dollar-per-barrel has plummeted to a five-year low. Sales tax collections hit a record high in November.
