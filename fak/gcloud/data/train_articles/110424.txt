'It's Laughably Bad'

Wolf Bestiality Story

IT'S A FAKE!



A newspaper clipping, which cites The Sun and claims that comedian Michelle Wolf once pleaded guilty to animal abuse, was fabricated.



The fake clipping appeared on Twitter in the days following Wolf’s much-discussed performance as the keynote speaker at the White House Correspondents’s Association dinner April 28. Wolf graduated from Hershey High School.

The partial clipping was made to look as if it was taken from the Sunday, July 10, 2015, issue of “The Hershe…” newspaper. The text of the clipping also says that “Hershey investigator, Dan Browlinski, told The Sun that several hundreds images and videos of Miss Wolf engaging in illegal sexual intercourse with a number of male dogs was found on her hard drive.”

“It’s laughably bad,” The Sun’s Managing Partner David Buffington, said. “The person who faked this thing messed up all sorts of easily verifiable stuff.”

For example, The Sun is a weekly newspaper and is published on Thursdays, not Sundays. The Sun does not use the typefaces shown in the fake clipping, and The Sun’s police news reports are not written in that style.

“You could go to our website, thesunontheweb.com, and figure out that stuff in five minutes,” Buffington said.

A search of The Sun’s current archives shows no mention of Dan Browlinski. (The Sun dates back to 1871.) A search of the archives does show that a Michelle Wolf was mentioned in 2010 as a bridesmaid at a wedding.

A search of court records in counties covered by The Sun does show that a Michelle Wolf pleaded guilty to speeding in 2018, but the search showed no other offenses.
