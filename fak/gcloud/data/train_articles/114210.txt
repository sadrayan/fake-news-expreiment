‘Gray death:’ Heroin, fentanyl mix kills DeKalb woman
A Brookhaven woman died from a mixture of heroin and fentanyl known as “gray death,” GBI officials said.

Lauren Camp, 24, had ingested the mix before she was found submerged in a bathtub in February, GBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles said. GBI officials found the deadly drugs at the scene. Camp’s “gray death” is the first confirmed in Georgia.

GBI crime lab supervisor Deneen Kilcrease dubbed the drug "gray death" for its color.

“It's the only gray drug that I've ever seen,” she told Channel 2 Action News, “and when I heard what components were it, I didn't see how anyone can survive it.”

There have been 50 confirmed seizures of gray death in Georgia this year, according to the GBI. One of the drugs in the mix, furanylfentanyl, killed at least 22 Georgians within the past year.
