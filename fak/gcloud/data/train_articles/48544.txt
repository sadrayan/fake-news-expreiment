How Trumpâ€™s proposed 2020 budget hinges on significant economic growth
Larry Kudlow:

Well, we will just see. The proof of that pudding will be in the eating.

Everybody disagreed with us in 2018, said we couldn't get 3 percent economic growth after the tax cuts were passed. And we did. And, again, the view here is, we are promoting incentives in the economy. We have had tremendous increases in business investment.

We have also had 100 percent expensing for new equipment. That has spurred business investment. There's money coming in offshore. We're the hottest economy in the world. The president's trade policies, I think, are contributing to confidence. We are on the verge of what I hope will be a historic deal with China. Perhaps we will talk about that.

In other words, people have doubted our supply-side tax cuts. So far, we won round one. I'm going roll the dice again, and I'm going to take the over and suggest that we will be right again this year, and many of our critics will not be.
