Ron Johnson Launches Radio Ad on Saving Packers Fans From Vikings Broadcasts
Ron is using his private sector experience to solve problems and connect Wisconsin

The Ron Johnson campaign today launched a radio ad reminding voters in northern Wisconsin about Ron’s work to cut through bureaucratic red tape that forced Wisconsinites to watch Minnesota Vikings games instead of Packers games. The ad, “ Packers,” will air on northern Wisconsin radio stations through the end of the election.

“Ron Johnson believes all Wisconsinites deserve to enjoy Packers games, and their local news. That’s why when he went to Washington, he got a law passed to fix it,” the narrator says.

Parts of northern Wisconsin are in the Duluth, Minn. media market, so they receive Minnesota Vikings games instead of Packer games. In 2014, Ron got a provision signed into law that allows television stations to change their designated market. WSAW in Wausau has already filed a petition with the federal government to broadcast Packers games and local news into Ashland and Iron counties.

“Ron Johnson saw a problem and he fixed it,” the narrator continues. “He didn’t let politics get in the way. Ron Johnson – he listens to northern Wisconsin and he gets results.”
