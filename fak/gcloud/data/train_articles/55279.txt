New York's income tax rates were last changed two years ago for tax year 2016, and the tax brackets were previously changed in 2015.

New York has eight marginal tax brackets, ranging from 4% (the lowest New York tax bracket) to 8.82% (the highest New York tax bracket). Each marginal rate only applies to earnings within the applicable marginal tax bracket .

In New York, different tax brackets are applicable to different filing types. Married couples filing their New York income tax return jointly will usually have wider tax brackets than those filing separately or as an individual.

How do New York tax brackets work?

Technically, you don't have just one "tax bracket" - you pay all of the New York marginal tax rates from the lowest tax bracket to the tax bracket in which you earned your last dollar. For comparison purposes, however, your New York tax bracket is the tax bracket in which your last earned dollar in any given tax period falls.

You can think of the bracketed income tax as a flat amount for all of the money you earned up to your highest tax bracket, plus a marginal percentage of any amount you earned over that. The chart below breaks down the New York tax brackets using this model:

For earnings between $0.00 and $8,500.00, you'll pay 4% For earnings between $8,500.00 and $11,700.00, you'll pay 4.5% plus $340.00 For earnings between $11,700.00 and $13,900.00, you'll pay 5.25% plus $484.00 For earnings between $13,900.00 and $21,400.00, you'll pay 5.9% plus $599.50 For earnings between $21,400.00 and $80,650.00, you'll pay 6.33% plus $1,042.00 For earnings between $80,650.00 and $215,400.00, you'll pay 6.57% plus $4,792.53 For earnings between $215,400.00 and $1,077,550.00, you'll pay 6.85% plus $13,645.60 For earnings over $1,077,550.00, you'll pay 8.82% plus $72,702.88 For earnings between $0.00 and $17,150.00, you'll pay 4% For earnings between $17,150.00 and $23,600.00, you'll pay 4.5% plus $686.00 For earnings between $23,600.00 and $27,900.00, you'll pay 5.25% plus $976.25 For earnings between $27,900.00 and $43,000.00, you'll pay 5.9% plus $1,202.00 For earnings between $43,000.00 and $161,550.00, you'll pay 6.33% plus $2,092.90 For earnings between $161,550.00 and $323,200.00, you'll pay 6.57% plus $9,597.12 For earnings between $323,200.00 and $2,155,350.00, you'll pay 6.85% plus $20,217.52 For earnings over $2,155,350.00, you'll pay 8.82% plus $145,719.80

iFrame not loaded! New York Income Tax Estimator You can use the income tax estimator to the left to calculate your approximate New York and Federal income tax based on the most recent tax brackets.

New York Tax Deductions When calculating your New York income tax, keep in mind that the New York state income tax brackets are only applied to your adjusted gross income (AGI) after you have made any qualifying deductions. Qualifying deductions might include an itemized deduction, the New York standard deduction, exemptions for dependants, business expenses, etc. Remember that New York may have very different deduction laws from the Federal Income Tax, so you may have to write a whole new list of deductions for your New York income tax return.

New York Standard Deductions & Personal Exemption Amounts

In addition to marginal tax brackets, one of the major features of the New York income tax is deductions. The three most common deductions encountered by taxpayers are the New York Standard Deduction, the New York Personal Exemption, and the New York Dependent Deduction. The current values of these deductions for tax year 2018 are as follows:

Standard Deduction (Single) Standard Deduction (MFJ) Personal Exemption Dependant Exemption $8,000.00 $16,050.00 $0.00 $1,000.00

The standard deduction, which New York has, is a deduction that is available by default to all taxpayers who do not instead choose to file an itemized deduction. Essentially, it translates to $8,000.00 per year of tax-free income for single New York taxpayers, and $16,050.00 for those filing jointly.

The Personal Exemption, which is not supported by the New York income tax, is an additional deduction you can take if you (and not someone else) are primarily responsible for your own living expenses. Likewise, you can take an additional dependent exemption for each qualifying dependent (like a child or family member), who you financially support.

The Federal income tax also has a standard deduction, personal exemptions, and dependant deductions, though they are different amounts than New York's and may have different rules.
