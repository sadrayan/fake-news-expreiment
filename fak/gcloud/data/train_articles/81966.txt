Possible presidential spoiler Gary Johnson speaks to The Times editorial board about siphoning votes from Hillary Clinton
Currently, you go to the doctor, you have no idea what it's going to cost -- no idea. You have no idea what the outcome's going to be. And then when you do get the bill you know that nobody's really going to pay what it is they said this costs. How do you get those reforms? Well, obviously this is very complex. If we may also talk about the entitlements: Neither Trump nor Clinton is talking about reform to the entitlements, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security. And it's a fiscal cliff. We are headed for a fiscal cliff unless, in my opinion, we address these issues. The way we address Medicare and Medicaid is we give those functions to the states. Having been governor in New Mexico, in my heart of hearts I could have drawn new lines of eligibility for Medicaid and had a safety net. No one would have gone without. But if I would have been given a fixed amount of money, I believe I could have made that stick. Medicare of course is not a state's function, but I think it needs to be if we are actually going to reform it. I'll say that this [creates] 50 laboratories of innovation and best practices that would emerge that would be fabulously successful. You'd also have some horrible failures that others would have to avoid.
