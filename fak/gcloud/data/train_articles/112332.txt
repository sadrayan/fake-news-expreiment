About ― The Tempest
The Tempest was founded in 2016 to serve tomorrow’s leaders, creators, and dreamers with uniquely creative and intelligent storytelling that’s built for users first. We help our highly engaged audience of diverse women chasing dreams of every size, broaden their views of the world, see what lays ahead, and truly claim their voices – and power.

We are more than thirty people around the world, along with more than 1,500 writers, with a significant presence in New York, Dubai, Los Angeles, London, Karachi, and Toronto. Collectively, we speak 20 different languages, reflecting our diverse perspectives and belief in a truly global community.

As the global next-generation women’s media company, we’ve innovated the way content and storytelling speaks to and represents the world, simply by giving our audience the community they’ve always wanted. Delivering on that mission, we’ve driven authenticity-fueled initiatives across a range of platforms, with a particular focus on design, community, user experience, and innovative storytelling. We’ve grown from a single website into an array of digital products and brands, which are listed below.

We celebrate authenticity, build community, and always seek to disrupt the norm – walking the walk in everything we do.
