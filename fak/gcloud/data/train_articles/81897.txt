Immigrants object to growing use of ankle monitors after detention
Andrew Free, a Nashville-based immigration attorney volunteering at the Texas detention centers, said a Honduran client fought in court for a week to not wear an ankle monitor, and had her release approved on her own recognizance â€” only to have ICE issue her a monitor anyway. The relative she went to stay with in Texas was hesitant to host her because of the stigma associated with the monitors, Free said.
