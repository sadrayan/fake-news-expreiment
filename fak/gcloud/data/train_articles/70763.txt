3 SECTION 9. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is hereby found and determined by the

4 Eighty-second General Assembly that existing highway user revenue sources do

5 not provide sufficient funds for the necessary maintenance, repair,

6 construction and reconstruction of state highways, county roads and municipal

7 streets; that there is an immediate and urgent need for adequate state

8 highways, county roads and municipal streets; that the continued economic

9 expansion and growth of this state will be jeopardized if an adequate system

10 of state highways, county roads and municipal streets is not provided; and

11 that only by the immediate passage of this act may such vitally needed

12 additional funds be provided to solve these problems. Therefore, an emergency

13 is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the

14 preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective on

15 the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved nor

16 vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the

17 period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is

18 vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective

19 on the date the last house overrides the veto.
