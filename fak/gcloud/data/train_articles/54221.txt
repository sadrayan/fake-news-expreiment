Manager Discussion of Fund Performance

Columbia Acorn® Fund P. Zachary Egan Co-Portfolio Manager Fritz Kaegi Co-Portfolio Manager Matthew A. Litfin Lead Portfolio Manager Columbia Acorn Fund Class Z shares gained 10.39% in 2016. While it had a strong absolute return, the Fund fell short of its primary benchmark, the Russell 2500 Index, which gained 17.59%. The benchmark’s more core orientation benefited from strength in value stocks throughout the year. In comparison to the Fund’s more growth-oriented Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth peer group, Columbia Acorn Fund beat the category average return of 6.03% by 436 basis points (a basis point is 1/100th of a percent). We feel 2016 was a positive year for the Fund’s small/mid-cap growth strategy and are pleased with its solid absolute return in a market that largely favored value strategies. Fund relative performance benefited from good stock selection in the consumer discretionary sector, but was dragged down by investments in the financial and information technology sectors. The health care sector is inherently risky and often complicated by political volatility and regulatory hurdles, so it was not surprising that the sector came under pressure following the U.S. presidential election on concerns about changes proposed by the new administration. The Fund saw a significant impact from health care holdings both at the top and the bottom end of the performance scale. On the downside in the sector, Celldex Therapeutics, a biotech developing cancer drugs, fell following a failed drug trial early in the year and a lack of news flow kept the stock depressed, resulting in a 78% decline for the year. Down 37% in the Fund, orphan drug developer Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical also declined with the sector and on concerns about drug prices. There is still a great deal of strategic interest from acquirers within the health care sector, as evidenced by Medivation, a developer and marketer of cancer drugs. Its stock rose 173% for the year, gaining on news that French drug company Sanofi wanted to acquire the company at a significant premium. Sanofi lost out to Pfizer, however, which acquired the company at a price well above Sanofi’s initial offer. Up 46%, Align Technology, the maker of the Invisalign system used to straighten teeth, gained as the company continued to take business away from traditional braces with its clear

plastic retainers. In the real estate sector, Jones Lang LaSalle, a provider of real estate services, fell 37% in 2016. The company struggled early in the year on concerns of a decline in commercial real estate transaction and leasing volumes in China, concerns that broadened to include the United Kingdom and Europe following the Brexit vote. Industrials benefited from the “Trump bump” following the election, particularly companies with larger U.S. tax exposure. Up 55%, Toro, a well-known name in lawn care equipment, reported strong quarterly earnings and positive initial 2017 guidance driven primarily by excellent operational execution. New to the Fund this year, WageWorks, a provider of health care consumer-directed benefits and commuter account management, falls within the industrial sector and gained 41% on news of its acquisition of ADP’s customer-directed benefits business. This acquisition is expected to have significant upside, and the company also benefited from positive 2017 enrollment trends. Through enhancements to our long-standing, research-driven process, the number of new stock ideas added to Columbia Acorn Fund increased in 2016. The 58 new ideas that were added—which compares to 25 new ideas added in 2015—represented 38% of the Fund’s market value at year end. Looking at Fund and benchmark comparative data for earnings-per-share growth, long-term debt to capitalization and return on invested capital, the portfolio now holds higher quality and faster growing names. We believe we are offering Fund shareholders a portfolio of the best U.S. small- to mid-caps available. We do not anticipate the same level of turnover will continue in 2017, but we will continue to look for opportunities to add what we believe to be superior smaller growth names to the portfolio. While we do not generally make large shifts in the Fund based on macroeconomic events, we did consider Fund positioning and the anticipated impact of a Trump presidency. We took advantage of the downturn in health care to increase the Fund’s overweight in the sector. We believe that there are many compelling investment areas in health care that will not be impacted significantly by the changes proposed by the new administration. While still an underweight position versus the benchmark, we did 6 Columbia Acorn Family of Funds | Annual Report 2016

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance (continued)

Columbia Acorn® Fund increase exposure to financials in the quarter, specifically to banks that are likely to benefit from higher interest rates. With the potential for interest rates to rise, we maintained the Fund’s large underweights in utilities and real estate, areas that are generally negatively impacted by higher rates and that also lack the growth potential that we look for in Fund holdings. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies involve risks and volatility and possible illiquidity greater than investments in larger, more established companies. Foreign investments subject the Fund to political, economic, market, social and other risks within a particular country, as well as to potential currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Risks are enhanced for emerging market issuers. The Fund may invest significantly in issuers within a particular sector , which may be negatively affected by market, economic or other conditions, making the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in the sector.

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance

Columbia Acorn International® P. Zachary Egan Co-Portfolio Manager Louis J. Mendes Co-Portfolio Manager Columbia Acorn International Class Z shares ended the year down 2.28%, underperforming the 3.57% gain of the Fund’s primary benchmark, the MSCI ACWI ex USA SMID Cap Index (Net). The relative lag was largely due to the Fund’s emphasis on secular growth businesses in a year that favored deep value cyclicals. This effect of the Fund’s investment strategy is apparent when looking at its more growth-oriented Morningstar Foreign Small/Mid Growth peer group, which had an average decline of 2.98% for the year. Materials and information technology were the most significant sectoral detractors from relative performance for the year. Regionally, the majority of the Fund’s underperformance was concentrated in Europe and the United Kingdom, and in Asia ex-Japan. On the downside, IHI, a Japanese industrial conglomerate, was the Fund’s biggest detractor for the year. Down 49%, we sold the stock in the first quarter as word reached the market that several of its projects in shipbuilding and overseas plant construction were exceeding budget estimates, negatively impacting the company’s profitability. Based in Sweden, Kindred Group (formerly known as Unibet), a European online gaming operator, ended the year down 24%. Kindred gave back much of its 2015 gains as overall sentiment on the sector weakened and on concerns that growth would not be fast enough in newly regulated markets to offset higher taxes. We view the re-regulation of online gaming as a long-term positive development, reducing regulatory risk, raising barriers to entry and favoring highly ethical, well-invested Nordic operators like Kindred. CCL Industries, a Canadian global label converter, ended the year up 23% and was the Fund’s top contributing stock. CCL acquired U.S.-based Checkpoint Solutions, a maker of anti-theft label systems, in 2016, raising expectations of significant cost and revenue synergies from the move. Actelion, a Swiss-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for orphan diseases, was added to the Fund this year and was a top contributor to gains, increasing 53% in the Fund. A key player in the $5 billion-plus pulmonary hypertension market, Actelion is the subject of a complicated takeover bid by Johnson & Johnson, which may not ultimately result in a deal, but has put a valuation premium on its shares. Also impacted by acquisition news, U.S.-listed Cepheid, a global leader in the burgeoning molecular diagnostics space, gained 83% following the announcement that it was to be acquired by Danaher. We sold the stock on the news. Thoughtful market commentators will pause before opining on market prospects for 2017, given the series of consequential political surprises in 2016. Western Europe, including the United Kingdom, was home to over 40% of the Fund’s capital at year end. Here we face not only uncertainties related to how the United Kingdom will extricate itself from the European Union, but also important national elections in both France and Germany, which could have implications for the future of the European integration project. On the other hand, many European corporates, with the notable exception of financials, are beneficiaries of continuing low interest rates and any potential fiscal boost. In addition, we feel many corporate valuations appear reasonable at this time. Japan, the third largest economy in the world, contains few pockets of growth owing to adverse demographics and little immigration. However, many Japanese companies are now earnestly adopting initiatives aimed at improving returns on capital, which we believe could prove a catalyst for further stock price appreciation. The yen remains a wildcard, as earnings in Japanese exporters can be highly sensitive to foreign exchange effects. The Fund had roughly 20% of its capital deployed in Japan at

year end. Asia ex-Japan, not a homogenous region, constituted roughly 15% of Fund assets at year end. Here we remain excited by attractive demographics, and rising productivity and prospects for the consumer and financial sectors, which flow from these. As long as regional corporates fund themselves in unhedged U.S. dollars, however, dollar strength introduces balance sheet hazards, which we will be watching closely. To the extent that companies anywhere on the globe supply the U.S. market, they could be adversely impacted by protectionist measures seemingly entailed by President Trump’s “America First!” rhetoric. The contours of any policy in this regard, however, remain highly uncertain at this time, and Columbia Acorn Family of Funds | Annual Report 2016

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance (continued)

Columbia Acorn International® policymakers may reconsider as they become sensitized to the ultimate implications of this approach for U.S. consumers and U.S. exporters. As always, we will rely heavily on indicators of business quality to sort through the opportunities. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. International investing involves certain risks and volatility due to potential political, economic or currency instabilities and different, potentially less stringent, financial and accounting standards than those generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Risks are enhanced for emerging market issuers. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies involve risks and volatility and possible illiquidity greater than investments in larger, more established companies. 12 Columbia Acorn Family of Funds | Annual Report 2016

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance

Columbia Acorn USA® Matthew A. Litfin Lead Portfolio Manager William J. Doyle Co-Portfolio Manager Columbia Acorn USA Class Z shares gained 13.00% in 2016, a strong absolute return but short of the 21.31% gain of the Fund’s primary benchmark, the Russell 2000 Index. The difference was largely due to the benchmark’s exposure to value stocks, which led market performance for much of the year but aren’t a focus of the Fund’s small-cap growth strategy. Comparing to the Fund’s growth-oriented Morningstar Small Growth peer group, Columbia Acorn USA surpassed the category average return of 11.20% by 180 basis points (a basis point is 1/100th of a percent). Health care names were prominent among the Fund’s detractors for the year. Celldex Therapeutics, a biotech developing cancer drugs, was sold in the first quarter but ranked as the Fund’s worst detractor for the annual period, falling 78% in the Fund. The company’s brain cancer drug failed a Phase III trial early in the year and the stock declined on the news. Orphan drug developer Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical and Akorn, a developer, manufacturer and distributor of specialty generic drugs, ended the year down 38% and 42%, respectively. Political uncertainty following the election brought down the sector, as did increased concerns regarding drug pricing pressures. The top-contributing sector to Fund performance for the year was consumer discretionary. The Fund’s overweight position in the sector gained 24%, nearly doubling the benchmark’s 13% return. LCI Industries (formerly Drew Industries), a provider of recreational vehicles (RVs) and manufactured home components, was the top contributor in the Fund, gaining 78% in 2016, as the company continued to benefit from market-share gains amid robust RV end-market demand, combined with its efficient manufacturing processes. Within the same industry, we participated in the October initial public offering of Camping World, a chain of RV-centric retail stores and related services provider. The stock got off to a strong start, ending the year up 42%. The RV market is one of the bright spots in the consumer discretionary space, and we believe Camping World has solid prospects for sales growth and margin expansion. Papa John’s International, a franchisor of pizza restaurants, was also a leader for the year in the sector, gaining 56% as the company took share in the pizza industry with its effective digital platform and marketing strategy, which drove strong earnings. Over the past year, we made significant changes to Columbia Acorn USA. We added 63 new ideas to the Fund, focusing on companies that have high and steady returns on invested capital. We also reduced the weighted average market cap of the Fund by focusing our additions to the portfolio on small-cap growth names. Overall, the Fund increased its exposure to the health care and consumer discretionary sectors in 2016 and reduced its exposure to industrials, as we gravitated to companies that we believe are less cyclical, have sustainable growth outlooks and have the ability to control their own destinies. While health care struggled late in the year, we are finding compelling valuations and investment opportunities in the sector in areas that we believe are unlikely to be greatly impacted by changes proposed by the new administration. Going into 2017, it appears that there is significant economic momentum. U.S. gross domestic product growth looks encouraging, though it was down somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2016. Consumer spending has been strong, and the market is beginning to price in apparent optimism around potential regulatory changes. In our opinion, a more business-friendly environment should be beneficial to the high-quality, small-cap growth companies held in Columbia Acorn USA, as should a transition in equity markets from being interest-rate driven to being earnings driven. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies involve risks and volatility and possible illiquidity greater than investments in larger, more established companies. The Fund may invest significantly in issuers within a particular sector , which may be negatively affected by market, economic or other conditions, making the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in the sector.

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance

Columbia Acorn International SelectSM Stephen Kusmierczak Co-Portfolio Manager Andreas Waldburg-Wolfegg Co-Portfolio Manager Columbia Acorn International Select Class Z shares ended the year up 1.18%, underperforming the 4.50% gain of the Fund’s primary benchmark, the MSCI ACWI ex USA Index (Net). The relative lag was largely due to the Fund’s emphasis on growth in a year that favored deep value cyclicals. Comparing to the Fund’s more growth-oriented Morningstar Foreign Large Growth peer group, which had an average decline of 2.14% for the year, the Fund outperformed by 332 basis points (a basis point is 1/100th of a percent). Regionally, Fund underperformance was concentrated in the United Kingdom and Europe. On a sector basis, Fund performance lagged in the consumer discretionary and materials sectors. On the downside, Novozymes, a Danish manufacturer of industrial enzymes, fell 27% on lowered guidance in the second half of the year, reversing reports made earlier in the year that the company would likely reach the higher end of its guidance range. Novozymes has been negatively impacted by weak agriculture income and low oil prices, which have depressed bioenergy. Down 38% for the year, Eutelsat, a French provider of fixed satellite services, was sold in the third quarter on concerns about future growth prospects for the company. Down 15%, Distribuidora Internacional de Alimentación, a discount retailer in Spain and Latin America, declined as quarterly earnings fell short of expectations and remained flat year-over-year. Pricing pressure in Spain and Portugal have hurt the company. Next, a UK clothes and home retailer, ended the year down 40%, also suffering from poor earnings results for the year. The leading contributor to Fund performance in 2016 was Largan Precision, a Taiwanese maker of mobile device camera lenses and modules. Largan dominates the high-end miniature lens business and has been expanding its operating margins. Its stock gained 73% during the year. Also a leader in the year, Partners Group, a Swiss investment manager focused on private equity, infrastructure and real estate, gained 33%. The company benefited from the uptick in European financials and from fundraising from new and existing clients that exceeded expectations. Canadian global label converter CCL Industries, the Fund’s largest position at year end, was also a top contributor, gaining 22%. CCL acquired U.S.-based Checkpoint Solutions, a maker of anti-theft label systems, in 2016, raising expectations of significant cost and revenue synergies from the move. As we move into 2017, worldwide political uncertainty is at an all-time high. President Trump’s pledge to put America first could have negative implications for international companies that draw their business from the United States. A lack of clarity around Brexit negotiations continues to worry investors, and upcoming elections in France and Germany could determine the future of the European Union. On the other hand, despite initial concerns, the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Renzi following the defeat of a controversial reform referendum had little impact on European markets late in the year. In addition, Italy began to take measures to safeguard its banking sector, a move viewed very favorably by the markets. At the end of the year, we saw interest rates increase in the United States and we expect other countries to follow. Japanese stocks rallied at year end on positive economic data suggesting

improved growth prospects and on reduced expectations of further stimulus efforts coming from the Bank of Japan. The European Central Bank announced stimulus measures but then hinted at a

possible reversal. Through diligent research, we will continue to focus on finding opportunities to take advantage of market conditions. Our emphasis remains on building exposure to names that have solid earnings growth and the ability to succeed long term. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. Foreign investments subject the Fund to political, economic, market, social and other risks within a particular country, as well as to potential currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Risks are enhanced for emerging market issuers.

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance

Columbia Acorn SelectSM David L. Frank Co-Portfolio Manager Matthew S. Szafranski Co-Portfolio Manager Columbia Acorn Select Class Z shares gained 11.88% in 2016, a strong absolute return but short of the Fund’s primary benchmark, the S&P MidCap 400 Index, which gained 20.74%. Throughout most of the year, strong performance among value stocks helped the benchmark’s more core orientation, but worked against the Fund’s mid-cap growth strategy. Compared to its peers, Columbia Acorn Select topped its Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth category average annual return of 6.03%. The Fund underperformed relative to its benchmark in the information technology sector, due largely to the underperformance of two names sold in the first quarter of the year. Bankrate, a provider of Internet advertising for insurance, credit card and banking markets, left the Fund with a 33% loss for the year after declining on increased pressure from competitor Google. Blackhawk Network, a third-party distributor of prepaid content such as gift cards, declined 26% in the Fund on changes at the retail level that negatively impacted its business in the first quarter. Within the real estate sector, Jones Lang LaSalle, a provider of commercial real estate services worldwide, struggled early in the year on concerns of a decline in commercial real estate transaction and leasing volumes in China. Following the Brexit vote, these concerns expanded to include the United Kingdom and Europe. While its stock recovered some ground in the third quarter, a downward reversal in the fourth quarter left Jones Lang LaSalle with a 16% loss for the year. As we ended the year, the surprising outcome of the U.S. election sparked a sudden and significant change in market expectations and touched off a flood of cash into equity sectors expected to benefit from Republican policy initiatives including financials, industrials, materials and energy. Against this backdrop, Columbia Acorn Select benefited from its overweight position in the industrials sector. Nordson, a manufacturer of dispensing systems for adhesives and coatings, was mentioned at the half year as being a beneficiary of new technology that utilizes the company’s dispensing and testing technologies. This development, combined with the sector rally late in the year, led the stock to a 75% gain in the Fund. Financials surged following the election on expectations of less onerous federal regulations for brokers, as well as benefits from higher interest rates. This rally contributed to the 74% annual gain for SVB Financial, a bank for venture capitalists that was added to the Fund this year. Among its mid-cap banking peers, we expect SVB Financial to find a higher rate environment very advantageous. Political uncertainty following the election weighed on the health care sector in the final months of 2016, but the Fund outperformed its benchmark in the sector thanks to strong stock selection, gaining 12% versus a benchmark gain of 9%. Align Technology, the manufacturer of the Invisalign system used to straighten teeth, gained 45%, as the company has been able to take business away from traditional braces with its clear plastic retainers. The launch of a new digital scanner this year helped drive an acceleration of case volumes and, moreover, its acquisition of a minority stake in Smile Direct Club, a do-it-yourself aligner treatment for basic cases, looks promising. We further concentrated the Fund in 2016, ending the year with 32 names. We have worked to create a portfolio of our analyst team’s top ideas, focusing on high-quality names that we believe have strong growth potential and that are available at compelling valuations. We like companies that we see as having the ability to control their own destinies and not being heavily tied to macroeconomic drivers. On a sector basis, the Fund’s largest average overweights relative to the benchmark at year end were in the industrial and consumer discretionary sectors. The adjustments that we made to the Fund were largely completed at mid-year, and we were pleased to see Columbia Acorn Select ahead of the benchmark with the Fund up 13.26% and the benchmark up 11.87% for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Going forward, we expect less turnover in the Fund, as we seek to profit from multi-year trends in our heavily researched, concentrated Fund.

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance

Columbia Thermostat FundSM David L. Frank Portfolio Manager* Columbia Thermostat Fund Class Z shares gained 4.72% in 2016, compared to an 11.96% gain of the Fund’s primary equity benchmark, the S&P 500 Index. Fund gains topped its primary debt benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which ended the year up 2.65%, while the Fund’s custom 50/50 Blended Benchmark gained 7.38% for the year. The Fund’s equity portfolio had a weighted average gain of 6.41% for the year. Columbia Dividend Income Fund led the equity portion, gaining 13.65% in 2016. Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund had the largest decline, falling 8.36%. Columbia Thermostat Fund’s bond portfolio ended the year with a weighted average gain of 3.62%. Columbia Income Opportunities Fund was a standout for the year, gaining 10.66%. Columbia U.S. Treasury Index Fund had the smallest gain, increasing 0.88% for the annual period. The Fund hit five reallocation triggers in the second half of the year and three in the fourth quarter. The Fund increased equity exposure in November and decreased exposure twice in December to end the year with a 10% weighting in stocks and a 90% weighting in bonds. We were pleased to see the Fund perform as designed in 2016, offering shareholders a return that fell between the equity and bond markets. The Fund ended the year with its minimum exposure to stocks of 10%, as we sold equities on market strength late in the year to capture gains. This was the first time in 2016 that the S&P 500 topped the 2,250 threshold, which triggered the Fund’s move to 10% stocks. We look forward to taking advantage of future market reversals. *Christopher Olson, former co-portfolio manager of Columbia Thermostat Fund, retired from Columbia Wanger Asset Management on December 31, 2016. David Frank will continue as the sole portfolio manager of Columbia Thermostat Fund. Results of the Funds Owned in Columbia Thermostat Fund as of December 31, 2016 Equity Funds Weightings

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance (continued)

Columbia Thermostat FundSM A "fund of fund" bears its allocable share of the costs and expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests. Such funds are thus subject to two levels of fees and potentially higher expense ratios than would be associated with a fund that invests and trades directly in financial instruments under the direction of a single manager. T he Fund’s investments in the underlying funds may present certain risks, including the following. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. The Fund’s investment in other fund s subjects it to the investment performance (positive or negative), risks and expenses of these underlying funds. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies involve risks and volatility and possible illiquidity greater than in investments in larger, more established companies. There are risks associated with fixed-income investments , including credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and prepayment and extension risk. In general, bond prices fall when interest rates rise and vice versa. This effect is more pronounced for longer term securities. Non-investment-grade (high-yield or junk) securities present greater price volatility and more risk to principal and income than higher rated securities. Foreign investments subject the Fund to political, economic, market, social and other risks within a particular country, as well as to potential currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Risks are enhanced for emerging market issuers. The value of an investment in the Fund is based primarily on the performance of the underlying funds in which it invests. The Fund is subject to the risk that the investment manager’s decisions regarding asset classes and underlying funds will not anticipate market trends successfully, resulting in a failure to reserve capital or lower total return. The Investment Manager may prefer an underlying fund in the Columbia Acorn Family of Funds over alternative investments. There can be no assurance that the Columbia Acorn Funds will outperform similar funds managed by the Investment Manager’s affiliates. This is not an offer of the shares of any other mutual fund mentioned herein. 28 Columbia Acorn Family of Funds | Annual Report 2016

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance

Columbia Acorn Emerging Markets FundSM Fritz Kaegi Co-Portfolio Manager Stephen Kusmierczak Co-Portfolio Manager Louis J. Mendes Co-Portfolio Manager Satoshi Matsunaga Co-Portfolio Manager Columbia Acorn Emerging Markets Fund Class Z shares ended 2016 down 3.04%, underperforming the 3.51% gain of the Fund’s primary benchmark, the MSCI Emerging Markets SMID Cap Index (Net). 2016 was the Fund’s toughest year in terms of underperformance versus its primary benchmark since its launch in 2011. The Fund’s primary detractor was poor stock selection in China (including Hong Kong- and Singapore-listed stocks), which represented about two-thirds of the underperformance relative to the benchmark, with one stock—Sihuan Pharmaceutical—representing about a third of the Fund’s

total underperformance. In an effort to improve performance, we’ve made changes to our analyst coverage in China, and we’re upgrading the quality of Fund holdings in that market. Our analyst has a strong record investing in Asian technology and select China-related stocks, and we feel he can further his stock-picking success with his coverage of the full region. We have been hurt by “value traps”—stocks that look very cheap but that have unexceptional corporate governance, business models and economic drivers—and relatively illiquid ones at that. In the meantime, because we believe high-quality ideas in Chinese small caps are scarce, we have reduced our overall exposure to China. The second-largest negative Fund performance factor was not being present in Brazil for the full year, which accounts for about one-third of the Fund’s underperformance versus the benchmark in 2016. Entering 2016, we had some limited exposure to the market, but we saw little to be excited about in terms of Brazilian company fundamentals; further, Brazil had a 10-year bond rate of about 16%, rendering equity investments relatively unattractive because a company’s future cash flows would be heavily discounted by comparison with less-risky local bank deposits or bonds. Against this backdrop, we opted to exit the market. By the end of 2016, local bond rates fell to nearly 11%, making stocks look more attractive. At the same time, the Fund missed out on the 24% appreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar. We generally do not try to make bets on interest rate changes or foreign currency moves because these tend to be speculative. In 2016, the Fund also performed poorly in some of the markets where it was overweight, most notably India and Mexico. In India, government moves hurt: in October it announced media regulations that could affect ad revenues at Zee Entertainment, an Indian programmer of pay television content and the Fund’s largest holding. Though we think the effect will be muted on Zee Entertainment’s business and that there are positive aspects of the change that could increase subscription revenues, the news hurt the stock late in the period, leaving it with a 0.98% return for the year. In November, the government caused a negative monetary shock by cancelling large-denomination cash bills. This "demonetization" caused disruption in many industries and hurt Indian stocks, as investors sought liquidity and priced in the shock’s effects. As a result, during the fourth quarter India underperformed other countries in the Fund. Nonetheless, we believe that we have a group of high quality, resilient Indian businesses that will hold up well through the “demonetization” disruption. In Mexico, the MSCI Mexico Investable Market Index sank 8% and the peso depreciated 6% in the wake of the U.S. elections on concerns the new presidential administration will enact policies that could worsen Mexican business conditions. Airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte was among the Fund’s biggest detractors for the year, falling 27% on fears of lower traffic. We have followed Mexican airport operators for years and held on to the position based on our belief that we own an asset with attractive long-term growth and price dynamics, listed at a very attractive price. On the positive side, the Fund saw strong performance from holdings in Taiwan and the Philippines during the year, and also benefited from its overweight allocation to Southeast Asia. Largan Precision (+72% for the year), Silergy (+37% for the year), and Vanguard International (+36% for the year)—all tech hardware companies—strongly outperformed Taiwan and the tech sector as a whole versus the benchmark, driven by diverse trends within their various industries. Melco Crown (Philippines) Resorts grew 57% during the year and was the leading contributor to performance, benefiting as gaming conditions improved and costs got under control, finally swinging the company to profitability after a tough opening in 2015. 32 Columbia Acorn Family of Funds | Annual Report 2016

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance (continued)

Columbia Acorn Emerging Markets FundSM Emerging markets face diverse economic and political challenges in 2017, arising not only from conditions internal to them but also from policy and macroeconomic volatility in the developed world. International political tension has also ratcheted higher. As we navigate these conditions—and strive to improve on our 2016 performance—remember that each of your portfolio managers are sizable investors in this Fund. Having each lived and worked in emerging markets ourselves, we know that these countries have their ups and downs, but also are at the leading edge of many global economic and demographic trends. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. International investing involves certain risks and volatility due to potential political, economic or currency instabilities and different, potentially less stringent, financial and accounting standards than those generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Risks are enhanced for emerging and frontier market issuers. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies involve risks and volatility and possible illiquidity greater than investments in larger, more established companies.

Manager Discussion of Fund Performance

Columbia Acorn European FundSM Andreas Waldburg-Wolfegg Co-Portfolio Manager Stephen Kusmierczak Co-Portfolio Manager Columbia Acorn European Fund Class Z shares ended the year down 3.29%, underperforming the 1.57% decline of the Fund’s primary benchmark, the MSCI AC Europe Small Cap Index (Net). The relative lag was largely due to the Fund’s emphasis on growth in a year that generally favored value. The impact of value strength on the Fund was felt strongest in the fourth quarter. Columbia Acorn European Fund’s performance was in line with its Morningstar Europe Stock peer group, which had an average decline of 1.66% in 2016. Regionally, relative underperformance was concentrated in Northern and Central Europe and in the United Kingdom. From a sector perspective, the Fund underperformed the benchmark within the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors. Among the Fund’s detractors, Wirecard, a German online payment processing and risk management company, fell in the first quarter on questionable allegations against the company. This downturn was followed by a strong second and third quarter, but the company cooled in the fourth quarter leaving the stock with a 13% loss for the year. Ending the year down 37%, we sold the Fund’s position in Regus, a provider of rental office space in full service business centers. In light of the many newcomers in the space, we were no longer convinced that Regus could preserve its edge. Distribuidora Internacional de Alimentación, a discount retailer in Spain and Latin America, declined 16%, as earnings fell short of expectations. Pricing pressure in Spain and Portugal hurt the company. Top contributors to Fund performance in the year included two Finnish stocks. Munksjo, a specialty paper manufacturer, gained 76% on strong results driven in part by improved market conditions that removed headwinds that were hampering stock performance. Konecranes, a manufacturer and service provider for industrial cranes and port handling equipment, rose 50% on news it would acquire U.S.-based Terex Corporation’s material handling and port solutions business. Listed in Spain, Prosegur, a provider of security guard services, ended the year up 40%, as the company showed strong organic growth and more technological innovation and service-level agreements. As we move into 2017, Europe faces many challenges. A lack of clarity around Brexit negotiations continues to worry investors, and the upcoming elections in France and Germany could determine the future of the European Union. On the other hand, despite initial concerns, the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Renzi following the defeat of a controversial reform referendum had little impact on European markets late in the period. In addition, Italy began to take measures to safeguard its banking sector, a move viewed very favorably by the markets. During the fourth quarter, we saw interest rates increase in the United States, and we expect other countries to follow. The European Central Bank announced stimulus measures that bolstered the markets late in the year but then hinted at a

possible reversal. While we will continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic factors impacting Europe, our focus remains on owning stocks in companies with solid earnings growth and sound

long-term prospects. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. International investing involves certain risks and volatility due to potential political, economic or currency instabilities and different, potentially less stringent, financial and accounting standards than those generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies involve risks and volatility and possible illiquidity greater than investments in larger, more established companies.

A “fund of fund” bears its allocable share of the costs and expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests. Such funds are thus subject to two levels of fees and potentially higher expense ratios than would be associated with a fund that invests and trades directly in financial instruments under the direction of a single manager.
