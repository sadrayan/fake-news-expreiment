Greek Cross
The so-called “Greek Cross” is formed by four arms of equal lengths.

While the Latin cross is identified with the crucifixion, the Greek cross is usually considered as a sign of God.

It is the preeminent graphic sign of the church and Christian society. The space between the arms is often filled with other signs or abbreviations, as with the Jerusalem cross and the Greek insignia with ICXC and NIKA.

From this basic form, most of the crosses in heraldry were developed, which greatly expanded the variety of cross forms. The Greek cross is often found carved or marked on church furnishings and is the shape of the consecration cross. The Red Cross uses the form in the west (a red crescent is used in non-Christian countries).

Other symbols are also sometimes added to the arms.
