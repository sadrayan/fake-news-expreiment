I reviewed the one paragraph and power-point presentation you had sent yesterday, including a statement that scimetrics made yesterday (http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scimetrics-ltd-corp-releases-facts-on-kaput-feral-hog-bait-300421327.html).

Upon consultation with several veterinarians, I think it is fair to say that nothing Scimetrics has released so far would count as a study. Having a paper "submitted for consideration" does not make it available to the public -- unless you can find it, in that case please send along.

Thanks,

A public study should really be a study done by an independent third party (i.e. a state agency like Texas Parks and Wildlife, or a University like Texas A&M Agrilife, Texas Tech, etc.) - otherwise there may be bias.

However, a study by Scimentrics regarding Kaput's use on feral hogs should be a full study (not a power point presentation) - whereby all the details of the testing methodology were laid out, such that individuals in the science and research fields could fully understand how the poison was studied. The following would likely be addressed in a full study: detail on the primary poisoning effects for wildlife (deer, javelina, raccoons, coyotes, etc.)

detail on the secondary poisoning effects for all scavengers (coyotes, buzzards, eagles, hawks, etc.) and humans detail on what the blue dye might do to the cattle and pork market (will USDA plants let an animal through that has a blue fat layer?) were all the feral hogs tested in fenced enclosures or free range? etc.,etc.,

Thanks,
