Press release: Africa overtaking America in the race against measles — Good Governance Africa
For once, Africa is outpacing America in combating measles. Vaccination rates have decreased in the US, leading to the current outbreak, while in Africa, measles jabs increased by 39% between 2000 and 2013, according to the upcoming Africa Survey 2015.

The Africa Survey, published by Good Governance Africa (GGA), is a comprehensive annual collection of social, political and economic indicators for the continent’s 55 countries compiled from a wide range of sources. GGA obtained information for this press release from the World Health Organisation.

Around the world, the measles vaccine has prevented an estimated 15.6m deaths between 2000 and 2013. Deaths from measles during this period dropped 88% in Africa, from 327,012 to 37,979, and 80% globally, from 498,676 to 101,744.

The strong correlation between increases in immunisation against measles and decreases in both incidence and deaths due to this disease is evident in many African countries.

In Niger, immunisation rates went up by 81% between 2000 and 2013, while deaths decreased by 91%. In addition, between 2009 and 2012, 66% fewer cases of measles were reported.

Similarly, Ethiopia increased immunisation by 88%, and decreased deaths by 78%, from 20,634 in 2000 to 4,541 in 2013.

Moreover, many African countries, despite varying degrees of economic and political stability, had an almost 100% immunisation rate in 2013, several exceeding the 91% vaccination rate in the US.

“Measles is a highly contagious and very serious illness that still kills an average of 400 children every day,” said Kate van Niekerk, a GGA researcher. “The widespread availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine, even in some of Africa’s most volatile and poor regions, has been a major public health success and has contributed to the reduction of child mortality.”​
