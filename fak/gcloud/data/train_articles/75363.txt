This eventually came to an end after the government spent billions of dollars combating the Great Depression.The largest uninterrupted stretch of deficits came between 1970 and 1997.It's hard to imagine that the United States will post a surplus anytime soon - will we give the 28 year stretch between 1970 and 1997 a run for its money?--
