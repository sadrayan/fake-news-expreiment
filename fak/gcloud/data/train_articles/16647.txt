Subject: RE: Austin reporter, notes below

I did have a follow-up:

There have been news reports of Houston cantinas (such as sports bars) housing prostitution upstairs and apartment complexes being used for prostitution. How do such activities affect the department’s estimate of the number of brothels in the city?

3:04 p.m.

For the statistics we gave you, they do include apartment complexes. We have conducted investigations into apartments operating as brothels as well.
