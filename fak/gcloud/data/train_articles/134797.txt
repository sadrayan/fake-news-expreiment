PHOTOS: Ben Carson and Vermin Supreme file for president on deadline day
Republican Ben Carson filed the paperwork and paid the $1,000 fee to have his named listed in the first-in-the-nation primary ballot on Friday, the final day of the filing period.

Carson was preceded Vermin Supreme, a bizarre candidate who wears a boot on his head and argues for a “pony-based economy.” Supreme paid the fee using cash – each $50 bill stamped to say it’s “not to be used for bribing politicians” – and registered as a Democrat.
