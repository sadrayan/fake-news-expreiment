birch paper — “As standalone bills, I would be opposed”
“As standalone bills, I would be opposed”

Congresswoman Annie Kuster (D-NH) yesterday on her vote for the so-called “CRomnibus” bill:

Tacked onto the massive spending bill were two policy issues that she said shouldn’t have been included in a budget bill and instead should have been dealt with “in the normal course of the policy debate.” But she voted for the bill, which passed 219-206, to avoid the alternative: another government shutdown. One of those issues was an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that the White House said weakened “a critical component of financial system reform aimed at reducing taxpayer risk.” The other was an amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act to allow individual donors to contribute to national political party committee accounts for conventions, buildings and recounts in amounts that are dramatically higher than what the law currently permits. “As standalone bills, I would be opposed” to those measures, she said, but she felt it was “a better deal than if we’d closed down the government and come back in January when the Republicans controlled the Senate.”

The bill tacked onto “CRomnibus” that gutted a key Dodd-Frank provision, allowing conditions to return that triggered the recession, is HR 992.

Rep. Kuster’s statement that she would be opposed to a standalone bill is curious.

Here is Rep. Kuster voting for a standalone HR 992 in committee.

And here is Rep. Kuster voting for HR 992 as a standalone bill in the full house:
