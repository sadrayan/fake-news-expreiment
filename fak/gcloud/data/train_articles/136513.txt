Police warn if you get these in your trick-or-treat bag, they're not candy
The Jackson Police Department posted a photo on its Facebook page of what appears to be candy with images of dice, superheroes and movie companies, but that is in reality pills that could be dangerous if a child ingests them, WLBT reported. The image has since been removed from the police department's Facebook account.

The items are actually shaped Ecstasy, WLBT reported.

The fear of children getting the pills, the idea of putting a cartoon character, or kid-friendly image on the drugs is not anything new, Snopes.com reported.

Snopes also found there has been no reports of a child actually receiving the drugs in their trick-or-treat candy.

Police suggest "When in doubt, throw it out" when it comes to kids' Halloween candy.
