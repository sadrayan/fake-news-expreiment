Why are you running for office?

I am tired of career politicians. When government is your career, you have little reason to fix government–and every reason to claim you will so people vote for you. That’s why I am term limiting myself and have signed multiple term limit pledges, so people will know they’re sending a different ‘cut’ of individual to Washington. They can trust I’ll use my background of attacking waste, training leaders and dismantling inefficient bureaucracies, to make a real difference.

What is the biggest problem you see with your party?

Two stand out. We are often out-communicated by the Left on major issues (one exception is the NRA’s stellar work). And secondly, we have been factionalized to the point of

dysfunction. Solving this requires a focused, detailed message; and leadership uniting factions, moving the ball down the field.

What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent?

Our product guarantee at blahaforcolorado.com details fixing the broken tax system, securing our borders and attacking our debt and deficit. I have committed to making quantifiable changes to these areas, or I will not seek a second term. None of my opponents have asked to be held accountable to their promises. Additionally, my commitment to protecting our 2nd Amendment is unparalleled.

What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent?

The far Left has greatly damaged our country, and the Iranian Nuclear Agreement puts our country in jeopardy.

Give us your plan to address the Islamic State crisis and describe the circumstances in which you would support American boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

Boots on the ground should be a last option. If we are truly at war with radical Islam, then we should declare war. In previous published op-eds I have called for America to lead a coalition of the willing by declaring an Article 1 section 8 (declaration of war). Historically, when America has taken this bold step, we win.

Do you support federal action to provide clear rules for legal marijuana businesses to gain access to banking? If so, please describe what you would support.

I believe in the 10th Amendment. This issue should be left to the states discretion, for it is not spelled out as a federal right. Federal intervention only complicates an already controversial issue. As an individual with extensive banking background, more inappropriate government regulation is never a good idea.

The U.S. national debt is now more than $19 trillion. Even if you could cut fraud and waste, you would still have most of that debt to deal with. What specific actions do you support to get a handle on our debt and reduce the annual deficit? And what significant spending cuts would you support to balance the budget?

Like a home budget, we must begin with the deficit. A thorough evaluation of social programs reveals an unsustainable escalation. Action must be taken on numerous entitlement programs following a vigorous national discussion.

In another target area, I would use my extensive background in waste reduction. We would focus on removing infrastructure, resources and bureaucracies from Washington while moving decisions to the state and local level. Initial areas would be dismantling and disempowering the IRS, eliminating the Department of Education and constraining the EPA. Proven tools of industry and expertise must be used when going after these behemoth, out of control entities.

Obviously, the long term solution is a balanced budget amendment forcing massive restraint and spending. This concept requires 34 states to lead the way and ultimately 38 states to support. This is gaining momentum daily. I will be one of the individuals leading that discussion for a balanced budget amendment.

Which of the entitlement programs would you look at first to reform or make cuts?

June 8, 2016 Voter Guide: U.S. House District 5 Democratic primary Social Security should be maintained for those already in the retirement window ( 50+). A different solution for the next generation involving concept similar to a 401K must be pursued. The reasoning is quite simple; every analysis shows the current payer-payee ratio is unsustainable. A good initial start should be in the general welfare area. “Work Fare” to incentivize those trapped in the system must be pursued. A tiered, skills-based approach allowing individuals to obtain needed market-based capabilities is required to enable their transition from the current system.

Effectively managing our military capabilities remains paramount. The BRAC process has been marginally effective. Having closed hundreds of bases through the process over the last decade, we must take a very critical look at our overall military capabilities. This should include technology, total force strength, upgrades in technology required–and all must be pursued with a careful eye to the dangerous world in which we live. First and foremost, America must be an exceptional and preeminent leader.

Fracking often dominates the political conversation in Colorado. Most efforts to regulate drilling have been on the state and local level, but is there a role for the federal government and what should it be?

There is no need for additional federal intrusion.

Colorado has been home to the Columbine and Aurora movie theater shootings, two tragedies that caused Americans to consider stricter gun laws. When it comes to the Second Amendment, what values would guide your approach to future federal gun legislation?

As an NRA supporter, I believe we must continue to defend our 2nd Amendment rights. With only 27 words, the 2nd Amendment makes clear the right of every law abiding American to keep and bear arms. In another op-ed published June 5th, I made clear the 2nd Amendment is in fact a great equalizer for each and every American, man and woman.

Do you believe the Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more accessible and affordable?

The Affordable Care Act is a disaster. The evidence of escalating cost, deteriorating quality and government intervention is clear for most Americans. Regardless of the spin, Obamacare is a perfect example of big government overreach and incompetence.

How would you approach reforming the Affordable Care Act?

Most experts agree individual portable plans are a good solution. We need to allow free market economics to enter health care. By letting the states provide 50 laboratories of best practices, this competition will raise the water level and provide a better product. However, the solution also requires extensive discussions as a country allowing participation from a cadre of view points and perspectives. This will be a difficult fix.

Does the federal government have a responsibility to help with student debt, and what ideas do you think would make a difference?

Student debt should be treated in the same way as mortgages. The free market should be unleashed, as participation in competing for debt will ultimately result in lower rates, providing better terms for students. Incidentally, the first step toward helping student costs would be examining why tuition rates have skyrocketed at several times the rate of inflation.

What if anything should Congress do to address the crisis of opioid addiction and overdose?

Currently there are numerous studies and committees evaluating the situation. Pending those findings, discussions and potential action should follow. However, there clearly is a crisis in America with youth and others anesthetizing themselves to a degree not seen in years past.

Do you support the Senate’s 2013 passage of a comprehensive immigration reform authored in large part by the Gang of 8 that includes Colorado’s Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet and Florida’s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio? Why or why not?

No, the Gang of 8 plan and proposal was not supportable or in the best interest of America.

Why are you running for office?

Deeply disappointed in the Colorado Republican Party, distraught and distressed about our Federal Representatives in Washington DC and the direction our military is being led and managed Federally and the lawlessness and recklessness of the legalization and distribution of marijuana in the state of Colorado.

What is the biggest problem you see with your party?

Lack of commitment, standing firmly on conservative principles, values and beliefs and representing the voters wishes and demands in Washington DC, especially when it comes to foreign and domestic enemies, individual defense, Constitutional rights, tax reform, illegal immigration, enforcement of our laws, less government and debt reduction, deregulation and preserving and promoting American Christian values, traditions and beliefs.

What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent?

I am the only candidate that has a Federal solution to regulating marijuana. I am the only candidate with a Government Reduction Act. I am the only candidate that has specific ideas and solutions on strengthening our Armed forces and reforming the Veterans Administration and the only Disabled Veteran candidate with over 25 years of experience with the VA, as a patient.

What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent?

Registered Republican

Give us your plan to address the Islamic State crisis and describe the circumstances in which you would support American boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

Declare and identify radical Islamic Terrorists as an enemy. Work with the president and the US Senate in identifying Islamic Terrorists leaders, occupied territories (regardless of what country), training areas and facilities, weapon storage and manufacturing facilities and destroy and eliminate all the latter by air, land and sea with minimal civilian and American loss of life while organizing and leading a coalition of Ally’s that support the latter.

Do you support federal action to provide clear rules for legal marijuana businesses to gain access to banking? If so, please describe what you would support.

I have an Act already created called the Federal Marijuana Utilization Act. It requires any state to legalize marijuana to distribute marijuana in generic packages with warning labels like cigarettes & alcohol, does not allow public advertising and signage, allows doctors to prescribe edible marijuana through a pharmacy, allows farmers to grow hemp and allows local municipalities to create and enforce strict laws of using and smoking marijuana in public places and exposure to the general public that are offended by the public use of marijuana and gives private property owners more civil and legal rights to use and or defend their property against unwanted and unwarranted marijuana use on their property. All regulated and enforced by any of, in part or in whole, the DEA, ATF, Dept of Agriculture, Dept of HHS, local police and the sheriff.

The U.S. national debt is now more than $19 trillion. Even if you could cut fraud and waste, you would still have most of that debt to deal with. What specific actions do you support to get a handle on our debt and reduce the annual deficit? And what significant spending cuts would you support to balance the budget?

I have an Act that I call the Government Reduction Act. It will dissolve the Department of Education, combine the Department of Labor and Commerce, reduce the Department of Energy by 5% annually for 5 years and will eliminate the Department of Homeland Security and rename it the Department of Information Technology. I also would like to turn Obamacare into a Government healthcare entity which would include all and any Federal government employee under honorable status, past and present, their dependents, the Veterans Administration, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the uninsured and uninsurable all into one healthcare system and then those that do not fall into the latter have their own private healthcare system where all can compete and or collaborate with each other in providing healthcare, options and plans for all.

Which of the entitlement programs would you look at first to reform or make cuts?

Reform our Federal Court System, cut Planned Parenthood and review other government subsidized programs. I do support a “laddered” and or “piggy backed” rationed increase in the retirement age in Social Security benefits. I do support certain closures of any government facility but also support increases and creations of others to include military bases, Centers of Disease Control and Emergency Evacuation & Response Water and Food Storages.

Fracking often dominates the political conversation in Colorado. Most efforts to regulate drilling have been on the state and local level, but is there a role for the federal government and what should it be?

That states are not “over stepping”, overtly creating and demanding business follow inordinate and unreasonable regulatory rules and regulations.

Colorado has been home to the Columbine and Aurora movie theater shootings, two tragedies that caused Americans to consider stricter gun laws. When it comes to the Second Amendment, what values would guide your approach to future federal gun legislation?

That the right to bare arms shall not be infringed.

Do you believe the Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more accessible and affordable?

No

How would you approach reforming the Affordable Care Act?

Turn Obamacare into a Government healthcare entity which would include all and any Federal government employee, past and present, their dependents, the Veterans Administration, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the uninsured and uninsurable all into one healthcare system and then those that do not fall into the latter have their own private healthcare system where all can compete and or collaborate with each other in providing healthcare, options and plans for all.

Does the federal government have a responsibility to help with student debt, and what ideas do you think would make a difference?

No, and the governments responsibility is to ensure that student loans are being handled correctly, fairly and justly. To prosecute and punish fraudulent lenders and lendee’s and to regulate fair and affordable interest rates and qualified and competent educational institutions.

What if anything should Congress do to address the crisis of opioid addiction and overdose?

Support and fund the agencies responsible in stopping the manufacturing, distribution and sales of that and other illegal and harmful drugs.

Do you support the Senate’s 2013 passage of a comprehensive immigration reform authored in large part by the Gang of 8 that includes Colorado’s Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet and Florida’s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio? Why or why not?

No, there are plenty of Immigration Laws already on the books, the number one problem with illegal Immigration is that laws are not being enforced and or not being supported and encouraged to be enforced by the Executive Branch, Judicial Branch and the majority of those in the Legislative Branch.

Why are you running for office?

I am running for the United States Senate to reignite the American spirit! We need good jobs, less regulation, and a more common sense tax policy in this country. We should do all we can do encourage business development, and getting the Federal government out of the way would be a good start.

I care about the heart and soul of this country, and believe we can do better. Not only for ourselves, but for our kids and grand kids. They deserve a free and prosperous country, and everyday we see the overreaches from Washington, D.C. slowly eroding our freedoms and liberty, and we must not stand for it any longer.

What is the biggest problem you see with your party?

The biggest problem I feel we have with our party is that we aren’t inclusive enough. We are the “big tent” party, but at times it doesn’t feel that way. We need to do a better job of reaching out to individuals of all backgrounds, and not only during election time. This is why I am committed to hosting town hall events all across this state once I am elected. No one can say they represent Colorado without interacting regularly with the voters that put them in office.

What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent?

Jobs are the top issue on voters minds. I have been focused on the “middle skills jobs” gap here in Colorado, and frankly across the country. Middle skills jobs are jobs that require more than a high school diploma, but do not require a college degree to get. These are our technical jobs – welders, plumbers, electricians – these are good paying jobs that are available right here in Colorado today but only %42 of our workforce is educated or trained to perform these jobs. We can fill thousands of jobs by encouraging vocational and technical training around our state.

I was a Co-Founder of one of our states largest Charter Schools, High Point Academy. I believe in the idea of educational choice for all. Children living in a underperforming school districts should be able to every opportunity available to them. Parents deserve the right to choose what schooling is right for their kids. Whether that’s a public, private, charter, or home school, parents know what’s best for their kids and we should trust them to make those decisions.

The third issue is two-fold: energy and transportation. I believe that we should open up federal lands for energy exploration. By allowing these lands to be utilized we have the real possibility of becoming entirely energy independent and at the same time increase royalty revenue from the energy producers. By opening these lands we will increase the royalties received from energy development and I have proposed that we return those monies to the states to fund many transportation projects.

There is a path to becoming energy independent here at home, and to fixing many of our critical transportation needs. I believe this a the plan to get us there.

What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent?

I truly believe we all agree on the threat of terrorism to this country, and all of us are willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure American citizens remain safe and free. Three of the candidates are Vets, myself included, and we are all strong supporters of our military.

We also agree, i believe, on an “all of the above” energy policy. The important part of this issue is to not elevate one energy sector over the other creating an unfair playing field. We must research how to utilize wind, solar, and bio-fuels the most effective way possible, but not at the expense of our fossil-fuel based energy resources that are critical to our way of life.

Last, tax reform would be an area I believe we are in most agreement about. While we have different specific tax reform proposals we all agree in the need for a simple, fair, and flat tax system. Reducing corporate interest rates is incredibly important to spur economic growth in our country as well.

Give us your plan to address the Islamic State crisis and describe the circumstances in which you would support American boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

Addressing the Islamic State threat is a challenging one. While they are the most immediate threat we face as a nation they aren’t the only threat. The Islamic State believes it is acting on behalf of their caliphate. In order to have a caliphate they must control territory in order to have a basis for their existence. By wiping out the Islamic State and retaking the territories held by them currently we will destroy their caliphate, which they can not continue without.

A coordinated, global effort is necessary to combat these terrorists. America can not fight this war alone, nor should we. It will require the leadership and military forces of many nations aiding the fight in eradicating this threat. While I don’t believe it is necessary to have boots on the ground currently situations can change that would require us to consider putting U.S. soldiers on the ground.

Do you support federal action to provide clear rules for legal marijuana businesses to gain access to banking? If so, please describe what you would support.

Yes. All legitimate business should be treated equally by our banking and financial sector. We have made legal marijuana businesses operate primarily as cash only institutions which makes them a target for potential criminal activity. There is no reason not to allow full equality for businesses across this country.

The U.S. national debt is now more than $19 trillion. Even if you could cut fraud and waste, you would still have most of that debt to deal with. What specific actions do you support to get a handle on our debt and reduce the annual deficit? And what significant spending cuts would you support to balance the budget?

As it relates the the deficit I believe that by getting more people back to work we will increase revenue coming in. Washington, D.C.’s habit is to take that extra revenue and put it towards another project, and I believe this is irresponsible. We need to take a hard look at many departments budgets and get them to only fund the necessary services required to perform their duties. I believe that we can save millions by this process alone. Just like every Coloradan family balancing a budget we should cut things we just simply cant afford which will allow us to save more revenue than we spend. Once we are able to get to a point where we are building a surplus we must pass a Balanced Budget Amendment which will allow us to continue building reserves, and paying down the debt.

Getting more people back to work is the critical part of this plan. We must act now!

Which of the entitlement programs would you look at first to reform or make cuts? Do you support raising the retirement age to receive Social Security benefits, military base closures? Please elaborate.

First, we need to make our welfare program a “workfare” program again. Requiring individuals to work, or volunteer their time 20 hours a week is a good start. Many of these employment or volunteer opportunities have the real possibility to leading to full time employment which will get these individuals off the welfare system.

Social Security poses an interesting question. While the retirement age has historically been 65 we have gradually see that increase for younger generations. The problem is we will continue to need to raise the age to the point where individuals are being asked to work to 70 or 72 before being eligible for full benefits. I believe we should look at creating a plan for younger generations that is more in line with a defined contribution plan, rather than the defined benefit plan we currently have under Social Security.

The goal would be to keep things as they are now for retirees, those retiring soon, and employees who have been paying in to the system for a significant time. The remaining individuals would have the ability to utilize the contribution plan noted above.

I believe this will help the Social Security funding issues, and bring the program closer to solvency.

Fracking often dominates the political conversation in Colorado. Most efforts to regulate drilling have been on the state and local level, but is there a role for the federal government and what should it be?

Yes. We should explore the real possibility of leasing federal lands within our state for energy exploration, and development. With this increase in royalties we will be able to direct those funds back to the states to increase funding for critical transportation/infrastructure projects.

Colorado has been home to the Columbine and Aurora movie theater shootings, two tragedies that caused Americans to consider stricter gun laws. When it comes to the Second Amendment, what values would guide your approach to future federal gun legislation?

I am, and have always been pro 2nd Amendment. As a strong believer in the 10th Amendment the states should be able to enact laws that do not violate their citizens constitutional right to “keep and bear arms” while at the same time ensuring the safety of the community

Do you believe the Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more accessible and affordable?

No. It has shown time and time again that ObamaCare has done very little in this regard. Take Tonya Sais as an example. Ms. Sais is a single mother who told me her premium to cover herself and her children is $1500 a month with a $6000 out of pocket maximum. These plans are not “affordable” to every day Coloradans, and we must do all we can to replace ObamaCare with a more market driven approach.

How would you approach reforming the Affordable Care Act?

It all comes down to consumer choice. By allowing employers to continue to provide insurance coverage for the 150 million Americans that receive their health insurance now is critical. For others offering tax credits to help pay for coverage, allowing insurance to be bought and sold across state lines, making insurance portable, and some tort reform will certainly go a long way in fixing this issue.

Does the federal government have a responsibility to help with student debt, and what ideas do you think would make a difference?

I believe that not all graduating high school seniors need, or want a college degree. We have made it a societal status issue to have a diploma, and that is discouraging. As leaders we need to encourage community college/trade schools/vocational schools as viable options for many students. These students would not acquire the enormous debt many college students do, and will enter the workforce with real skills that will get them to work immediately. We are talking about aircraft mechanics, welders, electricians, plumbers, and so on. These are good paying jobs that there is a demand for now!

With respect to individuals with student loan debt they should be able to refinance those loans to a lower rate to make a monthly payment more affordable. We must educate students about the loan process. To take on $100,000 in debt for an Art History major where the prospect of finding a good paying job will be limited seems irresponsible. We must ensure that the loan repayment process is very clearly spelled out at the beginning so a fiscally prudent decision could be made.

What if anything should Congress do to address the crisis of opioid addiction and overdose?

I do not believe that Congress should be addressing this crisis. We need to have a serious dialogue with physicians around the country about ways to lower the number of opioid pain medications being prescribed today. While these medications work well for short-term management of acute pain for medical procedures we have too many individuals taking opioids for chronic pain syndromes. These individuals become dependent on the medication, and when no longer able to receive it from their physician they turn to illicit opiates where many of these overdoses have occurred. We must address the illegal drug problem in our country or more people will become victim of drugs.

Do you support the Senate’s 2013 passage of a comprehensive immigration reform authored in large part by the Gang of 8 that includes Colorado’s Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet and Florida’s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio? Why or why not?

No. The “Gang of 8” was a clever way to provide blanket amnesty to illegal immigrants here today. That is not the solution to immigration reform. We must start with securing the border. In my view this would be a wall in some places, electronic/drone monitoring of more remote locations, and increasing the number of agents that can respond quickly to violations. Once the border is secure we can discuss increasing our work visa system to give American companies the ability to hire the right workers legally. With bringing these individuals in to the work force we will increase tax revenue by increasing the legal workforce in this country, also helping to fund many entitlement programs.

Twitter: @darrylglenn2016

Why are you running for office?

There’s a movement occurring this election cycle. Some argue that it’s time for America to be great again. I’m running to be your next United States Senator because I believe it’s time for Colorado to take a leadership role in restoring the American Dream. As your next Senator, I will defend our country, rebuild and modernize our military, secure the border, promote energy independence and end the war on coal. I will further vote to repeal excessive regulations, promote comprehensive corporate and individual tax reform and restore more fiscal control over the budget. Lastly, I will defend our constitutional rights for all individuals including the unborn.

What is the biggest problem you see with your party?

The Republican Party must do a better job articulating the importance of the need for a smaller federal government based upon our Constitution.

What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent?

Three policy issues that set me apart from Michael Bennet are:

1. I do not support the Iran Nuclear Deal. I believe it should be repealed.

2. I do not support the Affordable Care Act. I believe it should be repealed.

3. I do not support granting federal agencies rule making authority. I will vote to repeal this authority and return it back to Congress.

What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent?

The biggest areas of agreement that I have with Michael Bennet are that we both are registered voters in Colorado and want to serve in the United States Senate.

Give us your plan to address the Islamic State crisis and describe the circumstances in which you would support American boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

I would like Congress to exercise its power under Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution and vote for a formal declaration of war against ISIS. Our military strategy, to include supporting American boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq, must involve a strategy based upon evidence that it is in the best interest of our national security, a comprehensive approach to defeat ISIS, authorization to use all necessary and appropriate military options, and measurable objectives reportable to Congress.

Do you support federal action to provide clear rules for legal marijuana businesses to gain access to banking? If so, please describe what you would support.

Not at this time. Marijuana is still an illegal drug under federal law. The Department of Justice still maintains the ability to arbitrarily challenge Colorado’s legalization of marijuana if it determines that Colorado’s regulatory system is inadequate. Further, banks are subject to federal law, so the overall legalization of marijuana needs to be addressed before granting access to banks.

The U.S. national debt is now more than $19 trillion. Even if you could cut fraud and waste, you would still have most of that debt to deal with. What specific actions do you support to get a handle on our debt and reduce the annual deficit? And what significant spending cuts would you support to balance the budget?

I would vote in favor of the following to reduce our debt: A reduction of the corporate and individual taxes rates, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the removal of the rule-making authority for federal agencies, a balanced budget amendment and the repeal of Dodd-Frank. Moreover, I support the elimination and defunding of all agencies like the Departments of Education and Energy because they fall outside of the framework of the Constitution.

Which of the entitlement programs would you look at first to reform or make cuts?

Social Security reform must be addressed first, because the program payouts exceed its revenue stream. I would strongly consider supporting a proposal to raise the retirement age to receive Social Security for individuals at least 10 years away from retirement age. Congress should strongly consider the authorization of a Base a Realignment and Closure process if it is presented with verifiable data that demonstrates that efficiency and cost savings can be achieved.

Fracking often dominates the political conversation in Colorado. Most efforts to regulate drilling have been on the state and local level, but is there a role for the federal government and what should it be?

No.

Colorado has been home to the Columbine and Aurora movie theater shootings, two tragedies that caused Americans to consider stricter gun laws. When it comes to the Second Amendment, what values would guide your approach to future federal gun legislation?

We need to adhere to our rights under the Second Amendment of the Constitution.

Do you believe the Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more accessible and affordable?

No.

How would you approach reforming the Affordable Care Act?

The Affordable Care Act should be repealed and not reformed. I support a health insurance policy based on competition across state lines, that’s transferable with the policy holder regardless of employment, that allows individuals and families to use health savings accounts, that grants policy holders the ability to specifically tailor their coverage to the degree of risk that they’re willing to absorb, and plans that provide coverage for pre-existing conditions.

Does the federal government have a responsibility to help with student debt, and what ideas do you think would make a difference?

No. There is no constitutional basis for the federal government to be mandated to assist with student debt. Better educating our college students on the risks of high student debt and helping them to find alternatives to taking out student loans would help make the difference to their financial future.

What if anything should Congress do to address the crisis of opioid addiction and overdose?

Congress does not have a direct role under the Constitution in addressing the crisis of opioid addiction and overdose. Congress should direct its focus on policies that provides States with the flexibility to empower local communities and families on identifying solutions to this growing problem.

Do you support the Senate’s 2013 passage of a comprehensive immigration reform authored in large part by the Gang of 8 that includes Colorado’s Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet and Florida’s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio? Why or why not?

No, as it grants amnesty to people who are living in this country illegally.

Why are you running for office?

All of us are deeply concerned about the direction of our country. The incessant bickering and fighting has rendered us to a state of almost permanent paralysis. Friction – disagreement – is part of politics; it always has been and always will be. And it can be a healthy part of the process. Today is different. The intensity of the anger and dysfunction are at a level we have never experienced. Career politicians engulfed in self-serving, polarizing partisan politics are the core issue. Many put their personal interests in front of the interests of the United States; many have reduced themselves to being “warriors for their party” rather than representatives of the people. We need a change in culture; we need a change in behavior; we need a change in leadership.

I am not a career politician – I have never run for office or held office. I have no interest in having a career in politics – I have no personal agenda. I seek only to serve my country – to give back. I had a successful 35-year career in business. I am not obligated to anyone other than the people of Colorado. I will limit my service to two terms and pass the baton to the next Senator to perpetuate the essential conservative representation America so desperately needs.

Great leaders have a vision – they know where we are going and what we need to become. Today, I believe America is in a vacuum with no clear understanding of where we are going or what we need to be. Washington DC has failed us.

I have a vision for America – I feel strongly about what we must be and where we should be going. My vision for America includes:

We are a financially disciplined country that balances its budget, lives within its means, and rarely borrows money. We have the most vibrant and powerful economy in the world – we are the best entrepreneurs and business people on the planet. We have the world’s best educated and best trained people and workforce. Our business environment fosters the formation of new companies and the success and expansion of existing businesses – we are constantly generating more and better paying jobs. Our middle class is thriving; and prosperity is being perpetuated for all Americans.

We have the strongest and best military and intelligence capabilities in the world. Our friends and allies fully trust that we will keep the promises we make to them; and our enemies fear us – they know we have the unwavering resolve to take whatever steps are necessary to preserve our freedom, our security and our prosperity. “Peace through strength” is our governing principle – and it works. We are rarely called to action and, when we are, conflicts are resolved quickly and with finality.

We are generous, compassionate and peace loving – we serve, we give, and we care. We love life – no one laughs more or has more fun than Americans.

To fulfill this vision, we must change – we need new leadership to change the culture in Congress and deliver real results to the American people.

What is the biggest problem you see with your party?

What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent?

The biggest difference between me and my republican opponents is that I am the only candidate who has never run for public office and has never served in public office. I am a businessman who built a successful Colorado company that employed hundreds.

What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent?

We all support strengthening our national security and economic security.

Give us your plan to address the Islamic State crisis and describe the circumstances in which you would support American boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

First and foremost, the United States and our allies must make a commitment to win and to destroy ISIS. Once that commitment is made, the decision on the role of American troops can be determined.

America’s security at home and abroad is the most important constitutional role of the federal government; I will uphold that responsibility and honor that priority.

We must reestablish our global leadership. Our forfeiture of this role has produced power vacuums – and those vacuums have been filled by terrorists in the Middle East; by emboldened and illegal behavior by China in the South China Sea; in the Ukraine and Crimea by the Russians; and in North Korea where nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems continue to be developed. Our allies no longer trust that we will do what we have promised; and our enemies no longer respect our resolve. Our world is more dangerous as a result.

Today the size of our military has fallen to pre-WWII levels. The number of soldiers and personnel in our military is measurably down; and we are asking them to do significantly and unreasonably more. Our Navy is smaller than at any time since 1915; and our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat fleet in its history.

We must rebuild our military and we must reestablish our global leadership. By sustaining steady and strong military and intelligence capabilities, we will avoid conflict and quickly suppress confrontations before they deliver meaningful threat. This is “peace through strength.

Do you support federal action to provide clear rules for legal marijuana businesses to gain access to banking? If so, please describe what you would support.

Yes.

The U.S. national debt is now more than $19 trillion. Even if you could cut fraud and waste, you would still have most of that debt to deal with. What specific actions do you support to get a handle on our debt and reduce the annual deficit? And what significant spending cuts would you support to balance the budget?

Congress’s unwillingness to balance the budget – or even pass a budget at all – has produced a national debt of $19 trillion and growing. It has nearly doubled under our current Administration. This level of debt puts at risk the economic opportunity of future generations – it represents over $60,000 of debt to every man, woman and child in America, before they can even think of paying for college, buying a home or starting a business. Congress should be sequestered to the capitol until a budget is passed, and I support a Constitutional Amendment requiring a balanced budget.

This level of debt is a significant threat to America’s way of life. Today we spend $400 billion annually to service that debt – that is 11% of our overall budget; and, at 2.4%, interest rates are at a historically low level. Interest rates will rise – and when they return to more normalized levels such as 5%, the cost of our debt will approach $1 trillion – almost one-third of our budget. Together with the cost of our entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid – 55% of our budget), we won’t have enough left over to fully pay for Defense – and nothing to pay for Transportation, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, or any other programs. If faced with these conditions, our choices will be limited to significantly raising taxes and/or slashing benefits under Social Security and Medicare – we would fundamentally alter the way Americans live, and we would fail to keep the promises we have made to our children and our grandchildren.

We must balance our budget and reduce our debt.

Which of the entitlement programs would you look at first to reform or make cuts?

Fracking often dominates the political conversation in Colorado. Most efforts to regulate drilling have been on the state and local level, but is there a role for the federal government and what should it be?

Regulations dealing with fracking are most appropriately determined at the state level. Light, heat, hot water, air conditioning, motorized transportation – we take for granted the presence of these comforts – and they contribute enormously to the quality of our lives. Fossil fuels have been the primary energy source delivering these basic comforts. And we all share concerns about the environmental impacts of the use of these energy sources – these concerns substantially define our energy policies today.

Today, for the first time in our history, America is capable of being energy independent. Our freedom from dependence upon overseas oil imports is important to our security. We should do everything that is reasonable and possible to maximize our production and use of domestic energy sources. I support the ongoing use and improvement of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) with proper environmental stewardship and state oversight; and the continued use of clean coal from Colorado and the West.

Concurrently, securing and making permanent our energy independence means that we must release the dynamics of innovation, competition and incentives for the development of advanced energy solutions. Through investment in research and development, we can encourage the discovery and refinement of energy sources which are cleaner, dependable, plentiful, cheaper, and that contribute to the quality of our lives. Any energy sources that will produce these results should be pursued – whether solar, wind, nuclear, biomass, hydro, or fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas. As credible ideas are developed, the private sector can put its capital and operating expertise to work, providing these new energy solutions to our communities and around the world.

Colorado has been home to the Columbine and Aurora movie theater shootings, two tragedies that caused Americans to consider stricter gun laws. When it comes to the Second Amendment, what values would guide your approach to future federal gun legislation?

The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Colorado’s Constitution, grant each of us the right to bear arms; and that that right shall not be infringed upon. The purpose of this right extends well beyond just the right to protect ourselves and our property; that right also exists to ensure we have a government that is subordinate to the people – that purpose was a clear and conscious choice of our founding fathers.

Our individual right to bear arms is not unlimited – there are common sense expectations: Convicted felons and adjudicated mentally ill people cannot possess weapons; weapons cannot be possessed in certain places; in Colorado, you are required to have a permit to carry a concealed weapon; we regulate the proper storage of guns; background checks are required for the sale of virtually all weapons; and guns may not be purchased through the mail or over the Internet.

The Supreme Court has made clear that the Second Amendment defines an individual’s right to gun ownership; 40% of Americans own guns; I own six. I support our right to bear arms; I support the laws that exist to protect this right; and I support the rules that protect public safety associated with our rights to bear arms.

Do you believe the Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more accessible and affordable?

It was originally argued that the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – was needed to enable the 10% – 15% of Americans who did not have health care coverage to get access to it. What we got instead was a healthcare mandate that requires everyone to buy health care insurance; defining and mandating the exact coverage even if we don’t want or need the coverage. Our freedom to choose was taken away.

And we were promised that Obamacare would protect relationships between Americans and their doctors, reduce the cost of healthcare and lead to better healthcare for all. It has not. Costs have continued to skyrocket at double-digit rates. The fundamental principle that those using the services are the ones who can most effectively drive down costs was completely ignored; rather, the government and insurance companies, through Obamacare, have taken over this role – and they have failed.

Obamacare must be repealed and replaced. We can and must do better. Having spent 30+ years running businesses that focused on solving problems of this kind, I am convinced a sound, open market solution that will return control and choice back to each of us is a better solution.

Healthcare Savings Accounts (HSA’s), funded with tax-deductible contributions, can be used to pay for deductible expenses or for expenses not covered by our healthcare policies. And HSA’s should be expanded – we should be allowed to contribute more money to our HSA accounts.

I strongly endorse the idea that we should own our healthcare coverage – it must be portable; it should follow us wherever our employment takes us, to and beyond retirement. And insurance companies should not be able to cancel our coverage.

Obamacare must be replaced with a rational plan that protects our right to choose our healthcare coverage, with the coverage provided by the private, free-market. And, since we as individuals will be in control of our healthcare choices, rather than the government or insurance companies, competitive forces will be released that will result in better care at lower costs. There is a good solution for healthcare in America. As your U.S. Senator, I will work tirelessly to repeal and replace Obamacare. We can do better.

Do you support the Senate’s 2013 passage of a comprehensive immigration reform authored in large part by the Gang of 8 that includes Colorado’s Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet and Florida’s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio? Why or why not?

There are more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States today. The exact number is not known. This has been divisive, and it has cost us billions of dollars.

We must secure our borders. If we do not, any plan that addresses these 11 million people is irrelevant – our problems will simply persist. Ronald Reagan said, “A nation that cannot secure its borders is not a nation.” We must secure our borders.

It is estimated that most of these people do not want to be here permanently. They want to have access to a work visa program that will allow them to be in the United States legally and to travel back to their homes. Today they are trapped: if they leave, they are not certain they will be able to return. And, because today the United States issues only 66,000 temporary work visas, with an annual demand that is measured in the millions, we have created a “black market” for illegal labor to support the many segments of our economy and businesses that are substantially dependent upon a migrant work force. Therefore, we must have an effective Non-Citizen Work Visa program. This program must require that immigrant workers:

Pass background checks to avoid the risk of terrorism and criminality.

Pay a penalty for having entered the country illegally.

Have health care coverage – paid for by themselves or by their employer.

Have a self-supporting job.

Have a start date and an expiration date to their work visa. Once expired, they must leave the country.

In the event these conditions are not met, the person will be deported. And with such a program in place, any employer who knowingly hires a person who is here illegally should face penalties and fines.

For those who want to seek permanent residency in the United States, they must complete each of the same steps; and anyone not completing these steps will be deported.

If they seek U.S. Citizenship, they may apply but they must go to the “back of the line” and complete the process as if they have just entered the country. I value the right to vote in this country and our standards for U.S. Citizenship must be maintained at the highest levels so that each person who becomes a citizen upholds our values and pledges allegiance to this country.

Why are you running for office?

I am running because Coloradans need a strong leader in the United States Senate that will fight to keep our country safe, secure, and economically prosperous. As Colorado’s next Senator, I will focus on national security and economic security, because Colorado families deserve to live in safety and prosperity. I view serving in an elected office as an extension of my military service, and I will spend every single day in the United States Senate fighting for Colorado.

I am a military Intelligence Officer that has deployed to places like Iraq and Afghanistan. I have held a Top Secret security clearance for my entire adult life, and I am acutely aware of the threats facing our nation. Unlike Michael Bennet, my knowledge of international affairs doesn’t come from a briefing paper or foreign policy magazine; it comes from real experience.

Whether it’s his support for closing Guantanamo Bay, his vote for the Iran deal, his opposition to common sense policies that would screen Syrian refugees entering our country, his support of Obamacare, or his reckless fiscal policy, Michael Bennet has proven he is dangerous for Colorado.

What is the biggest problem you see with your party?

We need more elected Republicans who are willing to stand up for conservative principles and say no–not only to big spending Democrats, but also to fiscally irresponsible members of our own party when necessary.

As a member of the Colorado House of Representatives, I was one of the few Republicans to stand up for our conservative principles and vote against the largest budget in state history, despite pressure from Democrats and Republican leadership.”

What three policy issues set you apart from your opponent?

The list of policy differences between my opponent and me is a long one, but here are three important points of differentiation:

Iran Deal: I strongly disagree with Senator Bennet’s support for the Iran deal. As an Intelligence Officer, I know the Iranian regime is evil, and cannot be trusted. The Iran deal makes the United States of America less safe, but also gravely endangers some of our closest allies, like Israel. It virtually guarantees the Iranians will obtain nuclear weapons, probably before my kids are in middle school.

National Debt: When Senator Bennet ran for the Senate in 2010, he said he would finally do something about our national debt. Well, he did, but unfortunately all he did was help double it. I’ll fight to cut our national debt, balance our budget, and get our fiscal house in order. I will stand up to members of either party who get in the way. We have a runaway spending problem, and I believe it is immoral for us to mortgage the futures of our kids and grandkids.

Obamacare: We would not have Obamacare today if Senator Bennet would have voted against it. But Bennet supported Obamacare, and now we are seeing the devastating effects it has had on Colorado families. Senator Bennet has openly admitted that he understands how Obamacare has hurt Coloradans—but he just doesn’t have any answers. I do have answers: we need to repeal Obamacare immediately and replace it with innovative, free-market solutions that focus on healthcare outcomes and the doctor-patient relationship.

What are the biggest areas of agreement between you and your opponent?

Senator Bennet votes with President Obama 98% of the time and was the head of the Senate Democrats’ partisan attack group – the DSCC. Unfortunately, there isn’t much we agree on, but I do know Senator Bennet is a family man who loves his children and we certainly have that in common.

Give us your plan to address the Islamic State crisis and describe the circumstances in which you would support American boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq.

First, we must secure our borders, modernize our legal immigration system, and keep terrorists out of our country. Radical Islamic terrorists have declared war on us—this is not a war of our choosing, but terrorists threaten our safety and security, and they will not simply go away if we bury our heads in the sand. The simple truth is President Obama and Senator Bennet have no strategy to keep our country safe. They have supported our enemies, who no longer fear us, and they have abandoned our allies, who no longer trust us. Politicians in Washington shouldn’t be using our men and women in uniform as political pawns; they should give them everything they need for victory and then get out of the way.

Unfortunately, at a time in which America has been at war for the longest period in our nation’s history, we now have the fewest number of people that have been to war serving us in Washington. Those of us who have been to war know that war is always the last resort. But sometimes we have to go to war. And when we do, we must do it with overwhelming force, achieve clearly outlined objectives, and then come home. I believe we can defeat radical Islam with our all volunteer military, fighting them over there, instead of living in fear back at home. I will vote for policies that provide our military forces all of the resources it needs to fight and win, without handcuffing our military members with unreasonable rules of engagement that put them in harm’s way.”

Do you support federal action to provide clear rules for legal marijuana businesses to gain access to banking? If so, please describe what you would support.

One of the reasons people are so frustrated with government right now is because government holds private businesses and citizens to standards to which the government does not comply. This is a prime example. Right now, the State of Colorado is allowed to use the federal banking system to deposit the tax revenue generated by marijuana businesses, but the very same businesses paying these taxes to the state are denied access to banks. I support opening the banking system to marijuana businesses so they can move out of the shadows and away from an all cash system that invites corruption and puts business owners in unnecessarily dangerous situations.

The U.S. national debt is now more than $19 trillion. Even if you could cut fraud and waste, you would still have most of that debt to deal with. What specific actions do you support to get a handle on our debt and reduce the annual deficit? And what significant spending cuts would you support to balance the budget?

As a fiscal conservative, I firmly believe that we need to rein in spending in order to ensure the economic security of our country. An important first step is to do away with the massive omnibus spending bills that fund the entirety of the US government. Instead, we need have a budget for each of the 12 federal departments so that we can go line-by-line to evaluate the effectiveness and necessity of programs in each department. I also believe that we need to get rid of Obamacare, and target cuts at career bureaucrats in Washington D.C., such as those in the US Department of Transportation (which has nearly 60,000 employees) and the US Department of Education, which siphons funds away from our classrooms and pays administrators an average salary that is twice as high of a classroom teacher. Let’s cut out the middleman, get rid of Common Core, and make sure education is focused on doing what is best for our kids. That is best accomplished at the state and local levels.

Which of the entitlement programs would you look at first to reform or make cuts?

We need to make sure that programs like Social Security and Medicare are protected for those citizens who have spent their lives paying into them. After all, it’s their money, and as a United States Senator, I will make sure Coloradans that are at or near retirement will be unaffected by modernizing our entitlement programs. For those just starting out, I would support reforms that would ensure the government couldn’t raid the retirement accounts of hardworking Coloradans. Technology is changing our world at an amazing pace, people are living significantly longer, and that means raising the retirement age probably makes sense. For the next generation, we need to be focused on innovative reforms that allow the free market to work.

Colorado’s military installations are absolutely critical to our national security and defense. As a military member and an Intelligence Officer, I understand the missions at Colorado’s military bases, and I would strongly protect our national security capabilities. I oppose Senator John McCain’s proposal that would likely move United States Northern Command out of Colorado, or eliminate it altogether.”

Fracking often dominates the political conversation in Colorado. Most efforts to regulate drilling have been on the state and local level, but is there a role for the federal government and what should it be?

The safe and responsible use of hydraulic fracturing should not be a matter of partisan politics. Developing our energy resources is common sense. It dramatically boosts our economy, creates thousands of jobs, allows technology to advance, and will ultimately provide us with energy independence, which should be a national security priority. The federal government largely hinders safe and responsible energy development—we’ve figured it out in Colorado. An all-of-the-above energy portfolio makes sense to me. I think we’d be better off if the federal government got out of the way so we could allow Colorado common sense to prevail here at home.

Colorado has been home to the Columbine and Aurora movie theater shootings, two tragedies that caused Americans to consider stricter gun laws. When it comes to the Second Amendment, what values would guide your approach to future federal gun legislation?

As Colorado’s next United States Senator, I will be a tireless advocate for our Second Amendment Rights. Americans have the right to keep and bear arms, and that right of law-abiding citizens shall not be infringed. As a member of our military, I swore a sacred oath to support and defend the Constitution, which includes the Bill of Rights, and the Second Amendment. I will do everything in my power to ensure our rights are protected today and for future generations.

Do you believe the Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more accessible and affordable?

Senator Bennet’s vote for Obamacare has made health insurance much more expensive for Coloradans across the state. And in many cases, people who now have insurance either can’t afford their doctor visit, or can’t find a doctor willing to accept their government-mandated insurance. In fact, Senator Bennet wanted to go even further than Obamacare and institute a public option. But now that it’s an election year, in typical politician fashion, he comes back to Colorado and says he opposes Colorado’s single payer healthcare initiative. Colorado deserves better than a Senator who does one thing in Washington and says another in Colorado.

Senator Bennet recently admitted that Obamacare has been devastating for Coloradans–some of whom will see their premiums go up by almost 30% in the coming year alone. Senator Bennet said he is aware of the problem, but he doesn’t have any solutions. I do.”

How would you approach reforming the Affordable Care Act?

We need to repeal Obamacare and replace it with innovative, free-market solutions that focus on healthcare outcomes and the doctor-patient relationship.

Does the federal government have a responsibility to help with student debt, and what ideas do you think would make a difference?

The federal government is, in large part, responsible for the student debt crisis our young people now face. And since Senator Bennet took office, the amount of student loan debt in this country has nearly doubled. We need to seek state or private solutions that drive down the cost of education (which may include increasing the use of technology, decreasing administrative overhead, and allowing our higher education system to change and reform).

What if anything should Congress do to address the crisis of opioid addiction and overdose?

About 80% of heroin users say they became addicted to opioids when they were first legally prescribed to them by a physician. My focus would be on awareness and treatment, so pain management programs are tailored for patients in a way that will prevent prescription opioid abuse and would not lead to heroin use.

Do you support the Senate’s 2013 passage of a comprehensive immigration reform authored in large part by the Gang of 8 that includes Colorado’s Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet and Florida’s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio? Why or why not?

No. I am an Intelligence Officer assigned to United States Southern Command – specifically analyzing and studying threats to our country coming through Central and South America. Having this unique insight allows me to speak from a position of authority about our immigration crisis. Immigration is fundamentally a national security issue. The first step to solving our immigration problem is securing our border. Next, we need a modernized, legal entry and exit system so we know exactly who is coming in to our country. Third, we need to ensure employers are not employing illegal labor. When we do these three things and enforce existing law, we will be well on our way to solving our immigration crisis.

For about a generation, politicians have been talking about securing the border and enforcing our immigration laws, yet there has been a clear lack of political will on either side to actually follow through. I look forward to solving this problem when I’m elected to the United States Senate.
