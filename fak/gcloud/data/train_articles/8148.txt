New music today means new media, but the Grammys are mired in the past.





Think about it: How did you first hear Adele's “Rolling in the Deep”? Through a friend of a friend on Facebook? Through your favorite celebrity's Twitter account? During the season four finale of “Gossip Girl”? More than likely, it, or your new favorite song by Bon Iver, Usher or Skrillex, didn't come to you by way of an FM radio station or popular local DJ. Its arrival into your world seemed more organic. You discovered it.

And in many ways, this reality has rendered the notion of a shared conversation about music in America as obsolete as the compact disc, or, perhaps, the Grammy Awards.

The major nominations for the 54th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be all-inclusive, but more significantly, they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general population.

Take, for example, the nominations for album of the year. It is still considered the top award, despite the fact that no one listens to albums from start to finish anymore. That aside, does anyone really consider Rihanna's “Loud,” which had its share of passable dance-floor bangers, an “album,” or merely a collection of potential hit singles?

The Foo Fighters' “Wasting Light” was a very impressive Bob Seger imitation, but really, did it move rock forward in any substantial — or even minor — way? Ditto Bruno Mars' exceedingly safe “Doo-Wops & Hooligans,” a bland collection of Pat Boone-friendly pop songs about puppy love and lazy days. Missing from the list? Kanye West's epic “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record. West also was partially responsible for the breakout success of Bon Iver (who has a surprising four nominations, three in top categories) due to his collaboration with the indie folk artist.
