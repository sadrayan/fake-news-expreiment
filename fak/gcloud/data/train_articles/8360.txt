STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

In the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Thirteen

AN ACT relative to the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.

Be it Enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened:

1 Findings.

I. Modern medical research has discovered beneficial uses for marijuana in treating or alleviating the pain, nausea, and other symptoms associated with a variety of debilitating medical conditions, as found by the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine in March 1999.

II. Subsequent studies since the 1999 National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine report continue to show the therapeutic value of marijuana in treating a wide array of debilitating medical conditions. These include relief of the neuropathic pain caused by multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and other illnesses that often fails to respond to conventional treatments and relief of nausea, vomiting, and other side effects of drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, increasing the chances of patients continuing on life-saving treatment regimens.

III. Marijuana has many currently accepted medical uses in the United States, having been recommended by thousands of licensed physicians to at least 500,000 patients in states with medical marijuana laws. Marijuana’s medical utility has been recognized by a wide range of medical and public health organizations, including the American Academy of HIV Medicine, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the American Public Health Association, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and many others.

IV. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports and the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics shows that approximately 99 out of every 100 marijuana arrests in the United States are made under state law, rather than under federal law. Consequently, changing state law will have the practical effect of protecting from arrest the vast majority of seriously ill patients who have a medical need to use marijuana.

V. Alaska, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New�Mexico, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Washington have removed state-level criminal penalties from the medical use and cultivation of marijuana. New Hampshire joins in this effort for the health and welfare of its citizens.

VI. States are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people for engaging in activities prohibited by federal law. Therefore, compliance with this act does not put the state of New Hampshire in violation of federal law.

VII. State law should make a distinction between the medical and non-medical uses of marijuana. Hence, the purpose of this act is to protect patients with debilitating medical conditions, as well as their physicians and designated caregivers, from arrest and prosecution, criminal and other penalties, and property forfeiture if such patients engage in the medical use of marijuana.

VIII. The people of the state of New Hampshire declare that they enact this act pursuant to the police power to protect the health of its citizens that is reserved to the state of New Hampshire and its people under the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution.

2 New Chapter; Use of Marijuana for Medicinal Purposes. Amend RSA by inserting after chapter 126-V the following new chapter:

The written certification shall be valid for up to one year and shall specify the qualifying patient’s debilitating medical condition, which also shall be noted in the qualifying patient’s medical records.

126-W:2 Protections for the Medical Use of Marijuana.

I. A qualifying patient who has been issued and possesses a registry identification card shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty, or denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to a civil penalty or disciplinary action by a court or occupational or professional licensing board or bureau, for the medical use of marijuana in accordance with this chapter, if the qualifying patient possesses an amount of usable marijuana that does not exceed 2 ounces. A qualifying patient shall remain subject to the provisions of RSA 126-W:5.

II. A designated caregiver who has been issued and possesses a registry identification card shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty, or denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to civil penalty or disciplinary action by a court or occupational or professional licensing board or bureau, for assisting a qualifying patient to whom he or she is connected through the department’s registration process with the medical use of usable marijuana in accordance with this chapter, if the designated caregiver possesses an amount of marijuana that does not exceed 2 ounces of usable marijuana. A designated caregiver shall remain subject to the provisions of RSA�126-W:5.

(b) A designated caregiver is presumed to be lawfully engaged in assisting with the medical use of marijuana in accordance with this chapter if the designated caregiver possesses a registry identification card and possesses an amount of marijuana that does not exceed the amount allowed under this chapter.

(c) The presumptions made in subparagraphs (a) and (b) may be rebutted by evidence that conduct related to marijuana was not for the purpose of treating or alleviating the registered qualifying patient’s debilitating medical condition or symptoms or effects of the treatment associated with the debilitating medical condition, in accordance with this chapter.

IV.(a) An alternative treatment center may accept marijuana seeds, seedlings, plants, or useable marijuana from other registered alternative treatment centers in New Hampshire. An alternative treatment center may transfer or sell marijuana seeds, seedlings, plants, or usable marijuana to other registered alternative treatment centers in New Hampshire.

V.(a) No school or landlord may refuse to enroll or lease to, or otherwise penalize, an individual solely for his or her status as a registered qualifying patient or a designated caregiver, unless failing to do so would put the school or landlord in violation of federal law or regulations.

(b) For the purposes of medical care, including organ transplants, a registered qualifying patient’s authorized use of marijuana in accordance with this chapter shall be considered the equivalent of the authorized use of any other medication used at the direction of a physician, and shall not constitute the use of an illicit substance.

(c) Unless a failure to do so would constitute a violation of federal law or federal regulations, an employer shall not discriminate against an individual in hiring, termination, or any term or condition of employment, or otherwise penalize an individual, based upon either of the following:

(1) The individual’s status as a registered qualifying patient or registered designated caregiver; or

(2) A registered qualifying patient’s positive drug test for marijuana components or metabolites, unless the patient used or possessed, or was under the influence of or impaired by marijuana on the premises of the place of employment. For purposes of this chapter, “impaired” includes but is not limited to instances where the registered qualifying patient is not able to safely perform essential job tasks.

VI. A person otherwise entitled to custody of, or visitation or parenting time with, a minor shall not be denied such a right solely for conduct allowed under this chapter and there shall be no presumption of neglect or child endangerment.

VII. A registered designated caregiver who is a licensed health care professional may receive compensation for costs associated with assisting a registered qualifying patient who has designated the designated caregiver to assist him or her with the medical use of marijuana. Such compensation shall not constitute the sale of controlled substances.

VIII. A physician shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty, or denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to a civil penalty or disciplinary action by the New Hampshire board of medicine or any other occupational or professional licensing board or bureau, solely for providing written certifications or for otherwise stating that, in the physician’s professional opinion, a patient is likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marijuana to treat or alleviate the patient’s debilitating medical condition or symptoms or effects of treatment associated with the debilitating medical condition, provided that nothing shall prevent a professional licensing board from sanctioning a physician for failing to properly evaluate a patient’s medical condition or otherwise violating the standard of care.

XI. A registry identification card, or its equivalent, that is issued under the laws of another state, district, territory, commonwealth, or insular possession of the United States that allows, in the jurisdiction of issuance, a visiting qualifying patient to possess marijuana for medical purposes, shall have the same force and effect as a registry identification card issued by the department, provided that a debilitating medical condition as defined in RSA 126-W:1, V exists.

XII. Any cardholder who transfers marijuana to an individual who is not a cardholder under this chapter shall be guilty of a class B felony, shall have his or her registry identification card revoked, and shall be subject to other penalties as provided in RSA 318-B:26.

An applicant who is aggrieved by a department decision may request an administrative hearing at the department.

IV. The department shall require a state and federal criminal records check on each person who is applying to be a designated caregiver or an alternative treatment center agent. The department shall request the department of safety to perform the state and federal criminal records check and the department of safety shall complete such records checks and convey the findings of such checks to the department within 30 days of the request. The department and the department of safety may exchange necessary data including fingerprint data with the Federal Bureau of Investigation without disclosing that the records check is related to the provisions of RSA 126-W and acts permitted by it. The department and the department of safety shall destroy each set of fingerprints obtained pursuant to this chapter after the criminal records check is complete.

V. The department shall issue a registry identification card to the designated caregiver, if any, who is named in a qualifying patient’s approved application and who qualifies under this chapter. The department shall notify the qualifying patient who has designated someone to serve as his or her designated caregiver if a registry identification card will not be issued to the individual.

VI. The department shall issue registry identification cards to qualifying patients and to the designated caregivers within 5 days of approving an application or renewal. Each registry identification card shall expire one year after the date of issuance, unless the physician states in the written certification that he or she believes the qualifying patient would benefit from medical marijuana only until a specified earlier date, then the registry identification card shall expire on that date.

VII. The department shall track the number of registered qualifying patients who have designated each alternative treatment center and issue a monthly written statement to the alternative treatment center identifying the number of registered qualifying patients who have designated that alternative treatment center along with the registry identification numbers of each patient and each patient’s designated caregivers.

VIII. In addition to the monthly reports, the department shall also provide written notice to an alternative treatment center which identifies the names and registration identification numbers of a qualifying patient and his or her designated caregivers whenever any of the following events occur:

(a) A qualifying patient designates the alternative treatment center to serve his or her needs under this chapter;

(b) An existing registered qualifying patient revokes the designation of the alternative treatment center because he or she has designated a different alternative treatment center instead; or

(c) A registered qualifying patient who has designated the alternative treatment center loses his or her status as a registered qualifying patient under this chapter.

IX. The following notifications and department responses are required:

(a) A registered qualifying patient shall notify the department of any change in his or her name, address, or designated caregiver within 10 days of such change.

(b) A registered qualifying patient or alternative treatment center agent who fails to notify the department of any of these changes shall be guilty of a violation, punishable by a fine of no more than $150. If the qualifying patient’s certifying physician notifies the department in writing that either the qualifying patient has ceased to suffer from a debilitating medical condition or that the physician no longer believes the patient would receive benefit from the medical use of marijuana, the card is null and void upon notification by the department to the qualifying patient.

(c) A registered designated caregiver or alternative treatment center agent shall notify the department of any change in his or her name or address within 10 days of such change. A registered designated caregiver or alternative treatment center agent who fails to notify the department of any of these changes shall be guilty of a violation, punishable by a fine of no more than $150.

(d) When a qualifying patient, designated caregiver, or alternative treatment center agent notifies the department of any change to a name, address, alternative treatment center, or designated caregiver, the department shall issue the cardholder a new registry identification card with a new random 10-digit identification number within 15 days of receiving the updated information and a $10 fee.

(e) A registered qualifying patient who no longer has a debilitating medical condition and the patient’s registered designated caregiver and alternative treatment center shall return all registry identification cards associated with that qualifying patient to the department within 48 hours of receiving the diagnosis by the patient’s physician. When a registered qualifying patient dies, the family or designated caregiver shall notify the designated alternative treatment center within 24 hours, the alternative treatment center shall make arrangements to pick up any remaining supply of marijuana within 48 hours of receiving such notification, and the protections of this chapter shall no longer apply.

(f) If a cardholder loses his or her registry identification card, he or she shall notify the department and submit a $10 fee within 10 days of losing the card. Within 5 days after such notification, the department shall issue a new registry identification card with a new random 10-digit identification number.

X. Mere possession of, or application for, a registry identification card shall not constitute probable cause or reasonable suspicion, nor shall it be used to support the search of the individual or property of the individual possessing or applying for the registry identification card. The possession of, or application for, a registry identification card shall not preclude the existence of probable cause if probable cause exists on other grounds.

XI.(a) The department shall create and maintain a confidential registry of registered qualifying patients, designated caregivers, and alternative treatment center agents who have applied for and are entitled to receive a registry identification card in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(b)(1) Except as specifically provided in this chapter, no person shall be permitted to gain access to any information about qualifying patients, designated caregivers, and alternative treatment center agents in the department’s confidential registry, or any information otherwise maintained by the department about physicians and alternative treatment centers, except for authorized employees of the department in the course of their official duties and authorized employees of local and state law enforcement agencies who have stopped or arrested an individual who claims to be engaged in the medical use of marijuana. Authorized employees of local and state law enforcement agencies shall be granted access to the information within the department’s confidential registry only for the purpose of verifying that an individual who has presented a registry identification card to the state or local law enforcement official is lawfully in possession of such card. In addition, if a state or local law enforcement agent has obtained a search or arrest warrant for a specific individual or address for which the law enforcement agent has probable cause to believe possesses, cultivates, or distributes marijuana, the department shall confirm or deny whether the individual or location is a registered qualifying patient, designated caregiver, or alternative treatment center agent.

(2) An employer, landlord, court, administrative hearings officer, or health care provider that has been presented with a registry identification card by a person asserting that they are entitled to protections under RSA 126-W:2 may contact the department to verify the validity of the registry identification card. The department shall verify a registry identification card to an employer, landlord, court, or health care provider who requests verification pursuant to this paragraph, provided that the employer, landlord, court, or health care provider provides the random identification card number on the registry identification card. In verifying the validity of a registry identification card, the department shall confirm only whether a card bearing the random identification card number is valid and the name of the person to whom it was issued.

(c) An individual shall be guilty of a class B misdemeanor for breaching the confidentiality of information obtained pursuant to this chapter, except that department employees shall be exempt for notifying law enforcement officials about falsified or fraudulent information submitted to the department, provided the employee who suspects that falsified or fraudulent information has been submitted confers with his or her supervisor, and both agree that circumstances exist that warrant the notification.

XII. The department shall submit to the legislature an annual report that does not disclose any identifying information about qualifying patients, designated caregivers, or physicians, but does contain, at a minimum, all of the following information:

(a) The number of applications and renewals filed for registry identification cards.

(b) The number of qualifying patients and designated caregivers approved in the state.

(c) The number of alternative treatment centers registered in the state.

(d) The nature of the debilitating medical conditions of the qualifying patients.

(e) The number of registry identification cards revoked.

(f) The number of physicians providing written certifications for qualifying patients.

XIII. Where a state or local law enforcement agency encounters an individual who, during the course of an investigation, credibly asserts that he or she is a registered qualifying patient or registered designated caregiver or encounters a registered alternative treatment center, the law enforcement agency shall not provide any information from any marijuana-related investigation of the individual or entity to any law enforcement authority that does not recognize the protection of this chapter and any prosecution of the individual or entity for a violation of this chapter shall be conducted pursuant to the laws of this state. This paragraph shall not apply in cases where the state or local law enforcement agency has probable cause to believe the person is distributing marijuana to a person who is not allowed to possess it under this chapter, nor shall it prevent the sharing of information if the primary offense is unrelated to marijuana.

XIV. The application for qualifying patients’ registry identification cards shall include a question asking whether the patient would like the department to notify him or her of any clinical studies regarding marijuana’s risk or efficacy that seek human subjects. The department shall inform those patients who answer in the affirmative of any such studies it is notified of that will be conducted in the United States.

126-W:4 Department Rules. Not later than one year after the effective date of this chapter, the department shall adopt rules, pursuant to RSA 541-A, governing the manner in which it shall consider applications for issuance and renewals of registry identification cards for qualifying patients and designated caregivers. The department’s rules shall establish application and renewal fees for registry identification cards in accordance with the following:

I. The fee structure by the department for alternative treatment centers and registry identification cards shall generate revenues sufficient to offset all state expenses of implementing and administering this chapter; however,

II. The department may accept donations from private sources without the approval of the governor and council in order to reduce the application and renewal fees.

126-W:5 Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Limitations on the Use of Medical Marijuana.

I. A registered qualifying patient may use medical marijuana on privately-owned real property only with the permission of the property owner or in the case of leased property with the permission of the tenant in possession of the property, except that a tenant shall not allow a qualified patient to smoke medical marijuana on rented property if smoking on the property violates the lease or the lessor’s rental policies that apply to all tenants at the property. However, a tenant in possession may permit a qualified patient to use medical marijuana on leased property by ingestion or inhalation through vaporization even if smoking is prohibited by the lease or rental policies. For purposes of this chapter, vaporization shall mean the inhalation of marijuana without the combustion of the marijuana.

II. Nothing in this chapter shall exempt any person from arrest or prosecution for:

(a) Being under the influence of marijuana while:

(1) Operating a motor vehicle, commercial vehicle, boat, or vessel, or any other vehicle propelled or drawn by power other than muscular power;

(2) In his or her place of employment, without the written permission of the employer; or

(3) Operating heavy machinery or handling a dangerous instrumentality.

(b) The use or possession of marijuana by a qualified patient or other cardholder:

(1) For purposes other than alleviating symptoms as permitted by this chapter; or

(2) In a manner that endangers the health, well-being, or safety of another person.

(c) The smoking of marijuana in any public place, including:

(1) A school bus, public bus, or other public vehicle;

(2) A workplace or place of employment, without the written permission of the employer;

(3) The grounds of any preschool or primary or secondary school;

(4) Any correctional facility; or

(5) Any public park, public beach, public recreation center, public field, or youth center.

III. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require:

(a) A governmental, private, or any other health insurance provider, health care plan, or medical assistance program to be liable for any claim for reimbursement for the medical use of marijuana.

(b) Any individual or establishment in lawful possession of property to allow a guest, client, customer, or other visitor to use marijuana on or in that property. This chapter shall not limit an individual or entity in lawful possession of property, or an agent of such individual or entity, from expelling an individual who uses marijuana without permission from their property and from seeking civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized use of marijuana on their property.

(c) Any accommodation of any medical use of marijuana on the property or premises of any place of employment or on the property or premises of any jail, correctional facility, or other type of penal institution where prisoners reside or persons under arrest are detained. This chapter shall in no way limit an employer’s ability to discipline an employee for ingesting marijuana in the workplace or working while under the influence of marijuana.

(d) A landlord to permit a qualified patient to use marijuana in any common areas of leased property.

(e) A landlord to permit a qualified patient to smoke marijuana on any or in any leased property, except that a landlord may not prohibit the medical use of marijuana on leased property by a qualified patient through means other than smoking, including but not limited to the ingestion of medical marijuana or the inhalation through vaporization, as long as the tenant in possession of the property provides permission to the qualified patient to use medical marijuana in the rented property.

IV. Fraudulent representation to a law enforcement official of any fact or circumstance relating to the medical use of marijuana to avoid arrest or prosecution shall be punishable by a fine of $500, which shall be in addition to any other penalties that may apply for making a false statement or for the use of marijuana other than use undertaken pursuant to this chapter.

126-W:6 Affirmative Defense. Except as provided in RSA 126-W:5, it is an affirmative defense to any prosecution of an offense involving marijuana intended for medical use that:

I. The defendant is a qualifying patient in possession of a valid registry identification card and at the time of arrest or prosecution was in possession of a quantity of marijuana that was not more than is allowed under this chapter; or

II. The defendant is a designated caregiver in possession of a valid registry identification card and at the time of arrest or prosecution was in possession of a quantity of marijuana that was not more than is allowed under this chapter; and

III. The qualifying patient or the qualifying patient’s designated caregiver was engaged in the acquisition, possession, preparation, use, or transportation of marijuana, paraphernalia, or both, relating to the administration of marijuana solely to treat or alleviate the qualifying patient’s debilitating medical condition or symptoms or effects of treatment associated with the qualifying patient’s debilitating medical condition.

126-W:7 Enforcement.

I. If the department fails to issue a valid registry identification card in response to a completed application for issuance or renewal submitted by a qualifying patient by certified mail pursuant to this chapter within 20 days of the application for issuance or renewal, the registry identification card shall be deemed granted, and a copy of the registry identification application or renewal shall be deemed a valid registry identification card.

II. If the department fails to issue a valid registry identification card in response to a completed application for issuance or renewal submitted by an alternative treatment center agent or a designated caregiver by certified mail pursuant to this chapter within 45 days of the application for issuance or renewal, the registry identification card shall be deemed granted, and a copy of the registry identification application or renewal shall be deemed a valid registry identification card.

III. If at any time after one year following the effective date of this chapter the department is not accepting applications, including if it has not adopted rules allowing qualifying patients to submit applications, a notarized statement by a qualifying patient containing the information required in an application, pursuant to RSA 126-W:3, I together with a written certification shall be deemed a valid registry identification card.

126-W:8 Alternative Treatment Centers.

I. An alternative treatment center registered under this section may acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or dispense marijuana, marijuana paraphernalia, and related supplies and educational materials, to registered qualifying patients who have designated it as their alternative treatment center and to their registered designated caregivers for the registered qualifying patients’ medical use.

HB 573-FN - FISCAL NOTE

AN ACT relative to the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.

FISCAL IMPACT:

The Judicial Branch, Judicial Council, New Hampshire Association of Counties, New Hampshire Municipal Association, and the Departments of Corrections, Safety and Health and Human Services state this bill, as introduced , will have an indeterminable fiscal impact on state, county and local expenditures, and state and local revenue in FY 2013 and each year thereafter. There will be no impact on county revenue.

METHODOLOGY:

The Judicial Branch states this bill would enact RSA 126-W relative to the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. The Branch identified seven sections in the bill that may result in additional costs and four sections of the bill that could result in savings to the Branch.

The potential costs could arise from the following:

• Proposed RSA 126-W:2, XII makes it a class B felony to sell marijuana to an individual who is not a cardholder;

• Proposed RSA 126-W:3, III provides for administrative hearings in the Department of Health and Human Services if an individual is aggrieved by a Department decision. Such hearings could result in appeals to the Supreme Court which has discretionary review of such appeals;

• Proposed RSA 126-W:3, IX(b) and (c) make it a violation with a maximum fine of $150 for a qualifying patient or designated caregiver to fail to notify the Department of any change in name or address;

• Proposed RSA 126-W:3, XI(c) makes it a class B misdemeanor to breach the confidentiality of information obtained pursuant to the chapter;

• Proposed RSA 126-W:5, IV provides for a $500 fine for a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement official of any fact or circumstance relating to the use of medicinal marijuana to avoid arrest or prosecution;

• Proposed RSA 126-W:6 allows medical use of marijuana to be an affirmative defense in any prosecution of an offense involving marijuana. This defense has the potential to elongate trials; and

• Proposed RSA 126-W:8, IX(d) makes it a violation for the first offense and a misdemeanor for subsequent offense for and agent, volunteer, officer, or board member of an alternative treatment center to have been convicted of a drug-related offense.

Potential savings could result from the following:

• Proposed RSA 126-W:2, I provides that a qualifying patient is not subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty for the medical use of marijuana if the patient has no more than two ounces of marijuana;

• Proposed RSA 126-W:2, II provides a designated care giver is not subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty for the medical use of marijuana if the caregiver has no more than two ounces of marijuana;

• Proposed RSA 126-W:2, IV provides that an alternative treatment center may accept marijuana seeds, seedlings, plants or usable marijuana; and

• Proposed RSA 126-W:8, VIII provides no registered alternative treatment center, nor one of its agents, shall be subject to arrest, or prosecution for any marijuana related offense provided the center or agent was acting in accordance with the chapter.

The Branch has no information on which to estimate the bill’s impact on the number of felonies, misdemeanors, or violations that would be tried or avoided, and therefore cannot provide an accurate estimate of the fiscal impact on state revenue and expenditures. The Branch can, however, provide information on the cost of processing each type of case. The Branch states the average cost of processing a routine felony case in the superior court will be $405.37 in FY 2014 and $415.78 in FY 2015. In the district division of the circuit court, the average cost of processing a class A misdemeanor will be $62.71 in FY 2014 and $64.40 in FY 2015; the average cost of processing a class B misdemeanor will be $44.32 in FY 2014 and $45.84 in FY 2015; and the average cost of processing a violation-level offense will be $42.85 in FY 2014 and $44.36 in FY 2015. The Branch states these cost estimates are based on data that is more than seven years old and does not reflect the changes to the courts over that same period of time or the impact these changes may have on the processing of these types of cases. Additionally, the Branch states that if a single case were to be appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the fiscal impact would be in excess of $10,000.

The Judicial Council states the bill may slightly increase Council expenditures. The Council assumes a very small number of people who suffer from a debilitating medical condition are currently prosecuted each year for either the possession or manufacture of marijuana. The Council also assumes a very small number of severely ill people with the types of serious medical conditions and chronic pain issues who would be eligible for prescription marijuana under the bill would divert properly prescribed marijuana in order to sell the drug for material gain. The Council therefore expects the legalization of marijuana possession for medicinal purposes to have no impact on Council expenditures. The Council states, however, that there is no way of knowing to what extent the introduction of licensed commercial marijuana production facilities will lead to collateral crimes unrelated to the dispensing of prescription marijuana. Should such additional crimes occur, and should arrested individuals be eligible for appointed counsel at state expense, a flat fee of $756.25 per felony is charged by a public defender or contract attorney. If an assigned counsel attorney is used the fee is $60 per hour with a cap of $1,400 for a misdemeanor charge and $4,100 for a felony charge. The Council also states additional costs could be incurred if an appeal is filed. The public defender, contract attorney, and assigned counsel rates for Supreme Court appeals are $2,000 per case, with many assigned counsel attorneys seeking permission to exceed the fee cap. Requests to exceed the fee cap are seldom granted. Finally, expenditures would increase if services other than counsel are requested and approved by the court during the defense of a case or during an appeal. The Council cannot determine the fiscal impact as it cannot predict the number of cases which may occur.

The New Hampshire Association of Counties states to the extent fewer individuals are charged, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration in a county correctional facility, the counties may have decreased expenditures. The Association is unable to determine the number of individuals who might be charged, convicted or incarcerated as a result of this bill to determine an exact fiscal impact. The average annual cost to incarcerate an individual in a county correctional facility is approximately $35,000. There is no impact on county revenue.

The New Hampshire Municipal Association states that while the bill may impact local law enforcement officials, it is unable to determine the fiscal impact.

The Department of Corrections states it is not able to determine the fiscal impact of this bill because it does not have sufficient detail to predict the number of individuals who would be subject to this legislation. The Department states the average annual cost of incarcerating an individual in the general prison population for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 was $35,071. The cost to supervise an individual by the Department’s division of field services for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 was $608.

The Department of Safety states the proposed legislation requires a criminal record check through the FBI criminal records database and a New Hampshire criminal history check for all caregivers, alternative treatment center agents, principle officers, board members, and employees. The Department is not able to determine the number of additional criminal background checks that would result from the bill and cannot estimate the fiscal impact. The Department states that if the volume of record requests becomes significant, additional personnel may be needed. The Division of State Police assumes any reduction in the number of drug cases handled by the laboratory would allow resources to be reallocated to other cases that may have been delayed, resulting in no fiscal impact to the lab.

The Department of Health and Human Services assumes the revenue generated by application fees, fines, and private donations will be sufficient to offset the cost of implementing and administering its responsibilities under the bill, however the Department is unable to estimate the potential revenue and states the revenue would not be available until FY 2014. The Department states it does not have existing staff to perform the responsibilities and assumes two additional full-time positions would be necessary. The Department’s responsibilities would include the following:

• Process applications and issue and renew I.D. cards within 15 days of receiving an application;

• Issue photo I.D. cards to qualifying patients and named designated caregivers within 5 days of approving an application;

• Issue replacement I.D. cards within 5 days when cards are lost or when there is a change in name or address;

• Require a state and federal criminal record check, through the Department of Safety, for designated caregivers, principal officers, agents, and employees or volunteers of alternative treatment centers. On an annual basis, conduct annual state and federal criminal record checks and reissue I.D. cards to principal officers, agents, and employees or volunteers of alternative treatment centers;

• Create and maintain a database of qualifying patients, designated caregivers, and principal officers, agents, and employees or volunteers of alternative treatment centers;

• Issue monthly written statements to alternative treatment centers providing: the number of qualifying patients who have designated the center, registration numbers for the patient and designated caregiver, and an update of certain changes;

• Provide written notices to each treatment center as qualifying patients designate or revoke designation for that center;

• Verify the validity of a registration I.D. card for law enforcement, employer, landlord court, administrative hearing officer, or health care provider;

• Submit an annual report to the legislature providing comprehensive data on the program;

• Adopt administrative rules for the program and accept applications for alternative treatment centers within 30 days of the adoption of rules;

• Inspect alternative treatment centers to review dispensing records and receive incident reports concerning rules violations, and loss of inventory by theft or diversion;

• Provide an annual report to the Health and Human Services Oversight Committee as described in RSA 126-W:10; and

• Determine and enforce civil infractions for violations of the chapter.
