Upstate/Downstate: School Effectiveness in Illinois
During the early years of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), “low-income school” was mostly code for an urban school that served high concentrations of non-white students. But these days, the connections between low-income enrollment and lower achievement are being enacted at scale in predominantly white communities with the same depressing regularity as they have been for years in low-income communities of color.

A new report, "Upstate/Downstate: Changing Patterns of Achievement, Demographics and School Effectiveness in Illinois Public Schools," describes some surprising shifts in local and regional achievement patterns in the State of Illinois, one of the most demographically representative states in the country. These shifts show worrisome declines in many communities that were not the original focus of NCLB and promising growth in some communities that were.

Race and family income still predict standardized test scores with remarkable accuracy in most school districts. But Upstate/Downstate offers new evidence that changes in school effectiveness - what schools and districts do to improve their impact on student and adult learning - can play as powerful a role in local and regional achievement as race and family income do.
