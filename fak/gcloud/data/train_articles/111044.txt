Bernie Sanders sit-in: Stuart delegate one of 57 who helped organize
When nearly 200 Bernie Sanders delegates walked into the main media tent outside the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, Dawn Abate of Stuart was among them.

Abate, who is in her first year as a delegate, said she is a member of the group that organized the sit-in, called the Coalition of the 57, with one delegate from each of the 57 states and territories represented in the group.

Abate is the group’s representative in Florida.

As the group worked to get their leader allowed inside the media tent where the sit-in was being held, Abate assisted in negotiations.

“There have been rumors about all sorts of sit-ins and civil disobedience, and I think that there’s a time and place for that in history, and certainly in present day, but that’s not something that Bernie wants us to do,” she said. “He does not want us to disrupt the convention, and we respected what he asked us to do.”

Abate said the Coalition of 57 wants to “unite the party. We want to be in solidarity.”

She added that while the group doesn’t want Donald Trump to defeat Hillary Clinton, “unfortunately the … official nominee is not working really hard to keep the movement alive.”
