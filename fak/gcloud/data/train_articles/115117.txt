1950

Birth of BIC® Cristal®

Marcel Bich, believing in the potential for the ballpoint pen, adapts and improves the ballpoint invented by the Hungarian László Biró, and in December 1950, launches his own ballpoint pen in France under the BIC® brand, a shortened and more memorable version of his own name. The quality and affordable price of the BIC® Cristal® ballpoint pen means that it is quickly adopted by an increasing number of consumers.
