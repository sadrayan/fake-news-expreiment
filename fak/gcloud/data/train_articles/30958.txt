NC General Assembly mulling over changing school grading scales Copyright by WNCN - All rights reserved Video

RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) - The North Carolina General Assembly is considering changing the grading scale used in state public schools.

Right now, anything less than a 60-percent mark is a failing grade. The new scale would change that to anything less than 40 percent.

The new scale would be:

A: 100 to 85 percent

B: 84 to 70 percent

C: 69 to 55 percent

D: 54 to 40 percent

F: Anything below 40 percent

School report cards from the 2017 school year have results for individual schools and counties. Wake County schools have just a 0.6 percent fail rate. Cumberland County has 1.2 percent fail rate. Durham County has 18 percent failure rate.
