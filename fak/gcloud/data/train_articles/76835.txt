As President of NationsBank in Florida, Sink’s bank employees using deceptive sales practices swindled elderly bank customers into high-risk investments. NationsBank tellers were paid kickbacks for referring their customers to the risky securities. Newspapers reported that brokers were instructed to look like bank employees and even used NationsBank stationary and letterhead.

According To The NationsSecurities Fraud Case NationsBank of Florida, N.A. is listed as “controlling persons” of NationsSecurities

24. Until on or about November 15, 1994, the following

parties were “controlling persons” of NationsSecurities within the

meaning of § 20 of the 1934 Act:

(a) NationsBank Corporation;

(b) NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A.;

(c) NationsBank of Florida, N.A.;

(d) NationsBanc Enterprise, Inc.;

(e) Dean Witter Venture, Inc.;

(f) Dean Witter Discover and Company.

NationsSecurities Conducted Business On The Premises Of Bank Branches Operated By NationsBank Of Florida, N.A.

6. NationsSecurities is a registered broker/dealer under the

1934 Act and is a member of the NASD. NationsSecurities, at all

times material, conducted a retail securities business on the

premises of bank branches operated by NationsBank of North

Carolina, N.A., and NationsBank of Florida, N.A., and the other

banking subsidiaries of NationsBank Corporation known by various

5

names2 in various states throughout the southern United States,

including Florida, and in the District of Columbia, at their

direction and control.

Below Are A List Of Some Of The Allegations Brought Against NationsBank Including: Working Out Of Bank Branches, Deceptive Sales Pitches, Referral Fees For Bank Employees, Etc…

87. The following are a few examples of the ways in which the

distinctions between NationsBank Corporation’s banking

subsidiaries, and NationsBanc Securities/NationsSecurities, were

intentionally blurred, so as to confuse bank customers as to the

nature of the products being sold:

(a) Brokers were physically located on

the premises of the bank branches,

and were permitted virtually

unlimited access throughout the bank

branches, which were liberally

plastered with decals proclaiming

the protection of FDIC insurance;

(b) Brokers typically sat in NationsBank

bank lobbies at the same desks where

customers opened checking or savings

accounts and bought bank CD’s;

(c) NationsBank Corporation and its

banking subsidiaries provided

brokers with bank customers’

confidential account information

through the United States Mail

and/or interstate wire/telephone

communications, including such

information as the dollar value and

maturity dates of customers’ CD’s,

the dates of deposits and

withdrawals, account balances, the

identities of joint account holders,

and personal information such as the

addresses, telephone numbers, ages

and incomes of the customers;

(d) A printed script prepared for

NationsBank employees entitled

“REFERRALS ARE KEY!” contained

“(t]he following lead-ins” for use

by bank employees to refer bank

customers to brokers:

* NationsBank offers a wide range of

investment services, If you’d like,

I can ask a NationsSecurities

representative to call and arrange

a meeting. . . .

23

* Many priority customers, like

yourself, work with our investment

representatives. May I introduce

you to him/her?. . . .

(e) Brokers were trained to make

telephone solicitations such as “I

am calling from the bank” or words

of similar effect, for the purpose

of soliciting securities sales;

(f) Brokers were taught to emphasize the

safety, stability, and credit

quality of shares of the Trust and

were trained to hedge or avoid

directly answering customer

questions or objections, such as,

“Is this FDIC insured?”

(g) Prior to the inception of

NationsSecurities, NationsBanc

Securities account applications

featured the “NationsBank” corporate

logo in large type and contained few

or no disclosures under the

circumstances indicating the risk

being taken by the customer when

investing in shares of the trust;

(h) Even after NationsSecurities’

inception, brokerage applications

concealed or disguised explanations

of risk under a boxed heading in the

margin misleadingly labeled

“Affiliate Disclosure.”

(i) Employees of NationsBank

Corporation’s, subsidiaries were

instructed to advise customers that

Dean Witter products (including the

Trust) were as safe as NationsBank,

or words to like effect;

(j) NationsBank Corporation’s banking

subsidiary employees were actively

engaged in soliciting and

“referring” sales of securities,

including the Trust, and customers

typically were unable to discern

that the bank customer service

representative, manager, or

teller who normally handled their

24

depository accounts were now engaged

in security solicitations in

exchange for improper ongoing

transaction-based compensation.

(k) The various other misleading

activities and practices outlined

above.
