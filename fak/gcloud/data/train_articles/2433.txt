Rothstein auction of exotic cars and luxury yachts live
By Peter Franceschina

Sun Sentinel

The fruits of Fort Lauderdale attorney Scott Rothstein's massive Ponzi scheme are on the auction block. Exotic autos and yachts -- toys for the well-heeled set worth millions -- will be sold to the highest bidder, whether investor or private collector, at today’s auction at the Broward County Convention Center in Fort Lauderdale. Proceeds will go to a restitution fund to help pay victims of Rothstein's $1.4 billion fraud scheme.

As the lot numbers come up for bid, we will post pictures of the cars and yachts with descriptions and then provide the winning bid. The first items to be auctioned will move down the blog as newer items come under the gavel.

First up are some appetizers, two Yamaha WaveRunners. A crowd of several hundred people has grown into a thousand or more packed into one of the exhibit halls at the Broward County Convention Center. Some folks have flown in from as far as Texas and even Canada to bid. IRS agents are standing by the cars, politely bantering with the curious and those who are here to plunk down some serious cash if they get the winning bid.

12:45 p.m.

The auction is now underway. Incredibly, the first lot, a WaveRunner, sold for $9,000 in a matter of mere seconds. Looks like the auctioneers are going to run the prices up at a blistering pace. It's standing room only around the seated bidders, with auction workers in tuxes weaving through the audience to identify bidders.

Well, it's over. In a little over an hour the government collected $5.8 million. They're already clearing the chairs.

The final lot, the second Ferrari.

One of Rothstein's main status symbols got to two million in about two minutes. Then it took another 10 minutes for it to reach its final price. There was quite a bit of drama as the bidders steeled themselves to go higher.
