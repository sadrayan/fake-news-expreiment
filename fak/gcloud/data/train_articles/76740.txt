As they consider more efforts to curb illegal immigration, Gov. Greg Abbott and Republicans in the Legislature this year are focusing their attention on so-called sanctuary cities, opening the governor to criticism that the state is imposing itself on local law enforcement jurisdictions.

Abbott made sanctuary cities legislation a priority in his State of the State address this week. He also proposed spending another $800 million on border security over the next two years, continuing the spending level in the current budget.

A hearing is set for Thursday on the Senate sanctuary cities bill that would end policies like San Antonio’s that prohibit police from asking about immigration status of suspects and require jails to honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers.

Similar legislation failed two years ago. But Abbott elevated the issue amid his public fight with Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, who has said she would only honor ICE detainers for undocumented immigrants charged with serious crimes.

On Wednesday, Abbott made good on a threat to withhold $1.5 million in state law enforcement grants to Travis County over the dispute.

“I think the intention of my bill is that no city or county can have a policy that prohibits” asking about immigration status, said Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, the author of one of the House bills that also includes a provision on ICE detainers. “It doesn’t say that they have to, it prohibits that. The city of Fort Worth cannot have policy or law that says police officers cannot check a person’s citizenship status.”

It's unlikely many cities or counties would be affected by a state law on ICE detainers. Only Travis County has announced it won't comply with detainers for low-level offenders. But it remains unclear what happens when ICE abandons its Priority Enforcement Program, a detainer system that only asked jails to hold convicted criminals of serious crimes. President Trump signed an executive order last week to end the PEP system.

Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar, a Democrat who took office this year, said in a statement that the jail will “will comply with all laws as they pertain to arrest and release of inmates. I will honor all warrants for arrest and will only hold inmates as specifically required by law.”

There's no federal law requiring jurisdictions to honor ICE detainers, although in some cities ICE has started issuing warrants instead of the semi-formal detainers. In a follow-up statement, Salazar said he had met with ICE officials last Thursday.

“We have agreed to work together on detainers on a case-by-case basis and to act jointly, always in the interest of public safety,” he said.

Much more controversial is the issue of whether local police forces can instruct officers to not ask about immigration status. The San Antonio Police Department has a written policy forbidding officers to ask about immigration status from the people they encounter.

Police Chief William McManus said he cooperates with ICE, including allowing deportation officers into the city’s detention center. Acting as immigration agents would hurt police officers’ ability “to work with the community to help fight and solve crime,” McManus said.

“I’m concerned about it every (legislative) session, because again I think that if it were to happen, I think it’s going to hurt us,” he said. “We’re certainly paying close attention to it this session as well, because there seems to be big push to enact that type of legislation.”

“I believe that local law enforcement should remain under local control,” he added.

The issue has been consistently opposed by business groups and evangelicals, which usually are Republican allies.

Other immigration-related bills would end in-state college tuition for undocumented immigrants in Texas, and require government contractors to use the federal E-verify system to prove their employees are legal documented workers.

The various bills could hurt tourism Texas tourism, the state’s second-largest industry, and hit the labor forces for the construction, hospitality and agricultural industries, said Chris Wallace, the president of the Texas Association of Business.

“Overall, whether it’s the repeal of in-state tuition or the sanctuary cities, TAB’s opposed to it,” Wallace said. “We feel that overall, this type of legislation hurts the Texas economy.”

House Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, has expressed little interest in ending in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, but the choice of Geren, a Straus lieutenant, to write the “sanctuary cities” bill is seen as an indication that some version of it will be allowed through the House.

It remains to be seen what the final legislation will include. So far, the various proposed bills contain a range of provisions including protection for crime victims and exemptions for school and hospital districts.

“That is a concern for me,” Geren said of whether police should ask crime victims about their immigration status. “I want to make sure that we don’t intimidate someone, a woman that’s been abused, from reporting the abuse or a witness to a crime from reporting the crime, but we’re trying to work with all parties concerned to alleviate some of those.”

“I don’t think anybody knows what’s going to pass,” said Matthew Simpson, whose group, the Trust Coalition, which includes the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, is opposing the Senate sanctuary bill. “I don’t think there’s a version that’s an anointed version.”

Opponents of the bills have pointed out that the same state officials who have decried federal overreach are setting policies for cities and counties.

“In the past, a certain party was a pro local control party until the locals started doing things they didn’t like, and now they’re against local control,” State Rep. Diego Bernal, D-San Antonio, said in a town hall at the University of Texas at San Antonio downtown campus earlier this month. “And I will also point out that usually happens when those local localities start to erect protections for themselves, whether they’re (non-discrimination ordinances) or tree ordinances or plastic bag bans or bans on fracking. That’s when the philosophy switches.”

Jeff Judson, a former member of the board of directors of the Heartland Institute and a former senior vice president of the San Antonio Tea Party, responded that cities don’t have the same legal and constitutional protections that states do.

“This notion of local control is fine, but as Gov. Abbott has said, it goes federal to state control and then to individual liberty, and if a local community is violating our individual liberties and not keeping us safe, which is one of their most important functions, then we do rely on the state to step in and make sure our liberties are preserved,” Judson said.
