Tripedia DTaP lists "SIDS" and "Autism" as Known Adverse Reactions on its Package Insert
"Adverse events reported during post-approval use of Tripedia vaccine include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, SIDS, anaphylactic reaction, cellulitis, autism, convulsion/grand mal convulsion, encephalopathy, hypotonia, neuropathy, somnolence and apnea. Events were included in this list because of the seriousness or frequency of reporting."--Tripedia Package Insert

I seriously doubt, in the current state of heightened awareness about autism, that the makers of Tripedia would admit that autism is a known adverse reaction to their vaccine unless there are significant reasons/research to support its validity. They must be worried about lawsuits but there must also be good reasons (ie.evidence of a connection) for them to put this out there! Not to mention that they included SIDS as well !!

(Not that the other brands of DTaP are any safer! Sanofi-Pasteur may just be the first to admit this!)
