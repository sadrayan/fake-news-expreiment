Police say a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a luxury residential building in Manhattan's Union Square.

Crime scene investigators were on the scene at 1 Irving Place Tuesday evening, collecting evidence in the bizarre and grisly death. Police say it's not clear yet how the 48-year-old woman died, but her body was found at around 5 p.m.

Her purse was found near the trash chute where it appears she went in.

Neighbors said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building's famous resident, Anthony Weiner. The disgraced former congressman is still listed as a resident at the building, though he's currently serving time in prison for sexting an underage girl.

The woman's death is not yet being called suspicious.
