Pursuant to Section 510(b)(2) of Title V of the Social Security Act, the term "abstinence education," for purposes of this program means an educational or motivational program that:

(A) Has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

(B) Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school age children;

(C) Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;

(D) Teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity;

(E) Teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

(F) Teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;

(G) Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances; and

(H) Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity. Eligibility Requirements (080) Applicant Eligibility (081): Funds are allotted to 59 States and Territories to enable them to carry out abstinence education programs. Eligible applicants include the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia, the republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. Beneficiary Eligibility (082): School-age girls and boys, adolescents, at-risk populations subject to out-of-wedlock births, parents, youth serving professionals and families. Credentials/Documentation (083): A signed letter from the authorized representative must accompany each application; it should include documentation establishing the authorized representative's authority to apply for and administer the Abstinence Education grant program funds on behalf of the State or Territory. 2 CFR 200, Subpart E - Cost Principles applies to this program. Application and Award Process (090) Preapplication Coordination (091): Preapplication coordination is not applicable. Environmental impact information is not required for this program. This program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372. Application Procedures (092): 2 CFR 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards applies to this program. Application procedures will be given in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Award Procedure (093): ACF recruits and trains Federal staff and contractors to review applications. Program administrators review, observe, and edit comments of reviewers to ensure they are in compliance with guidelines and Federal law. Applications are rated Approved, Approved with Conditions, or Approval Pending. States that submit applications that are Approved receive grant awards and do not need to send further information. States that submit applications that are Approved with Conditions" receive grant awards with descriptions of weaknesses and subsequent conditions that must be met in order to receive Approved status. The applicants are given a set time period to send to ACF a response that addresses the conditions. States that submit applications that are rated Approval Pending receive a list of weaknesses cited by the reviewer and directions for submitting an amended application that addresses the weaknesses. The State will not receive a grant award until the State submits a satisfactory application. The applicants are notified of a final due date for submission of a satisfactory application. The remaining unobligated balance is reallocated as supplemental funding to such States that submit a valid application consistent with the original formula for this funding. Deadlines (094): Contact the headquarters or regional office, as appropriate, for application deadlines. Range of Approval/Disapproval Time (095): From 30 to 60 days. Appeals (096): Not Applicable. Renewals (097): From 90 to 120 days. Assistance Consideration (100) Formula and Matching Requirements (101): Statutory Formula: Title V.

Matching Requirements: The statutory formula for this program is based upon census data. Grants awarded to each State are determined by a formula using the State's proportion of low-income children compared to the total number of low-income children in the U.S. based on the most recent Census data for children in poverty. For each fiscal year, the estimated allotment for each State or Territory will be updated based on the most current available census data and will be communicated to States by August 15 of the preceding fiscal year. Census data are unavailable for the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. Thus, the allocations for these three entities are based on the amounts allocated to them by HHS in prior fiscal years. There is a required match of 43 nonfederal dollars for every 100 federal dollars. For example, if a states federal award is $100,000, the State must provide a match of $75,250, which would represent 43% of the total project cost of $175,000 (counting both federal grant and state match). The match can be reached by use of state dollars, local government dollars, and private dollars including foundation dollars, in-kind support, or any combination thereof.

This program does not have MOE requirements. Length and Time Phasing of Assistance (102): In accordance with Section 503 of the Social Security Act, Any amount payable to a State under this title from allotments for a fiscal year which remains unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such State for obligation during the next fiscal year. For example, funds appropriated and allocated to the States in FY 2010 (starting October 1, 2009) are available for obligation and expenditures through September 30, 2011. The program was extended through FY2017 and legislation was enacted to redistribute unclaimed funds to states currently receiving funding with the provision that they use the funding for abstinence-only education. See the following for information on how assistance is awarded/released: Draw downs are based upon need and project progress. Post Assistance Requirements (110) Reports (111): Progress reports and financial expenditure reports are required. The Financial Status Report is required annually. The Performance Progress Report is required semi-annually. Program guidelines allow States to expend abstinence education funds over a two-year period. An interim Financial Status Report (SF-425) is due annually, and a final fiscal report is due 90 days after the end of the project period. Performance monitoring occurs by reviewing program progress reports and conducting monitoring phone calls. Audits (112): In accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR 200, Subpart F - Audit Requirements, non-Federal entities that expend financial assistance of $750,000 or more in Federal awards will have a single or a program-specific audit conducted for that year. Non-Federal entities that expend less than $750,000 a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in 2 CFR 200.503. As described in Title V, Section 506(b)(1) of the Social Security Act, each state shall, not less often than once every 2 years, audit its expenditures from amounts received under this title. Records (113): Records of the recipient shall be made available to the Secretary to secure an accurate description of the activities for which funds were spent in achieving the purposes of this section. States shall make available copies of reports and audits for public inspection within the State. Within 30 days following the completion of each audit report, the State shall submit a copy of that audit report to the Secretary.
