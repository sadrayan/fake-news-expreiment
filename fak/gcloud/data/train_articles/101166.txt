Passionate supporters throng Anies-Sandiaga celebration at City Hall
Lack of crowd control marred a celebration held following the inauguration of Governor Anies Baswedan and his deputy Sandiaga Uno at City Hall, Central Jakarta, on Monday afternoon.

Over 1,000 supporters and residents squeezed into the hall’s yard, pushing each other as Anies and Sandiaga, assisted by their bodyguards, arrived after being sworn in at the State Palace.

Security personnel tried to make way for the new leaders as supporters attempted to take pictures of Anies and Sandiaga, with some reportedly getting shoved by security.

Anies and Sandiaga were rushed to the Balai Agung room, where the city administration held a handover ceremony.

Supporters tried to get onto the room’s balcony, which had been designated for the press.

The celebration, which was enlivened by Islamic devotional songs, is scheduled to end by 11 p.m.

The administration invited street vendors to provide visitors with various dishes, ranging from ketoprak (dish consisting of ground peanuts, tofu and rice cakes), soup, noodles and gado-gado (mixed vegetable salad with rice cakes and peanut sauce).

Jakarta Environment Agency head Isnawa Adji said about 200 orange troops would be assigned to clean City Hall and its surrounding area.

"By the time the event ends, I can ensure that there will be no trash,” Isnawa said. (fac/wit)
