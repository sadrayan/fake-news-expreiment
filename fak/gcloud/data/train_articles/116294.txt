Breitbart confuses photo of Cleveland's Cavs championship parade for Donald Trump rally
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Downtown Cleveland drew an absolutely "yuuuge" crowd during the Cavs' championship parade in June.

So, it sort of stands to reason that someone might confuse the fervor unleashed as the city ended a decades-long championship drought with the grandiosity of say, a political rally.

Breitbart, a right-wing political news site that enthusiastically supports GOP nominee Donald Trump, captioned an article about the crowds at a Wednesday Trump rally in Jacksonville, Florida with a photo that was immediately recognizable to Northeast Ohio residents.

Breitbart removed and replaced the photo, and later filed a correction after Media Matters, a liberal watchdog group, called attention to it:

The image's emergence on Wednesday night appears to originate with Tatiana Wright, a Donald Trump supporter from Virginia, who posted the picture on her Twitter account.

Wright spent some of Wednesday night arguing with perplexed Clevelanders:

@PatMcManamon You are not a reporter. You are @HillaryClinton BFF. Tell her this. She fakes polls. I tweet fake pictures. Thanks. #Tatiana -- Tatiana Wright (@twright55) August 4, 2016

She further explained to Ohio Public Radio's Andy Chow on Thursday morning that her mislabeling of the Cleveland parade was intentional:

@andy_chow @HillaryClinton done on purpose: Hillary fakes polls, deletes her emails, I tweet fake picture. It worked! [?] #Tatiana -- Tatiana Wright (@twright55) August 4, 2016

So there you have it. #ThisIsCLE, and #ThisIs2016.
