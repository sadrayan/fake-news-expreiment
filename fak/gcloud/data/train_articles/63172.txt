WE BEGIN TODAY WITH THE RACE FOR THE OPEN SEAT IN THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT HOUSE , SPEAKER PAUL RYAN’S SEAT. RYAN’S RECENTLY ANNOUNCED RETIREMENT CREATED AN OPENING IN THAT SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN DISTRICT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO DECADE AND SOME OBSERVERS SAY IT APPEARS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MIGHT HAVE CLEARED THE FIELD FOR A PREFERRED CANDIDATE. U.W. BOARD OF REGENTS MEMBER BRYAN STEIL, A CORPORATE ATTORNEY FROM JANESVILLE. HE ONCE WORKED FOR PAUL RYAN. STEIL DECLARED HIS CANDIDACY LATE LAST MONTH, AND HE JOINS US NOW ON "UPFRONT." BRIAN STYLE -- BRYAN STEIL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS AN INTRODUCTION FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU. BRYAN: BORN AND RAISED IN WISCONSIN, AND WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN, AND WORKED I MANUFACTURING AND NINE YEARS. I SERVED ON THE WISCONSIN BOARD OF REGENTS. THAT KIND OF BACKGROUND WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO THIS RACE. IT IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. MIKE: THE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU ARE? BRYA I AM TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT POCKETBOOK ISSUES. THEY ARE FRUSTRATED WITH SPENDING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND FRUSTRATED WITH THEIR RISING HEALTH-CARE COSTS, AND PEOPLE SAY THAT WE ARE AT 2.9% UNEMPLOYMENT, SO HOW DO WE PREPARE OUR WORKFORCE IN THE FUTURE? MIKE: HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT THAN PAUL RYAN? IS THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOU TWO? BRYAN: I LOOK AT ASPECTS O HIS MANUFACTURING BACKGROUND, SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF MIKE GALLAGHER SOME OF HIS FOREIGN-POLICY EXPERIENCE. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT PAUL RYAN’S 20 YEARS, BUT I AM MY OWN MAN. MIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT IT SEEMED TO SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TRYING TO CLEAR THE FIELD FOR YOU. IS THAT A FAIR ASSESSMENT? BRYAN: I DON’T THINK SO. WE CAME OUT RIGHT AFTER PAULINE MADE HIS DECISION AND STARTED REACHING OUT TO FRIENDS, FAMILY, PEOPLE ACROSS. THE DISTRICT, AND GAINING SUPPORT IT HAS BEEN REALLY OVERWHELMING THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE HAVE PULLED OUT EARLY, BUT EVE DAY, I’M INTRODUCING MYSELF TO VOTERS, TRYING TO EARN THEIR TRUST, AND TRYING TO GET THEM TO ALLOW ME TO REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS IN WASHINGTON. MIKE: YOU HAVE BEEN WELCOMED TO THE RACE BY SOME OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. KATHY MYERS SUGGESTED YOU BE A RUBBER STAMP IN WASHINGTON, AND THE PRICE CAMPAIGN, I WANT TO READ A QUOTE -- IT IS HARD TO THINK OF ANYONE LESS IN TOUCH WITH THE STRUGGLING -- WITH THE STRUGGLES FACING WORKING FAMILIES THAN A THIRD-GENERATION -- BRYAN: I HAVE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN ROCK COUNTY. MIKE: BUT YOU ARE A CORPORATE ATTORNEY, NOT A MANUFACTURER. BRYAN: MY EMPLOYER IS A MANUFACTURING CORPORATION, SO EVERY DAY, I COME INTO THE OFFICE, AND FIGURE OUT TO GROW JOBS OF THE COMPANY. MIKE: LET’S TALK ABOUT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS FOX CON. WHERE DO YOU STAND? BRYA HOW DO YOU GROW JOBS IN THIS AREA? IF YOU GO BACK NOT THAT LONG AGO, WE WERE HAVING THE OPPOSITE CONVERSATION. LARGE COMPANIES ARE A POSITIVE STATEMENT OF THE REFORMS OF WISCONSIN AND THE BEGINNING OF THE REFORMS AND WASHINGTON D.C. COMPANIES ARE COMING HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BEST WORKFORCE. WE HAVE THE BEST WORKFORCE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. MIKE: DO YOU SUPPORT WHAT HAS BEEN PASSED BY CONGRESS? DO YOU THINK THE TEXANS WANT PACKAGE THAT W PASSED WAS GOOD LEGISLATION? BRYA IT IS A GOOD STEP FOR TO ALLOW EMPLOYERS AND JOB GROWTH IN OUR AREA, AND THE RESULTS ARE STARTING TO SPEA FOR ITSELF. AN EMPLOYMENT RATE IS A TERRIFIC STATISTIC THAT PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF THE TYPES OF RESULTS THAT THOSE TYPES OF TAX REFORMS PRODUCE. MIKE: GIVE ME A SENSE OF YOUR BACKGROUND THE BOARD OF REGENTS. WHAT DID THAT TEACH YOU? WHAT DID YOU LOVE FROM THAT THAT YOU BRING TO THIS NEXT PHASE OF YOUR LIFE? BRYA GREAT QUESTION. THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS. THERE IS COMMITMENT TO SERVICE AND THE COMMITMENT TO WISCONSIN. I THINK YOU ALSO SEE, HOW DO WE PREPARE INDIVIDUALS FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE? YOU TAKE FOX CON AS AN EXAMPLE. THEY WILL NEED 13,000 EMPLOYEES. THEY WILL NEED PEOPLE TO WORK AT ALL DIFFERENT SKILL SETS. SO ENGINEERS WILL BE NEEDED, BUT YOU NEED EFFECTIVE HIG SCHOOLS AND EFFECTIVE TECHNICAL COLLEGES. THERE IS THAT PREPARATION OF TRAINING FOR THE JOB OF THE FUTURE, AND THE SECOND PIECE IS MY COMMITMENT TO FISCAL DISCIPLINE. SO, THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN BOARD OF REGENTS ALONG WITH THE GOVERNORS HELD THE LINE ON TUITION AS FLAT. IF YOU TOOK THAT TYPE OF SPENDING APPROACH WASHINGTON, YOU CAN IMAGINE WHERE WE WOULD BE. SO THE COMBINATION OF PREPARING INDIVIDUALS FOR THE WORKFORCE, AND ALONGSIDE A TRUE FISCAL APPROACH ON SPENDING IS WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IN WASHINGTON. MIKE: YOU WORKED WITH PAUL RYAN FOR A WHILE. CAN YOU DESCRIBE YOU DID WITH PAUL RYAN? BRYAN: RIGHT AFTER I GRADUATED COLLEGE, ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO, I WORKED FOR PAUL IS A POLICY ADVISOR. FOCUSING ON BUDGET ISSUES. YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHO PAUL RYAN WAS BACK THEN. I SPENT MY TIME WORKING ON BUDGET ISSUES. MIKE: WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM HIM? BRYA YOU LEARN HOW TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. HOW YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION ON ISSUES IS A WISCONSIN APPROACH. YOU ADDRESS PROBLEMS DIRECTLY, HEAD-ON, AND YOU HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW YOU SOLVE THEM. THAT IS WHAT PAULINE HAS TAUGHT ME. MIKE: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS AN ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER PRESIDENT TRUMP? BRYAN: I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT AND THE REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE. BUT I HAVE A MORE WISCONSIN COMMUNICATIONS STYLE THAN THE PRESIDENT, BUT EXCITED ABOUT THE REFORMS IN WASHINGTON. MIKE: BRYAN STEIL IS ONE OF THE CANDIDATES OF ONE OF THE SEAT PAUL RYAN IS GIVEN THE -- IS GIVING UP AS HE RETIRES. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.
