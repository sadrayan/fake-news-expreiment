Tim Kaine Delivers National Security Speech in North Carolina
Tim Kaine delivered a speech on national security and foreign policy in Wilmington, North Carolina on Monday. During his speech, Kaine spoke about the experience of Hillary Clinton and contrasted her experience with the comments and actions of Republican Donald Trump. Kaine painted Trump as someone who cannot be trusted when it comes to foreign policy because he is “emotionally volatile, fact-challenged, self-obsessed and inexperienced.” Kaine spoke about the importance of the United States’ relationship with its allies and questioned whether Trump would be able to maintain the United States’ status as a leader in the world. “He has a bizarre fascination with strongmen and authoritarian leaders in countries that are no allies of the United States, and with respect to our allies, he would toss alliances aside, and says he wants to ‘take everything back from the world that we’ve given to them. Trump has offered empty promises and divisive rhetoric. Under his leadership, we would be unrecognizable to the rest of the world. And we would be far less safe,” he said. A video of Kaine’s speech is below.
