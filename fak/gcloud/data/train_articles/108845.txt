The Hitching Post specializes in small, short, intimate, and private weddings for couples who desire a traditional Christian wedding ceremony. We believe that every wedding is special and realize how important this day is to those who walk through our doors.

At one point in time a railway tunnel ran under where the Hitching Post now stands, which was built in 1955. It has been used for wedding ceremonies for over 50 years. Prior to that time, the Hitching Post was in a wood building in the same general area and Justice of the Peace officers (an elected position) ran the Hitching Post. During WWII, couples would line up around the door waiting for their chance to be married. In 1989 the current owners purchased the Hitching Post. A few years later they made the building uniquely stand out from the Coeur d’Alene backdrop by adding the front western façade. Read More About Our History ->

The Hitching Post staff would be honored to be a part of your special day.
