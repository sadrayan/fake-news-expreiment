Ft. Hood shooter - Registered Democrat – Muslim



Columbine shooters - Too young to vote but both families were registered Democrats and progressive liberals.



Virginia Tech shooter - Registered Democrat - Wrote hate mail to President Bush and to his staff.



Colorado Theater shooter - Registered Democrat; staff worker on the Obama campaign; Occupy Wall Street participant; progressive liberal.



Connecticut School Shooter - Registered Democrat; hated Christians.



Congresswoman Gabby Giffords’ shooter – Leftist, registered Democrat.



All of these shooters were progressive Democrats!



Why is that the media always tells us that conservative NRA-type gun-owners are the real danger?



Lesson... Don't trust the media! Or politicians!

It was a major embarrassment for Lamestream media when their Tea Party accusations regarding Gabby Gifford's shooter were proven unfounded, and it was discovered in his own writings that he was a Democrat.

It should surprise no one.
