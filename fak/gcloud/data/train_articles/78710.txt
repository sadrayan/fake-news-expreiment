Total Aircraft Carrier Strength by Country
OVERVIEW

The United States fields the largest modern carrier force in the world with few nations fielding more than a single example. THese vessel types are expensive to design, built, procure, and maintain and have long been the domain of top world defense powers. With each passing year, new players are entering the realm of a surface fleet built around the mighty aircraft carrier - China being a key example of this.



For the purposes of the GFP ranking, Helicopter Carriers are included in this listing alongside traditional fleet carriers due to their growing popularity worldwide. Landlocked nations are not penalized for the lack of a standing naval force but those powers with clear access to oceans are penalized for lacking a carrier element. Aircraft carriers currently under construction are excluded due to their inability to contribute to a present-day war effort.



The aircraft carrier remains a nation's "symbol of strength" on the high seas and is a sought-after component of several military powers such as China, Egypt, and Turkey. The United States Navy remains the clear leader in the field of aircraft carriers with its powerful nuclear-fueled fleet as well as its conventional-powered inventory. This allows the nation to field an impressive military presence anywhere in the world.



The data presented below is through 2019.



New to 2019 is the inclusion of Landing Helicopter Docks observed as aircraft carriers.
