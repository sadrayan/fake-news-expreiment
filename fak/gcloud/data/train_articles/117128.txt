2007, 2008, and 2009 Amero Mintage Figures.

Sales of all 2007 and 2008 Amero coins have been discontinued. Some 2009 Ameros are now available for ordering (see below). Additional 2009 Amero types will become available later in the year. Minting of the 2009 1/10 oz gold 100-Amero coins with satin finish have been discontinued. Final mintage of that coin is 143. A few of those are still available for ordering.

All 2009 Ameros will be stamped by a coin press that was actually used in the U.S. Denver Mint from 1986 to 2001. Moonlight Mint, a private facility built by Amero coin minter Daniel Carr acquired this surplus Denver Mint coin press in early 2007 and completed the restoration of it in late 2008. Traditionally, all Ameros have had a symbolic "D" mint mark. But now that all Ameros will be struck on a Denver Mint coin press, the "D" takes on additional meaning. Note that the 2008 100-Amero (1/10th oz gold) coins were also struck on this Denver coin press. So anyone who ordered one of those coins can now rightfully claim that it was stamped by a (former) U.S. government coin press. Moonlight Mint's Denver Coin Press.

NOTE:

I have received numerous inquiries as to my personal stand on the North American Union (NAU) issue.

My goal with these coins is not to endorse a Union of North America or a common "Amero" currency. I fully support the United States Constitution, and I would not welcome (in any form) a diminishment of its provisions. I expect that these coins will help make more people aware of the issue and the possible ramifications. I leave it up to others to decide if they are in favor of, or against a North American Union. And I encourage citizens to voice their approval or disapproval of government plans that impact them.



A currency union, similar to the European Union "Euro" has been proposed for North America. The name of the new currency is the "Amero". The Wikipedia encyclopedia article has additional details about the "Amero". This has been the source for many conspiracy theories tied in with other proposals such as the "Canamex Corridor".

These private-issue fantasy pattern coins will be struck as an annual series (until such time as it is no longer legal to do so), starting in the latter part of 2007.

Final mintages will be determined by sales. The 2008 issues will be available for ordering during 2008, and none will ever be minted after the end of the year. Some 2008 Amero issues may be withdrawn before the end of the year, and new issues will added later in the year.

The 2007 designs feature various Seated Liberty obverses and a similar Eagle & Globe reverse (except for the Jamestown 400th Anniversary commemorative issue which features Pocahontas).

One 2008 design (the 100-Amero Seated Liberty silver proof) was carried over from 2007. The remaining 2008 Ameros feature a Winged Liberty Head design.
