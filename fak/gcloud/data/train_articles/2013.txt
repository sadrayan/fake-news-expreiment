McCain on Airbus
Will you overturn the Air Force decision to replace the air in fueling (sp) crew of about 160 aircraft with the European Airbus.

No. I think the bulk of that manufacturing and those jobs will be here in the United States of America, and I think it was a fair and open competition as far as I can tell. I’ll be glad to send you the statistics. Almost all of that investment and any aspect of it will be kept inside the United States of America. My job is to have the best quality product at the lowest price to the taxpayer. I’m proud to have saved the taxpayer some $6 billion in what happened last time when they tried to do a tanker deal that was bad for America.
