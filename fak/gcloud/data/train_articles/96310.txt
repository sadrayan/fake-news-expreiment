WEBVTT WE'RE STILL MONTHS OUT FROM THE NOVEMBER ELECTION, BUT THE RACE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS ALREADY BEEN MAKING HEADLINES. THERE ARE THREE CANDIDATES SO FAR. A REPUBLICAN AND TWO DEMOCRATS. ONE OF THEM IS OUR NEXT GUEST JOHN RICHARDS OF MILWAUKEE. HE JOINS US ON THE SATELLITE FROM MADISON. REPRESENTATIVE, GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. YOU'VE BEEN IN THE ASSEMBLY FOR 15 YEARS. WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE THE STATE'S TOP COP? WELL, I THINK WISCONSIN NEEDS A STRONG LEADER AS ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO CAN BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO GET THINGS DONE, TO KEEP US SAFE AND ALSO STAND UP FOR THE VALUES THAT HAVE ALWAYS MADE WISCONSIN GREAT AND I THINK PRETTY UNIQUE. VALUES LIKE PROTECTING CONSUMERS, AND PROVIDING EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. STANDING UP FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE CLEAN, OPEN, TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS I HAVE EXTENSIVE HISTORY DOING. YOUR OPPONENTS ARE LIKELY TO SAY THAT JOHN RICHARDS IS A POLITICIAN, WE'RE PROSECUTORS. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? WELL, I HAVE A LONG TRACK RECORD OF WORKING WITH PROSECUTORS, POLICE OFFICERS, JUDGES AND THE WHOLE RANGE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GIVING OUR FRONT LINE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICES THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO KEEP US SAFE. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS YEAR, I WORKED WITH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO PASS A PAY INCREASE. IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED IN OUR STATE. TO PASS STRICTER DRUNK DRIVING LAWS IN OUR STATE. TO WORK TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE TOUGHER LAWS PROTECTING OUR DOMESTIC ABUSE VICTIMS IN OUR STATE. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS I HAVE EXPERIENCE DOING. WE NEED A STRONG AND EXPERIENCED LEADER WHO CAN COME TOGETHER WITH BOTH PARTIES TO GET THINGS DONE. ON YOUR WEBSITE YOU TALK ABOUT BEING A TOUGH ON CRIME ATTORNEY GENERAL. WHAT AREAS IN PARTICULAR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BEING TOUGH ON CRIME? WELL, LET ME USE GUNS FOR EXAMPLE. I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF CRIMINAL. THAT'S WHY I WROTE THE BACKGROUND CHECK LAW THAT REQUIRES A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR ALL IN WISCONSIN TO MAKE SURE IF YOU ARE A MULTIPLE FELON, IF YOU HAVE A JUDICIAL ORDER ON YOU SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A GUN. IF HAVE BEEN COMMITTED FOR MENTAL ILLNESS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A GUN. THOSE ARE REASONABLE PROTECTIONS WE SHOULD BE PASSING IN WISCONSIN, SUPPORTED BY MOST PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN. CERTAINLY MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT IN WISCONSIN. THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE PASSING. YOU MENTIONED A DRUNK DRIVING IN YOUR EARLIER STATEMENT ABOUT DRUNK DRIVING LAWS. AS MANY PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE WATCHING TODAY KNOW, COUPLE OF STORIES CAME OUT IN RECENT WEEKS ABOUT BOTH OF YOUR OPPONENTS HAVING HAD ALCOHOL-RELATED OFFENSES, GIVEN THAT THEY WERE MANY YEARS AGO. IS THAT RELEVANT TO THIS CAMPAIGN? THOSE PAST OFFENSES? WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE DRUNK DRIVING TOUGHER IN WISCONSIN, TOUGHER ON DRUNK DRIVING IN WISCONSIN. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THREE BILLS UP IN FRONT THAT I SUPPORT THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO TIGHTEN UP DRUNK DRIVING LAWS. I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT CRIMINALIZING FIRST OFFENSE DRUNK DRIVING IN WISCONSIN. THERE ARE FINANCIAL CONCERNS WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND CERTAINLY MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING THE WORK LOAD ISSUES. BUT THERE'S A WAY WE CAN GET IT DONE AND WE SHOULD GET IT DONE. SO, I DON'T HEAR YOU SAYING YOU NECESSARILY THINK THOSE PAST PROBLEMS WITH ALCOHOL-RELATED OFFENSES ARE PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN. I DIDN'T HEAR YOU MENTION THAT. WELL, I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IN THE FUTURE, WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WISCONSIN FACES IN THE FUTURE AND THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE AND THE WAY WE ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES IN WISCONSIN. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IN THIS CAMPAIGN. LET ME HAVE YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S ON YOUR WEBSITE. YOU SAY ON THE WEBSITE YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TO FIGHT FOR EVERY WISCONSIN CITIZEN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. IF THE COURTS WERE TO UPHOLD THE STATE'S VOTER I.D. LAW, IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD VIGOROUSLY SUPPORT? VOTER I. DIMPLET LAW AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW IS TROUBLING BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE VOTES. CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A WOMAN WHO'S A PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE, SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME PUTTING TOGETHER THE INFORMATION TO GET AN I.D. THAT WOULD ALLOW HER TO VOTE. IF SOMEONE LIKE THAT IS RESTRICTING FROM VOTING AFTER A LAW WE PASSED, SOMETHING IS WRONG AND WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT OBVIOUSLY IF THE LAW IS PASSED AND THE COURT RULES IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL, WE'LL UPHOLD THE LAW OF COURSE. BUT I DO THINK THE LAW AS IT'S WRITTEN NEEDS SCRUTINY. I THINK WE SHOULD BE STANDING FOR THE VALUE THAT EVERYONE WHO'S ELIGIBLE TO VOTE SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE. THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CORE AMERICAN VALUE THAT WE SHOULD BE UPHOLDING. GOT A COUPLE OF SECONDS LEFT. YOU SAID YOU WANT TO TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT THIS OFFICE. VERY BRIEFLY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE OFFICE ENGAGE IN, I THINK A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH COZYNESS WITH THE PARTY IN POWER. YOU CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN IT WITH THE OPEN MEETING LAW AND THE OPEN RECORDS LAW, WHERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HIMSELF MARCHED ON THE SUPREME COURT TO GET A RULING THAT THE LEGISLATOR WAS EXEMPT FROM THE OPEN MEETINGS LAW. NOW, THERE IS SOME WORK TO REOPEN AS IT APPLIES TO THE LEGISLATOR. I THINK WE SHOULD APPLY THESE LAWS EVEN HANDEDLY. IF A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICANS BREAKS THE LAW, THEY SHOULD BE HELT ACCOUNTABLE. ALL RIGHT, REPRESENTATIVE JOHN RICHARDS, ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU MIKE. WE WILL BE TALKING TO OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE COMING WEEKS. NEXT, THE PUSH TO RAISE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. A WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN SAYS THERE'S A WAY TO HELP WITHOUT HURTING SMALL BUSINESSES. WEDNESDAY, THE STATE SENATE WILL BE ON THE FLOOR TO CONSIDER
