Strategic Considerations in Japan-Russia Relations: The Rise of China and the U.S.-Japan Alliance

Michito Tsuruoka

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This essay examines recent developments in Japan-Russia relations and assesses the implications of both China’s rise and the U.S.-Japan alliance for this relationship.

Main Argument

The Japan-Russia relationship operates in a complex strategic environment. In conducting diplomacy with Moscow, Tokyo must take into account both the rise of China as a strategic challenge to Japan and the alliance with the U.S., which is always viewed skeptically by Moscow. On the one hand, China’s assertive actions in the East and South China Seas provide the basic strategic rationale for Japan’s recent efforts to improve relations with Russia. On the other hand, any possible deal between the two countries on the return of the disputed Northern Territories/Southern Kuril Islands will have to address the role of U.S. forces in protecting Japan under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. For resolving the latter issue, the unification of Germany in 1990 and NATO enlargement in the late 1990s may provide useful lessons on what Russia might demand and what could be negotiated.
