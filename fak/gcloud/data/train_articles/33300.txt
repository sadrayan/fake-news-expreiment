Medicare for all requires corporate tax increase, Andrew Gillum says
Washington (CNN) Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum acknowledged Sunday that his "Medicare for all" plan would require increasing taxes on corporations in his home state.

Gillum said on CNN's "State of the Union" that he would "absolutely not raise taxes on everyday working Floridians" to institute the proposal. Pressed on whether wealthier Floridians would see a tax hike, he said corporations would front the plan.

"We will increase taxes for corporations in our state who, right now, just so you are aware, only 3% of companies in the state of Florida pay the corporate tax rate. ... And that 3% under the Donald Trump tax scam got a windfall of $6.3 billion overnight due to the tax reform that took place in Washington, DC," Gillum said.

"We're not asking for all of it," he continued. "We simply said we believe that we ought to bring a billion of that money back into the state's government because being a cheap-date state has not worked for the state of Florida."

A spokesman for Gillum said the mayor was citing an analysis by the left-leaning Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy in 2015 that said only about 53,000 corporations in Florida, or about 3 percent of the total, paid any state corporate income tax.
