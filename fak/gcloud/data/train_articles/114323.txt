If you love animals, you are likely to find this book a real page-turning read. I recommend it for that, as well as another very important reason.



The author volunteers at the Sarvey Wildlife Care Center in Washington State. His name is Jeff Guidry, and his beloved, Lynda, plays a wonderful role in the story. One thing this book points out is the healing that animals can bring to humans. That's one reason to volunteer in wildlife care.



One of the most important things this book explains and repeatedly depicts is the difference between wild animals and domestic ones. Some of the animals the center winds up taking care of have been raised by people who thought they could domesticate a wild animal. They thought it was all in how the animal was raised, all about experience.



This is simply not the case, and the animals suffer hugely from people trying this. As the wild animal matures, instincts mature, too, and they are genetic, not from experience. Meanwhile, the animal has been deprived of early experiences it needed to survive in the wild when mature. It can't be tame anymore, and it can't make it in the wild, either.



There are quite a few animals that often fall victim to this human misunderstanding. After a lot of research, the Americans with Disabilities Act has very recently been updated to say that the only animals that qualify to be service animals to people with disabilties and have full public access are dogs and miniature horses. It has been found that other animals are just too unpredictable. Genetics make a huge difference.



Before adopting any animal, it is vital to do careful research. This book is a great story and will also help people understand a little bit more about the needs of wild animals. From there, before adopting any animal, research--a lot!
