Patrick Murphy for U.S. Senate
Washington Post: Senate Democrats end marathon filibuster, announce Republicans agree to gun control vote

Orlando, our state, and the LGBT community are still reeling from this weekend’s senseless tragedy, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. 49 innocent people are dead and 53 are wounded, many of them Hispanic and LGBT. Our thoughts and prayers are insufficient. Floridians — and all Americans — expect their elected leaders to work to end the epidemic of gun violence. To keep our country and all its citizens safe we need to:

Close the terrorist gun loophole — suspected terrorists shouldn’t be able to legally purchase guns

Mandate background checks for all gun purchases

Ban high-capacity magazines and keep assault weapons out of the hands of dangerous people

It’s the time for action, and if I were in the Senate, I would proudly stand with Senator Chris Murphy and Senate Democrats in support of their filibuster to force Mitch McConnell’s hand on this critical issue.

Early this morning, after almost 15 hours, their courageous filibuster concluded with a promise from the GOP to hold a vote on background checks and the terrorist loophole. It’s the very least they can do in the wake of Orlando.

Will you add your name to stand with me and Senate Democrats to end gun violence?

Sincerely,

Patrick
