najeeb ahmed missing case: JNU student Najeeb Ahmed missing case: Delhi HC allows CBI to close file
NEW DELHI : The Delhi high court on Monday stopped monitoring of the Central Bureau of Investigation probe into missing Jawaharlal Nehru University student Najeeb Ahmed and allowed the agency to go ahead if it wants to close the case before trial court.HC rejected the allegations of Ahmed’s mother, Fatima Nafees, that the CBI probe was “tardy and slow” and ended the habeas corpus proceedings started nearly two years ago.A bench of Justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel disposed of the petition filed by Nafees, refusing to accept her allegations that the agency wanted to file the closure report due to “political compulsions”.The bench, in its 34-page judgment, also rejected Nafees’ plea for entrusting the investigation to a Special Investigation Team (SIT) whose work would be monitored by the high court, thus removing CBI from the picture. It said on the plea of the petitioner, the court first transferred the investigation to CBI and has been monitoring progress up to the stage where the agency was in a position to file a closure report.“Consequently, the prayer of the petitioner that the court should constitute an SIT and monitor its work, thus removing the CBI from the picture, has to be declined,” the bench said.HC brought CBI into the picture on May 16 last year. The agency said it examined every aspect of the case but is of the opinion that no offence was committed against Ahmed, who had gone missing from Mahi-Mandvi hostel of JNU on October 15, 2016, following a scuffle with some students allegedly affiliated to ABVP.Delhi Police didn’t oppose the handing over of the investigation, saying it had done its bit. But Ahmed’s mother demanded access to the status reports filed by CBI so that loopholes could be highlighted. The bench said at every stage of the hearing, Nafees was aware of the filing of the status reports. It also underlined that the status reports might also contain details of the case diary of the investigating agency and these are not shared with anyone.
