WISGOP Unveils New Radio Ad On Susan Happ’s Shady Land Deal
by

[Madison, Wis.] – Today, the Republican Party of Wisconsin released a radio ad titled, “Susan Happ: Conflict of Interest,” which highlights Politician Susan Happ’s shady land deal with a child predator. Susan Happ took $180,000 from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution. When the victim asked for a special prosecutor given Happ’s extreme conflict of interest, she was denied.

Listen to the radio ad here. The ad will air statewide.

Wisconsin GOP Executive Director Joe Fadness released the following statement on WisGOP’s new radio ad:

“Susan Happ’s willingness to put politics and personal benefit ahead of public safety is wrong. Happ gave a sweetheart deal to a child molester that gave her $180,000 at the same time the victim was denied justice. It’s time that Happ stop hiding and finally be honest with voters about this troubling situation. Wisconsin deserves better than Happ’s record of protecting criminals over victims.”
