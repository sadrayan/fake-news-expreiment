The plant was moved because of a stimulus project. If there was no stimulus project there, $200,000 would not have been spent moving the plant to accommodate the project, a waste of taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers were forced to pay this money because of the stimulus, which we consider an abuse of power. We stand by our report.
