Emails, responses to PolitiFact Texas, Jessica Sandlin, Texas press secretary, Office of U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, April 1, 2013

...We reached our conclusion based on the TMA report attached – page 12 specifically. Thanks and hope you are doing well,

Jessica Sandlin

Texas Press Secretary

U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX)

Thanks.

That chart (on p. 12) speaks to physicians accepting all NEW patients. The same survey indicates that some 31 percent of physicians accept all new Medicaid patients, while another 26 percent limit such patients. Separately, 67 percent of Texas physicians submitted a Medicaid claim in fiscal 2011, we wrote in a January fact check. If that holds up, it suggests about one in three physicians do not accept Medicaid—the opposite of what the leaders said.

The release from the Governor and Senators that you’re asking about today repeats the TMA conclusion that you already fact-checked and found to be mostly true: “Only three in 10 Texas doctors are currently accepting new Medicaid patients.”

Now you’re bringing up another fact-check on a separate stat from January. Are you fact-checking one of your fact-check findings with a separate fact-check? I’m not following.

I apologize if I was unclear. The survey indicates 57 percent of doctors accept at least some new Medicaid patients. Agree?

Again, the release from the Governor and Senators that you’re asking about today repeats the TMA conclusion that: “Only three in 10 Texas doctors are currently accepting new Medicaid patients.”
