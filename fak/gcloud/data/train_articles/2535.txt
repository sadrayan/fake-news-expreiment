Republicans Take Aim at Hillary Clinton for VA Remarks
Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and Republican lawmakers sparred over the Department of Veterans Affairs Wednesday, each side accusing the other of politicizing veterans issues and not working to fix problems at the department.

The dustup comes days after Mrs. Clinton seemed to play down the VA’s deep-seated problems on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show. “It’s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,” she said in the Friday interview.
