AISD Graduation Rates Reach All-time High
AUSTIN, Texas—Graduation rates for the Austin Independent School District's Class of 2012 are at an all-time high at 82.5 percentage points, a 2.5 percentage point increase from the previous year, according to the Texas Education Agency's recently released report on graduation and completion rates.

"I am proud of our students’ success and our teachers’ and principals’ work to continue to raise graduation rates for all students,” AISD Superintendent Meria Carstarphen said. “We continue to raise the bar to prepare students with the skills they need to compete in our global economy. Higher graduation rates are critical to the success of our students, district and to the future of our community.”

Since 2008, graduation rates among AISD's high school seniors have risen steadily from 74.3 to 82.5 percent. Each year, the TEA reports graduation rates for the previous school year. Information for the past three years is included in the chart.

AISD’s schools have implemented a new early warning system so that guidance counselors and administrators can track student progress, and provide timely support and guidance when students are falling behind, missing classes, or having other issues that might interfere with their long-term success.
