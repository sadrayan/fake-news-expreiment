Jeb Bush calls for crackdown on 'anchor babies'
Jeb Bush said Wednesday he disagrees with Donald Trump's call to end birthright citizenship but echoed Marco Rubio's call a day earlier to prevent abuses, which Bush described with a loaded term.

"This is a right of the 14th amendment and I just don’t think it's legitimate to say we're going to change our Constitution and that's going to solve our problem. I don’t think that's the proper thing to do," Bush said.

But appearing on Bill Bennett's radio show, Bush set off Democrats by calling for more enforcement and using the term "anchor babies."



“If there’s abuse, if people are bringing — pregnant women are coming in to have babies simply because they can do it, then there ought to be greater enforcement. That’s (the) legitimate side of this. Better enforcement so that you don’t have these, you know, ‘anchor babies’, as they’re described, coming into the country.”

Hillary Clinton replied with a tweet: "They're called babies."

Rubio did not use "anchor babies" on Tuesday yet also sought a balance, saying the birthright citizenship should not go away while calling for enforcement against an "industry" of people who come to the U.S. illegally to have children.
