Rep. Tom Graves: President’s Veto of 42,000 Jobs is Appalling





Washington, February 24, 2015 - Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA-14) issued the following statement after President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill (S. 1) approving the Keystone XL pipeline:



“The president’s veto of 42,000 jobs is appalling. After five safety and environmental reviews by the president’s own State Department, he decided to put partisan politics in front of all the families who would benefit from the good-paying jobs the Keystone XL pipeline would create. It is my hope that we can find another way to move this important jobs project forward.”



According to the State Department, the Keystone XL pipeline would create approximately 42,100 jobs and roughly $2 billion in earnings throughout the country. ###
