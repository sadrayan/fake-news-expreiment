New Jersey Families Can't Afford Christie and Romney





(Trenton)- This morning, the Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institute released an analysis of Mitt Romney’s tax proposals. The non-partisan organization found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. Assemblyman John Wisniewski, Chairman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, released the following statement in response:



"In New Jersey, taxes on middle class and working families have gone up as Governor Christie eliminated the property tax rebate and reduced the earned income tax credit. If Mitt Romney is elected President, these same families will see their taxes go up even more. In order to pay for a $5 trillion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires, Mitt Romney would increase taxes on the average middle class family by $2000. New Jersey’s middle class just can’t afford Chris Christie and Mitt Romney.”
