One hundred mothers in one of Milwaukee's most distressed neighborhoods will soon have access to a support system aimed at helping them deliver and nurture healthy babies.

Mayor Tom Barrett on Tuesday signed legislation creating a joint pilot program with the Milwaukee County Department of Health and Human Services to provide doulas to 100 expectant mothers in the troubled 53206 ZIP code.

"A healthy city starts with healthy moms and babies," Barrett said during a bill signing event at Canaan Missionary Baptist Church on North 11th Street.

Barrett was joined by Aldermen Khalif Rainey and Milele Coggs, County Supervisor Marina Dimitrijevic, Milwaukee Health Commissioner Jeannette Kowalik, Dalvery Blackwell of the African American Breastfeeding Network, Julia Means of Ascension Health and a group of doulas.

Rainey, the lead sponsor of the measure at City Hall, said that addressing problems like infant mortality and reducing incarceration rates has to be a priority for everyone, including elected officials.

"If these aren't addressed, again we have missed the mark," Rainey said.

Under the measure, the Milwaukee Health Department will compensate 100 doulas to help expectant mothers in the 53206 ZIP code. The program will be funded with up to $100,000 from Milwaukee County.

Rainey worked with Dimitrijevic to develop the program.

"This is just the beginning. This is a pilot program. But think about the power of 100 doulas, 100 women and families and children," Dimitrijevic said.

"We will have the healthiest babies in the nation," she said.

Dimitrijevic and Kowalik spoke of the importance of city and county officials, as well as public agencies and private groups, working together to combat infant mortality.

"We can't do this alone," Kowalik said. "We have to have partnerships."

The measure comes as Gov. Tony Eversâ€™ has pledged to spend $618,000 in his 2019-'21 budget to fund doula training.

Doulas are certified professionals trained to support expectant mothers' nutritional, physical and mental health with culturally sensitive pregnancy and childbirth education. They typically emphasize prenatal nutrition, labor coaching, breastfeeding, safe sleeping habits and stress reduction techniques.

Many have additional specialties, such as massage, hydrotherapy, lactation consultations, yoga, aromatherapy and organizational skills.

Coggs said: "It is far beyond time that we work together, collaborate on solutions, so that years from now we are not having these same conversations about all the negative we know exists. We know we have the power and the knowledge and the ability and the resources to help change those outcomes."
