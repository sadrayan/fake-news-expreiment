DMS Releases New Ad For Troy Balderson
The six-figure ad buy highlights Balderson’s commitment to Ohio as a small business owner and commonsense legislator working on both sides of the aisle to advance solutions that benefit Ohio families.

WASHINGTON - Today Defending Main Street released “ Solutions ,” its third television ad this cycle airing in support of Rep. Troy Balderson (OH-12).

The ad also showcases why Danny O’Connor is wrong for the 12th District, highlighting his support to make Columbus a Sanctuary City for illegal immigrants. He is also seen on-camera emphasizing his years-long fight to advance progressive values.

“Danny O’Connor’s liberal agenda is wrong for Washington and wrong for Ohio. Troy Balderson is a man of action, and has a proven record of commitment to Ohio families. He’s the right choice in November and is critical to holding the Republican majority in Congress,” said Defending Main Street President Sarah Chamberlain.

Defending Main Street aired two television ads in support of Balderson this past Spring, prior to the 12th Congressional District’s primary election for the U.S. House of Representatives.

“Solutions” is airing in the Columbus and Zanesville markets through October 23rd.
