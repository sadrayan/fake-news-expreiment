Supreme Court disbars Rothstein
As expected, the Florida Supreme Court approved the permanent disbarment of alleged Ponzi schemer and major political donor Scott Walter Rothstein. The order, signed by the court's clerk, allows the Florida Bar to recover $1,250 in costs from Rothstein, though it might be difficult considering those at the front of the reimbursement line.

Rothstein can appeal, and only after that window expires is it final, but the order is "effective immediately."
