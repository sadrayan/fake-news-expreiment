Trump surrogate Katrina Pierson tweeted Thursday evening that McCain “still refuses to answer questions about his role” in the dossier alleging a number of damning ties between Donald Trump and Russia written by former MI6 spy Christopher Steele.

Since everyone is just now realizing his staffers role in the #RussiaHoax We have been asking questions!

The link in the tweet was from 2017 — before the senator and former presidential candidate passed away — but was nonetheless sent out on December 20, 2018.

“Who wants to tell her?” writer Dustin Giebel tweeted before joking that Pierson is “screaming at McCain’s gravestone, ‘”ANSWER ME G*DDAMNIT.'”

ABC News podcaster Matt Bevin, meanwhile, mused that the former Trump campaign aide is “in her office screaming questions at a Ouija board.”

Another user noted, in vulgar fashion, that Pierson may have messed up her Hootsuite tweet-scheduling settings — or at least hoped she had.
