Joe:

Hello again; hope this doesn’t find you swamped…

Is what the Texas Senate just approved the largest tax cut in state history, as the press release below says?

What’s the best way to gauge?

You told us a while back the 2006 tax reductions had an annual value of $6 billion. I have pasted our email exchange below the pr.

Thanks.

VAN TAYLOR HELPS SENATE PASS WHAT WOULD BE THE LARGEST TAX CUT IN TEXAS HISTORY

Taylor: "Spending is the cause of big-government, but taxes and debt are the symptoms"

AUSTIN, TX – Senator Van Taylor today helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the State Senate. A co-author of the tax package passed this afternoon, Taylor has been outspoken in his support for lower taxes and less government. In total, the Senate tax package would provide $4.6 billion in property and business tax relief.

"Without a vigilant eye defending the taxpayers, government will naturally consume everything in its path," stated Taylor. "Spending is the cause of big-government, but taxes and debt are the symptoms. Government cannot spend what it doesn’t take from its citizens. The taxes cuts passed today in the Senate would provide long-awaited tax relief for Texas families and small businesses."

The Senate tax relief package contained Senate Bills 1, 7, and 8, with SB 1 addressing property tax cuts and SB 7 and SB 8 cutting taxes on small businesses. All three measures passed the Senate and now await action in the Texas House.

On property tax relief, SB 1 increases the homestead property tax exemption, which exempts the first portion of individual's home from property tax calculation. As passed by the Senate today, the non-taxable amount of a individuals home increased from the first $15,000 to 25 percent of the median market value of a Texas home. This change protects homeowners from appraisal creep, where the rising value of Texas homes lead to an effective tax increase for homeowners. Currently the Legislative Budget Board estimates a $31,373 exemption for the tax year 2016. Since school districts are guaranteed a fixed amount from the state this tax reduction would reduce the state's general revenue spending, not the amount credited to school districts.

Speaking on property tax reform Taylor stated, "The math is simple, just because home values go up, that doesn’t mean it costs government any more to provide the same services to those same homes. Worse, while appraisal values increase the tax burden on working families, there is no guarantee that family incomes will rise at the same rate to offset this effective tax increase. This money belongs to the people, not government, and homeowners should not be punished with higher taxes when they are fortunate enough to see an increase in the value of their home."

As it relates to business taxes, in 2006, the Texas Legislature authorized the business margins tax, commonly known as the franchise tax, which taxes businesses based on their gross receipts before expenses. Currently, Texas is one of only five states with gross receipt style taxes. Additionally, compliance with the franchise tax requires several complex calculations and an additional set of accounting books which increase the costs for businesses to comply.

To address these issues, SB 7 reduces the franchise tax rate 15% and broadens the scope of businesses eligible to use the E-Z computation method, reducing the compliance costs for more businesses. SB 8 provides business tax relief for growing small businesses by expanding the franchise tax exemption from $1 million in sales to $4 million in sales. This would reduce franchise tax revenues to Texas by only 8% while completely removing the state tax burden on 52% of Texas businesses.

Taylor said of the tax cuts, "The franchise tax is an especially punitive tax that is tremendously difficult and costly to comply with and unfairly taxes gross receipts. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Instead of penalizing Texas businesses with stacks of paperwork and additional taxes on top of what they already pay, we should be letting them spend their time and resources doing what they do best -- creating jobs."

In their 2015 rankings of state business tax climate, the non-partisan Tax Foundation ranked Texas 39th amongst states based on their relative tax burden. The study noted that if the margins tax were to be repealed, Texas would have ranked 1st in business tax climate.

A seventh generation Texan and local small businessman, Van Taylor serves the majority of Collin County and a portion of Dallas County in the Texas Senate where he is widely recognized as a conservative leader. Taylor serves as Vice-Chairman of the Nominations Committee and also as a member of the Education, Health and Human Services, and Transportation Committees. Van and his wife, Anne, married after his return from Iraq and are the proud parents of three young girls. Van and his family reside in Plano near the land his great-grandfather farmed during the Great Depression.

Are you asking about SB 1 (property tax) or SB 7 and SB 8 (franchise tax), or all three?

I think the 2006 tax cut should be viewed as larger, certainly from a property tax standpoint. I can’t really speak to the franchise tax portion. I’m not sure that the franchise tax has ever been “cut”. So if the maker of the statement was speaking about business taxes or specifically the franchise tax reduction, it may be the largest reduction ever.

If speaking about property tax (SB 1), I would say no way. The 2006 cuts reduced school district M&O rates by at least 22% (maximum rate now is $1.17, back then it was $1.50), and even more for taxpayers in districts that have not increased tax rates significantly in the last several years. Even factoring in a maximum I&S rate of $0.50, the percentage reduction was at least 16.5%. The homestead exemption change might be a larger percentage than that for some homesteads that are substantially below average value, but to a taxpayer with a taxable property value of $300,000, the extra exempted amount equates to only about a 6% reduction in value, and therefore a 6% reduction in taxes due. Additionally, if you are not a homeowner, you get no direct tax relief from the property tax change.

If you want to get into the question of what happened to school district tax rates and property values after the 2006 reduction, and that those factors counteracted the tax rate reduction, the same may very well turn out to be true for this exemption increase as well. Certainly from a value perspective, it won’t take long for homeowners whose homesteads are valued at the median value used for indexing the exemption to end up paying more taxes even if the rates don’t rise.

I think you would be able to compare the fiscal notes for the three tax cut bills form this session to the fiscal note for the 2006 rate reduction scheme and see the clear difference in terms of cost to the state.

Subject: Tax Cut Information

Hi Gardner,

I appreciate the discussion today.

At the end of the day, I find that the Senate’s $4.63 billion tax relief package (franchise tax cut of $2.48 billion and property tax relief of $2.15 billion) would be the largest tax cut in the state’s history.

The fiscal note that shows a larger 2006 property tax cut package than the current Senate package merely a hypothetical that didn’t bear out in reality from higher local tax rates and higher appraisals. If you look at the total fiscal notes for cuts to the franchise tax, they amount to $2.48 billion. Considering the actual property tax cuts in 2007 from the 2014 Comptroller report in Exhibit 9, the 2006 property tax relief amounted to only a minor reduction of approx. $400 million in overall property tax revenues and a $2 billion cut in the school tax property levy in 2007. Both the total and school property tax revenues were above the 2006 level in 2008, erasing any property tax cuts during that two year period. This.

Therefore, I can only conclude that the Senate’s tax package would be largest tax cut in the state’s history. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best,

Vance

Thank you for sharing. Come back in a year, and I would imagine the same could be said about the Senate’s property tax cut of 2015. After all, the fiscal note is being prepared for SB 1 by the same LBB that prepared the fiscal note for the 2006 rate reduction. Value increases, particularly for the 50% of the tax base that gets no property tax reduction at all, will likely push tax bills for many individuals higher in tax year 2015 even if they succeed in increasing the homestead exemption. If the only way to show a cut is for the aggregate total of tax revenue to decrease, then I suspect this measure will be seen in hindsight as a total failure.

The 2014 tax year value of the state mandated homestead exemption is about $75 billion according to the Comptroller’s value study for that year. If we assume that an additional $100 billion is exempted by the new mechanism (a generous estimate), that has to be matched up against the anticipated increase in value of the $2 trillion tax base. The Comptroller projects tax year 2015 total taxable values to increase 5.71% over 2014. Multiplied by the $2.038 trillion tax base, that is an increase in total value of $116 billion. Last time I checked $116 billion was more than $100 billion. So I would expect no reduction in the overall taxes levied for tax year 2015.

That is not to say that the additional exemption is trivial, and I would never characterize it as anything other than a tax cut. But I don’t believe it to larger than the 2006 rate reduction, and I don’t believe it is particularly long-lasting for those who actually would receive that benefit.

Your comment below (bolded) refers to several data sources. Can you guide me to the originals (provided they are web-linked)?

This link is to the 2014 Comptroller’s property value study. Scroll down to the section “Deduction Detail” to see the deduction amount for the current exemptions:

http://www.cpa.state.tx.us/propertytax/administration/pvs/findings/2014p/ALL0000001Y.html

The $2 trillion tax base number can be seen at the bottom of the first section labeled “Totals by Category”.

On the growth in tax base, the Comptroller is required to estimate the growth rate by Education Code §42.254. This is usually done by letter to the Speaker and Lt. Governor. I could not find a link to the letter specifying the 5.71%, but the number has been in the general appropriations act (HB 1/SB 2) since those bills were introduced this session. I think we may have seen a copy of the transmittal letter from the Comptroller, but I could not find it this morning on my desk (I can barely find the keyboard at this point). Below is an excerpt from the rider for the Foundation School Program from the engrossed version of HB 1 that lays out that assumption:

Formula Funding: The Commissioner shall make allocations to local school districts under Chapters 41, 42 and 46 based on the March 2015 estimates of average daily attendance and local district tax rates as determined by the Legislative Budget Board and the final tax year 2014 property values. Property values, and the estimates of local tax collections on which they are based, shall be increased by 5.71 percent for tax year 2015 and by 5.30 percent for tax year 2016.

The appropriations bill can be downloaded from the home page of LBB’s web site. Here’s that link:
