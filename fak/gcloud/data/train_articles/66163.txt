Donald Trump says he'll implement tough new restrictions on administration officials and their spouses giving paid speeches if he's elected to the White House. The GOP nominee is telling a rally crowd in Wisconsin that he wants to ban the spouses of senior government officials from collecting speaking fees as they serve. He says he'll insist senior officials sign an agreement barring them from collecting speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist or any entity tied to a foreign government for five years after leaving office. Trump has criticized rival Hillary Clinton for the speaking fees she collected after leaving her position as secretary of state and called on her to release the transcripts.
