Milwaukee poverty a regional problem, Mayor Tom Barrett says

To Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the city's long fight against poverty isn't just a local problem — it's a regional one that needs a regional solution.

"You have politicians who say that it's a Milwaukee problem," Barrett said in the wake of new U.S. Census Bureau figures that show Milwaukee is among the nation's most impoverished big cities. "The problem is we have focused and concentrated the vast majority of low-income people in the city of Milwaukee and then we say it's a Milwaukee problem."

Nearly a third of the city's residents, including four in 10 children, lived in poverty in 2012, according to the census estimates released Thursday.

Those numbers — 29.9% overall, including 42.6% of children under 18 — were virtually unchanged from the 2011 numbers.

Milwaukee's poverty rate was in the top 15 among the nation's big cities with populations over 250,000. Detroit was the country's poorest city with a poverty rate of 42.3%.

William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, said the national figures in such areas as immigration, migration and fertility pointed to small yet significant signs of improvement in the overall economy.

Frey said that while the poverty numbers from the bureau's American Community Survey may not reflect well on Milwaukee, "if you put together the whole country it does show there is light at the end of the tunnel."

Barrett's message — that southeastern Wisconsin's poverty is concentrated in the city — is backed by the dramatic difference in the numbers for surrounding suburbs.

Seventy-one percent of those who lived in poverty in a four-county area lived in the city of Milwaukee in 2012. Poverty rates remained low in Washington (6.1%), Waukesha (5.9%) and Ozaukee (5.5%) counties.

And although Milwaukee County's poverty rate overall was 22.3%, the county's rate fell to 9.8% in the communities outside the city.

Overall, 13.2% of Wisconsinites lived in poverty in 2012, which wasn't statistically different from 2011.

For a family of four, the poverty threshold in 2012 was $23,492.

Barrett said there needs to be a regional effort to decrease poverty. In 1970, when industrial jobs were plentiful, the city's poverty rate stood at 11.2%.

But as de-industrialization occurred over the decades, poverty increased in the city.

Barrett said his administration is "trying to do everything we can" to bring jobs to the N. 30th St. Industrial Corridor, Reed Street Yards and the Menomonee Valley.

"We see places where we're making progress and we see places where we're losing homes and have a higher inventory of foreclosed properties," Barrett said. "We're fighting this fight on multiple fronts."

Growth in suburbs

Curtis Skinner, of the National Center for Children in Poverty, said a recent national phenomenon has been a growth in poverty in America's suburbs, which often opens a broader conversation on the subject.

But asked if Barrett might be able to trigger a regional conversation — and solution — on poverty, Skinner said it "becomes a little more complicated if he can't point to the fact that it's a growing problem in the suburbs, too, demanding a common solution."

Skinner said, though, there are concentrations of poverty in suburbs across the country, including southeastern Wisconsin.

Median household income in Wisconsin was $51,059, virtually matching the national figure.

But that doesn't begin to make up for the losses in the last decade or so. Since 2000, median income in Wisconsin has declined by 9.3%.

Residents of Ozaukee ($75,170) and Waukesha ($72,364) counties had the highest median incomes in the area.

The median income in Washington County was $64,221 and in Milwaukee County was $42,381.

Statewide, 10.4% of people had no health insurance, around the same as in 2011.

In the wake of the 2008-'09 Great Recession, the percentage of people with private health insurance in Wisconsin decreased from 74.1% in 2008 to 69.4% in 2012.

During the same period, public coverage increased from 15.9% to 20.3%.

Statewide, 27.1% of people over 25 had at least a bachelor's degree. Waukesha (39.7%) and Ozaukee (46.6%) counties had high rates of college attainment, while Washington (29.9%) and Milwaukee (28.4%) counties exceeded the state figure.
