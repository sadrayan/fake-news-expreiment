Race for the 23rd Congressional District
As House Speaker Paul Ryan prepares to host a fundraiser for Tom Reed, Reed's democratic challenger releases his second TV ad. This advertisement highlights John Plumb's 22-year career in the US Navy. Back in April when Congressman Tom Reed announced his endorsement for Donald Trump, Plumb said Trump is "weakening our national security just running for President," and that Reed's support for Trump proves that both Republicans are unfit to serve. Joining us from Buffalo to talk more about his campaign for the 23rd congressional district is Democrat John Plumb.
