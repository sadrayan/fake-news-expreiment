The cases are being recalled due to the risk of skin irritation, blisters or burns if the liquid contained in the phone case leaks and comes into contact with the skin due to breakage or cracking of the case.





The affected cases were sold on Amazon.com; GetMixBin.com; Henri Bendel stores and online at henribendel.com; Nordstrom Rack stores; Tory Burch stores; and at Victoriaâ€™s Secret stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and online at victoriassecret.com.
