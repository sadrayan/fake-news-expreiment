The U.S. Agency for International Development obligated contract funding for fiscal 2015 reached $4.8 billion — a $1 billion increase from its total in 2014. This 26 percent budget surge marks the first upward movement in USAID’s contract spending in the last three years.

Despite USAID’s focus on channeling more foreign aid to local organizations — most notably through the USAID Forward initiative — the agency continues to award the bulk of its contracts to American firms. In 2015, the top 20 recipients of USAID funding were all U.S.-based organizations. Combined, these transactions account for 70 percent of the total USAID spending for obligated contracts for the year, up slightly from 67 percent in 2014.
