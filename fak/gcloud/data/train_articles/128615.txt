'I prepared to be president,' Clinton tells Trump in debate zinger

After Donald Trump jabbed her for reports about her debate prep, Hillary Clinton hit Trump with one of the more memorable zingers from Monday night’s debate.

“I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. “And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that’s a good thing.”

The crowd, against moderator Lester Holt’s orders, broke into applause.
