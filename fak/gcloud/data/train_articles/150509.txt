Bestiality Ban Is ‘Legitimate,’ German Court Rules
MAINZ, Germany — A legal bid to overturn a law banning sex with animals was thrown out by Germany's constitutional court on Thursday.

The case was launched by a man and woman who "feel sexually attracted to animals," officials said.

However, the court ruled that the bestiality ban did not violate the individuals’ "right to sexual self-determination."

"The protection of the well-being of animals by guarding from unnatural sexual assaults is a legitimate goal,” the court said in its statement explaining the ruling.

Judges found the law, which outlaws sexual acts with animals or making them available to others for that purpose, was "proportionate."

Offenders face fines of up to 25,000 euros ($27,000).
