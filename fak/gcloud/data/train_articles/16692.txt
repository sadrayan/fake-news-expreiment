For a Texas fact-check, could you guide us on whether the term “illegal alien” appears in federal law? I have not spotted it.

My story is due Friday, meaning tomorrow.

I rely every time on attributable on-the-record information.

Thank you for what you do.

You can find instances of the term “illegal alien” in federal law. A few examples are: 8 USC 1252(c), 1365, and Section 204 and 332 of the Illegal Immigration and Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996.
