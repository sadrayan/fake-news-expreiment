Micho: We are fully aware that penalties are a lottery
Cape Town - Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic said his side "gave everything" in their Nedbank Cup clash against Black Leopards despite bowing out of the tournament on penalties.

The Sea Robbers took the lead through a magnificent free-kick from Justin Shonga in the first-half but the hosts leveled the tie when Mwape Musonda netted five minutes before half-time.

Pirates created the better chances after the interval but Leopards keeper King Ndlovu showed his resolve to keep his side in the game and force it to penalties.

The home side eventually won 5-4 after the visitors had missed two spot-kicks.

Sredojevic said after the game: "We are fully aware that penalties are a lottery and you never know what will happen, it can go either way.

"We tried out best throughout the game, from the start before conceding that goal against the run of play.

"Instead of taking the opponents to the counter-attack we conceded from the counter-attack. We paid from the silly mistakes we made later on."

Thembinkosi Lorch, Mako and Shonga had good chances to win the game in regulation time for Pirates but it was not to be.

Sredojevic continued: "We tried our best in regular and extra time to attack and create chances, throwing all available attacking players forward but it was not meant to be whilst trying our best.

"We went to penalties and had the advantage. This was the fourth time we had the advantage in penalties and we missed them.

"It's much more of a mental than football aspect, but it is very hard to accept especially knowing that we have given everything."
