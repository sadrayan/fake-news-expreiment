THESE WOMEN ARE LEADING THE ‘TRUMP-PENCE WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT TOUR’

Time

"Six women are currently leading the Trump-Pence female empowerment charge: Katrina Pierson, Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump, reality television star Omarosa Manigault, YouTube stars Diamond and Silk, and a vice-president at the Eric Trump foundation named Lynne Patton."

...

Lara Trump appealed to the crowd in Ohio saying, “We are not politicians, we are civilians. We really don’t have any idea what we’re doing, except we said, ‘We’ve got to go out and tell people what a great guy Donald Trump is.'”

In addition to appealing to women, the Trump-Pence Women Empowerment Tour is reaching out to women of color especially. Trump is the only one of the six women who isn’t a woman of color. She said, “If you look at the make-up of our tour, we have a very diverse group here, the majority of ladies are African-American. It speaks to who Donald Trump is, these are all women he’s touched in very different ways.”
