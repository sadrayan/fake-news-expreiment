What do Rick Scott and Playboy have in common?
The seemingly infinite paper trail detailing Rick Scott's business investments now leads to Quepasa, a Latino social networking website that partners with Playboy Mexico to find the Playmate of the Year.

Scott owned a 13.8 percent interest in Quepasa in April 2010, according to SEC filings, worth about $7.6 million. The company's connection to the adult magazine began in 2009 (after Scott was an investor) and the announcement was titled, "Playboy Mexico and Quespasa.com Get it On." They also helped pick the "Cyber Chica of the Month."

Expect more crazy Scott business connections in weeks to come. But amid all this mud slinging the question is: who cares? Scott's opponents are digging up new dirt on the GOP gubernatorial hopeful's investments every hour it seems, but will voters hold him accountable for every business he invests in? The answer is unknown but his rival Bill McCollum and Democrats will surely help educate voters. Buzz just can't wait to see Playboy Mexico appear in a campaign ad. How else could this campaign season get any crazier?
