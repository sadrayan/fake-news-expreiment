Springsteen Was Criticized For Bashing Trump. His Response Is Perfect
Bruce Springsteen doubled down on his remarks against Trump this week, following controversial comments he made in his interview withThe rock legend and American icon ripped into the Republican nominee, making it absolutely clear that Springsteen doesn’t care what Trump supporters think about his opinion on the candidate:

Originally, when asked what his thoughts on the Trump phenomenon were, Springsteen gave the following response:

Well, you know, the republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it’s a tragedy for our democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged, you’re pushing people beyond democratic governance. And it’s a very, very dangerous thing to do. Once you let those genies out of the bottle, they don’t go back in so easy, if they go back in at all. The ideas he’s moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas – white nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things that he’s done – not immediately disavowing David Duke? These are things that are obviously beyond the pale for any previous political candidate. It would sink your candidacy immediately.

I believe that there’s a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization that has occurred in the United States for the past 35, 40 years and how it’s deeply affected people’s lives and deeply hurt people to where they want someone who says they have a solution. And Trump’s thing is simple answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex problems. And that can be very appealing.
