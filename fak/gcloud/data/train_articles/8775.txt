STATEMENT OF U.S. SENATORS RUSS FEINGOLD AND JOHN MCCAIN

May 9, 2006

"The nation has witnessed over the past several months just how important it is for Congress to reform the ways in which we plan our water resources projects. While the Army Corps of Engineers has provided valuable services for our nation in the past, currently tens of millions of taxpayer dollars get spent on low priority or poorly designed Corps projects that have the support of certain powerful members of Congress. The Feingold-McCain Water Resources Planning and Modernization Act will help to identify the highest priority projects, so that taxpayer dollars can go where they are most needed.

"Congress must not turn a blind eye to the need for meaningful reform. Our bill is a sensible effort to make sorely needed and long overdue changes to the Army Corps to protect our communities, our environment and our budget bottom-line. Congress should incorporate these changes when it takes up legislation authorizing Army Corps projects in the Water Resources Development Act. It would be irresponsible to continue 'business as usual' in light of everything we've learned."
