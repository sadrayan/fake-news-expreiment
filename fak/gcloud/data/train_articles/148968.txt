HFF Announces Border Wall Ad Campaign

House Freedom Fund announced a new 30-second national television ad today supporting President Donald Trump’s fight to secure funding for the border security wall.

The new spot calls on Democrats in Washington to support wall funding and encourages Americans to make their voices heard by visiting BorderWallNow.com.

The national TV ad will be supported with local spots encouraging specific Democrats in key congressional districts to support the President’s plan. HFF aims to collect 1 million petitions and invest over $1 million into this important advocacy campaign.

TRANSCRIPT: “Border Wall Now”

Over and over again:

An Illegal Immigrant crosses the border and someone gets hurt

Including officers of the law.

President Trump is fighting to build a wall to keep us safe, and put America first.

But Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are standing in the way

Playing politics instead of protecting America

Tell them enough is enough: Border Wall Now!
