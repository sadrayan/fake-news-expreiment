SlutWalk Chicago 2013
In January, 2011, Toronto Police Officer Michael Sanguinetti made a stunning statement during a sexual assault seminar. “You know, I think we’re beating around the bush here,” said Sanguinetti. “I’ve been told I’m not supposed to say this, however, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.” (Digital Journal)

In April of that year Women in Toronto held the first SlutWalk. From that point on, SlutWalk turned into a global phenomenon. The protests and rallies are held internationally during the year. Women dress like sluts, wearing revealing attire, to protest excusing sexual assaults or explaining them on the basis of appearance.

"Historically, the term ‘slut’ has carried a predominantly negative connotation. Aimed at those who are sexually promiscuous, be it for work or pleasure, it has primarily been women who have suffered under the burden of this label. And whether dished out as a serious indictment of one’s character or merely as a flippant insult, the intent behind the word is always to wound, so we’re taking it back. “Slut” is being re-appropriated." (SlutWalk Toronto/2011)

SlutWalk Chicago was held Saturday in Daley Plaza. The event ran from at 2:00pm to 4:00pm. There were between 200 and three hundred people in Daley Plaza when the rally got under way started.
