Why is Rick Scott speaking at Americans for Prosperity event?
Let's say you're a sitting governor heading into an election where your only chance of winning a second term is to dramatically improve your standing among independent and swing voters. What would you do?

Well, you might suddenly start talking about the importance of throwing more money at public schools, maybe even start sympathizing with parents and teachers grumbling about too much emphasis on testing. Maybe then reverse course on opposing expanding Medicaid insurance coverage for more than a million Floridians, even if you do nothing to actually make that happen. You might also start touting your commitment to the environment and committ $90-million to help the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee.

Then, of course, you would jump at the opportunity to give the keynote address at an Americans for Prosprity conference. Huh?

Unless he's worried about his base or the lingering threat of a primary challenge, it baffles us that Scott - who couldn't find time to attend any of a three-day education summit he called himself - would find the time to speak at the AFP "Defending the American Dream Summit" Friday at Universal Florida. Maybe he hopes the Koch brothers, who founded AFP, will show some love to Scott's Let's Get to Work Committee.

Otherwise there seems to be little gain. As a speaker, Scott is highly unlikely to compare favorably to the others speaking during his Friday afternoon block - Marco Rubio, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, David Horowitz. And embracing group thundering about the Barack Obama destroying America won't do much to win over the Florida voters Scott needs most.
