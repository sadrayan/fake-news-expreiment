WEBVTT ♪♪ CLASSACT -- NI MIKE GOVERNOR JOHN THAIN, NICE TO HAVE A HERE. GUEST: THANK YOU. WE USUALLY SPEND A WEEK HERE. MIKE: WHY ARE YOU INVESTING TIME AND ENERGY IN WISCONSIN? GUEST: IN EVERY STATE. IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO WISCONSIN. EVERY STATE HAS THE SAME CONCERNS AND WE WOULD NOT BE DOING THIS IF WE DID NOT THINK WE COULD WIN THE RACE. MIKE: YOU ARE SERIOUS. YOU SAID AT THE RALLY IT IS A CRAZY ELECTION YEAR. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BE ELECTED? GUEST: I DO BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE POLARIZING AND AS A THIRD CHOICE , TO FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS SERVED TWO TERMS EACH AND HEAVILY DEMOCRAT STATES BY BEING PHYSICALLY -- FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE, YOU KNOW, WHAT DOES THAT ANIMAL LOOK LIKE? THAT ANIMAL IS SOMETHING I THINK AS GREAT APPEAL RIGHT NOW. MIKE: YOU NEED 15% IN THE MAJOR NATIONAL POLLS TO GET INTO THE DEBATE, ARE YOU RUNNING OUT OF TIME? GUEST: THE CLOCK KEEPS TICKING AND OF THE POLLS ARE RATCHETING UP AND WE AR JUST, ONE WEEK AGO, WE JUST STARTED SPENDING MONEY. WISCONSIN IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE WE ARE SPENDING MONEY ON ADVERTISING, SO MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT. I MEAN, IT IS CLOSED. MIKE IT AND YOUR NUMBERS SHOW YOU ABOUT 8%-10%. GUEST: ACTUALLY THE COMMISSION HA IDENTIFIED COLD - POLLS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT AT 10%. MIKE: YOU HIT ON SOMETHING I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT AND THE FACT WE HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY HIGH NEGATIVES CONNECTED TO DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON . GIVEN THAT COME ARE YOU SURPRISED YOU ARE NOT DOING BETTER SINCE HE REPRESENT A THIRD OPTION THAT ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE TWO MAJOR OPTIONS? GUEST: THE BIGGEST HURDLE RIGHT NOW IS THAT MY NAME IS NOT BEING INCLUDED IN ANY OF THE POLLS. IN OTHER WORDS, NOT ONE OF THEM IS BEING CONDUCTED NATIONALLY WHERE IT IS JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP, HILLARY CLINTON. IF THAT WERE THE CASE , TOMORROW I WOULD BE A 20%. AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH , G THERE IS A THIRD CHOICE. IT MAY BE ABOUT 50% OF THE POLLS CONDUCTED RIGHT NOW, I AM THE THIRD QUESTION ON THE LIST. AND THEN 99% OF THE MEDIA AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU ARE GUILTY, BUT YOU ARE GUILTY IN THAT YOU JUST REPORT THE TOP LINE. 70% OF AMERICANS DO NOT KNOW THERE IS A THIRD CHOICE IN THE RACE. IT SAID THAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS HIGH RISK AND HAVE REWARD -- AND HIGH REWARD. IF PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNEW THAT THERE WAS A THIRD CHOICE AND THE THIRD CHOICE WAS ENCOMPASSED -- TWO VERY SUCCESSFUL GOVERNORS THAT UNQUESTIONABLY MADE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR STATES. MIKE: FOR PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHERE THEY WANT TO LAND IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND FOR PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY CANNOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP CLUB BUT I THINK I AM A REPUBLICAN, WHAT DO YOU OFFER THEM? GUEST: HONESTY, KEEPING YOUR WORD. I THINK THE UNFORGIVABLE IN LIFE IS HYPOCRISY, SAYING ONE THING AND DOING ANOTHER. WE ARE NOT HYPOCRITES AND WE DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR STATES AND WE ALIGN PHILOSOPHICALLY WITH MOST AMERICANS. WE ARE SPEAKING BROADLY, BEING FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE, SMALL GOVERNMENT AND LOWER TAXES. SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE ALWAYS COMING DOWN ON THE SIDE OF YOU AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE CHOICES IN OUR OWN LIVES ALWAYS, AS LONG AS THOSE CHOICES DO NOT PUT OTHERS IN HARMS WAY. AND I THINK THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS ARE SKEPTICAL THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MILITARY INTERVENTION, THE WORLD IS ANYMORE SAFE AS THE RESULT OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS. WHEN WE INSTALLED -- AND WE INVOLVE OURSELVES IN REGIME CHANGE, IT HAS RESULTED IN THE SITUATION WE HAVE TODAY WERE THE ONLY CANDIDATES THAT DO BELIEVE IN FRE TRADE, BELIEVING IT WILL RESULT IN MORE U.S. JOBS, NOT LESS. AND THAT WE DO HAVE SOME ISSUES GLOBALLY, BUT WE NEED TO JOIN DIPLOMATICAL, SPECIFICALLY WITH RUSSIA TO DEAL WITH SYRIA. SPECIFICALLY WE NEED TO JOIN HANDS WITH CHINA TO DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA. MIKE: I WANT TO PICK UP ON THOSE POINTS. LET'S TALK ABOUT TRADE. YOU ARE IN A STATE WHERE PEOPLE BELIEVE TRUE FREE TRADE HAS NOTHING GOOD TO THE WISCONSIN WORKER, THE WISCONSIN WORKER HAS SUFFERED BECAUSE JOBS HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE COUNTRY. SO HAVE YOU SELL WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TO A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF FREE TRADE? GUEST: WHAT YOU JUST POINTED OUT WAS, MOST OF AMERICA ASSOCIATING CRONY CAPITALISM, GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE AND PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS, AND EQUATING CRONY CAPITALISM AND FREE TRADE AS ONE IN THE SAME WHEN IN FACT THEY ARE OPPOSITES. THAT IS AN INDICATION THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. FREE TRADE, DEVOID OF GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE AND GOVERNMENT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND THAT REALLY THE VERSION -- THE AD VERSION THAT WE HAVE TO THE TRADE AGREEMENTS IS THAT THEY ARE LACED WITH FAVORITISM. THAT INDIVIDUALS -- INDIVIDUAL GROUPS HAVE PAID FOR FAVORITISM, GIVING THEM MORE INFLUENCE AND MONEY AS OPPOSED TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. IT'S A FREE TRADE IS REALLY ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND WE GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY, WE THRIVE. THIS IS MORE U.S. JOBS, NOT LESS OF THEM. MIKE: IMMIGRATION, I THINK I SAW YOU AND THE GOVERNOR AT A FORUM WHERE YOU SAID WE ARE AS PRO-IMMIGRATION AS YOU CAN GET. IS THAT CORRECT? GUEST: YES. THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS CAME OUT WITH AN ANALYSIS OF IMMIGRATION. IF WE RESTRICT IMMIGRATION, IT WILL HAVE -- THAT CAME FROM THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, THAT IS THE ONLY MODERATE OF DONALD TRUMP, THAT SAI THAT A RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY ALLOWING FOR HIGH SKILLED WORKERS WOULD HAVE A SMALL POSITIVE IMPACT. BUT INCREASING IMMIGRATION WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY. SO I THINK WE SHOU EMBRACE IMMIGRATION IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ARE A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE SHOULD MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY AND WORK AND LET THEM BE ABLE TO GET A WORK VISA AND IT SHOULD ENTAIL A BACKGROUND CHECK AND A SOCIAL SECURITY CARD SO THAT APPLICABLE TAXES GET PAID. 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE IS A GREAT MISUNDERSTANDING ON WHY THAT EXISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY AND WORK, TO TA JOBS THAT U.S. CITIZENS DO NOT WANT AND BECAUSE THAT, IF YOU WERE IN THE SAME SITUATION, WE WOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING TO BENEFIT OUR FAMILIES. AND WORKERS COMING ACROSS THE BORDER FROM MEXICO, THE CREAM OF THE CROP WHEN IT COMES TO HARD-WORKING INDIVIDUALS. AND UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS GO BACK 20-3 YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY AND IF WE WERE GOING T DEPORT 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IT WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE. BUILDING A WALL ACROSS THE BORD IS CRAZY AND I AM SPEAKING AS A GORDON -- AS A BORDER GOVERNOR. MIKE: YOU SEEM GENUINELY OFFENDED BY SOME OF THIS FROM DONALD TRUMP. GUEST: I AM. AND IT IS OFFENSIVE. IT IS OFFENSIVE TO 48% . NEW MEXICO HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF THE HISPANIC POPULATION OF ANY STATE IN THE U.S. ABOUT 50% OF NEW MEXICO IS HISPANIC. HOW IS THE CRACKDOWN OF 11 MILLION UNDER COMMITTED WORKERS GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN NEW MEXICO. LITERALLY, WILL IT BE A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND IF YOU ARE HISPANIC WILL YOU NEED TO PROVIDE PAPERS? THAT IS HOW IT WILL HAVE TO WORK AND WILL HAVE TO BE DRAGGING FAMILIES THAT OWN HOMES FROM THOSE HOMES, ALL THE WAY BACK TO MEXICO WHERE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN FOR 30 YEARS. MIKE: I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION YOU GET SO OFTEN, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. THIS IS THE MARIJUANA QUESTION. YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU FAVOR THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA AND YOU SAY THAT YOU USE IT RECREATIONALLY. I SEE PEOPLE LIKE MITT ROMNEY, THE FORMER NOMINEE SAY THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER VOTING FOR THE LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE BUT THIS MARIJUANA THING JUST DOES NOT PLAY WELL WITH ME. GUEST: 60% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA. AND LEGALIZING MARIJUANA, WE HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN THE COUNTRY THAT ARE CONVICTED FELONS. BUT FOR THE DRUG LAWS THEY WOULD BE TAXPAYING LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ANY LESS LAW-ABIDING IN THIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. ROOTS OF THAT ARE IN THE DRUG WAR, THE WAR ON DRUGS. SO LET'S BRING AN END TO THE WAR ON DRUGS AND I THINK I LEGALIZING MARIJUANA THE WORLD WOULD BECOME A BETTER PLACE. ON THE MEDICINAL SIDE IT COMPETES WITH ILLEGAL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT KILL 30,000 PEOPLE A YEAR. AND NOT ONE DOCUMENTED DEATH FROM MARIJUANA. AND I OF -- AND I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT LEGALIZING MARIJUANA WOULD LEAD TO LESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE, BECAUSE IT IS SAFER THAN ANYTHIN ELSE OUT THERE, STARTING WITH ALCOHOL. THE CAMPAIGN LEGALIZE MARIJUANA IN COLORADO WAS BASED ON MARIJUANA IS SAFER THAN ALCOHOL. SO MITT ROMNE , IT IS 40% OF AMERICANS THAT WANT TO CRIMINALIZE THE USE OF MARIJUANA . AND FOR SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO NO USE MARIJUANA, FINE. THIS IS PERSONAL CHOICE. BUT FOR SOMEBODY WHO DECIDE THEY WANT TO USE MARIJUANA AND TO TAKE THE EDGE UP AT THE END OF THE DAY BY USING MARIJUANA AS OPPOSED TO ALCOHOL, WHY BEGRUDGE THEM THAT AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT DOING HARM TO OTHERS? GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR IMPAIRED, THAT IS WHERE GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE. MIKE: FOR YOU AT THI MOMENT IN THE CAMPAIGN, THIS IS ALL ABOUT GETTING INTO THE DEBATE, ISN'T IT? GUEST: THERE IS. THERE IS NO WAY TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY WITHOUT BEING IN THE DEBATE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST DEBATE WILL EXCEED THAT OF THE SUPER BOWL. YOU CANNOT WIN THE SUPER BOWL IF YOU'RE NOT IN IT. MIKE: THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO, GARY JOHNSON.
