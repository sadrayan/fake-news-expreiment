Evaluation Ratings & Effectiveness Levels Requirements:

Effectiveness levels are associated with Gross Salary levels and are an average of the two most recent evaluation ratings. For the first year of implementation a teacherâ€™s effectiveness level will be based on the first year evaluation rating only.

Progressing I: Requires completion of one year of service as a classroom teacher.

Progressing II: Requires completion of two years of service as a classroom teacher.

Proficient I: Requires completion of three years of service as a classroom teacher.

Proficient II & Above: Requires Distinguished Teacher Review.

Exemplary II: Requires at least one year as an Exemplary I teacher.

Master: Requires at least two consecutive years as Exemplary II and at least four years as a distinguished teacher in a Tier One school.

Teachers with two or more years of service who are new to the District or teachers who have reached their third year of service who are applying to DTR for the first time may earn an effectiveness level up to Exemplary I.
