I don’t think the projection that Austin will be at 3,858,800 by 2046 is too out there and think IHS Markit is a solid source.

The City of Austin Demographer (Ryan Robinson) has the 5-county region higher at 4,330,155 in 2045 (his end that year):

http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Demographics/austin_forecast_2017_annual_pub.pdf (linked from http://www.austintexas.gov/page/demographic-data).

The State of Texas Demographer has Austin MSA with 4,651,780 in 2046 assuming that migration continues at the pace set from 2000-2010. If you think that’s too aggressive a scenario to continue over that long time horizon, then they offer projections assuming growth at half the 2000-2010 rate. That would put Austin at 3,081,305 in 2046.

Ryan assumes the rate of growth decreases over time and I think offers a reasonable middle ground between the aggressive and conservative versions of the state projections.

When you’re otherwise asked about the region’s growth by 2046, what do you say and what factors do you cite as drivers? Any caveats?

I can’t say that I get many questions about the 30-year horizon. I’m not a demographer, but I don’t see something preventing Austin from maintain something like the 3% per year that has been its fairly long term average. We’re not landlocked. I suppose there are resource issues like water (and roadways?), but I don’t have any basis for claiming they put a particular ceiling on growth, easier to imagine they’d be managed.

Migration, as opposed to natural increase, is more of a driver here than just about any other major metro, so if that’s not sustained for any reason, then growth will slow.
