Thanks for the additional information.

Below is the text of my summary of the news stories highlighted in the list you shared.

At moment, it looks like ISIS or the Islamic State was mentioned in connection with two pre-New York attacks. It seems likely too that there could have been an ISIS connection to others, but again there are no explicit mentions.

Make sense?

Anything else play into Chairman McCaul’s claim?

Thanks again,

TEXT:

In March 2017, six people died after Khalid Masood drove a car into pedestrians on a sidewalk near London’s Westminster Bridge. A BBC news story said the so-called Islamic State said it was behind the attack.

The next month, a man drove a stolen truck into a Stockholm department store, killing four people. A BBC news account quoted Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, calling the incident a terror attack. It didn’t mention a particular group.

In June 2017, Khuram Butt, a British national, was believed to have led a trio of terrorists who used a van to plow into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing customers in pubs and bars, killing seven people. In 2016, the Telegraph newspaper reported, Butt had appeared in a documentary entitled “The Jihadis Next Door.”

The same month, a man drove a car into a police van on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. CNN reported that according to its affiliate, BFMTV, “the driver was under what is known as a ‘Fiche S’ file, a French terror/radicalization watch list composed of thousands of names, of which some are under active surveillance. Active surveillance means that they are on law enforcement's radar, not necessarily under rigorous surveillance,” CNN said.

In France in August 2017, a man injured six soldiers by driving into them at Place de Verdun, not far from the town hall in Levallois-Perret, which is home to France’s main intelligence agency. The Guardian newspaper reported that although French authorities remained cautious per the driver’s motives, “the incident appears to be the latest assault on France’s security forces.”

Less than two weeks later, a van plowed through crowds on the renowned Las Ramblas avenue, a popular tourist section of Barcelona, leaving 13 people dead, CNN reported, and Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, called it an act of "jihadi terrorism." CNN further said ISIS' media wing, Amaq, had said the perpetrators were "soldiers of the Islamic State" though ISIS hadn’t “explicitly claimed responsibility.”

The next day, police in the Spanish resort town of Cambrils, south of Barcelona, shot five people after they drove their car at pedestrians and police officers, Reuters reported.

In Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, was accused of running down a police officer with his car and then stabbing him repeatedly on the last Saturday of September 2017. According to a Reuters news story, police later said the driver fled before driving a U-Haul truck into four pedestrians during an attempt to evade capture. Reuters further said U.S. authorities had previously obtained a deportation order for Sharif, who instead had entered Canada and gained refugee status.

I am circling back because we heard back from an expert suggesting that some of the attacks cited by the chairman have no corroborated connection to ISIS.

Erin Miller, program manager for the Global Terrorism Database at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, emailed us that she’d reviewed the nine listed attacks. She said the consortium would not attribute any of the attacks to the Islamic State itself. She also said its post-June determinations were preliminary as officials have not done the data collection for these attacks yet.

A portion of her reply (her comments in bold):

3/22/2017 – London, United Kingdom – Westminster Bridge attack NO (no indication perpetrator was inspired by IS)

Please let me know if anything more figured into the representative’s claim? We hope to complete our review soon.

Based on the open-source information we provided, the Committee believes the 9 vehicular attacks the Chairman cited were either claimed by ISIS or the perpetrator was inspired by ISIS.
