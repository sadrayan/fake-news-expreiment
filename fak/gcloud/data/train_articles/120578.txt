CAUTION AGAINST FAKE KENYA 2019 POPULATION AND HOUSING CENSUS JOB ADVERTISEMENT
The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) would like to bring to the attention of the public that it has not placed any job advertisements for the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census, as is being purported through social media.

We wish to notify the public that all our recruitments are coordinated from our Human Resource Management and Development office in Nairobi. All KNBS job advertisements are done through the daily newspapers, uploaded on the website, www.knbs.or.ke, and a link sent to the official social media sites. Anytime you receive job advertisements purported to be from the Bureau, kindly verify such details from our official platforms.

The recruitment processes are free, fair and do not involve exchange of money or favors of any kind. Members of public are therefore advised NOT to send any money for employment.

The people behind the advert are fraudsters and conmen posing as employees of the Bureau for their selfish gains.

We caution the public to be wary of such individuals who purport to be recruiting on behalf of the Bureau.
