NFL fines Marshall $15,000 for orange cleats
The NFL fined Chicago Bears receiver Brandon Marshall $15,000 for wearing in Monday's win over the Cowboys cleats that violated the league's uniform policy, his second such infraction of the season.

Marshall wore orange cleats, which violated the league's rule that players must wear cleats the dominant base color of which are black or white.

Marshall on Tuesday implied he wore the cleats because he stood to gain from an endorsement opportunity.

"Oh, man, that's tough," Marshall said on WMVP-AM 1000 on Tuesday. "I don't even want to talk about the fine. Why do I do it? There's other opporutnities that come from it. Let's put it that way. I've been reading a lot about branding and marketing. So sometimes you've got to pay a little bit to get a little bit."

Marshall violated Rule 5, Section 4, Article 2(g) of the NFL rulebook, which states:

"Each team must designate a dominant base color for its shoes, either black or white (with shoelace color conforming to the dominant base color of the tongue area of the shoe)."

It also states:

"A player may wear an unapproved standard football shoe style as long as the player tapes over the entire shoe to conform to his teamâ€™s selected dominant base color (i.e., white or black)."

Marshall did not use tape.

The league fined Marshall $10,500 after he wore lime green cleats for the Bears' win over the Giants on Oct. 10. Lime green is the color of mental health awareness, of which Marshall is an advocate. He vowed to match that fine with a with a donation to a charity that helps people with mental illnesses resulting from cancer diagnoses.
