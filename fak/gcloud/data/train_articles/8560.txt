African Lion & Environmental Research Trust
Species Status Overview

Estimating African lion (Panthera leo) populations with any accuracy is difficult and involves many uncertainties. While the three main surveys to date all used different methods, it is widely accepted that lion populations in Africa are in serious decline, even in protected areas.

In 2015 the IUCN stated that “The Lion population is inferred to have undergone a reduction of approximately 42% over the past 21 years (approximately three Lion generations, 1993-2014)” and estimated that fewer than 20,000 lions remain.
