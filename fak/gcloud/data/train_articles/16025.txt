My note to RJ:

I have what I hope proves a quick follow-up query.

The 2018-19 budget includes $10,901.7 million in OTHER FUNDS for education. What are those other funds, specifically? Is any of the $10.9 billion from state revenue?

Gardner, see the attached and below. The total adds to a slightly higher amount than the $10.901.7 million in the GAA, because there are some appropriations from inter-agency contract dollars in the components that are subtracted when summarizing to avoid double-counting. Let me know if you need anything further. Wayne.

In Higher Ed, Other Funds include the following:

$1.8 billion in Available University Fund;

$380.2 million in various Other Funds at the Texas A&M System Agencies, including indirect cost recovery, fee revenue, appropriated receipts, and interagency contracts;

$101.0 million at the Health Related Institutions, including appropriations from the Permanent Health Fund and various Permanent Endowment Funds (tobacco funds);

$72.2 million in various funds at Coordinating Board, including student loan funds and other permanent funds;

$46.3 million in Available National Research University Fund;

$17.3 million in Permanent Fund Supporting Military and Veterans Exemptions; and

Total: $2,417.8 million. All these are state funds.
