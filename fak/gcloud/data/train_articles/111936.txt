What John Kasich Really Said About Women Coming ‘Out Of Their Kitchens’
During a rally in Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. on Monday, Ohio Gov. John Kasich recalled how there was a time when women “came out of their kitchens” to campaign for him.

Quickly, a highly misleading, a 22-second edited version of Kasich’s remarks began circulating, with the implication being that Kasich was an out-of-touch throwback who in his mind at least still consigned women to the kitchen. The edited clip included a woman in the audience later in the rally telling Kasich she would be supporting him but she wouldn’t be coming out of her kitchen to do it.

Soon, there was an onslaught of media reports noting Kasich had flubbed. MSNBC ran a slighting longer clip than the original and asked guests about how it might hurt Kasich in the race for the Republican nomination. Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton tweeted that in 2016, “a woman’s place is wherever she wants it to be.”

It’s 2016. A woman’s place is…wherever she wants it to be. https://t.co/lkXdirHlap — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 22, 2016

But here is what Kasich really said. The bolded section was left out of the edited clip:

“How did I get elected? ” Kasich says, referring to one his early campaigns. “Nobody was — I didn’t have anyone for me. We just got an army of people — and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and to put yard signs up for me all the way back when you know when things were different. Now you call homes and everybody is out working, but at that time, early days it was really an army of the women that really helped me to get elected.”

Kasich was first elected to the Ohio state Senate in 1978 and to Congress in 1982.
