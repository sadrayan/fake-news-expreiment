Another Military Commander Is Fired
Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, who oversees the nation’s arsenal of intercontinental missiles, was fired on Friday for personal misbehavior, the Air Force said, adding that the matter was not tied to readiness or security. On Wednesday, the deputy commander of United States Strategic Command, which oversees America’s nuclear arsenal and space operations, was removed in a gambling investigation. The Air Force did not say what General Carey did wrong but provided a list of things he was not being accused of, including sexual misconduct.
