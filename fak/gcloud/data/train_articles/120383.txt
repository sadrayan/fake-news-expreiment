Pence disappointed in Supreme Court ruling, will uphold law
INDIANAPOLIS â€” Indiana Gov. Mike Pence issued a statement saying he is disappointed in the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling giving same-sex couples the right to marry in any state.

Pence said Friday he believes marriage is the union between one man and one woman and that he was disappointed the Supreme Court failed to recognize the historic role of the states in setting marriage policy. But he says his administration will uphold the law and abide by the court ruling.

Pence says people are free to disagree with decisions of the Supreme Court, but are not free to disobey them. He says his administration will respect the law and the dignity and worth of every Hoosier and every Hoosier family.
