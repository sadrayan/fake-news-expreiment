Bears? Buffalo? Bull...?

There are many references on-line to a Texas law that prohibits you from shooting a buffalo from the second story of a hotel building in Texas. A google search pulls up plenty. None of them cite to any Texas statute. That’s cause it was never real. The LRL confirmed this in a story for National Geographic last year: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140117-weird-state-laws-nature-texas-science-bizarre-wild-west-united-states-geography/

The dildo thing is real. Or, it was real. The law is still on the books, but unenforceable to the degree that it restricts how many dildos you can purchase or possess. Here’s a good summary.

http://www.lonestarq.com/fact-check-dildos-really-illegal-texas/ (the case was Reliable Consultants, Inc. v. Earle, 517 F.3d 738 (5th Cir. Tex. 2008)

A law allowing citizens to carry guns in bars? Well… 46.035 prohibits a CHL holder from carrying on the premises of a business that has a TABC license and derives 51 percent or more of its income from the sale or service of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption. 46.035 (h-1) sets out the exceptions to that law, which includes judges, certain judicial officers, and prosecutors. Law enforcement officers aren’t CHLholders; they’re authorized to carry pretty much anywhere. But you don’t have to be a citizen to get a CHL.

Now, by guns does he mean “rifles?” ‘Cause we don’t have laws restricting carrying a rifle in a bar.

Gonna check out some crazy Florida laws real fast… get back to you in a second.
