Immigrant sentenced to 40 years in prison for drunken driving crash that killed family
A Guatemalan illegal immigrant recently received a 40-year prison sentence in Hart County Superior Court for a car crash in November that killed a Franklin County couple and their 5-year-old daughter.

Marco Hernandez Ramirez, 34, entered a guilty plea to three counts of first-degree vehicular homicide on Friday. Northern Circuit Superior Court Judge Jeffery Malcom then imposed a 43-year sentence with the first 40 years served in prison.

The plea was not negotiated, Northern Circuit District Attorney Parks White said Tuesday.

"It's a tragic case," said White, who went to the scene of the two-vehicle wreck on Nov. 28 in Hart County.

Killed were 48-year-old Jerry Russell Cannon, his wife, Kathryn Cannon, 32, and their daughter, Rose Marie Cannon.

Ramirez, who did not receive any life threatening injuries in the wreck, was transported to a hospital in Anderson, S.C., where a blood test showed his blood alcohol concentration was 0.27, White said.

Ramirez was previously deported from this country, but he returned illegally and obtained a job at a plant nursery in Hart County.

On the day of the crash, White said Ramirez consumed a six-pack of beer on his job, then left, obtained a 12-pack of beer, and returned to work, White said.

Over the protests of his co-workers, Ramirez then attempted to drive home in a company van, the prosecutor said.

On Georgia Highway 77, known as Lavonia Highway, he crossed the center line and slammed head on into a Toyota Camry killing the Cannon family, according to law enforcement reports.

"The scene was quite horrific," White said.

"We originally indicted him for felony murder on the belief the van was stolen," he said. "However, the owner of the van, later in a deposition, no longer maintained it was stolen, so we no longer could pursue the felony murder counts."

The Cannon family was buried in Burgess Cemetery in Lavonia.
