US Senate votes to spare Great Lakes program from cuts
For the second year in a row, the U.S. Senate has voted to restore Great Lakes funding slated for drastic cuts in President Trump's budget recommendation.

President Trump’s proposed budget sought to cut the Great Lakes Restoration initiative from $300 million to about $30 million.

“For months, Michigan residents have sent a clear signal that they do not support the Administration’s cuts to Great Lakes funding,” U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said in a press release. “Because of those voices, and our bipartisan efforts, we ensured that every penny of this funding was restored so that the work of protecting our Great Lakes can continue.”

The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative helps protect the lakes from invasive species and water contamination.

The Senate also passed legislation to update the EPA’s Lead and Copper rule.
