5-14-2015 Sex for sale; sex trafficking, harassment and stalking in State of the State RI
Guests: Tammy Duxbury, Coventry Town Councilwoman and Sherry Roberts, Represetative, Coventry/West Greenwich

Host: Rebecca Quigley Time: 30 minutes

Following an expose by Parker Gavigan of NBC 10 News concerning questionable illegal activity taking place at the Cascade Spa, Coventry residents alerted Councilwomen Duxbury, who took immediate action to notify town authorities of the complaints and concerns. This mobilized Coventry Town Council to enact an ordinance, as did Providence City Council, to prohibit and stop sex for sale activities. With genuine concern for the welfare of children, Representative Roberts, in association with other similarly minded legislators, has sponsored legislation to address sexual harassment and stalking; sex trafficking; and sex for sale.
