Trial To Begin In Target Stabbing Lawsuit Against “Hero” – CBS Pittsburgh
PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — On Monday, in a courtroom in downtown Pittsburgh, jury selection will take place in Target’s lawsuit against Michael Turner.

Three years ago, Turner and his friends jumped in when Leon Walls attacked a 16-year-old girl inside the East Liberty Target.

Turner told us what happened that day.

“I entered Target, went up the escalator, I make a right that’s when I encounter Walls in the store,” he said. “He grabbed the little girl. No, he didn’t stab her at that point he was talking you know, he was trying to get out of the store. Joby was saying ‘you’re not going anywhere until the police come’ and that’s when he started saying ‘ya’ll think I’m playing, ya’ll think I’m playing,’ and he stabbed at her the first time then he stabs her again!”

The girl, 16-year-old Allison Meadows, is from Tennessee. She was in town visiting family in Pittsburgh.

Turner and his friends got Walls away from her and held him down until police arrived.

Her father says Turner and his friends are heroes.

“We credit them for saving Allison’s life,” Glen Meadows said.

Though Turner was called a hero, Target is suing him.

Target’s position is that Turner and his friends had a violent encounter with Leon Walls on the street and they chased him into the store.

The Meadows family says they support Turner.

“I really don’t understand all the details as to why they are pursuing that angle, but we certainly hold these guys in the highest regard for what they did,” Glen Meadows said.

The Meadows family will travel to Pittsburgh this weekend so they can be in the courtroom for Monday’s trial.
