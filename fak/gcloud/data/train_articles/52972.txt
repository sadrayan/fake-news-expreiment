Food and Faith First-ever cut in state food tax passes in Tennessee!
PHP celebrates the victory of Tennesseans for Fair Taxation (TFT), a group we’ve been able to fund with gifts to the One Great Hour of Sharing.

The first-ever reduction of the state’s high food tax has now passed both houses and it headed to the Governor’s desk for his signature. As part of the budget bill that passed both chambers, the sales tax on food will be cut from 6 to 5.5%. While this is far less than TFT had asked for, it is a very positive first step that we can build as we move forward.
