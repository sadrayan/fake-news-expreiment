Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 - Title I: Provisions Relating to Savings in Health and Income Security Programs - Subtitle A: Medicare - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services from recognizing as reasonable payments for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services to the extent such costs exceed (by 110 percent for periods on or after October 1, 1984) the average of such costs for all hospitals in the same group for a comparable time period. Authorizes the Secretary to provide for exemptions from such limitation as appropriate. Exempts hospitals which: (1) are located outside of a standard metropolitan statistical area; and (2) have less than 50 beds.

Authorizes the Secretary to provide that payment with respect to services provided by a hospital in a State may be made in accordance with a hospital reimbursement control system in a State, rather than as provided under Medicare, if the State requests such treatment and if the Secretary: (1) determines that the system, if approved, will apply to substantially all nonfederal acute care hospitals in the State and to the review of at least 75 percent of all revenues or expenses in the State for inpatient hospital services and of revenues or expenses for inpatient hospital services provided under title XIX of the Act (Medicaid); (2) has been provided satisfactory assurances as to the equitable treatment under the system of all entities that pay hospitals for inpatient hospital services, of hospital employees, and of hospital patients; and (3) has been provided satisfactory assurances that under the system, over 36-month periods, the amount of payments made under such system will not exceed the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made not using such system.

Directs the Secretary to develop proposals for legislation which would provide for reimbursement on a prospective basis.

Provides that any determination of reasonable cost with respect to services provided by hospital-based skilled nursing facilities shall be made on the basis of a single standard based on the reasonableness of costs incurred by free standing skilled nursing facilities (SNF).

Authorizes the Secretary to take into account overhead costs associated with a physician providing hospital outpatient services in determining the limitation on the reasonable cost of outpatient services.

Prohibits reimbursement to health care providers for costs incurred which are directly related to influencing employees respecting proposed unionization.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine which services performed in hospitals and SNF's: (1) constitute professional medical services personally rendered to an individual patient which may be reimbursed as physicians' services under part B; and (2) constitute professional medical services rendered for the general benefit of hospital or SNF patients and may be reimbursed only on a reasonable cost basis. Directs the Secretary, for purposes of cost reimbursement, to recognize as a reasonable cost of a hospital or SNF only that portion of the costs attributable to services rendered by a physician in a hospital or SNF which are general benefit services as described above, apportioned on the basis of the amount of time actually spent by the physician rendering the services.

Prohibits, in the case of a provider paid on the basis of reasonable cost, the inclusion of costs determined on the basis of a percentage of the provider's charges. Excludes from such prohibition: (1) physician services constituting professional services rendered for the general benefit to patients in a hospital or SNF; and (2) any amount which is reasonable and where either to charge in such a manner is a customary commercial practice or it provides incentives for the efficient and economical operation of the provider of services.
