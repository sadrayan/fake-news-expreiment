Total fall enrollment in degree-granting postsecondary institutions, by control and level of institution: 1970 through 2012
—Not available.

1 Large increases are due to the addition of schools accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology.

2 Because of imputation techniques, data are not consistent with figures for other years.

NOTE: Data through 1995 are for institutions of higher education, while later data are for degree-granting institutions. Degree-granting institutions grant associate’s or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. The degree-granting classification is very similar to the earlier higher education classification, but it includes more 2-year colleges and excludes a few higher education institutions that did not grant degrees.
