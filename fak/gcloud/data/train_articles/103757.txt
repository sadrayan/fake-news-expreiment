Lady Gaga Hermaphrodite Rumors 'Ridiculous'
Lady Gaga's all woman.

That's what her manager's asserting after an up-skirt photo of the pop star sparked rumors that she's a hermaphrodite. The photo, taken from video shot at England's Glastonbury festival, reveals a bulge between Gaga's legs -- a bulge that could have been caused by undergarments, a bad angle, or, as some blogs would have you believe, a penis.

Bossip.com alleged that Gaga said this when asked about the subject:

"It's not something that I'm ashamed of, just isn't something that I go around telling everyone. Yes. I have both male and female genitalia, but I consider myself a female. It's just a little bit of a penis and really doesn't interfere much with my life. The reason I haven't talked about it is that it's not a big deal to me. Like come on. It's not like we all go around talking about our v***. I think this is a great opportunity to make other multiple gendered people feel more comfortable with their bodies. I'm sexy, I'm hot. I have both a **** and a p*****. Big f******g deal."

ABCNews.com asked Gaga's manager if the "Poker Face" singer is a hermaphrodite and if she said the above quote. His reply:

"This is completely ridiculous."

Gaga's sexuality has been the subject of intense speculation ever since she told Rolling Stone magazine that she considers herself bisexual, though her attraction to women is purely physical.

"I think I'm changing what people think is sexy," she told the magazine in May.

In June, she elaborated on the issue to USA Today, saying, "I don't think being gay or being bisexual or being sexually free is anything that should be hidden. Everybody has a right to their secrecy, of course, but I don't feel particularly shy about it. It is who I am. I sing very openly about it in my music, so I suppose I could say that I choose not to hide it in interviews because I don't care to hide it and, two, because it is very obvious in my music that I like women."

But apparently, that doesn't mean she's toting a disco stick of her own. Consider the Glastonbury festival photo a wardrobe malfunction, not a coming out.
