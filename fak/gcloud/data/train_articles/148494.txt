Malaysia National Day 2018
Today’s Doodle celebrates Malaysia’s Independence Day. Also known as Hari Kebangsaan or “National Day” it’s a commemoration of the moment in 1957 when Tunku Abdul Rahman, the first Chief Minister of Malaya, read the declaration of independence from Great Britain.

This year’s Hari Kebangsaan will be particularly exciting because, for the first time since 1957, Malaysian citizens recently elected a new government. When fireworks explode in the sky above this multicultural southeast Asian country this, proud Malaysian citizens will look forward to the future as they celebrate their nation and their flag, also known as Jalur Gemilang or “Stripes of Glory.”

Malaysia has had many flags over the years, many including the Malayan tiger seen in Today’s Google Doodle. The tiger is part of the national consciousness, representing strength and courage. Of the nine subspecies of tigers, the ones indigenous to Malaysia are slightly smaller, and live in the tropical forest. They are the subject of many Malay folklore. Some stories cast them as humans morphed into animal form: the were-tiger harimau jadian, for example, is a fabled guardian of palm plantations.

The Malaysian flag will be flown today at parades and in households where families celebrate over plates of Nasi Lemak, a fragrant rice dish cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf, Malaysia’s national dish. There are many reasons to celebrate this major holiday, which also coincides with lunar new year, and hari raya, the feast that concludes Ramadan.

Happy National Day Malaysia!
