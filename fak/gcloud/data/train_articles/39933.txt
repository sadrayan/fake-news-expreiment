Buttons Protesting Supreme Court Nominees

Buttons against Supreme Court nominees David Souter and Robert Bork. President George Bush nominated Souter who was confirmed in October of 1990. President Ronald Reagan nominated Bork in 1987, but after much partisan fighting he was voted down by the Senate. The Souter button contains an image of a clothes hanger, as a reference to his views on abortion. (Photo by David J. & Janice L. Frent/Corbis via Getty Images)
