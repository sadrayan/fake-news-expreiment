#ShareYourEars Photos Help Make Wishes Come True: Disney Donates U.S. $3M
Share Your Ears Transforms Lives

The Walt Disney Company celebrated its third year of Share Your Ears in support of Make-A-Wish® . This year, in celebration of Mickey Mouse's 90th Anniversary, Disney hosted two phases of the Share Your Ears campaign during the month of November. The heartfelt and engaging social campaign helped fans unlock U.S. $5 donations from Disney to Make-A-Wish through fun and simple consumer activations.



To the hundreds of thousands of Disney fans who took part in this year's #ShareYourEars campaign celebrating 90 Years of Mickey, thank you! Disney is donating U.S. $3 million to Make-A-Wish to help grant even more life-changing wishes for kids fighting critical illnesses!



Since 1980, Disney has helped Make-A-Wish grant more than 130,000 wishes — experiences that not only brighten lives for a special moment, but also help wish kids and their families replace fear with confidence, sadness with joy and anxiety with hope. This is all part of the Disney Team of Heroes commitment to deliver comfort and inspiration to families around the world.



We appreciate Disney and all our supporters for participating in this milestone year — Mickey's 90th — and making the impossible possible for kids, their families and communities around the world.
