Hit & Run Victim Says He Was Targeted Because Of Trump Bumper Sticker – CBS Boston
HYANNIS (CBS) – A driver rammed by a car believes he was targeted because he had a President Trump bumper sticker on his SUV. A woman from Taunton is facing charges.

“I could hear her screaming out of the car or something, so I thought man maybe something’s wrong with my car,” said the man who did not want to be identified. “I get out, all of a sudden I hear, ‘You’re racist,’ and a bunch of cuss words.”

Police say the attacker is 25-year-old Chloe Wright of Taunton.

The victim recorded the incident as she first allegedly drove into the back of his car, then clipped his door, missing him by inches. “Her tire was right next to my foot,” he said. “That could have ended really bad.”

The incident happened on North Street in Hyannis, but he says it started earlier when she was honking and yelling at him. “The first thing she said when I came out of the car was ‘Did you vote for Trump?’ and I was like, ‘Yeah, what of it.’ And that was pretty much what triggered this, it was like nonstop,” he said.

Wright gave police an address to a home in a trailer park, but residents say an elderly woman lives at the address and they’d never heard of the suspect. She’s been charged with Assault and Battery with a Dangerous Weapon.

As for the victim, he’s only left wondering one thing: “Was it really worth it for her?”
