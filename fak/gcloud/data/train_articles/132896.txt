Permanently Protect Dreamers, TPS Holders, and DED Recipients
The lives of hundreds of thousands of Dreamers, TPS holders, and DED recipients are at risk.

The Trump Administration has repealed DACA, and terminated six TPS designations and protection for Liberian DED recipients. Congress must do the right thing and pass permanent bipartisan protections for these immigrants who for years have been contributing to our communities and our economy.

On Tuesday, March 12, 2019, Congress introduced the Dream and Promise Act. This bill allows Dreamers, TPS holders, and DED recipients to contribute fully in the country they love and know to be their home by providing a pathway to legal residency. We need supporters like you to keep up the momentum and commit to call your member of Congress.

The United States is the only home many Dreamers, TPS holders, and DED recipients have ever known. Collectively, they work, pay taxes, own homes, and help the U.S. economy grow. But ending DACA and terminating TPS and DED designations for countries engulfed in war and chaos is not just bad for America’s economy — it could also put their lives and families at risk.

It’s up to Congress to make protections for Dreamers, TPS holders and DED recipients permanent.

Will you call your representative and ask them to support the Dream and Promise Act now?
