Patrick Murphy Campaign Releases New Ad: “Absent”
Rubio Campaigns on Vote He Skipped

Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. — Today, the Patrick Murphy for Senate campaign released a new ad titled “Absent.” This digital ad, highlighting a national security vote that Marco Rubio has been campaigning on despite the fact that he didn’t show up for it, will target voters across Florida.

“On the issues that matter to Florida, Marco Rubio has been consistently absent,” said Murphy Campaign Spokeswoman Galia Slayen. “When national security votes came before the Senate, Rubio missed them and when key foreign policy issues came before Senate committees, Rubio didn’t attend. Floridians deserve a Senator who stands up every day for their safety and security. Marco Rubio is not that Senator and it’s embarrassing that he is touting a bill that he didn’t even show up to vote for.”
