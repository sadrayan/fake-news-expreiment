New York City mayoral race results 2017
Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio campaigned in the final days with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – a sign he sees himself as a liberal champion. His campaign only came to life in the closing weeks, with the mayor on course to cruise to a second term. Republican Nicole Malliotakis, private investigator Bo Dietl and two candidates who lost the primary to de Blasio but found different lines to run on in the general election, Mike Tolkin and Sal Albanese, will split what will largely be protest votes against a de Blasio’s first term that included criminal justice reforms and universal pre-kindergarten.
