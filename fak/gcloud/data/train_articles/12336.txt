Bring Uber to New York State
Tell them all you want for Christmas is Uber.

New York is one of the last places in the country without Uber. Some call it prehistoric. Others call it embarrassing.



Last week, Governor Cuomo came out in support of ridesharing and called on the Legislature to make it happen this year.



But your Legislator needs to hear from you.

Call 1-866-823-1772 and tell your Legislator that all you want for Christmas is Uber.

NY Needs Uber Coalition

We are a coalition of New Yorkers who want to see Albany leaders embrace new technology that will build on the Empire State's economic revitalization. We support ridesharing services like Uber which has the potential to create 13,000 jobs in one year and make our communities safer by reducing drunk driving incidents.

Across the United States and in New York City, Uber offers riders the ability to find a safe, affordable way to get around their communities and drivers the opportunity to earn income on their own schedule - but right now New Yorkers outside of NYC are missing out.

For far too long, New Yorkers — especially in communities Upstate — have seen jobs leave the state rather than be created right here. But New York State’s economy is finally turning around thanks to investment in innovators. Uber can help continue that revitalization by creating 13,000 jobs in New York State in the first year of operating alone.

Uber can also make New York a safer place to live by reducing drunk driving throughout the State. A recent, independent study conducted by Temple University found that cities where Uber operates have 3.6%-5.6% fewer drunk driving deaths than cities without access to ridesharing.
