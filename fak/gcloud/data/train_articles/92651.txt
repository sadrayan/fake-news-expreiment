Race to the Top winds down in Florida
As the federal Race to the Top grant enters its end game, state recipients from the first two phases -- including Florida -- are releasing executive summaries detailing what they accomplished with their money.

Florida's report on its $700 million award details that at least one school in every participating school district added a STEM career academy. The state adopted new academic standards, implemented new teacher evaluations and experienced steadily increasing graduation rates, according to the document.

School districts also are reporting their outcomes as part of the process.

In a presentation to the Pasco County School Board, administrators point out that the district used all but $125 of its $8,629,979.30 grant. About 62 percent of the amount went to salaries and benefits, in support of efforts such as increased STEM courses and performance pay in low-performing schools.

Overall, the money wasn't close to the total needed to get done the required work, supervisor of federal programs Tammy Rabon told the board. But since the state was mandating much of the change in law, Rabon added, "We figured why not get some of the funds to do it?"

Some of the expenses have been ongoing. But the district has absorbed most of those into its general fund, superintendent Kurt Browning said, so the initiatives can continue without reliance on federal support.

The state indicated similar progress.

"Because several RTTT components are already in law, and additional projects are in the State Board of Education 2015-16 Legislative Budget Request, we have made the necessary strides to begin sustaining the work accomplished during the grant," its summary states in the Next Steps section.
