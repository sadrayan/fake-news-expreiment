Source: Bill White campaign With the disclosure, White pressed GOP Gov. Rick Perry to publicly debate issues. Perry's campaign repeatedly has urged White to release his tax returns and has said Perry would wait to discuss debate dates until he did so. “Governor Perry seeks to avoid accountability to the public, and his handlers don't want him to appear in an unscripted format. He'll find any excuse not to debate,” White said Tuesday. White previously had released his 2009 return and said he released the 2004 to 2008 returns to “call his (Perry's) bluff.” Perry on Tuesday did not commit to a debate. Instead, Perry campaign spokesman Mark Miner called on White to release tax returns from his time as deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration in the early 1990s — a request he has made before — and during his subsequent stint as chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. As he has for months, Miner also raised questions about White's business dealings. “This partial release of some tax returns creates further questions about how Bill White profited while serving Houston as a part-time mayor,” Miner said, citing work by BTEC Turbines, which provided mobile power generators under contract to the Coastal Water Authority to help preserve the water supply after Hurricane Rita. Miner said that White “must explain the details of BTEC's involvement with efforts concerning Hurricane Rita, considering he was a board member of the company before being elected mayor and that he personally made more than $500,000 from the company just over one year after it participated in Hurricane Rita efforts.” Jab at Perry travels White had served on BTEC's board before becoming mayor. He said he enlisted its help as he did other companies in the wake of the hurricane, when he had no interest in the company; then invested in the company in December 2006. He reported $524,582 in income from the company in 2007. White scoffed at the description of his service as part-time, jabbing back with a reference to Perry's travels, which have included a 2006 Grand Cayman vacation and a 2004 trip to the Bahamas with campaign donors that the governor's office said was to discuss education. “I didn't go jaunting around to the Caribbean,” White said. “I was doing my job.” White, a lawyer who forged a career in the energy business, initially had refused to release all his tax returns from his time as mayor, dating back to 2004, when asked to do so by the Houston Chronicle. At first, he released only his 2009 return since that covered his time running for statewide office. “It was long overdue,” said Andrew Wheat, research director for Texans for Public Justice, an Austin-based organization that monitors government ethics. “I don't see what was to be gained by waiting. It seems like PR mistake 101 to me.” Perry filed 2009 extension Perry has not released his 2009 return — Miner said the governor had asked for a filing extension — but has released other returns going back to 1987. White's camp noted that Perry keeps most of his assets in a blind trust, so the details on his returns are limited. Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle said the value of Perry's blind trust as of August 2009 was about $896,000. Asked about Miner's call for additional tax returns, White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said, “Next, he'll ask for Bill's tax returns from when he ran concession stands in San Antonio as a teenager.” In a telephone interview, White said, “Part of this is an attempt by a career politician to hide his lack of business management experience. Part of it is an excuse to avoid the public accountability of a debate where he can't be scripted. And part of it is probably a smokescreen to deflect questions about his own financial disclosures.” Mayoral years totaled According to a summary compiled by his campaign during his time at City Hall, White's income included his salary as mayor, which ranged from $149,185 to $161,864 annually, for a total of $929,570. He also reported $119,322 to $303,462 annually in cash payments and stock awards, or a total of nearly $1.5 million, for service on the board of oil field company BJ Services. White's tax returns also show a total of $3.5 million in capital gains over the six years from stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other investments, a large part of which he said came from the sale of stock in three public companies in which White had acquired stock and on whose boards he had served prior to 2004: Pioneer Drilling, Chicago Bridge and Iron and Frontera Resources. That figure includes a $105,509 loss in 2009. He also showed a nearly $3.4 million payment in 2005 that he said stemmed from his work before 2004 for the WEDGE Group, based on the realized value of gains from investments he had managed. He said that primarily involved the sale of WEDGE's interest in San Antonio-based Pioneer Drilling Co. Among other income, White showed a total of $568,000 for investment consulting services from a Florida doctor he describes as a friend. He said the services largely were performed before 2004. Bacon said White donated the money to the Greater Houston Community Foundation. Chronicle reporters Joe Holley and R.G. Ratcliffe contributed to this story. pfikac@express-news.net
