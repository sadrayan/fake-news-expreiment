The PowerPuff Girls Movie Poster by GeekTruth64
So, after completing my Power Rangers movie poster trilogy. I was trying to figure out what to do next. I had been working on this previously, so I decided to go back and finish it.



The idea for this was that the movie takes place 15 years after the girls came into existence. The girls are trying to find their way in a world that they no longer have a purpose in. They defeated all of their primary villains as kids, then soon realize the reason they were born is no longer present. They still live in their home Townsville, but for the most part they have decided on different paths.



Blossom has forgone college and gone to work for a local company, now quickly moving up the ranks toward CEO. A fallout with Professor Utonium has resulted in a rift that not only split her and her sudo-father, but also her sisters.



Bubbles is in college, but is more interested in partying than learning. She believes life learning is far superior to book learning and has developed an interesting outlook on people and life. Surprisingly intelligent, she sees things with an unconventional perspective.



Buttercup works at a local fast food place. Often flipping out on costumers and employees alike, but keeps her job due to the fact that the manager has a crush on her. Even though all of the supervillans have been either defeated or dissapeared from Townsville, thugs and criminals are still around. She spends most of her free time seeking out these criminals and taking them down.



A returning villain will soon force this disgruntled family back together again...



I really like the choices I made for the cast.

Blossom---------------- Emma Stone

Bubbles----------------- Emma Watson

Buttercup--------------- Ellen Page

Professor Utonium----- Zachary Quinto

Former Mayor---------- Christopher Lee

Sera Bellum------------ Christina Hendricks
