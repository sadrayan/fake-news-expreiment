I have not seen the quote from Gov. Perry so I can't vouch for the accuracy of your depiction of the quote.

If the field of prospects is limited to what Gov. Perry would plausibly consider to be the Republican top tier, meaning those who poll at his level or higher, then his statement is demonstrably true. None of the Republican candidates that are currently running ahead of Perry in the polls has served in uniform.

If the field of prospects is expanded to include every person who has expressed an interest in running for president, then of course some of that vast multitude have served in uniform.

Professor Feaver:

I am hopeful you can help us on a fact check due today. At issue: Gov. Perry’s statement that in the field of presidential prospects, he’s the sole hopeful to have worn the uniform.

Our own check of biographical information for possible aspirants showed Lindsey Graham to be former Air Force; Jim Gilmore formerly an Army counterintelligence officer, John Bolton once in the National Guard -- and Democrat James Webb as a former Marine.

I’d be happy to do an interview by phone if that’s easiest. My number is below.

Cheers,
