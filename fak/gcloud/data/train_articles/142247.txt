(19:10) Justice Ministry: WTC bomber was never held in Israel

By Arieh O'Sullivan



There is no connection between the Mohammed Atta who kidnapped a passenger jet and flew it into the World Trade Center and a Palestinian of a similar name who was once extradited to Israel for blowing up a bus in the West Bank, the Justice Ministry announced today.



The report has been appearing on the so-called Internet rumor mill.



A Justice Ministry spokeswoman said terrorist pilot Mohammed Atta was never in Israeli custody.



The report is apparently based on the fact that, in 1990, the United States did extradite someone called Mahmoud Abed Atta to Israel to stand trial for an April 1986 machine gun attack on an Egged bus in Samaria which killed the driver.



Justice Ministry officials said he was eventually freed after the Supreme Court ruled there were faults in the extradition process. His whereabouts today are not known.



That man, a Palestinian born in Ramallah, was 36 years old at the time and would be 47 today. The terrorist pilot the FBI identified as Mohammed Atta was just 33 years old and an Egyptian.



"It's not the same person. It's obviously two different men with similar names," the spokeswoman said.
