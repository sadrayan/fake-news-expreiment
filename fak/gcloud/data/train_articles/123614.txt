According to the Daily Mail, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick made a $25,000 donation to a group honoring Joanne Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army who goes by the name Assata Shakur and was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1973 murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster.

Trooper Werner Foerster was shot and killed with his own service weapon after backing up another trooper who had stopped a vehicle containing two men and a woman on the New Jersey Turnpike, according to ODMP.

The subjects started struggling with the troopers and were able to disarm Trooper Foerster. One of the men opened fire, killing Trooper Foerster and wounding the other trooper. Despite the wounds, the other trooper was able to return fire and kill the subject.

Chesimard was sentenced to life in prison, but escaped prison in 1979 and fled to Cuba, where she now lives as a fugitive from justice.

Kaepernick reportedly made the donation to the Chicago-based organization—Assata's Daughters—as part of his pledge to "donate $100,000 a month for 10 months to 'organizations working in oppressed communities,'" the Daily Mail reported.

Kaepernick specified that some of the donation be given to Cop Watch, a group that encourages individuals to follow and videotape police officers performing their jobs.

The Black Liberation Army was responsible for the murders of more than 10 police officers around the country, according to ODMP.

Chesimard remains on the FBI's Most Wanted list.
