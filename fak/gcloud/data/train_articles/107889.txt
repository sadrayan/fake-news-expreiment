W Call Letters in the United States
K/W Call Letters in the United States



Thomas H. White -- January 1, 2018



Background



Reasons For The Exceptions

Stations located east of the Mississippi which were assigned calls from the KD-- ship block, instead of W--, during a June 1920 to April 1921 anomaly. (For some reason, during this anomaly almost all new land stations, east and west, got KU-- or KD-- four-letter calls. This included two broadcasting stations that just happened to be first licenced during this time: KDKA and KDPM).



Stations west of the Mississippi River that were licenced before the late January 1923 boundary shift, and were located in the slice of W territory that existed west of the Mississippi prior to the shift. (Originally about 170 stations, not including Minnesota and Louisiana. However, due to very high deletion rates plus later call changes, only eleven of these original calls survive: WEW, WHB, WKY, WOC, WOI, WBAP, WDAY, WJAG, WNAX, WOAI, and WTAW).



Portable stations (prior to 1928), which got W call letters because their original owners were located east of the Mississippi, but settled in a permanent home west of the Mississippi. (Four stations: WBBZ, WIBW, WLBN, and WMBH. There are no examples of a portable crossing in the other direction, i.e. no K portables "anchoring" in W territory).



Regular stations that changed their community of licence to the other side of the K/W divide. (Seven stations: KFKX, KSGM, KWEM, WKBB, WPLX, KOTC and KQQZ. NOTE: This omits Louisiana and Minnesota.)



Owner requests--examples: WACO in Waco, Texas; WDBQ in Dubuque, Iowa; WMT (Waterloo [Iowa] Morning Tribune).



Assigned by the Government--three stations. KTGG in Spring Arbor (later Okemos), Michigan reportedly got a "K" callsign because someone at the FCC thought that the "MI" postal code stood for Missouri, a west-of-the-Mississippi state. Also, two additional call assignments appear to have been selected by government regulators: KYWA Chicago, a booster station for KYW, and KOP, licenced to the Detroit Police Department.

29 Current AM-band K/W Boundary Exceptions (excluding LA & MN)

Purple: 1920-1921 anomaly--KDKA. Blue: pre-January 1923 boundary shift--WBAP, WDAY, WEW, WHB, WJAG, WKY, WNAX, WOAI, WOC, WOI, WTAW. Gray: ex-portable--WBBZ, WIBW, WMBH. Dark Green: moved to other side of the Mississippi-- KSGM, KQQZ. Red: requested call--KFNS, KWAM, WDBQ, WHO, WMT, WSUI, KFTK, WGUE. Light Green: government assigned call--KTGG. Black: reason unknown--KFIZ, KQV, KYW.

This map summarizes the current location of W and K stations on the AM band, by state. Yellow highlights the sixteen states mostly in the center of the country which currently have both K and W stations. In the west, in red, are the twelve states (including Hawaii), which have only had stations starting with K. Green designates the single state--Alaska--which had a W station in the past, but now has K stations exclusively. Light blue marks the two states--Mississippi and Ohio--which once had one or more K stations, but now exclusively have W stations. Finally, dark blue marks the nineteen eastern states which have only had W calls.
