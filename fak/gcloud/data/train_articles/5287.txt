Kuwait rejects rumors on travel ban for Iranians
In a statement issued on Saturday, the Embassy of Kuwait stressed that the news are completely baseless and the country has not made any decisions on barring the nationals of the five countries including the friendly country of Iran from entering Kuwait.

Kuwaiti charge d'Affaires to Tehran underscored that various nationalities among whom the nationals of friendly country of Iran are currently residing in Kuwait with their families in full security and prosperity and enjoy all civil rights.

He went on to add that the relatives of Iranian residents in Kuwait can visit the country without any problem after receiving their visas.

The rumors come in the wake of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, barring people from seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iran from entering the US. The measure has caused massive public protests across the country and the world due to its blatant discriminatory and xenophobic nature.
