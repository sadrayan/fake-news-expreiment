Patrick Murphy Condemns Marco Rubio’s Comments on Zika and Abortion
Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. — Yesterday, Marco Rubio stated that a woman does not have the right to an abortion, even if she is infected with the Zika virus and has reason to believe her baby will be born with severe microcephaly. Rubio’s comments come on the one year anniversary of his opposition to a woman’s right to choose in cases of rape and incest.

“Zika is most dangerous for women who are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant, yet Marco Rubio still opposes a woman’s right to make her own health decisions,” said Rep. Murphy. “Florida women need a fighter who will stand up for their right to choose and who is committed to getting our state the critical funding needed to fight this virus. It’s clear that Marco Rubio will always put his ideology above women’s health care — and our families deserve better.”
