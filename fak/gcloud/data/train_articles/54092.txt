IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOISEASTERN DIVISIONBACKPAGE.COM, LLC,No. ___________________

Plaintiff,

v.

THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County,

Illinois,

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE

AND DECLARATORY RELIEF ANDDAMAGES

Defendants.

For its complaint, Plaintiff Backpage.com, LLC (Backpage.com) alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION1.

This is an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1988, and the Declaratory

Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201, to enjoin, declare unlawful and recover damages for the actions

of Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart (Sheriff Dart) demanding that credit card associations

sever business relationships with Backpage.com, LLC and discontinue allowing use of their

cards for purchases on the Backpage.com website, thereby effecting an informal extralegal prior

restraint of speech without due process in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and

the Communications Decency Act (CDA), 47 U.S.C. 230.

2.

For over six years, Sheriff Dart has pursued a campaign against online classified

advertising websitesfirst Craigslist and then Backpage.comdemanding they shut down

portions of their sites for adult-oriented ads posted by users. At every turn, Sheriff Dart has beenstymied by the Constitution, federal law, and court decisions holding that such ads are protectedspeech and that websites are immune from state-law civil or criminal liability.

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 2 of 22 PageID #:2

3.

In 2009, Sheriff Dart sued Craigslist, alleging the website was a public nuisance

and facilitated prostitution, but this Court summarily dismissed the action. Dart v. Craigslist,

Inc., 665 F. Supp. 2d 961 (N.D. Ill. 2009). When, in 2010, Craigslist caved in to quasi-official

pressure and removed its adult services category, Sheriff Dart shifted his focus to

Backpage.com, threatening criminal investigations and prosecution unless it also eliminated its

adult category and escort ads on the site. Consistent with Backpage.coms longstanding efforts

to preclude improper ads and assist law enforcement, it sought to work with Sheriff Darts office

on screening and security measures, including requiring the use of credit cards for adult ads,

which Sheriff Dart requested at the time and Backpage.com has long done. But Backpage.com

refused to capitulate to the Sheriffs demands for censorship.

4.

Sheriff Dart has acknowledged that cases interpreting federal law preclude his

efforts to censor Backpage.com, but decries the law as antiquated, nonsensical, and an

absurdity. Thus, he decided to go out-of-the-box by disregarding the law and instead

pressuring credit card companiesAmerican Express, Visa and MasterCardto cut off use of

their cards for purchases on Backpage.com, with the aim of eliminating the websites ability to

do business altogether. Because of Sheriff Darts officious demand that the card companies

defund and cease and desist dealings with Backpage.com, Visa and MasterCard blocked use

of their cards for any and all purchases on the website. American Express did the same for

purchases in the adult category.

5.

Sheriff Darts actions are an unconstitutional prior restraint of speech without

legal authority or due process. See Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58 (1963).

The

First Amendment precludes a government official from banning a forum of speech simply

because he dislikes it. Prior restraints are presumptively unconstitutional and can be imposed

-2-

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 3 of 22 PageID #:3

only in the most exigent of circumstances, requiring the least restrictive means to further a

compelling state interest and requisite procedural safeguards. Sheriff Darts actions do not come

close to passing constitutional muster.

6.

Sheriff Darts actions to cripple Backpage.com and all speech through the site are

an especially pernicious form of prior restraint. He has achieved his purpose through false

accusations, innuendo, and coercion, whereas, if he had brought suit directly or Cook County had

attempted to pass a law to shut down the website, Backpage.com would have had a fair

opportunity to respond and defeat such efforts, given well-established law.

Backpage.com

received no notice or opportunity to be heard before card services were terminated. Moreover,

Sheriff Darts actions have not only infringed Backpage.coms rights to publish and distribute

speech, but the rights of millions of the websites users to post and receive protected speech.

7.

Accordingly, in this action, Backpage.com seeks declaratory and injunctive relief

and damages, including a declaration that Sheriff Darts actions are unlawful and

unconstitutional; an injunction requiring him to cease such actions and retract his letters to the

credit card associations; a preliminary injunction returning the parties to the status quo before the

credit card companies precipitously terminated services; damages to compensate Backpage.com

for loss of revenues and goodwill and infringement of its constitutional rights; and punitive

damages to provide punishment and as deterrence for Sheriff Darts intentional conduct

recklessly indifferent to protected rights.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

A. Background Regarding Backpage.com.

16.

Backpage.com

is

an

online

classified

advertising

service,

located

at

www.backpage.com, which began providing service in 2004.

17.

Backpage.com is available to users throughout the United States and is organized

geographically by states and municipalities. Thus, in Illinois for example, users can post and

review ads for Bloomington, Carbondale, Chambana, Chicago, Decatur, La Salle County,

Mattoon, Peoria, Rockford, Springfield, and/or Western Illinois.

18.

Users of Backpage.com may post and review ads in a number of categories (e.g.,

local places, community, buy/sell/trade, automotive, musician, rentals, real estate, jobs, dating,

adult and services) and subcategories.

Users post over six million ads every month.

Backpage.com is the second-largest classified ad website in the United States, after Craigslist.

19.

Users provide all the content for ads they post on Backpage.com using an

automated interface. Backpage.com does not dictate or require any content, although it does

block and remove user-supplied content (discussed below).

20.

Users may post individual ads for free in most categories, although up to July 6,

2015, Backpage.com charged for certain ads and services. For example, Backpage.com charged

$5-$17 for users to post in the adult category and $1 for dating ads, with charges payable by

major credit or debit cards. These charges discouraged abusive posting and provided data to help

track users engaged in illegal activities. Indeed, law enforcement officials, including Sheriff

-5-

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 6 of 22 PageID #:6

Dart, have urged that classified ad websites such as Backpage.com should require payment by

credit cards because of the user information this provides.

21.

For ads of all types, until July 6, 2015, Backpage.com also charged users for ads

posted nationally or in multiple markets, and for more prominent or repeat-ad placement.

22.

The three major credit card companiesAmerican Express, Visa and

MasterCardallowed use of their cards on Backpage.com and permitted banks to provide

merchant services to the company for eleven years, from 2004-2015.23.

Backpage.com prohibits illegal content and activity on its website and takes

extensive steps to prevent such misuse, especially to guard against any form of human trafficking

or child exploitation. For example, Backpage.coms Terms of Use prohibit any ads for illegal

services

or

posting

any

material

that

exploits

minors

in

any

way.

http://chicago.backpage.com/classifieds/TermsOfUse. Before users can post or view ads in the

adult category, they must affirm they are at least eighteen years old and accept the sites PostingRules, which mirror the prohibitions of the Terms of Use and also state that any suspected childexploitation will be reported for law enforcement investigation. In addition, every ad on thewebsite contains a link for users to report if they believe the ad may be improper, emphasizingthat concerns about any possible threat to a child should also be reported toabuse@backpage.com.24.

Links are also provided at many places on the site to the Cybertipline of the

National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and a User Safety page

addressing the issue of human trafficking. In addition, Backpage.com prominently features an ad

from a national support and rescue organization, Children of the Night (Want Out? National

Free Help 24/7: 1-800-551-1300. Tired of Turning tricks? Pimps Dont Care. We Do!).

-6-

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 7 of 22 PageID #:7

25.

Backpage.com also takes extensive measures to police user posts. This multi-

tiered system includes automated filtering and two levels of manual review by over 100

personnel. The filter scans for more than 100,000 terms, phrases, URLs and email and IP

addresses. The first manual review assesses ads in the adult and dating categories before they

are allowed to appear on the site, and the second level examines nearly every such ad after

posting, as a double-check for potentially improper content. Through its review processes,

Backpage.com blocks or removes over a million ads per month and immediately reports any ad

that may concern child exploitation to NCMEC (approximately 300 per month).

26.

Backpage.com regularly works with local, state and federal law enforcement

officials in connection with investigations and prosecutions, including responding to subpoenas

and other information requests (most within 24 hours), providing training to law enforcementofficials, and removing and blocking posts at their request. In some instances, Backpage.compersonnel conduct additional Internet research to provide law enforcement further information toassist in rescuing victims and arresting and prosecuting criminals. Law enforcement officialsoften commend Backpage.com for its support and cooperation, and that includes praise fromCook County officials.B. Sheriff Darts Crusade Against Online Adult-Oriented Advertising.27.

On information and belief, Sheriff Dart began contacting Craigslist in 2007

objecting to its erotic services category, which at the time allowed users to post adult-oriented

ads. In March 2009, Sheriff Dart filed a civil action in this Court against Craigslist, Dart v.

Craigslist, Inc., No. 09 C 1385 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 5, 2009), claiming the erotic services section

constituted a public nuisance and seeking an injunction to force Craigslist to eliminate adultoriented ads. The Court dismissed the suit under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). It held that Craigslist

-7-

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 8 of 22 PageID #:8

was immune from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), 47

U.S.C. 230, which provides that online services cannot be treated as the publisher or speaker

of any information provided by another information content provider, id. 230(c)(1), i.e., users

who post ads on Craigslist. Dart v. Craigslist, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 961. As the Court stated,

online services do not cause postings except in the sense of providing a place where people

can post, they are not culpable for aiding and abetting their customers who misuse their

services to commit unlawful acts, and having an adult services category is not unlawful in

itself nor does it necessarily call for unlawful content.

Id. at 966, 968-69.

The Court

concluded:

Sheriff Dart may continue to use Craigslists website to identify and pursue

individuals who post allegedly unlawful content. But he cannot sue Craigslist for

their conduct.

Id. at 969 (internal citations and footnote omitted).

C. After Craigslist Succumbed to Public Pressure Tactics, Sheriff Dart Shifted His

Crusade to Backpage.com.

28.

In September 2010, Craigslist shut down its adult services category in response to

public pressure from a group of state attorneys general (after initially resisting the pressure as

improper censorship). Less than a week later, the AGs targeted Backpage.com, and Sheriff Dart

joined, with his office announcing that it had focused on Backpage.com as the new

battleground.

29.

In January 2011, Sheriff Darts office wrote Backpage.com stating that it had

been conducting undercover online investigations of the website, had determined the site is

being openly used as a conduit for illegal prostitution activity, and insisted that Backpage.com

be brought into legal compliance by remov[ing] the Personals and Adults sections of [the]

website.

-8-

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 9 of 22 PageID #:9

30.

Sheriff Darts office wrote Backpage.com again in March and June, 2011,

demanding, among other things, that Backpage.com [r]equire posts in the Adults section be paid

using credit cards and provide customers identifying information to law enforcement agencies

upon request. Backpage.com responded to the Sheriffs office by explaining its screening

procedures and cooperation with law enforcement, noting that the website did require payments

by credit or debit cards and routinely provided identifying information from cards in response to

valid law enforcement requests. Following meetings with Backpage.com personnel, the Sheriffs

office wrote:

We all came away impressed not only with the work done so far by

[Backpage.com], but also with [your] candor and sincerity .

31.

Nonetheless, in January 2012, Sheriff Darts office returned to its demand that

Backpage.com eliminate the adult category, threatening prosecution under Illinoiss human

trafficking statute, 720 ILCS 5/10-9, if Backpage.com did not immediately cease and desist[].

Sheriff Dart also made public statements, asserting that Backpage is a conduit to criminality

and need[s] to be held accountable.

32.

In January 2014, Sheriff Dart wrote Backpage insisting it respond to a twelve-

page list entitled Request for Information and Site Modification, which, among other things,

demanded that Backpage.com [r]equire user[s] to pay fees with major credit card.

33.

In response to Sheriff Dart and other politicians demands that it shutter the adult

category on its website, Backpage.com has steadfastly maintained that censorship is not a

solution to human trafficking or child exploitation, but rather that law enforcement and other

authorities should work with websites to prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal activity and

to rescue victims.

D. Cases Establish that Escort Ads on Backpage.com Are Protected Speech Under the

First Amendment and CDA Section 230.

34.

While Sheriff Dart continued his vendetta, legislatures in three other states

Washington, Tennessee, and New Jerseypassed criminal laws targeting Backpage.com. In

each instance, federal courts enjoined the laws, finding them unconstitutional under the FirstAmendment and preempted by Section 230 of the CDA. Backpage.com, LLC v. McKenna, 881F. Supp. 2d 1262 (W.D. Wash. 2012); Backpage.com, LLC v. Cooper, 939 F. Supp. 2d 805(M.D. Tenn. 2013); Backpage.com, LLC v. Hoffman, 2013 WL 4502097 (D.N.J. Aug. 23, 2013).Noting that escort ads have long been permitted (and escort services are licensed and regulated inmany states), these cases held that the states efforts to regulate or effectively block such adswould likely chill protected speech. McKenna, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 1282. The courts rejectedarguments that the laws only prohibited advertisements for illegal transactions and instead foundthat they were overbroad and could not survive strict scrutiny. Hoffman, 2013 WL 1249063, at*8. Further, the laws violated CDA Section 230 because they sought to impose liability onwebsites for publishing third-party content, they would encourage websites either to restrictspeech or to relax their current self-policing, and Section 230 preempts all state civil andcriminal laws. McKenna, 881 F. Supp. 2d at 1273-75; Cooper, 939 F. Supp. 2d at 825. As theTennessee court summarized:Child sexual exploitation is an evil that states have an undisputed interest indispelling. However despicable this evil, though, the Constitution stands as ashield against broad assaults by states on the rights of their citizens. TheConstitution tells us thatwhen freedom of speech hangs in the balancethestate may not use a butcher knife on a problem that requires a scalpel to fix.

- 10 -

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 11 of 22 PageID #:11

Cooper, 939 F. Supp. 2d at 813. In all three cases, the courts ultimately entered permanent

injunctions and awarded Backpage.com attorneys fees.

See, e.g., Backpage.com, LLC v.

Cooper, 2013 WL 1249063 (M.D. Tenn. Mar. 27, 2013).

35.

More recently, a federal court in Massachusetts barred tort claims against

Backpage.com by plaintiffs who claimed they were victimized because of ads that appeared on

the site. Doe v. Backpage.com, LLC, 939 F. Supp. 2d 805 (D. Mass. 2015). Consistent with

Dart v. Craigslist and M.A. v. Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC, 809 F. Supp. 2d 1041 (2011),

the court held Backpage.com immune under Section 230.

E. Sheriff Darts Admissions That He Cannot Censor Backpage.com Under the Law.

36.

Sheriff Dart is well aware of the federal law and casesbeginning with his own

failed suit against Craigslistholding that online escort ads are protected speech and

governmental authorities cannot force websites to ban such ads. He has admitted this by railing

that Courts continue to follow antiquated laws to the point of nonsensical outcomes and

absurdity, and asserting that Congress is too hamstrung to act to change outdated language

in the Communications Decency Act. See Dart Letter to Charles W. Scharf, CEO of Visa, Inc.

(June 29, 2015), attached hereto as Exhibit B. Indeed, in June 2014, Sheriff Dart joined Senator

Mark Kirk to propose that federal law be changed, publicly asserting their purpose was to

target and combat online advertisers like Backpage.com.

Senator Kirks proposed

legislation was not enacted, and, as reported in the press, presented thorny free speech

concerns. See Juan Perez Jr., Kirk joins Cook officials in push to fight Internet sex trade, CHI.

F. Sheriff Darts Alternative Tack to Shut Down Backpage.com By Cutting Off Credit

Card Services.

37.

As Sheriff Darts spokesman has admitted, [a]fter the legislative and litigious

efforts failed, his office decided it needed to come up with an out-of-the-box idea, and

looked to the financial route, recognizing that transactions on the website would simply not

be possible if Visa and MasterCard would say no more.

Companies Abandon Backpage.com Over Sex Trafficking Complaints, Huffington Post (July 1,

2015), http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/01/backpagecom-credit-cards_n_ 7705708.html.

The Sheriffs office then moved full speed ahead and devoted a team to working almost fulltime on the effort. Id.

38.

On June 29, 2015, Sheriff Dart sent letters to the CEOs of Visa and MasterCard in

which he demanded and indicated he sought to compel them to defund and sever ties with

Backpage.com. His press release about the letters said this expressly:

SHERIFF DARTS DEMAND TO DEFUND SEX TRAFFICKING COMPELS

VISA AND MASTERCARD TO SEVER TIES WITH BACKPAGE.COM

Press Release, Cook County Sheriff (July 1, 2015), attached hereto as Exhibit A,

http://www.cookcountysheriff.com/press_page/press_BackPage_07_01_2015.html.

39.

The letters left no doubt about Sheriff Darts demand, his threatened pressure and

the consequences if the card associations did not accede. Writing under his letterhead as Cook

County Sheriff, he insisted the companies immediately cease and desist from allowing your

credit cards to be used to place ads on Backpage.com. See Ex. B (Visa letter); see also Dart

Letter to Ajaypal Banga, President and CEO of MasterCard, Inc. (June 29, 2015), attached hereto

as Exhibit C. He wrote that his office ha[d] objectively found that Backpage.com promote[s]

prostitution and facilitate[s] sex trafficking, with no support for this statement and despite his

- 12 -

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 13 of 22 PageID #:13

knowledge the site actively works to prevent trafficking or exploitation and regularly works with

law enforcement (including Sheriff Darts office) to combat it. Noting that he is the county

authority charged with eradicating such trafficking, the Sheriff not-subtly alluded to the card

associations legal dut[ies] to file Suspicious Activity Reports, suggested they could also be

required to alert law enforcement authorities of other possible problems, and made sure his

threat was plain by citing statutes imposing criminal penalties for money laundering, allowing

termination of a financial institutions status as an insured depository institution, and permitting

investigations and enforcement actions

Sheriff Darts letter also made clear he intended to

continue oversight of the card associations by asking each company to identify a contact person

[w]ithin the next week. See Exs. B, C. And, Sheriff Dart has stated that the letters were only a

part of a larger campaign Cook County planned to launch [to] pressure the credit card

companies. Tierney Sneed, Under Pressure, Major Credit Cards Cut Ties With Backpage.com

In less than 48 hours, MasterCard and Visa both announced they were terminating

suit Wednesday morning. See Ex. A.

41.

Visa and MasterCard acknowledge they banned use of their cards on

Backpage.com and terminated merchant services to the company because of Sheriff Darts

demands and compulsion. In a press statement, MasterCard stated it terminated card services for

Backpage.com because of the Sheriffs letter, regarding it as having confirmed illegal or

brand-damaging activities.

money/2015/06/30/mastercard-ceases-doing-business-backpage/29536177/.

Visa wrote to

Backpage.coms acquiring bank directing that it could no longer process transactions because

Visa had received allegations from US law enforcement that the merchant backpage.com is

linked to child prostitution and human trafficking and had been requested to impose an

immediate close down. See also Mathew Zeitlin, Backpage.com Cut Off From Credit Card

System Over Sex Trafficking Claims, BuzzFeed (July 1, 2015), http://www.buzzfeed.

com/matthewzeitlin/backpagecom-cut-off-from-credit-card-networks#.uww892ZwD.

42.

Backpage.com received notice from its acquiring banks and credit card processors

on July 1 and 2, 2015, that they could no longer process Visa and MasterCard transactions and

were terminating their merchant agreements for Backpage.com effective immediately.

43.

On information and belief, Sheriff Darts office previously contacted American

Express and pressured it to terminate use of its cards on Backpage.com as well. Bellware, Credit

Card Companies Abandon Backpage.com, Huffington Post (July 1, 2015) (Darts office had

previously reached out to American Express, which already complied.). On April 30, 2015,

American Express informed Backpage.com it was disallowing use of its cards for any purchases

- 14 -

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 15 of 22 PageID #:15

in the adult category of the website.

American Express did not indicate its reason for

terminating, but Sheriff Dart has since stated that he contacted and caused American Expresss

decision.

44.

MasterCard has also listed Backpage.com as a terminated merchant on the

Member Alert to Control High-Risk (MATCH) file. This list, maintained jointly by MasterCard

and Visa, prevents processing of credit card payments worldwide for any listed merchant, now

including Backpage.com. Thus, because of Sheriff Darts actions, Backpage.com is barred from

credit card services of any of the three largest card companies or any acquiring banks or credit

processing companies.

G. Effects of Sheriff Darts Actions and Coercion of MasterCard and Other Card

Associations on Backpage.com and Its Users.

45.

Sheriff Darts actions and the credit card companies acquiescence to his pressure

have cut off nearly all revenue to Backpage.com (leaving only Bitcoin as a means of payment,

which accounts for a small percentage of purchases on the website). This affects not only adult

escort ads but also other ads for dating, housing, services, trades, and sales of goods, among

others. In his zeal to prevent the few improper ads that users may post despite Backpage.coms

efforts to prevent them, Sheriff Dart has taken it upon himself to eliminate the website

altogether.

46.

Beginning on July 6, 2015, Backpage.com ceased charging for ads after the credit

card companies terminated as a result of Sheriff Darts demands. Backpage.com began offering

users a free promotional code in some areas (FREESPEECH) to allow them to post ads free of

charge until Backpage.com can obtain relief for Sheriff Darts actions. It later allowed users to

post ads free of charge without inputting a promotional code. Backpage.com took this step

- 15 -

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 16 of 22 PageID #:16

because disrupting or precluding its ability to provide services to users severely harms the

websites goodwill and users rights to post speech on the site.

47.

Providing services for free can only be a temporary measure, however. All

publishers need revenues to survive, and the First Amendment precludes coercive government

actions to choke off revenues to silence speech it disfavors. Sheriff Darts actions and the

termination of credit card services have also harmed Backpage.coms efforts to police and

preclude improper ads. Imposing charges and requiring users to pay by credit cards discourages

improper postings and provides information for law enforcement. Without such charges, the

volume of ads (including spam) increases and Backpage.com necessarily must devote resources

and personnel to address these problems, detracting from its efforts to police the website.

Backpage.com provides an online forum for speech of millions of users across the

country. Escort advertising and adult-oriented postings are protected speech under the First

Amendment and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as are ads in all of the many

other categories on the Backpage.com website.

50.

Sheriff Dart and Cook County could not lawfully enact an ordinance to shut down

the Backpage.com website, as such a law would be overbroad and would not survive strict

scrutiny under the First Amendment.

Sheriff Dart also cannot bring suit to shutter

Backpage.com or the adult category under state civil or criminal laws, as he well knows from his

unsuccessful suit rejected in by this Court in Dart v. Craigslist, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 961.

51.

Sheriff Darts actions constitute an extralegal and unconstitutional prior restraint

of speech. As established by Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58 (1963), government

officials cannot censor or chill speech through an informal process of coercive threats or

insinuation.

52.

Prior restraints of speech are the essence of censorship, Near v. Minnesota, 283

U.S. 697, 713 (1931), the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment

rights, Nebraska Press Assn v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 559 (1976), and bear[] a heavy

presumption against constitutional validity. Bantam Books, 372 U.S. at 70.

53.

Sheriff Darts actions do not fit within any of the narrowly defined exceptions to

the prohibition against prior restraints. See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S.

546, 559 (1975).

54.

Sheriff Dart cannot establish that his actions in demanding that the credit card

companies defund Backpage.com were the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling

state interest. See United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813

(2000). If allowed to stand, Sheriff Darts actions will eliminate an entire forum for online

speech and millions of permissible and constitutionally protected posts in order to target a

handful that may be unlawful but cannot be detected or blocked.

55.

Sheriff Darts efforts to close down an entire forum for online speech are grossly

overbroad and are governed by no discernable legal standards. City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer

Pub. Co., 486 U.S. 750, 770 (1988).

56.

Sheriff Darts actions also violate Section 230 of the CDA, 47 U.S.C. 230, as he

has no right or authority to preclude or seek to prosecute Backpage.com under state law for

publishing third-party content.

57.

As a direct result of Sheriff Darts actions, Backpage.com has suffered and absent

relief from this Court will continue to suffer damages for lost revenue, harm to its business and

goodwill, and infringement and deprivation of its rights under the Constitution and federal law.

Also as a direct result of Sheriff Darts actions, if not remedied, users of Backpage.com have

suffered and will continue to suffer infringement and deprivation of their constitutional rights.

58.

At all times and for all actions as alleged in this Complaint, Sheriff Dart acted

under color of state law. His actions have resulted in deprivation of rights and privileges secured

by the Constitution and federal laws of Backpage.com and its millions of users. Accordingly,

this Court may and should grant declaratory and injunctive relief, damages and attorneys fees

and costs under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1988.

COUNT II

Deprivation of Due Process of Law

(First and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. 1983)

59.

Backpage.com incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

60.

A prior restraint of speech, if otherwise permissible, may be imposed only if it

provides for requisite procedural safeguards to guard against suppressing constitutionally

protected speech. Southeastern Promotions, 420 U.S. at 559; Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S.51, 58 (1965).

Government actions effecting a prior restraint require a prompt judicial

determination of whether speech is unlawful or protected, and, more specifically: (1) the

burden of instituting judicial proceedings, and of proving that material is unprotected, must rest

on the censor, (2) any restraint prior to judicial review can be imposed only for a specified

brief period and only for the purpose of preserving the status quo, and (3) a prompt final

judicial determination must be assured. Southeastern Promotions, 420 U.S. at 560.

- 18 -

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 19 of 22 PageID #:19

61.

Sheriff Darts actions to accomplish ultra vires informal censorship had none of

the procedural safeguards constitutionally required. He did not institute any judicial proceeding

to determine that all speech on Backpage.com is unlawful; indeed, when he filed a proceeding

against Craigslist six years ago, his arguments were rejected by this Court. Sheriff Dart has not

indicated or proposed that he will file a judicial action to determine the legality of his actions, but

instead has touted that he has achieved his objective extra-judicially. Backpage.coms only

recourse to obtain a prompt judicial determination is to bring this action and ask the Court to

grant immediate relief.

62.

And, importantly, Sheriff Darts actions and the informal prior restraint he has

caused did not preserve the status quo, but rather destroyed it. The status quo when Sheriff Dart

set out to pursue his out-of-the-box unlawful actions was that the credit card companies

allowed use of their cards for purchases on Backpage.com, as they had for over eleven years.

Backpage.com and its users are entitled to appropriate relief from this Court to reinstate the

status quo to remedy Sheriff Darts unlawful and unconstitutional actions.

63.

Sheriff Darts actions have deprived Backpage.com due process of law. Sheriff

Dart gave Backpage.com no notice or opportunity to be heard before contacting Visa and

MasterCard to demand they cease and desist providing services. Sheriff Darts actions have

stigmatized and threaten to preclude Backpage.com from doing business altogether, which

infringes its liberty and property interests under the Fourteenth Amendment.

64.

As a direct result of Sheriff Darts actions, Backpage.com has suffered and absent

relief from this Court will continue to suffer damages for lost revenue, harm to its business and

goodwill, and infringement and deprivation of its constitutional rights. In this regard, too,

- 19 -

Case: 1:15-cv-06340 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/21/15 Page 20 of 22 PageID #:20

Sheriff Dart acted under color of state law, and this Court should grant declaratory and injunctive

relief, damages and attorneys fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1988.

COUNT III

Declaratory Judgment and Preliminary and Permanent Injunctions

(28 U.S.C. 2201 and 2202; Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and 65)

65.

Backpage.com incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

66.

This action presents an actual case or controversy between Backpage.com and

Sheriff Dart concerning rights under the Constitution and federal law. Declaratory relief is

therefore necessary and appropriate.

67.

Injunctive relief is necessary and appropriate in this action because Sheriff Darts

actions are unconstitutional, violate federal law, and have caused and will continue to cause

irreparable harm to Backpage.com and its users unless enjoined. Sheriff Dart has continued his

campaign to shut down Backpage.com even after succeeding with his demand that Visa and

MasterCard terminate services.

68.

Immediate injunctive relief is also appropriate and fundamentally important in

this case.

The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time,

unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.

Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).

Absent immediate preliminary relief to enjoin and correct Sheriff Darts actions, his informal and

extralegal prior restraint may succeed by making it impossible for Backpage.com to continue

doing business and offering its website as a forum for users across the country.

69.

Accordingly, with this Complaint, Backpage.com is also filing its Motion for

Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, urging that the Court should grant

emergency and immediate relief.
