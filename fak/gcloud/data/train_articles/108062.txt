New Oklahoma law allows ammunition in locked cars parked at work – EmployerLINC
An Oklahoma law going into effect on November 1 allows employees to store ammunition in their locked vehicles parked at work.

A key aspect of Oklahoma’s newly amended Self Defense Act allows people with valid gun licenses to carry handguns openly as well as concealed weapons in many public places. But another part of the “open carry” amendment to the Act affects how people can store ammunition in their cars.

Oklahoma law already prohibited employers from having policies banning employees from keeping guns locked in their vehicles in employer parking lots. The new law says employees may also store ammo in their locked vehicle.

Under the new law, businesses are still allowed to prohibit weapons in their buildings. Therefore, employers can still enforce policies that prohibit employees — even those with valid licenses — from bringing guns or weapons of any type into the workplace. Make sure you have a “no weapons in the building” policy that is distributed to your workforce and is posted. Your policy should also prohibit ammo in the building.
