Giant alligator roams golf course in Florida
1:15 P.M. MONDAY UPDATE: The exceptionally large gator at the Buffalo Creek Golf Course has roamed the links for years, and he's apparently good for business.

"People have heard that he is out here and that is all they want to see so they will bring spectators to ride so somebody can get a picture," pro shop clerk Wendy Schofield told News 3. "He doesn't bother anybody and they don't bother him, he's like a mascot for the course, which is owned by Manatee County."

"He has been here for a very, very long time, he's not new at all. There have been guesses that he's 15 to 16 feet long," the five-year employee said. "The word has spread that this is a great place to come and play. He is the highlight, but we are worth the price too."

Take a look at the picture below, it is quite possibly the biggest alligator you'll ever see.

Charles Helms posted a video on his Facebook page, after spotting the enormous gator roaming a golf course in Palmetto, Florida.



You can see how big the gator is when another man got a closer look.

In case you were wondering, the biggest alligator ever recorded in Florida was 14 feet long, weighing 780 pounds.
