New $1 Million AAN Ad Campaign Promotes Tax Cuts For Middle-Class Families
WASHINGTON – The American Action Network (@AAN) is launching a new comprehensive ad campaign in 24 congressional districts nationwide showcasing the benefits of pro-growth tax reform for middle-class families. These latest ads are part of a new $1 million television and digital ad campaign to promote the benefits of pro-growth tax reform following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The district-specific ads highlight how working families are benefiting from the middle-class tax cut. View the districts targeted here.

“All across the country, working families are benefiting from the results of pro-growth tax reform, and seeing a $2,000 tax cut,” said Corry Bliss, AAN Executive Director. “These tax cuts, wage increases, bonuses and other employee benefits – a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – are helping working families by providing a much-needed sense of financial security. AAN will continue to tout the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as families and workers across America continue to benefit from meaningful tax reform.”

Since August 2017, AAN has spent over $30 million promoting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and highlighting how the new savings benefit working, middle-class families.
