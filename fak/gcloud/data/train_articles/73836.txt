Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan Program
The Affordable Care Act calls for the establishment of the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) Program, which will foster the creation of qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers to offer competitive health plans in the individual and small group markets.

CO-OP Advisory Board

The law also requires the Comptroller General to establish a 15-member advisory board - Opens in a new window to make recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) with regard to the award of grants and loans. The board appointments were made by June 23, 2010.

CCIIO works with the advisory board to assist and advise the Secretary and Congress on HHSâ€™s strategy to foster the creation of qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers. Specifically, the advisory board provides advice regarding the awarding of grants and loans related to the CO-OP program. In these matters, the Committee shall consult with all components of the Department, other federal entities and non-federal organizations, as appropriate. It will also examine relevant data sources to assess the grant and loan award strategy to provide recommendations to CCIIO.

FACA Commission

The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) is a federal law (P.L. 92-463) that governs the behavior of federal advisory committees, such as the CO-OP program.
