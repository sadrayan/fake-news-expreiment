Trump tariffs on appliances, electronics will hit American consumers, retailers warn
U.S. retailers warn that tariffs proposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese imports would raise prices for American consumers on many products.

Trump's list includes more than 1,300 goods, such as flat-screen televisions, appliances and everyday consumer products. Clothing and shoes are not targeted.

Industry experts fear retailers that sell consumer electronics would be most affected. Still, the impact should be minimal at best, they said, though that could change if Trump decides to change course and target a broader range of products.

"As we've said all along, tariffs are taxes on consumers and a drag on the nation's economy," said Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation. "This entire process creates uncertainty and makes it difficult for retail companies that must rely on complicated global supply chains."
