Carry A. Nation - Introduction

The Famous and Original

Bar Room Smasher

In 1901 Carry A. Nation became a household name.

People across the country came to know her best for her anti-alcohol, saloon-smashing campaign. Although her efforts were sometimes ridiculed, Nation actually was part of a much larger movement of women who believed alcohol destroyed families.

Some dismissed her as a crank with extreme views. But behind the image of an angry crusader with a hatchet was a woman who inspired many followers.

Carry A. Nation: The Famous and Original Bar Room Smasher is an online exhibit addressing the reformer's life and times. It is a companion piece to Sinners and Saints: Vice and Reform in Kansas. Both displays were developed by the Kansas Museum of History.
