Gallup: Uninsured rate holding steady at new low point
The percentage of Americans without health insurance since the Affordable Care Act’s open enrollment has held steady in the months since that enrollment period ended, according Gallup polling.

The survey released Thursday morning finds the uninsured rate in the country has leveled off after dropping to 13.4% in April since the window for purchasing insurance through the marketplace ended in mid-April.

The uninsured rate ranged between 16.1% and 17.5% from early 2009 until early 2013, before spiking to 18% in the third quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2013 the average rate was at 17.1%, and it dropped to 15.6% in the first quarter of 2014 as Americans began using the marketplaces to sign up for health insurance.
