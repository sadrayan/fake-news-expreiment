Marco Rubio Continues the Fight Against Obamacare Bailouts
Marco led the fight to stop a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare before. Now he’s calling on Republican leaders to prevent the bailouts for good.

Breitbart News talked to Marco this week about how the Obama administration wants to bail out insurers taking part in Obamacare.

Marco stopped the bailout once in 2014:

For years, Rubio has pressed leaders in his party to repeal the “risk corridor” provisions in Obamacare that would allow the federal government to effectively bail out insurance company losses from participating in the program. Thanks to a policy rider in the 2014 omnibus bill inspired by Rubio, bailout payments from the federal government are currently being choked off.

Now the same insurance companies that spent millions lobbying in favor of Obamacare are asking Congress to fund a bailout for them.

Marco is now urging Republican leaders to prevent them once and for all:

“Why should American taxpayers be bailing out insurance companies, many of whom cooperated with, conspired with alongside the Obama administration to get Obamacare passed?” he asked. “And now they want to come with their lobbyists and basically force the American taxpayer to put money into a fund that bails them out for having lost money on the Obamacare exchanges.”

Marco has led the fight against ObamaCare bailouts for years.

If he succeeds in ending them permanently, it’ll be a huge win for taxpayers, and could be a big part of ending ObamaCare for good.
