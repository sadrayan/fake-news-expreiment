Keystone XL Pipeline Application

On January 26, 2017, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. (Keystone) re-submitted a Presidential permit application to the Department of State for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline’s border facilities. Acting on behalf of the President under delegated authorities in accordance with Executive Order 13337 and the January 24, 2017 Presidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs determined that issuing a Presidential permit to Keystone to construct, connect, operate, and maintain at the border of the United States pipeline facilities for the import of crude oil from Canada to the United States as described in the Presidential permit application for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project would serve the national interest. Accordingly, the request for a Presidential permit is approved.
