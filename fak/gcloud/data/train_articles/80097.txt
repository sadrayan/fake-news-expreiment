About Us
For nearly 60 years, the Insurance Information Institute (I.I.I.) has been the leading independent source of objective information, insight, analysis and referral on insurance for a wide range of audiences, including: Consumers, insurance professionals, the media, government and regulatory organizations, educational institutions and students.

The I.I.I.’s mission is to improve public understanding of insurance—what it does and how it works. And with this goal in mind, our website, blog and social media channels offer a wealth of research, white papers, videos, articles, infographics and other resources to inform and educate—while the annual Insurance Fact Book is the definitive research resource of its kind.

The I.I.I. is an industry supported organization, but does not lobby for insurance businesses; instead, our central function is to provide accurate and timely information on insurance subjects.

If your business, organization, or educational institution is interested in membership with the I.I.I., please visit iiimembership.org.
