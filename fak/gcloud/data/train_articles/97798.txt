For: PLUNDER PRESENT: LEONARDO-DE CASTRO, PJ,

Chairperson VILLARUZ, JR., and

PERALTA, JJ. PROMULGATED: September 12, 2007 x-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------x D E C I S I O N Republic Act (RA) No. 7080 as amended was approved on July 12, 1991, creating and introducing into our criminal legal system the crime of "plunder". This law penalizes public officers who would amass immense wealth through a series or combination of overt or criminal acts described in the statute in violation of the public trust. RA No. 7080 or the Anti-Plunder Law was a consolidation of Senate Bill no. 733 and House Bill No. 22752. The Explanatory Note of Senate Bill No. 733, quoted in the case of Estrada v. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 148965, February 26, 2002, 377 SCRA 538, 555), explains the reason behind the law as follows: Plunder, a term chosen from other equally apt terminologies like kleptocracy and economic treason, punishes the use of high office for personal enrichment, committed thru a series of acts done not in the public eye but in stealth and secrecy over a period of time, that may involve so many persons, here and abroad, and which touch so many states and territorial units. The acts and/or omissions sought to be penalized do not involve simple cases of malversation of public funds, bribery, extortion, theft and graft but constitute plunder of an entire nation resulting in material damage to the national economy. The above-described crime does not yet exist in Philippine statute books. Thus, the need to come up with a legislation as a safeguard against the possible recurrence of the depravities of the previous regime and as a deterrent to those with similar inclination to succumb to the corrupting influence of power. The majority opinion in the above-cited case, penned by Honorable Justice Josue N. Bellosillo, further explained the rationale behind the Anti-Plunder Law in this manner: Our nation has been racked by scandals of corruption and obscene profligacy of officials in high places which have shaken its very foundation. The anatomy of graft and corruption has become more elaborate in the corridors of time as unscrupulous people relentlessly contrive more and more ingenious ways to milk the coffers of the government. Drastic and radical measures are imperative to fight the increasingly sophisticated, extraordinarily methodical and economically catastrophic looting of the national treasury. Such is the Plunder Law, especially designed to disentangle those ghastly tissues of grand-scale corruption which, if left unchecked, will spread like a malignant tumor and ultimately consume the moral and institutional fiber of our nation. The Plunder Law, indeed, is a living testament to the will of the legislature to ultimately eradicate this scourge and thus secure society against the avarice and other venalities in public office. These are times that try men’s souls. In the checkered history of this nation, few issues of national importance can equal the amount of interest and passion generated by petitioner’s ignominious fall from the highest office, and his eventual prosecution and trial under a virginal statute. This continuing saga has driven a wedge of dissension among our people that may linger for a long time. Only by responding to the clarion call for patriotism, to rise above factionalism and prejudices, shall we emerge triumphant in the midst of ferment. [Emphasis Supplied] The present case is the first of its kind to be filed charging the highest official of the land, a former President, among others, of the offense of plunder. Needless to state, the resolution of this case shall set significant historical and legal precedents. Throughout the six years over which the court proceedings in this case unfolded, this Court confronted numerous novel and complicated legal issues (including the constitutionality of the plunder law, propriety of house arrest, among others), heard lengthy testimonies from several dozens of witnesses from both sides and perused voluminous documentary evidence and pleadings from the parties. Considering the personalities involved and the nature of the crime charged, the present case aroused particularly intense interest from the public. Speculations on the probable outcome of the case received unparalleled attention from the media and other sectors of society. Indeed, the factual and legal complexities of the case are further compounded by attempts to sensationalize the proceedings for various ends. However, this Court is ever mindful of its imperative duty to act as an impartial arbiter: (a) to serve the interest of the State and the public in punishing those who would so severely abuse their public office and those private individuals would aid them or conspire with them and (b) to protect the right of the accused to be only convicted upon guilt proven beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, the decision of this Court follows, upon no other consideration other than the law and a review of the evidence on record. STATEMENT OF THE CASE

On April 25, 2001, the Court promulgated its Resolution which stated: xxx xxx xxx the Court finds and so hold that probable cause for the offense of PLUNDER exists to justify issuance of warrants for the arrest of accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, Mayor Jose "Jinggoy" Estrada, Charlie "Atong" Ang, Edward Serapio, Yolanda T. Ricaforte, Alma Alfaro, John Doe a.k.a. Eleuterio Tan or Eleuterio Ramos Tan or Mr. Uy, and Jane Doe a.k.a. Delia Rajas. No bail is fixed for the provisional liberty of the accused for the reason that the penalty imposable for the offense of plunder under RA No. 7080, as amended by Sec. 12 of RA No. 7659, is reclusion perpetua to death. Director General Leandro R. Mendoza, Chief of the Philippine National Police, shall implement the warrant of arrest upon service to him by Mr. Edgardo A. Urieta, Chief of the Sheriff and Security Services Division of the Sandiganbayan. Once arrested, all the accused shall undergo the required processes and be detained at the PNP Detention Center, Camp Crame, Quezon City subject to, and until, further orders from this Court. On the 25th day of April 2001, on the basis of the said resolution, the Court issued an Order of Arrest and Hold Departure Order for all the named accused in the present information. The Philippine National Police (PNP) submittd its Report of Compliance dated April 25, 2001 which stated: 1. That in compliance with the Order of Arrest issued by the Honorable Court in the above captioned criminal case, accused Joseph E. Estrada and Jose "Jinggoy" Estrada, both residence of no. 1 Polk Street, North Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila voluntarily surrendered to the undersigned on 25 April 2001 at about 3:00 o’clock PM at said residence in the presence of their counsels. 2. That right after their surrender, they were brought inside Camp Crame, Quezon City for the required processes and pending further orders from this Honorable Court they shall be kept in Camp Crame; A Compliance/Return of Warrant of Arrest was also filed on April 26, 2001 by P/Chief Superintendent Nestor B. Gualberto. As to accused Serapio, the PNP’s Report of Compliance reads in part: 2. That one of the accused named therein, Atty. Edward S. Serapio, surrendered to the Chief, Philippine National Police, through the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) in Camp Crame, Quezon City on April 25, 2001 at about 9:45 PM where the required processes were administered to him and pending further orders from this Honorable Court he shall be kept in Camp Crame; The Court, in its Minute Resolution dated April 26, 2001, set the arraignment of the detained accused on May 3, 2001 which was cancelled due to the different motions filed by the accused. Accused Jinggoy Estrada filed his Motion to Quash or Suspend dated April 24, 2001 and a Very Urgent Omnibus Motion dated April 30, 2001. Among other motions, accused FPres. Estrada filed his Motion to Quash dated June 7, 2001 and accused Serapio filed his Motion to Quash (Re: Amended Information dated April 18, 2001) dated June 26, 2001. In its Resolution dated July 9, 2001, the Court denied all the aforesaid motions to quash and accused Jinggoy Estrada’s Very Urgent Omnibus Motion dated April 30, 2001. The Court’s Resolution dated July 9, 2001 was sustained by the Honorable Supreme Court in the Decisions rendered in Joseph Ejercito Estrada vs. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 148560, November 19, 2001) and Jose "Jinggoy" Estrada vs. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 148965, February 26, 2002). On July 10, 2001, the Court denied the motion to defer filed by accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada and proceeded with the arraignment of accused FPres. Estrada, Jinggoy Estrada, and Serapio under the Amended Information. The accused having refused to enter a plea, the Court entered a plea of not guilty for all the three (3) accused. Petitions for Bail / House Arrest With the detention of accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada in Camp Crame on April 25, 2001, both accused filed on the same day an Urgent Ex-parte Motion to Place on House Arrest. The Court on June 9, 2001, issued a Resolution denying accused FPres. Estrada’s Urgent Ex-Parte Motion to Place on House Arrest and issued an Order for the confinement of accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada at Fort Sto. Domingo, Sta. Rosa, Laguna, subject to the need for their continued confinement at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center (VMMC) where they were then confined. In view of the said resolution, accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada, on June 13, 2001, filed an Omnibus Motion (Re: Resolution promulgated on June 9, 2001) pressing in the alternative a Motion for Detention in Tanay, Rizal. On March 17, 2004, FPres. Estrada filed a Motion to Modify Custodial Arrangement dated March 17, 2004 and, on March 30, 2004, the counsel de officio of accused FPres. Estrada filed a Manifestation dated March 29, 2004 informing the Court, among others, that the said accused was willing to have his property in Tanay, Rizal placed under the control and supervision of the Court and the Philippine National Police for the duration of his detention. On July 12, 2004, the Court issued a joint resolution granting FPres. Estrada’s motion to modify Custodial Arrangement dated March 29, 2004 subject to the conditions imposed by the Court. Accused FPres. Estrada filed a Compliance and Acceptance of Conditions on July 13, 2004. Since then, accused FPres. Estrada has been detained in his property at Tanay, Rizal. When the Court ordered the arrest and detention of the accused in these cases, accused Serapio filed his petition for bail on April 27, 2001. Accused Jinggoy Estrada’s petition for bail was included in his Very Urgent Omnibus Motion dated April 30, 2001. Accused Serapio’s Petition for Bail was deferred indefinitely as prayed for by the said accused while, on August 14, 2001, accused Jinggoy Estrada filed an Urgent Second Motion for Bail for Medical Reasons dated August 16, 2001 which the prosecution opposed. On December 20, 2001, the Court issued its Resolution denying accused Jinggoy Estrada’s Urgent Second Motion for Bail for Medical Reasons. Considering the denial of the said motion for bail for medical reasons, accused Jinggoy Estrada, on April 17, 2002, filed an Omnibus Application for Bail dated April 16, 2002. After hearing, the Court issued a Resolution on March 6, 2003 which granted accused Jinggoy Estrada’s Omnibus Application for Bail. The prosecution’s Motion for Reconsideration dated March 13, 2003 was denied in this Court’s Resolution dated April 30, 2003. The aforesaid Resolutions granting bail to Mayor Jinggoy Estrada were upheld by the Honorable Supreme Court in a Decision promulgated in G.R. No. 158754, People vs. Sandiganbayan (Special Division) and Jose "Jinggoy" Estrada (August 10, 2007). As to accused Serapio, the Court’s Resolution dated September 12, 2003 also granted accused-movant Serapio’s Urgent Petition for Bail dated April 27, 2001. The Court fixed the amount of bail of accused Serapio and Jinggoy Estrada at Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) each which was to paid in cash. While the case was already in the trial stage, on January 4, 2002 the counsels for the accused Estradas wrote a letter to the Acting Presiding Justice requesting for a re-raffle of the cases against the accused, citing as grounds the continuing uncertain composition of the justices handling the cases against the accused Former President, et al., at that time. The prosecution filed its Opposition to Request for Re-Raffle On January 9, 2002 and its Comment/Suggestion on January 10, 2002 that a Special Third Division be constituted to be composed of the present Presiding Justice, the only remaining member of the Third Division to which the case was raffled, and two other Sandiganbayan Justices who are not retirables within the next three (3) years. Justice Anacleto Badoy, the Chairman of the Third Division, was due to retire on October 2002, while Justice Ilarde, the other member, retired on November 27, 2001. On January 11, 2002, the Sandiganbayan En Banc issued its Resolution 01-2002 recommending to the Supreme Court that the cases against accused FPres. Estrada, et al., be referred to a Special Division. The Supreme Court on January 21, 2002 promulgated its Resolution Creating the Special Division of the Sandiganbayan which shall hear, try and decide with dispatch the Plunder Case and all related cases filed or may hereafter be filed against accused FPres. Estrada, and those accused with him, until they are resolved, decided and terminated. In the Special Division of the Sandiganbayan, the Supreme Court retained, as Junior Member, the present Presiding Justice who was then the only remaining member of the Third Division to which the Plunder Case was raffled, and designated the then Presiding Justice Minita V. Chico-Nazario, as Chairperson, and Associate Justice Edilberto G. Sandoval as Senior Member. This was not the first time that a Special Division of the Sandiganbayan was constituted to try a case. A Special Division was previously constituted to try and decide the Aquino-Galman cases in that composition of the said Division was also maintained until the case was decided notwithstanding the subsequent changes in the composition of the Division due to promotions and/or retirement of its members. During the same year, the counsel de parte of accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada all withdrew their appearances. The Court on March 1, 2002, in order to protect the rights and interest of the accused, appointed the Public Attorneys Office (PAO) and those who have been recommended by the Board of Governor of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, to represent accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada as counsel de oficio, namely, Former Presiding Justice of the Sandiganbayan Manuel Pamaran, Atty. Prospero Crescini, Atty. Irene Jurado and Atty. Manuel Malaya. The PAO lawyers mentioned their duration as counsel de oficio, hence, (Ret.) Presiding Justice Pamaran and the private practitioners represented accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada up to the time the prosecution rested its case and submitted to the Court its Formal Offer of Evidence. However, before the presentation of the evidence for the defense, accused FPres. Estrada, in a Letter dated September 1, 2004, informed the Court that he have decided to re-engage the services of the members of his original de parte panel of lawyers. Upon conclusion of the presentation of prosecution evidence and after the Court have ruled on the offer of evidence of the prosecution, accused FPres. Estrada, Jinggoy Estrada and Serapio filed their respective motion for leave of court to file demurrer to evidence. In a Joint Resolution dated March 10, 2004, the Court granted accused FPres. Estrada’s Motion for Leave to File Demurrer to Evidence in Criminal Case Nos. 26905 and 26565 while it denied the same motion of all the accused in Criminal Case No. 26558 for lack of merit. Subsequently, the Demurrer to Evidence of accused FPres. Estrada was filed. In its Joint Resolution dated July 12, 2004, the Court resolved to deny FPres. Estrada’s Demurrer to Evidence in Criminal Case No. 26905 but granted the Demurrer to Evidence of FPres. Estrada in Criminal Case No. 26565. After the presentation of the evidence for accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada, accused Serapio manifested that he opted not to present his own evidence but adopted the evidence presented by FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada. The said accused then formally offered their evidence. The Court issued its resolution on the formal offer of evidence for accused FPres. Estrada, Jinggoy Estrada and Serapio. On the other hand, the prosecution manifested that it was not presenting any rebuttal evidence but formally offered additional evidence and tendered excluded evidence in its Supplemental Formal Offer of Exhibits [Re: Exhibits Identified, Presented, and Marked during the Cross Examination of Defense Witnesses] with Tender of Excluded Evidence dated March 29, 2007. The Court issued its Minute Resolution dated April 19, 2007 on the said additional offer of evidence of the prosecution. In an Order dated May 9, 2007, the Court gave the parties a period of time to file their respective memoranda and scheduled the Oral Summation requested by accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada on June 15, 2007. After the Oral Summation, the case was submitted for decision. Incidentally, on November 10, 2006, the National Bureau of Investigation filed its Return of "Alias" Order of Arrest, informing the Court that one of the accused in this case, Atong Ang was extradited from the United States of America and was already under the custody of the said agency. At his arraignment, accused Atong Ang refused to enter a plea and the Court entered a plea of not guilty for the said accused. On January 24, 2007, when the case was scheduled for Pre-Trial only for accused Atong Ang, the prosecution and the said accused, assisted by his counsel, manifested in open court that they had executed a Plea Bargaining Agreement. The Court’s Resolution dated March 14, 2007 approved the Plea Bargaining Agreement entered into by the parties. On March 19, 2007, during accused Atong Ang’s re-arraignment, the said accused pleaded guilty to a lesser offense of Corruption of Public Officials under Article 212 in relation to Article 211 of the Revised Penal Code. On the same day, the Court rendered its decision against accused Atong Ang sentencing said accused to "two (2) years and four (4) months of prision correccional minimum, as minimum, to six (6) years of prision correccional maximum, as maximum, and to pay the amount of P25,000,000.00 to the Government as his civil liability". Accused Atong Ang immediately filed a Petition for Probation (with Motion to Deduct Period of Preventive Imprisonment from the Term of Imprisonment and to Post Bail Pending Resolution thereof) which the Court granted in a Resolution dated May 25, 2007. Accused Atong Ang is now under probation. STATEMENT OF THE STIPULATIONS

OF THE PARTIES AT PRE-TRIAL

________________________________ After the arraignment of the accused, the pre-trial was conducted which led to the issuance of the Amended Pre-Trial Order dated June 14, 2001, quoted in part hereunder: When this case was called for pre-trial on September 3, 2001, accused JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, JOSE "Jinggoy" P.

Ricaforte (Ricaforte) and Edward S. Serapio. The paragraph also refers to unidentified co-conspirators by the usual "Jane Does" and "John Does". I. EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION The principal witness of the prosecution in this first specification of the predicate acts of plunder is Former Ilocos Sur Governor Luis "Chavit" C. Singson. He testified extensively on the charge that FPres. Estrada accumulated ill-gotten wealth in the above-mentioned amount through the monthly remittance to him of seems of money collected from operations of illegal gambling, commonly known as "jueteng", based in the different provinces of the country allegedly in consideration of the prosecution or unimpeded operation of said illegal gambling. The gist of the testimony of Singson relative to paragraph (a) of the Amended Information is set forth hereunder: GOVERNOR LUIS "CHAVIT" CRISOLOGO SINGSON (Gov. Singson) was 61 years old, married, a businessman, and a resident of Mabini Street, Poblacion, Vigan, Province of Ilocos Sur at the time he took the witness stand as prosecution witness. The examination of the witness was done by Solicitor General Simeon Marcelo under the control and supervision of the Ombudsman who was present. The counsel de oficio of accused FPres. Estrada and Jinggoy Estrada, (Ret.) Justice Manuel R. Pamaran, objected to the appearance of the Solicitor General, which the Court noted. [TSN dated July 17, 2002, pp. 166-167] The testimony of Gov. Singson was presented to corroborate the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Maria Carmencita Itchon, Emma B. Lim and the Equitable PCI Bank Branch Managers where Ricaforte opened accounts, and to prove that accused FPres. Estrada, Jinggoy Estrada, Atong Ang, Ricaforte, Serapio and the other accused, in conspiracy with one another, amassed and accumulated ill-gotten wealth for principal accused FPres. Estrada’s benefit while he was the 13th President of the Republic of the Philippines in the amount of Four Billion Ninety Seven Million Eight Hundred Four Thousand One Hundred Seventy-Three Pesos and Seventeen Centavos (P4,097,804,173.17), part of which was derived from: (1) the collection of jueteng protection money from November 1998 to August 2000, in the amount of Five Hundred Forty Five Million Pesos (P545,000,000.00) more or less and the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00) also from the said illegal gambling protection money; and (2) misappropriation, diversion and conversion for his personal gain as benefit public funds in the amount of One Hundred Thirty Million Pesos (P130,000,000.00) more or less, representing a portion of the Two Hundred Million pesos (P200,000,000.00) Tobacco Excise Share allocated for the Province of Ilocos Sur under Republic Act No. 7171. Gov. Singson was also presented by the prosecution to prove that Jinggoy Estrada and Serapio conspired with and/or acted as co-principals by indispensable cooperation of FPres. Estrada in the running of the illegal numbers game of jueteng and in the receipt by FPres. Estrada of jueteng protection money; that accused Jinggoy Estrada regularly collected jueteng protection money every month from January of 1999 to August 15, 2000, as an indispensable part of the amassing and accumulating ill-gotten wealth by principal accused FPres. Estrada and as part of the series and/or combination of overt or criminal acts constituting the crime of plunder; that Serapio conspired with FPres. Estrada and the other accused in receiving the Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00) which came from jueteng operations and in hiding and/or laundering the same through the banking system and that Serapio was the personal lawyer of FPres. Estrada and that in furtherance of the conspiracy he set up various juridical entities to mask and/or hide various illegal proprietary and business interests of FPres. Estrada. Gov. Singson would also identify certain documents, checks, pictures and other facts relevant to the foregoing, which tend to prove the combination and/or series of overt and criminal acts, constitutive of the crime of plunder (and to oppose the petition for bail of Jinggoy Estrada. Gov. Singson’s testimony was also offered to prove the illegal use of alias). [TSN dated July 17, 2002, pp. 168-174] Gov. Singson testified that he was called by FPres. Estrada at his house in Polk Street, Greenhills, on August of 1998. Gov. Singson was then the Provincial Governor of Ilocos Sur. Gov. Singson went to Polk Street in the evening. He was assisted by a security guard towards the kitchen where he found Atong Ang and FPres. Estrada talking how to expand the operations of jueteng, an illegal numbers game, in the provinces where there was yet no jueteng protection money. Shortly, Bong Pineda arrived. Gov. Singson heard FPres. Estrada told Bong Pineda that starting on that day not to bring money at his house because it was very obvious. Gov. Singson did not know Bong Pineda very much but he saw Bong Pineda in Congress when he was investigated regarding jueteng. The jueteng money would protect jueteng operator from being arrested. FPres. Estrada then instructed Bong Pineda to give the money to Atong Ang or to Gov. Singson because the latter was a Governor so it would not be obvious if he brought money to FPres. Estrada. [TSN dated July 17, 2002, pp. 178-187] According to Gov. Singson, the day after the aforementioned meeting, Atong Ang started meeting with the jueteng operators in his office near the municipal hall of San Juan. [Ibid, p. 188] Atong Ang and the operators were bargaining how much protection money from each province will be given to FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, p. 193] After the final talk, they started collecting jueteng protection money, specifically from August of 1998. [Ibid, p. 203] Gov. Singson knew FPres. Estrada for almost thirty (30) years before August of 1998. FPres. Estrada was not yet a mayor but a movie actor as Gov. Singson’s mother was a producer. [Ibid, p. 191] Gov. Singson first met Atong Ang at the cockpit and gambling places. He had known Atong Ang for a long time even when FPres. Estrada was still the Vice President. According to Gov. Singson, Bong Pineda was a close "compadre" of FPres. Estrada while his son, Jinggoy Estrada, was Bong Pineda’s godson by marriage. [Ibid, p. 197] Gov. Singson claimed that he was present in not all but several meetings of Atong Ang with the jueteng collectors. He was present when there was an agreement on the three percent (3%) of total collections in every province, as fixed by Atong Ang. [TSN dated July 22, 2002, pp. 12-13] Jueteng money was delivered to FPres. Estrada initially every end of the month, starting September of 1998 and later every 15th and at the end of the month. [Ibid, p.14] On October of 1998, Gov. Singson and Atong Ang brought the jueteng protection money of about Nine Million Pesos (P9,000,000.00) for the said month to FPres. Estrada at his house, in No. 1 Polk Street in Greenhills, but FPres. Estrada and Atong Ang had a nasty quarrel about the sugar allocation request of Atong Ang which was denied by FPres. Estrada. Gov. Singson brought home the said P9,000,000.00 but, the following day, FPres. Estrada called him up asking him to pay F.P. Estrada’s obligations which went on until the said amount was consumed and Gov. Singson was instructed by FPres. Estrada to continue the collection of the jueteng money. [Ibid, pp. 26, 22-23] Gov. Singson continued the collection as instructed by FPres. Estrada, still with the help of Atong Ang, from November of 1998 until August of 2000. The amounts of money collected from jueteng during the said period were listed in the ledger per month and per province. The ledger also listed the expenses paid for using the jueteng protection money. [Ibid, pp. 24-27] Every fifteen (15) days, Gov. Singson himself delivered protection money to FPres. Estrada in the amount of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) or a total of Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) every month. Emma B. Lim delivered once the jueteng money to FPres. Estrada in Malacañang. The protection money was delivered usually in cash but sometimes in check. Chavit Singon presented to this court two (2) sets of ledger. The first set consisted of nine (9) pages covering the month of November of 1998 up to July of 1999 (Exh. W7 to Exh. E8). The September 1998 and October 1998 collections were not reflected in the said ledger since the ledger was done only after FPres. Estrada and Atong Ang quarreled in October 1998. The second set of ledger covered the months of August of 1999 to August of 2000 (Exh.A-4 to Exh. A-4-d). [TSN dated July 22, 2002, p. 27-31] Gov. Singson prepared the pages of the first set of ledger (Exh. W7 to E8) with the help of Emma B. Lim and Ma. Carmencita Itchon and on the following year, Ricaforte joined them. [Ibid, pp. 35-36] The pages of the second set of ledgers starting August of 1999 to August of 2000 [Exhibit A-4 and submarkings] were prepared by Ricaforte under the supervision of Gov. Singson who also checked the said ledger. [Ibid, pp. 36-37] Ricaforte was introduced to Gov. Singson by FPres. Estrada before his birthday on April 19, 1999. She was designated by FPres. Estrada as auditor because FPres. Estrada was strict with money. Gov. Singson was thankful for Ricaforte’s designation because he did not want FPres. Estrada to distrust him. [Ibid, p. 40] Gov. Singson considered Ricaforte as the employee of FPres. Estrada with respect to the jueteng collections because not only was she introduced to Singson by FPres. Estrada, the latter also told Singson to give her Eighty Thousand Pesos (P80, 000.00) monthly salary. Ricaforte held office at LCS Building owned by Gov. Singson. [Ibid, pp. 42-43] Gov. Singson did not know Yolanda Ricaforte or her husband Orestes Ricaforte before April of 1999. Gov. Singson identified Ricaforte from a picture (Exh. A-6-b-1) where she was seated beside Menchu Itchon, the assistant of Gov. Singson. The picture was taken during the wedding of Raquel, the daughter of Gov. Singson where FPres. Estrada and his wife Senator Loi Ejercito stood as wedding sponsors. [Ibid, p. 45-48] According to Gov. Singson, the jueteng collections were placed in a scratch paper as they came every fifteen (15) days, at the middle and the end of the month or five (5) days after the end of the month. When all the collections had arrived, the list was finalized and then transferred to the computer. The ledgers were prepared upon instructions of FPres. Estrada because the latter was strict with money. [Ibid, pp. 37-40, 41-42] Gov. Singson explained in detail the entries on the left hand portion of the ledger for November of 1998 up to July of 1999. In the province of Ilocos Sur, the total collection for fifteen (15) days was Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P750,000.00), in the province of La Union for 15 days, Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) total collection, while in Bulacan for 15 days, One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) total collection (Exh. W7) of protection money for FPres. Estrada. The entries for the other provinces were similar. On the left side column were the names of the provinces, the middle column pertained to the number of days, i.e., whether for 15 or 30 days and the right column, the total amount of collections of jueteng protection money, in order that jueteng operators will not be "arrested" or apprehended. There was one (1) collector for three (3) provinces. [Ibid, pp. 53-54] In the second set of ledger (Exh. A-4 to A-4-d) Ricaforte gave a code name for every province below the title "Theme". The number of days, either 15 or 30, under the title "days" and the total amount of protection money for FPres. Estrada below the title "points" were indicated in the ledger. [Ibid, pp. 55-56] Gov. Singson narrated that when FPres. Estrada was still the Vice President, they were already collecting jueteng money but not in all provinces. When FPres. Estrada assumed the presidency, he called Gov. Singson and Atong Ang to start jueteng collections in provinces without protection money. Atong Ang talked to certain persons in the said provinces so that the collection of protection money could start. Every province had a collector but sometimes there was one collector for three (3) provinces. The collections were submitted to Gov. Singson but sometimes they would get the money from the house of the collectors. The jueteng collections which FPres. Estrada asked Gov. Singson to operate for FPres. Estrada’s own benefit was at the national level, meaning nationwide. They did not interfere with jueteng operations at the lower level. Before there were "Kangaroo" type of jueteng operations or "Guerilla Type". They did it on their own and they did not pay protection money. When the jueteng operators gave protection money to FPres. Estrada, they were not apprehended anymore although there were instructions to the contrary which were for show or for record purposes only. [Ibid, pp. 59-64] There were local officials who did not allow jueteng like Governor Lina in Laguna. He changed the Provincial Commander several times but jueteng still continued. In the other places the protection money for jueteng given to the local officials was different from that given to the higher levels. [Ibid, pp. 65-66] In Exhibit A-4, ULAC stands for Bulacan and the figure 1.00 means One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) for fifteen (15) days, as protection money for FPres. Estrada. If the number of days was blank it meant 15 days, otherwise the number 30 was indicated. In the ledger (Exh A-4-C up to A-4-I) covering the periods of January of 2000 up to August of 2000, the same figures appeared but the code names of the provinces were replaced by their original names as instructed by FPres. Estrada who was confused with the code names. Under the sub-title "amount", the total amount of protection money given to FPres. Estrada was reflected. For instance, in Ilocos Sur, the amount of 500 meant Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00). [Ibid, pp. 67-68] The other entries were similar, except for the substitution of the code names with actual names of the provinces. For instance, the amount of protection money given to FPres. Estrada corresponding to Ilocos Sur entered as 500, was Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00). For the province of Bulacan the number of days was blank and the figure 1,000 was entered. This means that for Bulacan for 15 days the total protection money given to FPres. Estrada was One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00). According to Gov. Singson, the collections were delivered in exact amount so they removed the zeroes in the ledger so as not to lengthen the entries. [Ibid, pp. 69-70] The two boxes of entries at the right bottom of the ledger marked as Exhibits A-4 to A-4-l, reflected the expenses to show where some of the money collected went. [Ibid, p. 70] The first entry (Exh. W7-1) showed that Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) went to "Jimpol", which referred to then Secretary Jimmy Policarpio. The latter confirmed to Gov. Singson this receipt of the said amount from Bong Pineda which Secretary Policarpio, then a political liaison officer for Congress, would use for the media. [Ibid, pp. 74-75] In the ledger for November of 1998, the entry 300 Goma (Exh W7-2) means that Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00) was given to the Office of the Chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP). [Ibid, pp.74-76] Gov. Singson himself brought the money at first to General Lastimoso, the Chief of the PNP but he refused to receive the money. Later Atong Ang identified the persons from PNP who will pick up the money and help them in the operation. Gov. Singson called up FPres. Estrada to inform him that Lastimoso refused to receive the money. Gov. Singson was worried Lastimoso may not coordinate with them. One time, Gov. Singson was called to Malacanang and he met General Lastimoso there and FPres. Estrada told the latter to coordinate with Gov. Singson about the operation of jueteng. General Lastimoso expressed the need to coordinate with the Regional Commanders to apprehend jueteng operations for show only ("kunwari"). [Ibid, pp. 77-80] The entry "November 1998, 5.00, AS Sunday" (Exh W7-3) means that the amount for Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) protection money was given to FPres. Estrada, whose code name was "Asiong Salonga" on a Sunday. Gov. Singson himself gave the money to FPres. Estrada. The next entry "1.000 Jing" (Exh W7-4), would show that One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) was given to Jinggoy Estrada, whose code name was "Jing". According to Gov. Singson, Jinggoy Estrada was the collector of protection money for the Province of Bulacan which should be Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00) for every month but Jinggoy Estrada kept the One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) and remit to Gov. Singson only Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) or One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) for every 15 days. [Ibid, pp. 80-82] Atong Ang told Gov. Singson that Jinggoy Estrada got One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) and Jinggoy Estrada confirmed it but when they told FPres. Estrada about it, he instructed them not to give Jinggoy Estrada money and he will be the one to give money to Jinggoy Estrada. Gov. Singson removed the name of Jinggoy Estrada from the list and they kept it a secret from FPres. Estrada that Jinggoy Estrada was taking jueteng money because Jinggoy Estrada will get angry too if he was not given a share. Jinggoy Estrada was then the Mayor of the Municipality of San Juan. Jinggoy Estrada collected money from the Province of Bulacan at the later part of January of 1999. [Ibid, p. 82-85] The entry "500 JD" (Exh W7-5) means that Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) went to Jude Estrada, a son of FPres. Estrada. Jude confirmed to Gov. Singson that he received the said amount of jueteng protection money from Atong Ang who reported that to Gov. Singson. The entry "1.800 ad check" (Exh W7-6) refers to One Million Eight Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,800,000.00) covered by a bad check, part of jueteng money, which bounced. This was PCI Bank Check No. 0019063 (Exh. F8) given to Gov. Singson by one Celso De Los Angeles. The entry "17.300 total expenses" (Exh. W7-7) represents the Seventeen Million Three Hundred Pesos (P17,300,000.00) the amount of total expenses for the month of November of 1998. The total expenses every month were entered in the ledger (Exh. X7 to E8, and Exh. A-4 to A-4-d. [Ibid, pp. 85-92]) In the entry for December of 1998 (Exh. X7), the first entry "5.00, AS" (Exh. X7-1) shows the Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) that was given by Gov. Singson to FPres. Estrada from the collection of jueteng protection money. The ledger for January 1999 bearing as first entry "6.00 cash January 2, AS" (Exh Y7-1), reflected the Six Million Pesos (P6,000,000.00) cash from the same source given personally by Gov. Singson to FPres. Estrada. The entry "3.00 check, February 1, 1999, AS" (Exh. W7-2) shows that Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00) in check was given to FPres. Estrada on February 1, 1999 as part of protection money. [Ibid, pp. 93-95] Another entry "5.00 check, February 1, 1999 AS" (Exh Y7-3), refers to the Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) Check given by Gov. Singson to FPres. Estrada from jueteng protection money. This check (Metrobank Check No.0000917, Exh G8-1) was deposited in the account of Paul Boghart, who was mentioned during the impeachment trial at the Senate as a foreigner assisting in the "PR" of FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, pp. 93-97] The entry "3.500 cash, January 19, AS" (Exh. Y7-4) pertains to Three Million Five Hundred Pesos (P3,500,000.00) cash from the protection money given by Gov. Singson to FPres. Estrada on January 19 (1999). The entry "5.00, February 18, AS" (Exh. Z7-1) refers to the Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) given by Gov. Singson to FPres. on February 18, 1999 from the same protection money. Gov. Singson explained that the entry "400 tax" (Exh Z7-2) at the right hand portion of Exhibit Z7, refers to the Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00) which he got for reimbursement of the expenses that he paid or would pay but were not recorded in the ledger. In the ledger for March 1999 (Exh. A8), April 1999 (Exh. B8), May 1999 (Exh. C8), June 1999 (Exh. D8), July 1999 (Exh. E8), and August 1999 (Exh A-4) there were similar entries of "tax" which were also intended for the same purpose. Gov. Singson called them "butal". Gov. Singson had the permission of FPres. Estrada that all amounts less than One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) were considered "butal" which Gov. Singson kept for reimbursement of expenses which FPres. Estrada would ask Gov. Singson to pay. If the total amount collection was Four Million Two Hundred Pesos (P4,200,000.00), Gov. Singson got Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) of the said collection as "butal" and included the same in the ledger as "tax". [Ibid, pp. 98-101] In the ledger for February 1999 collection appears a handwritten entry "+ 4.00 capitol February 3, 1999". This entry pertains to the Four Million Pesos (P4,000,000.00) "kickback" which FPres. Estrada asked Gov. Singson to give him on February 3, 1999 out of the Twenty Million Pesos (P20,000,000.00) allotted for the repair of the capitol of Ilocos Sur. This P4 Million was added to the "total to date" of the collection which consequently amounted to Thirty Eight Million Pesos (P38,000,000.00). [Ibid, pp. 102-103] In the ledger for March 1999 (Exh. A8), the first entry "5.00, 4/6/99, AS" (Exh. A8-1) shows that Five Mllion Pesos (P5,000,000.00) that Gov. Singson gave FPres. Estrada on April 6, 1999. Gov. Singson wrote on the ledger "AS", i.e. Asiong Salonga, the code name of FPres. Estrada [Ibid, p. 103] Regarding the entry "500 3/23 c/0 Malou AS" (Exh A8-2), Gov. Singson explained that Malou Florendo, the Secretary of FPres. Estrada, coordinated with Gov. Singson by telephone for the delivery of the amount of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) to FPres. Estrada. Emma B. Lim delivered the money as Gov. Singson was in the province when FPres. Estrada called up Gov. Singson to tell him he needed money very badly. [Ibid, pp. 104-106] On April 1, 1999, Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) were given by Gov. Singson to FPres. Estrada from jueteng protection money as shown by the entry "5.00 4/1/99 AS" (Exh B8-1). The next entry, "1.00, William Gatchalian" (Exh "B8-2), refers to the One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) given by Gov. Singson to William Gatchalian upon instruction of FPres. Estrada. Gatchalian had a Twenty Million Pesos (P20,000,000.00) check but FPres. Estrada won only Nineteen Million Pesos (P19,000,000.00) in their mahjong game, so FPres. Estrada asked Gov. Singson to give to Gatchalian the change of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) charged to the jueteng protection money. Gov. Singson gave Gatchalian the said amount through a Metrobank Check No. 0001066 (Exh H8 and H8-1). [Ibid, pp.106-109] The entry in Exhibit B8 which reads "200 Jerry and Len" (Exh B8-3) reflects the One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) each given to then Secretary Lenny De Jesus and Secretary Jerry Barican, or a total amount of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00), as "balato" as instructed by FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, pp. 109-110] Senator Tessie Oreta and Sonny Osmena were also given One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) each or a total of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) in Cebu aboard the Presidential Yatch "Ang Pangulo" as shown by the entry "2.00 Tessie and Sonny" (Exh. B8). Gov. Singson gave the said sums of money to the Senators, which he funded through the jueteng protection money, in the form of Metrobank Check No. 0001081 (Exhs. I8 and I8 -1 and Metrobank Check No. 0001082 (Exhs. J8 and J8-1) upon instruction of FPres. Estrada, as their "balato" for the winning of the latter in "Mahjong". [Ibid, pp. 112-114] The amount of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) was given by Gov. Singson to FPres. Estrada from the jueteng protection money on each of the following dates as shown by the entries in the ledger: (1) May 1, 1999 ("5.00 5/1/99 AS" – Exh. C8-1); (2) May 18, 1999 ("5.00 5/18/99 AS" – Exh. C8-2); (3) June 1, 1999 ("5.00 6/1/99 AS" – Exh. D8-1); (4) June 18, 1999 ("5.00 6/18/99 AS" – Exh. D8-2); (5) July 31, 1999 ("5.00 7/1/99 AS" – Exh. E8-1); and (6) July 19, 1999 ("5.00 7/19/99 AS" – Exh. E8-2). From May 1, 1999 to July 19, 1999, the total amount of money given by Gov. Singson to FPres. Estrada would amount to Thirty Million Pesos (P30,000,000.00) based on the ledger. [Ibid, pp.115-118] The entry reading "123,000 total to date" (Exh E8-3) represents the total amount of One Hundred Twenty Three Million Pesos (P123,000,000.00) that remained as of July 1999. [Ibid, pp. 118-119] After July 1999, particularly on August 1999, FPres. Estrada called Gov. Singson, Ricaforte and Serapio to a meeting at Mandaluyong. Gov. Singson was instructed by FPres. Estrada in the presence of Ricaforte and Serapio to turn-over all the balance of the money from jueteng to the account of Ricaforte. Gov. Singson was keeping most of the above-mentioned P123,000,000.00 in the bank and the others in cash in his office because FPres. Estrada would ask for money from time to time. Gov. Singson turned-over the aforementioned balance of the jueteng money partly in check and partly in cash in the office of FPres. Estrada. Ricaforte and Serapio were there with the Former President. [Ibid, pp.119-123] Part of the aforesaid P123,000,000.00 was covered by Metrobank Check No. 0001360 (Exh K8 and K8-1) of Gov. Singson in the amount of Seventeen Million Two Hundred Ten Thousand Pesos (P17,210,000.00) [Ibid, p. 123]. The second and third checks (Exhs A-2-b and A-7-c) were PCI Bank checks in the account name of William Gatchalian each in the amount of Thirty-Five Million Pesos (P35,000,000.00) or a total of Seventy Million Pesos (P70,000,000.00). Gov. Singson narrated that the amount of Sixty-Two Million Pesos (P62,000,000.00) from the jueteng protection money was lent to William Gatchalian. Out of this transaction, FPres. Estrada earned Eight Million Pesos (P8,000,000.00) such that William Gatchalian paid a total of Seventy Million Pesos (P70,000,000.00). [Ibid, pp. 124-125] Gov. Singson presented Metrobank Check No. 0001332 with account name Governor Luis "Chavit" Singson, in the amount of Forty-Six Million Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P46,350,000,00) payable to William Gatchalian (Exh L8 and L8-1). This check, according to Gov. Singson was part of the jueteng protection money lent to William Gatchalian. The rest of the P62,000,000.00 were in cash and covered by other checks. [Ibid, pp. 126-127] The Eight Million Pesos (P8,000,000.00) earned from the loan by FPres. Estrada was taken as advance by the latter before due date of the P70,000,000.00 of Gatchalian. For this reason, the P8,000,000.00 was not anymore added to the balance of P123,000,000.00 of jueteng money. [Ibid, pp. 127-130] The advance of P8,000,000.00 was covered by Metrobank Check No. 0001388 with the account name Governor Luis "Chavit" Singson (Exhs. M8 and M8-1). During the impeachment trial at the Senate, it turned out that the P8,000,000.00 was deposited in the account of Senator Loi Estrada [Ibid, pp. 130-131,139] The fourth check which covered part of the total balance of P123,000,000.00 jueteng protection money was a Far East bank Check in the amount of Thirty-Four Million Six Hundred Forty Two Thousand Four Hundred Forty Two Pesos (P34,642,442.00) payable to the order of Fontain Bleau, Inc. (Exh B6). [Ibid, p. 124] According to Gov. Singson, the Far East Bank check payable to the order of Fontaine Bleau, Inc. was paid by Fontana to Fontaine Bleau, Inc. which was a casino owned by FPres. Estrada and built with the use of jueteng protection money. The bulk of the P123,000,000.00 were turned-over by Gov. Singson in the form of checks. The cash amounted only to Eight Hundred Thousand Pesos (P800,000.00) only. [TSN dated July 24, 2002, pp.8-9] In the second set of ledger covering the months of August 1999 to August 2000 (Exh A-4) are found the following entries: (1) "3.00 AS 9/6 8 o’clock a.m." (Exh A-4.1) and (2) "5.00 AS 8/16/99" (Exh A-4.2). The entries represent the two (2) Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) given by Gov. Singson to FPres. Estrada on September 6 at 8 o’clock in the morning and on August 16, 1999 or a total of Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) as part of jueteng collection. [Ibid, pp. 10-13] The other entries in the said ledger are: (1) "16.310 August 1-15" (A-4-3); (2) "13.150 August 16-31" (Exh. A-4-4); (3) "29.460 total for August" (Exh. A-4-5); (4) "15.200 expenses" (Exh. A-4-6); (5) "14.260 subtotal" (Exh. A-4-7); (6) ".260 tax" (Exh. A-4-8); (7) "14.000 total to date" (Exh. A-4-9). Gov. Singson explained that the entries mean (1) that the total collection for August 1-15, 1999 amounted to Sixteen Million Three Hundred Ten Thousand Pesos (P16,310,000.00); (2) that from August 16-31, 1999 the total collection was Thirteen Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P13,150,000.00); (3) that the total collection for the whole month of August 1999 was Twenty Nine Million Four Hundred Sixty Thousand Pesos (P29,460,000.00) which all went to FPres. Estrada. The expenses for the said month reached Fifteen Million Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P15,200,000.00). The said amount of expenses was deducted from the total collection for the same month. The remainder, described as "subtotal", amounted to Fourteen Million Two Hundred Sixty Thousand Pesos (P14,260,000.00). Of the latter sum of money, Two Hundred Sixty Thousand Pesos (P260,000.00) was treated as "butal" and taken by Gov. Singson to be used as reimbursement for expenses which Gov. Singson was requested by FPres. Estrada to pay. The balance of Fourteen Million Pesos (P14,000,000.00) was deposited in the bank for President Estrada. [Ibid, pp. 14-18] The "tax" entries in the ledger, starting Exhibit Z to Z-7, covered the amounts less than One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) which were treated as "butal" that remained with Gov. Singson to reimburse him for expenses which were not recorded in the ledger but should be deducted from the money of FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, pp. 19-21] Gov. Singson mentioned that he personally gave or handed to FPres. Estrada even if Malou Florendo, FPres. Estrada’s secretary, was around. Gov. Singson either left the money beside FPres. Estrada or behind the latter’s chair. FPres. Estrada would count the money by the bundle [Ibid, pp. 22-23]. The Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) delivered by Emma B. Lim to Malou Florendo not to FPres. Estrada personally was confirmed by the latter to have been received by him. Emma B. Lim delivered the money to the Malacañang Palace because of the changes in the instructions given by FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, pp. 23-24] The net balance of Fourteen Million Pesos (P14,000,000.00) for August 1999 was deposited by Ricaforte at Equitable PCI Bank. The same was done to the net monthly balances for September 1999, October 1999, November 1999, December 1999, January 2000, February 2000, March 2000, April 2000 and May 2000. [Ibid, pp. 25-27] The other entries in the second set of ledger for September 1999 and October 1999 as follows: (1) "AS 11:30 am/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-a-1); (2) "10/29 AS/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-b-1"); (3) 10/14 AS/258 5.000 (Exh A-4-b-2), mean that Gov. Singson whose code name was "258" gave FPres. Estrada, referred to as "AS", which stands for Asiong Salonga Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) on each of the following dates: (a) in September 1999 at 11:30 in the morning; (b) on October 29, 1999; and (c) on October 14, 1999. In the November 1999 ledger (Exh A-4-c), the following entries appear (1) "11/30 laptop comp./print.105,850" (Exh. A-4-c-1) (2) "11/30 2 Starex 800 each/258 1.600" (Exh. A-4-C-2); (3) "11:30 AS/258 12p.m PG5.000" (Exh. A-4-C-3); (4) "11/15 AS/258 at 4p.m 5.000" ( Exh. A-4-C-4 ), and (5) "11/08 Jimpol 2.400". Gov. Singson explained the foregoing entries in the November 1999 ledger as follows: On November 30, 1999, the amount of P105,850.00 was used to buy the laptop computer with printer of Ricaforte. On November 30, 1999, Gov. Singson purchased Two (2) units of Starex at Eight Hundred Thousand Pesos each or a total amount of One Million Six Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,600,000.00). One unit of Starex went to Ricaforte and was registered in her name. The other was left in their office. At 12:00 noon on November 30, 1999, Gov. Singson brought Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) to FPres. Estrada in his house at P. Guevarra St. at Greenhills as part of jueteng protection money. At that time, Guia Gomez, one of the most loved of FPres. Estrada, resided at the said house. Gov. Singson also gave Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) to former FPres. Estrada on November 15, 1999 at 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon. On November 8, 1999, the amount of Two Million Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P2,400,000.00) was given by Bong Pineda to Secretary Jimmy Policarpio, as confirmed by both of them to Singson. During the prior months, only Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) per month were given to Policarpio, as shown by the ledger, but this was increased by Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00) because Policarpio told Gov. Singson that the Media was costly ("Magastos"). [Ibid, pp. 30-39] The ledger for December 1999 (Exh. A-4-d), contains the following entries: (1) "12/30 AS/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-d-1) and (2) "12/04 AS/258 5.00" (Exh A-4-d-2). According to Gov. Singson the aforesaid entries show that he gave to FPres. Estrada, as part of Jueteng protection, the amount of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) on December 30, 1999 and another Five Million Pesos (P5 Million) on December 4, 1999. [Ibid, pp.39-41] The ledger for January 2000 (Exh A-4-E) contains the following entries: (1) "1/31/00 AS at PR 5.000" (Exh A-4-E-1); and (2) "1/15/00 AS at Pr 5.000". According to Gov. Singson "PR" stands for Presidential Residence and "AS" for Asiong Salonga, that he gave to FPres. Estrada the amount of Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) twice, one on January 31, 2000 and the other January 14, 2000, at the Presidential Residence. [Ibid, pp.41-43] According to Gov. Singson, he was ordered by FPres. Estrada to give to him Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) of the jueteng collection every fifteen (15) days of the month. All the jueteng collections were for FPres. Estrada. The total amount of Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) were given to him every month plus the expenses ("gastos") and the remainder or the rest of the collection were deposited in the bank for FPres. Estrada in the name of Ricaforte. A total amount of Two Hundred Sixteen Million Pesos (P216,000,000.00) were deposited in the bank for FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, pp. 43-44] Gov. Singson agreed at first that he would not earn anything from jueteng, provided that the share of Ilocos Sur from the excise tax under R.A. No. 7171 amounting to billions of pesos would be released to them for their projects. Gov. Singson testified that, after the One Hundred Thirty Million Pesos (P130,000,000.00) were taken from him, the release of the funds did not continue. The Former President did not comply with the agreement. [Ibid, pp. 44-46] In the ledger for February 2000 (Exh A-4-F), the following entries appear: (1) "AS/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-F-1); and (2) "2/17/00 AS 258 5.000" (Exh A-4-F-2). Gov. Singson testified that these entries mean that he gave to FPres. Estrada, Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) as part of jueteng protection money in an unspecified day in February of 2000 and another Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) of the same money on February 17, 2000. [Ibid, pp. 48-49] The ledger for March 2000 (Exh A-4-G), bears the following entries: (1) "3/16/00 AS/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-g-1); and (2) "4/3/00 AS/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-G-2). According to Gov. Singson the entries mean that he gave Five Million Pesos (P5 Million) on March 16, 2000 and another Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) on April 3,2000, both as part of jueteng protection money. [Ibid, pp. 49-50] Gov. Singson explained that "258" was his code name which he had been using even in their radio communication and that later, FPres. Estrada would kid him with his code name when they played mahjong. [Ibid, p. 52] In the April 2000 ledger (Exh A-4-H), the entry "4/14/00 AS/258 5.000" appeared twice, (Exh A-4-H-1) because according to Gov. Singson he gave Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) twice, one in the morning and another in the afternoon on the same day, April 14, 2000, or a total of Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) from jueteng protection money collection, because FPres. called him up twice on the said date as his birthday on April 19, 2000 was nearing. [Ibid, pp. 53-54] At the ledger for May 2000 (Exh A-4-i), the first entry also at the right hand portion was "5/31 AS/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-i-1) and next entry was "5/13 AS/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-i-2). Gov. Singson explained that the entries meant that he gave Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) on May 31, 2000 and another Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) to FPres. Estrada on May 13, 2000, both part of the jueteng protection money. Gov. Singson also mentioned that the entries sometimes were not in chronological order, but they were for the same month. [Ibid, pp. 55-56] The June 2000 ledger (Exh A-4-j), the entry at the right hand portion reads: "6/30 AS/258 3.300", and the next entry is "6/15 AS/258 5.000" (Exh A-4-j-2). According to Gov. Singson, these means that he gave to FPres. Estrada Three Million Three Hundred Thousand (P3,300,000.00) from jueteng protection money collection on June 30, 2000, and Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) from the same collection, on June 15, 2000. [Ibid, pp. 56-57] The succeeding ledgers for July 2000 (Exh A-4-k) the following entries appear: (1) "7/14 AS/258 2.650" (Exh. "A-4-k-1) and (2) "8/12 AS/258 3.600" (Exh.A-4-k-2). Gov. Singson explained that the entries mean respectively that he gave the amount of Two Million Six Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P2,650,000.00) on July 14,2000 and Three Million Six Hundred Thousand Pesos (P3,600,000.00) to FPres. Estrada as part of jueteng protection money collection. [Ibid, pp.57-58] To the question of why the amounts were less than P5,000,000.00 on the said occasions, Gov. Singson replied that it so happened that those were the only cash in his possession when the requests for money were made and that they stopped jueteng collection because Atong Ang started with "Pick 2" and later "Bingo 2 Balls" which according to FPres. Estrada would have a semblance of legality. [Ibid, pp. 59-60] The ledger for the month of August 2000 (Exh.A-4-L) contains the entry "8/16 AS/258 3.050" (Exh. A-4-L-1). Gov. Singson testified that he gave FPres. Estrada on August 16, 2000 the amount of Three Million Fifty Thousand Pesos (P3,050,000.00) as part of protection money collected from jueteng. [Ibid, pp. 62-63] According to Gov. Singson the President was very strict with money and so they had an auditor and he checked the ledger monthly so that they could not make any kickback ("Kupit") from the jueteng collection. [Ibid, pp. 63-64] Gov. Singson testified that the jueteng collector for Bulacan on November and December 1998 was Jessie Viceo. In January 1999 the jueteng collector for Bulacan was Jinggoy Estrada as shown by the ledger where he was identified as "Jing" who got One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) (Exh. W7). Viseo and Jinggoy Estrada were friends so the latter supervised the jueteng collection in Bulacan, although he was residing in San Juan. When FPres. Estrada instructed Gov. Singson not to give money to Jinggoy Estrada and so that the latter will not get mad at him, Gov. Singson and Jinggoy Estrada agreed to keep it a secret from the FPres. that Jinggoy Estrada managed the jueteng collection in Bulacan and that out of the total monthly collection of Three Million Pesos (P3,000,000.00) from Bulacan, Jinggoy Estrada gave only Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) to Gov. Singson and he retained One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00). The money was either picked-up from the office or house of Jinggoy or the latter sent the money to Singson. The secret arrangement started in November 1999 and lasted until the end of August 2000. [Ibid, pp. 69-70] However, the arrangement did not appear in the ledger because they will be scolded by FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, p. 71] When asked whether Jinggoy Estrada personally collected the jueteng money, Gov. Singson replied that it was Jinggoy Estrada and Jessie Viceo who talked with each other, sometimes they got the jueteng money from the office of Jinggoy Estrada or sometimes the latter sent it to the office of Singson, but Gov. Singson knew that Jinggoy was in charge of the jueteng collection. The secret arrangement came about because jueteng collection in Bulacan was a problem from the start as there were delays or sometimes the checks paid by Jessie Viceo bounced. Viceo agreed to the arrangement because he was a close friend of Jinggoy Estrada. [Ibid, pp. 71-72] Gov. Singson knew Viceo personally because he would see Viceo in the cockpits which the latter frequented. [Ibid, p. 74] Gov. Singson considered the biggest among the expenses charged to the "Tax" the One Million Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,200,000.00) given to Laarni Enriquez whom Gov. Singson described as the most beloved or favorite of FPres. Estrada [Ibid, p. 75]. According to Gov. Singson, he was assessed, like other persons who attended the birthday party of Laarni, the aforesaid P1,200,000.00 as his share in the price of the necklace birthday gift amounting to Thirteen Million Pesos (P13,000,000.00) for Laarni. Jaime Dichaves collected the said amount from Gov. Singson after the party. Gov. Singson paid by check which was deposited in the account of Laarni at PSBank. [Ibid, pp. 76-81] It was Congressman Mark Jimenez who pinpointed the guests who would share (P1,200,000.00) each for the gift for Laarni after they had just finished playing mahjong with FPres. Estrada during the party. [Ibid, p. 84] Gov. Singson charged the P1,200,000.00 as "tax" in the jueteng collection because it was "a big amount of money". [Ibid, pp. 87-88] In the early part of the year 2000, FPres. Estrada instructed Gov. Singson to transfer Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00) of jueteng money to Serapio. The instruction was given by FPres. Estrada to Gov. Singson in Malacañang Palace in the presence of Ricaforte and Serapio. According to Gov. Singson, Serapio said "Ako na ang bahalang magpa-ikot-ikot" which Gov. Singson took it to mean that Serapio would see to it that the Two Huundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00) jueteng money would not be traced before it reached him. FPres. Estrada checked Gov. Singson in April 2000 when FPres. Estrada’s birthday was approaching, whether the money was so transferred. The transfer of funds was confirmed to Gov. Singson by both Ricaforte and Serapio. The jueteng money delivered to Serapio initially amounted to One Hundred Twenty Three Million Pesos (P123,000,000.00) but it was increased later to Two Hundred Sixteen Million Pesos (P216,000,000.00). [Ibid, pp. 88-94] Gov. Singson testified that Serapio was the trusted lawyer of FPres. Estrada who formed fake corporations for FPres. Estrada which Serapio would narrate to Gov. Singson when they often see each other in Malacañang Palace. Serapio was introduced to Gov. Singson in 1999 after the birthday of FPres. Estrada. Gov. Singson delivered jueteng money to FPresident Estrada in a black bag, like an attaché case. He delivered money at the houses of FPres. Estrada, particularly once at P. Guevarra Street, twice or thrice or four times or five times at Polk Street. [Ibid, pp. 95-98] Atty. Kenneth S. Tampal of the office of the Senate Legal Counsel brought the black bag referred to by Gov. Singson which was marked as Exhibit "MMM" at the Senate Impeachment Proceedings and the set of ledgers for the period beginning August 1999 to August 2000 (Exhibits A-4 to A-4-l). The bag was a leatherette attaché case with two (2) combination locks numbered 000. [Ibid, pp. 103-105] According to Atty. Tampal, the exhibits are in the custody of the Office of the Senate Legal Counsel. [Ibid, p. 110] Gov. Singson testified that the abovementioned black bag (Exh. O8) was one of the black bags which they used to deliver money to FPres. Estrada in Malacañang Palace. [Ibid, p. 113] The said black bag can contain five or even six million pesos. [Ibid, pp. 115, 118] He would leave the bag with money and brought with him the bag without money. The bag contained two (2) combination locks. The combination of both was "000" although he change it to "419", representing the birthdate of FPres. Estrada, April 19, at the time he delivered money in Malacañang Palace to FPres. Estrada, but the latter asked him to revert to "000" combination because FPres. Estrada could not open the lock. [Ibid, pp. 118-119] There were four (4) pieces of this type of bag. [Ibid, pp. 115-116] The bills placed in the bag were in One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) denomination. Many times Singson himself delivered the jueteng money to FPres. Estrada in Malacañang Palace. To go to the Presidential Residence (PR), he passed through the main gate where there were guards. At first, the Secretary would call to give the guards instruction not to inspect the bag. Later on, the guards came to know Gov. Singson and allowed him to enter without inspecting the bag. Jueteng money was either delivered to Gov. Singson’s office or picked-up by Gov. Singson, or his driver or his security or the people in his office. [Ibid, pp. 121-124] The total amount of money Gov. Singson collected from jueteng operations for FPresident Estrada starting November 1998 to August 2000 was Five Hundred Forty Million Pesos (P540,000,000.00) more or less, according to Gov. Singson. Gov. Singson personally delivered about Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00) to FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, p. 124-125] In the ledger for March 1999 (Exh AAAAAAAA), the entry "Bicol15 1.100" means in the Province of Bicol for fifteen (15) days the protection money collection for FPres. Esrada was One Million One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,100,000.00). In the ledger for the month of November 1998 (Exh. W7), there was an entry "1.500 Anton and 2.500 Anton". According to Gov. Singson, the entry was made because Atong Ang told him the amounts of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,500,000.00) and Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P2,500,000.00), or a total of Four Million Pesos (P4,000,000.00), collected from Bicol were recorded / listed in the name of Presidential Assistant Anton Prieto. Atong Ang informed Gov. Singson that FPres. Estrada knew about it and the latter so confirmed to Gov. Singson. [Ibid, pp. 125-127] While jueteng protection money collection started in September 1998, the ledger started only in November 1998 when Gov. Singson alone was asked to continue the jueteng collection. [Ibid, pp. 128-129] In the July 2000 ledger (Exh. A-4-k), the total amount of jueteng collection and the total amount of expenses were the same so the balance at the end of the month was zero because "Pick 2" replaced jueteng, as Gov. Singson, Dante Tan and FPres. Estrada discussed in Malacañang and in his new home at New Manila called "Boracay". "Pick 2" was the brainchild of Dante Tan and "Bingo 2 Ball" was the brainchild of Atong Ang. [Ibid, pp. 129-132] In "Boracay", Bong Pineda told Dante Tan, Gov. Singson and FPres. Estrada that "Pick 2" may be hard to be understood by the people because there will be 75 numbers. [Ibid, p. 134] In August 2000, "Pick 2" started and, in September 2000, before his departure for the United States, FPres. Estrada asked Gov. Singson to hasten the start of "Bingo 2 Balls". Atong Ang called Gov. Singson when he was in Malaysia in September 6, 2000 and told him that FPres. Estrada would like to rush the start of "Bingo 2 Balls". Gov. Singson replied that was nice and asked that Atong Ang reserve Ilocos Sur for him. However, the following day the son of Gov. Singson informed him that the other half of the franchise was given to his political opponent, Eric Singson, whom he defeated in the election. Eric Singson was his distant relative. [Ibid, pp. 138-141] According to the son of Gov. Singson, Atong Ang told him that he had the provincial commander transferred and the Chief of Police replaced. His father could not do anything to stop "Bingo 2 Balls" as it was decided by FPres. Estrada and his political career was finish. Gov. Singson talked with Atong Ang when he was in Malaysia and told him that they should wait for FPres. Estrada to return. FPres. Estrada returned from the United States on September 13, 2000. Gov. Singson also arrived from Malaysia the following day. The following day, Gov. Singson asked FPres. Estrada over the phone why the franchise was given to his political enemy. Gov. Singson told him that all the mayors will be embarrassed. FPres. Estrada replied that he had nothing to do with it. Gov. Singson thought that FPres. Estrada was fooling him. He told FPres. Estrada that it was a matter of pride, that all his mayors were getting embarrassed. FPres. Estrada replied that he did not care, so Gov. Singson told him "Kung dahil lang dyan pagkatapos ng lahat bibitawan mo ako, bibitaw na rin ako sa iyo". [Ibid, pp. 142-146] Gov. Singson then asked his lawyers to prepare his affidavit because he knew that his life would be in danger if he would part ways with FPres. Estrada, who was very powerful and Gov. Singson had no evidence. Gov. Singson then called Ricaforte and asked her to fax to him the ledger. Ricaforte asked if they were going to Malacañang. Gov. Singson knew that Ricaforte did not know yet what was happening. After she faxed the ledger from her house to Gov. Singson, the latter asked his lawyer to continue with the preparation of his affidavit. Gov. Singson said he prepared the affidavit so that if anything happened to him it would be known who was responsible. When asked if he was threatened, Gov. Singson replied that he knew FPres. Estrada and the men around him so he knew that his life was in danger. [Ibid, pp. 146-150] The first set of ledgers was faxed to Singson, while the second set (Exhs. A-4 to A-4-1) was in the possession of Ricaforte which she produced during the impeachment proceedings. The prosecution would have the latter subpoenaed fom the Senate. Everyone that Gov. Singson consulted gave the same comment. Nobody will believe Gov. Singson because FPres. Estrada was the most popular President elected. Gov. Singson talked with Jinggoy Estrada. Gov. Singson told Jinggoy Estrada that his family got One Hundred Thirty Million Pesos (P130,000,000.00) from him and that Jinggoy Estrada got part of the said money. Gov. Singson also told Jinggoy Estrada that jueteng money all went to his father and that Jinggoy Estrada also had a part of it. Jinggoy Estrada told Gov. Singson, they would fix it. [Ibid, pp. 147-155] Nothing happened so Gov. Singson talked with JV Ejercito, another son of FPres. Estrada. JV Ejercito asked Gov. Singson not to come out and that he will talk with his father. Again nothing happened so Gov. Singson approached Secretary Ronnie Zamora and showed him the ledger. The latter reacted that the ledger was a serious matter, "Delikado ito". Zamora asked Gov. Singson not to come out and he told Gov. Singson that he would see FPres. Estrada. Gov. Singson then went to see Former Secretary Edgardo Angara at the latter’s GMA Farm in Batangas and showed to him the ledger. Secretary Angara asked Gov. Singson not to come out publicly because the ledger was a serious matter and even they, the cabinet members may be affected. After that first meeting in Batangas, Chavit Singon saw Secretary Angara at the Philippine Plaza and he latter told Gov. Singson that it was alright as he was able to talk to FPres. Estrada. Secretary Angara, according to Gov. Singson, told FPres. Estrada that Gov. Singson was a big help to them in politics and that he was just asking for a small favor. Secretary Angara also asked FPres. Estrada not to embarrass Gov. Singson’s mayors. This matter might be known by the media. Secretary Angara informed Gov. Singson that FPres. Estrada got mad and replied "Sinong tinakot nya?" Before Secretary Angara left, he told FPres. Estrada that he saw Gov. Singson’s jueteng ledger and he found it a ground for impeachment. FPres. Estrada appeared surprised ("Nagulat") but did not say anything. Secretary Angara assured FPres. Estrada, he will first talk with Gov. Singson and fix it. For the third time, Gov. Singson saw Secretary Angara at New World Hotel. He asked Gov. Singson to give him until the end of September 2000 because the FPres. was a "macho" and would not easily give in. However, Gov. Singson replied that he was already decided because his mayors kept on calling him. Incidentally according to Gov. Singson, these political enemies were operating the "Bingo 2 Balls". [Ibid, pp. 156-164] After Secretary Angara, Gov. Singson also approached Congressman Mark Jimenez, who said after he met with FPres. Estrada, General Lacson and Secretary Ronnie Zamora that "Bingo 2 Balls" will not stop in Ilocos Sur but that Gov. Singson should lie low first. Gov. Singson replied that he had decided already to come out and he informed his mayors that he will expose the anomalies involving FPres. Estrada. Gov. Singson talked with Jimenez over the phone when he was then at Holiday Inn on October 3, 2000. There was a conference of the Mayors League in the Philippines. Gov. Singson left Holiday Inn together with twenty-two mayors. According to Gov. Singson, armed men followed him at about 11:30 that evening at San Marcelino Street and that his vehicle was blocked by three cars and one motorcycle, all passengers by which were fully armed by armalite. Two of the cars were TMG cars and the other, a civilian red car. Gov. Singson told the mayor with whom he was talking over the phone that they should all go to San Marcelino, behind Jai-Alai because of an emergency. His driver was instructed by Gov. Singson not to open the door of his vehicle. [TSN dated July 29, 2002, pp. 11-19] PAOC men signaled Gov. Singson to get out of his vehicle, a bullet-proof Ford Super Van but he refused. He went out of the van after the mayors arrived one after another. The PAOC team told Gov. Singson that they received information that he had a blinker that, although he did not use it, mere possession was already a violation and that they wanted to bring this to Crame and after he suggested that he be given a ticket of the volation but he instead asked that they go to the police precincts at the United Nations Avenue. Only the two TMG Officers went to the police precinct with Gov. Singson who rode in his own van. There were media people at the police precinct. When asked why he was being harassed although he was influencial to the FPres. Estrada, Gov. Singson replied to the media that he will expose the anomalies of FPres. Estrada. [Ibid, pp. 20-26] The following day the incident was published in the newspapers and shown on television. The group of FPres. Esrada tried to settle with Singson. JV Ejercito was the first to call repeatedly (every two minutes) to ask Gov. Singson to return the call of FPres. Estrada, Gov. Singson called the latter who asked that they talk because he was confused with the problems of the Abu Sayyaf and the First Lady. Gov. Singson replied he had already given his word. They talked for the second time and then third time, it was FPres. Estrada himself who called. The next person to call was Atong Ang who was pleading to Gov. Singson to fix the matter. Gov. Singson brought up the P130 Million from the excise tax which Gov. Singson said was taken by Atong Ang and FPres. Estrada. Atong Ang promised that the said amount will be returned to Gov. Singson and that the "Bingo 2 Balls" will be given to Gov. Singson. Gov. Singson informed him that it was too late. Atong Ang called Gov. Singson about twenty (20) times [Ibid, pp. 27-37] After Atong Ang, Former Secretary Alfredo Lim called to convince Gov. Singson to settle and to see FPres. Estrada. Alfredo Lim asked Gov. Singson to proceed with the press conference but he should put the blame on Atong Ang and that they will take care of Atong Ang. Alfredo Lim gestured with his right fist thumb down. Gov. Singson understood this to mean that Atong Ang will be killed. Gov. Singson did not agree because he might be implicated. He asked them to look for a good reason. [Ibid, pp. 38-42) The next to call Gov. Singson was Jinggoy Estrada. The latter and Gov. Singson talked on October 8, 2000. Jinggoy Estrada also sent many emissaries to talk with Gov. Singson. That evening Gov. Singson went to Cardinal Sin at his San Miguel Residence. Gov. Singson explained to Cardinal Sin the situation and left to him the evidences so that in case anything happens to Gov. Singson, he would know who will be responsible. Gov. Singson saw the Cardinal with his sisters. Cardinal Sin told Gov. Singson to go ahead that he will pray for Gov. Singson and that God will be with them. [Ibid, pp. 42-26] Gov. Singson returned to his house at 10:00 o’clock in the evening where Jinggoy Estrada called him and sent emissaries again to Gov. Singson. At 12:00 midnight Jinggoy Estrada and some friends of his arrived at Gov. Singson’s house in Blue Ridge, Quezon City. Jinggoy Estrada pleaded to Gov. Singson until 3:00 o’clock the following morning. Gov. Singson told Jinggoy Estrada that it was too late because his press conference will happen in a while and all that the Estradas could do was to deny what Gov. Singson will reveal at the press conference. He further said to Jinggoy Estrada that he will not mention the latter’s name. [Ibid, pp. 46-51] Gov. Singson proceeded with his press conference on October 9, 2000 at Club Filipino. He gave the two reasons: first, FPres. Estrada insulted him and wanted him killed so he was not a true friend anymore; and second, he already had the evidence and they will kill him even if he did not pursue his planned press conference. It was better for him to be killed with honor and to show how corrupt the government was under the Estrada Administration. According to Gov. Singson, FPres. Estrada wanted to replace jueteng with "Bingo-2-Balls" because he will earn more, about Fifty Million Pesos (P50,000,000.00) a day. Gov. Singson explained how much FPres. Estrada would receive from "Bingo 2 Balls". [Ibid, pp. 51-59] Gov. Singson also mentioned that FPres. Estrada owned the "Boracay Mansion" in New Manila. He identified this property through a computer generated picture (Exh. P8). [Ibid, pp. 60-67] Gov. Singson also described the house of FPres. Estrada at Polk St., Greenhills which he had visited frequently as well as the house of the FPres. in P. Guevarra Street which was just 2 to 3 kilometers away from Polk Street. [Ibid, pp. 68-72] Gov. Singson testified as to the other properties of FPres. Estrada like Fontainbleau, Inc., a casino. A check (Exh. V6) payable the order of Fonteinbleau, Inc. was among the checks turned over to Ricaforte. Gov. Singson helped put up the said casino for FPres. Estrada. However, his name does not appear as an incorporator of the said company in its Articles of Incorporation (Exh. 22). According to Gov. Singson, the shares in the company were distributed as follows: five percent (5%) to Butch Tenorio, the President of the casino; twenty-five percent (25%) for Gov. Singson; seventy percent (70%) for FPres. Estrada which were placed in the names of Jaime Dichaves and his classmate Susie Pineda. [Ibid, pp. 72-76] To prove his close relationship with FPres. Estrada, Gov. Singson mentioned that Jacob, a son of the FPres. Estrada by Laarni Enriquez, was his baptismal godson while FPres. Estrada stood as sponsor (in the wedding with his two children, Racquel and Randy). [Ibid, pp.76-78] On cross examination, Gov. Singson was confronted with his testimony during the Senate impeachment trial, contained in the transcript of the stenographic notes of the proceedings held on December 13, 2000 at pages 234 and 235 (Exh. 28-Serapio and submarkings). In the said testimony, Gov. Singson did not mention that Serapio was present when he turned over to Ricaforte the jueteng protection money, partly in cash and partly in check. [TSN dated July 29, 2002, pp. 147-150] Gov. Singson insisted that Serapio was present but he was being confused by the Senators sympathetic to FPres. Estrada. It appears, however, that Singson was not asked during impeachment proceedings who were present during the aforementioned turn-over of jueteng protection money. [Ibid, pp. 150-151] Gov. Singson also testified that he did not know if Ricaforte withdrew the amount in cash. Gov. Singson was only told by Ricaforte that she gave the Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00) to Serapio. [Ibid, pp. 153-156 Gov. Singson also admitted that the P200,000,000.00 were transferred to the Muslim Youth Foundation, Inc. [Ibid, p. 156] and that he likewise testified before the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee on October 17, 2000, as shown by the transcript of Stenographic Notes of the hearing of that Committee (Exh. 29 and submarkings). Ibid, pp. 158-159]. Gov. Singson acknowledged that he had came across the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation, Inc. (Exh 1-Serapio and submarkings). The said foundation’s Certificate of Incorporation was dated November 17, 2000, and that the Articles of Incorporation was dated February 15, 2000. [Ibid, pp. 167-168] Gov. Singson saw for the first time during his cross-examination the certification of the Branch Manager of Equitable-PCI Bank that the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation, Inc. maintained an account in the total amount of Two Hundred Three Million One Hundred Thirty-Six Thousand Nine Hundred Thirty-One Pesos and Twenty Seven Centavos (P203,136,931.27) (Exh 17; 17-a-Serapio). [Ibid, p. 169] EMMA BARBON LIM (Emma Lim) worked for Gov. Singson since July 1987 as Liaison Officer at the latter’s private office in LCS Building, San Andres corner Diamante Street, San Andres Bukid, Metro Manila. LCS stood for Luis Chavit Singson. Emma Lim did personal errands for Gov. Singson, like collecting jueteng money from different persons for FPres. Estrada pursuant to the instructions of Gov. Singson. As early as January 1999, Emma Lim was already receiving deliveries of jueteng money. Gov. Singson told her to take care of the money that she was receiving because it was not the money of Gov. Singson but of FPres. Estrada. She started collecting jueteng money sometime in April 1999. She personally went to the person from whom she collected the money. She knew that it
