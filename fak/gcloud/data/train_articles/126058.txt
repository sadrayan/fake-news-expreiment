President Obama’s Daughter Malia Confirmed Pregnant?
On 28 November 2014, the Empire News web site published an article reporting that President Obama’s 16-year-old daughter Malia (who is now 18) was pregnant:

In what promises to be the biggest White House scandal since intern fellatio, President Barack Obama’s daughter, 16-year-old Malia, has confirmed that she is pregnant. For now, Malia is staying hush-hush about the father’s identity, but one thing she would say is that he is white. “My mom always hoped I would get with a nice mixed-race man like dad, but love is so colorblind.
