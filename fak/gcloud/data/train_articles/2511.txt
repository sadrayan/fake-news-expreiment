Religious Exemptions at Center of ENDA Debate
As the Senate prepares to debate legislation barring discrimination against gay and lesbian workers, people on both sides are looking closely at a provision that would exempt a wide swath of religious organizations from new rules. Some conservatives are hoping to exempt more organizations from the billâ€™s protections, which would anger Democrats who argue they have already compromised on this point.

The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, is now believed to have 59 backers, including every Senate Democrat and four Republicans. Supporters are looking to a half dozen other Republicans as possible yes votes to produce the 60 needed to pass the Senate. Debate is set to begin Monday.
