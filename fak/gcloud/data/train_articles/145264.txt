Chuck E. Cheese Brawl in Lincoln Park Leads to Two Arrests
CHICAGO â€” Two people were arrested after getting into a brawl Sunday night while waiting in line for prizes at Lincoln Park's Chuck E. Cheese, police said.

Police responded to a call of a large group of people fighting at the kids entertainment center in the 1800 block of West Fullerton Avenue about 7:10 p.m., said Officer Jose Estrada, a Chicago Police Department spokesman.

The fight was prompted by a disagreement among patrons waiting in line to redeem tickets for game prizes, Estrada said.

Three adults suffered minor injuries but were not taken to hospitals, he said.

Arrested were Shambreya Barfield, 21, of the 3800 block of Broadway and Trevell Washington, also 21, of the 2100 block of West Monroe Street.

Barfield was charged with one count of misdemeanor battery, and Washington was charged with two counts of misdemeanor battery, Estrada said.
