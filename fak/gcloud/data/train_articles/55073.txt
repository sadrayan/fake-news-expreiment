Unapproved O’Rourke text message asks for undocumented immigrant’ vote
A person who a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s Senate campaign said was pretending to be a "texting team" volunteer sent an unauthorized message to voters Wednesday asking them to help "transport undocumented immigrants" to the polls.

"Hi, it’s Patsy here w/ Beto for Texas. Our records indicate that you’re a supporter," the message reads. "We are in search of volunteers to help transport undocumented immigrants to polling booths so that they will be able [sic] vote. Would you be able to support this grassroots effort?"

The text message circulated on social media Wednesday afternoon. By the evening, the campaign denied authorizing the message.

"It was sent by an impostor," spokesman Chris Evans told the American-Statesman in a text message Wednesday evening. "But we’re continuing to look into what happened."

The campaign used similar language in a subsequent text message to voters who received the message.

"An imposter signed up to be a volunteer on our texting team and texted you today with a message that was not approved by the campaign," read the follow-up message. "We’re very sorry about this and have taken the necessary steps to make sure that they do not continue sending text messages with our campaign."

Houston resident Frank Freeman received the ‘impostor’ message at 3:49 p.m. Wednesday, he told the Statesman.

"I thought it was hilarious," recalled Freeman, an O’Rourke supporter. "It’s pretty transparent."

On Freeman’s phone, the text split into two separate messages, breaking after the word "undocumented," which someone could easily overlook, he said.

Abilene resident Zach Snyder received the same message at 3:50 p.m. Wednesday, he told the Statesman.

"That is obviously a fake," Snyder said he recalled thinking. "It’s just an outrageous and terrible thing to do, because it’s trying to fool people."

O’Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso, faces incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who is running for a second six-year term in Congress.
