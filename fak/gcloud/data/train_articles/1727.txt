Beer Industry of Florida releases statement on proposed Florida beer legislation
Press Release:

(Tallahassee, FL) – “The Beer Industry of Florida (BIF) does not support current proposals that would virtually eliminate retail privileges for brewers. Brewers and distributors are good partners and some craft brewers need limited retail privileges to build their businesses. Therefore, it’s in distributors’ interest that small brewers should have a well-defined, limited exception in the statute that allows them to operate as retailers, both on-premise and off-premise.”

“The Beer Industry of Florida has supported the 64-ounce container, also known as the ‘growler’ for three years in a row, with no strings attached. The trade association, which consists of MillerCoors beer distributors from across the state, has also supported bills that would preserve Florida’s state-based system of alcohol regulation, placing reasonable restrictions on brewers’ ability to operate as retailers.”

“BIF will work with policy makers and industry members to permit limited retail privileges and other innovations sought by craft brewers, such as the 64-ounce “growler” container. However, it will oppose vertical integration of the industry that allows an industry member to operate in all three tiers in an unrestricted manner.”

The Beer Industry of Florida, Inc. is a 501(C)6 trade association dedicated to promoting the responsible consumption of alcohol and the preservation of the three-tier system of alcohol distribution and regulation.
