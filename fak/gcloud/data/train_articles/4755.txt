African-American activists defend their home against violent attacks

Williams remembers the threats that white segregationists made against her family, and when Robert and others helped defend the house of a black physician, accused of giving a white woman an abortion. The defenders "had trenches and sandbags," and made Molotov cocktails to use against the cars they expected. This defense effort spurred the creation of a rifle club Monroe's African Americans used to train themselves in self-defense. Robert concealed the group's racial identity and secured recognition from the National Rifle Association. Williams believes that the gun was an equalizing tool for black Americans.
