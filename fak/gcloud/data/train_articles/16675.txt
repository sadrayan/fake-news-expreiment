Lauren:

An update: From the TEA website, it looks to me like there were 332,767 students in 12th grade in 2016-17 compared to 408,202 students in ninth grade three years before. Can you point us toward, or share, the number of public high school graduates in 2016-17?

We do not yet have an annual count for 2016-2017 graduates – our team continues to vet this data. We expect it to be available within a week or two and would be happy to share the annual count with you when it is available.

However, we would note that this will only be an annual count of graduates. The number you have provided us above is a count for all 12th graders in the 2016-2017 year. There is no way to determine which cohort each student belongs to – and the rates you are looking at below are considered a cohort rate. The annual count of grade 12 students includes students from multiple cohorts - students who started with a different group of first-time ninth-graders – for example, students who were retained or who accelerated their studies.

If you are looking for the cohort rates for the class of 2016-2017 (or five- or six-year rates for the classes of 2016 and 2015), those will be available in the summer of 2018.

Thanks again,

g.

Subject: Fresh queries about graduation rates

Lauren:

It looks to us here that in 2015-16, Texas had the nation’s fifth-highest graduation rate. Has TEA analyzed these figures or written reports on the rankings?

We publish an annual report called the Secondary School Completion and Dropouts in Texas Public Schools. You will notice that the national cohort rate included in our last available report (for the 2015-2016 school year, released in August of 2017) is obtained from NCES and is included on page 118 of the report. Please note that the national cohort page in our latest report reflects graduation rates for the class of 2015. The data you have provided us in your link above will be included in our next report for the class of 2016-2017.

Alternatively, how did Texas rank in 2015-16 for its averaged freshman graduation rate?

We do not calculate an averaged freshman graduation rate at the state level – we report all data to NCES, and they use that data to calculate and release rates. They last calculated an AFGR for the 2012-2013 school year, which you will find on page 120 of the 2015-2016 report. https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/dropcomp_2015-16.pdf

Please note on page 117 of the same report the definition used by NCES to calculate the average freshman graduation rate.

It also looks like Texas previously ranked higher for its graduation rate compared to other states, as we reported here. Is that shift in rank accurate?

Yes, the rankings merely reflect relative performance and are accurate to the extent that the rates used for the rankings are accurate. However, we would like to also note that our graduation rate has consistently increased year over year for each graduating class. You can check statewide four-year graduation rates here: https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/dropcomp/years.html#campsum

Anything else you’d recommend we consider in analyzing whether Texas ranks among the top five states for its high school graduation rate?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks,

g.
