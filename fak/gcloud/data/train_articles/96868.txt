Wisconsin Governor-elect Scott Walker wants concessions from state labor unions to help cut the stateâ€™s budget deficit. Walker wants state workers to pay more for health insurance and contribute up to five percent of their salaries into the state pension system. During an appearance yesterday at the Milwaukee Press Club, Walker said he would also consider de-certifying state unions to help him get the changes he wants.



Such a change would set a precedent.



Milwaukee labor historian Ken Germanson says the unionization of state workers dates back to just after the Great Depression.
