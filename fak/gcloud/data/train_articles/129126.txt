Wendy Faulkner
What Is This Foundation All About?

Wendy Faulkner was brutally murdered on September 11, 2001 with thousands of others in the cowardly attack by Islamic terrorists on the World Trade Center. She was in the South Tower for a business meeting in her professional capacity as an Information Systems Vice President and has never been found.



Her personal loves were her family and friends along with a lifelong personal mission to help others less fortunate than herself by sending them boxes of much needed supplies every month, year after year. She was an extraordinary woman with an almost inexhaustable ability to care about and help others. To honor her memory in an appropriate and loving way, her husband and daughters founded this not-for-profit foundation to continue Wendy's mission of sending boxes of clothing, personal care items and small toys to unfortunate children and their caregivers around the world.



We are a not-for-profit 501(c)3 Ohio corporation committed to carrying on our beloved wife and mother's expression of God's love and generousity for many years to come. Please come back often as we develop this web site to learn about our work and how you can assist.



If you approve of our efforts, please consider making a tax-deductable donation to help some great and needy kids while keeping a very special lady's memory alive and active. God bless you and America!
