Shockingly Sad Photos Of Michael Jackson's Dead Body Surface, Shown In Court!
Today in the MJ murder trial, prosecutors showed a picture of Michael Jackson's lifeless body, taken several hours after the pop legend had passed.

The haunting image is of MJ naked and deceased, laid out on a gurney, prepared for an autopsy. It should be noted that the date in this photograph is incorrect and was explained by the autopsy doctor. It should read June 25th, the date of Michael's death.

We're warning you now: these pictures are not for the faint of heart. They are quite sad and distrubing. Please click the jump to view the pictures at your own risk.
