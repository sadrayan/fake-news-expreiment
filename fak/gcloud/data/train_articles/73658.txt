Clean Care of New England
Ability To Work With The Insurance Companies

Working with any insurance company (Home, Auto, Life, Health, etc..) can be a difficult and confusing task to say the least. The paperwork for coverage and follow up can be a nightmare for the home or business owner. Clean Care of New England will walk you through this process step by step.

Ability to Handle Mold, Fire, Smoke and Water Damage

When a major accident within the home occurs, rarely does it just cause damage of one kind. For example, when there is a fire in the bathroom, usually there is significant smoke and water damage that leads to mold if not handled properly. Or when a major pipe breaks and flooding occurs it can lead to an electrical malfunction and sometimes a fire. We have your back.
