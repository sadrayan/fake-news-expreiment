The House and Senate began this year's 60-day legislative session with vastly different positions, most of which appeared settled by the time lawmakers adjourned Monday night.

But the Legislature left Tallahassee without agreeing on a gambling compact with the Seminole Tribe or a policy governing the use of medical marijuana.

The details of major issues that stood between the House and Senate were hashed out behind closed doors by House Speaker Richard Corcoran and Senate President Joe Negron as they negotiated next year’s proposed $83 billion budget.

After talks, which were contentious at times, Corcoran, R-Land O’ Lakes, and Negron, R-Stuart, agreed to support major issues from either chamber. Negron won millions for higher education and money for a reservoir he wants to build south of Lake Okeechobee, which was later approved by Gov. Rick Scott. Corcoran got more than $500 million he sought for K-12 education and a promise from Negron to support deep cuts to Enterprise Florida and VISIT FLORIDA and his plan to eliminate 21 other corporate incentive programs.

Also during their behind-the-scenes negotiations, Negron and Corcoran agreed to details of a bill added to the budget that would expand charter schools to struggling school districts, guarantee recess for elementary schools, and promise bonuses for schoolteachers. That work led to the session being extended three days.

Now, the fate of much of what the Legislature wants is headed to the desk of Gov. Rick Scott, who hasn't been shy about his disapproval of the process.

“I ran for Governor to fight career politicians and it’s backroom deals like this that make families think politics is nothing more than a game,�? Scott said of the Legislature-approved budget. “I am beginning to review the budget and I have the option of vetoing the entire budget or vetoing the items that circumvented the transparent process and do not have an acceptable return on investment for hardworking taxpayers.�?

Budget Battle

House and Senate leaders are braced for a robust round of vetoes from Scott, who saw all of his budget requests ignored by the Legislature.

But Senate President Negron believes there’s much in the $83 billion spending plan for the governor to like.

“There’s a lot in this budget the governor should be proud of,�? Negron said. “There are many issues I think he has supported in the past or he said he would support.�?

House Speaker Corcoran praised his "Schools of Hope" plan, which encourages high-performing charter networks to expand within struggling school districts, as “one of the greatest education plans in the history of the state.�?

Legislative leaders also highlighted other education-related budget accomplishments, including $234 million for the state's Best and Brightest teacher bonus program, $300 million to beef up the state’s 12 universities and $300 million to expand the state’s Bright Futures Scholarship and other student tuition assistance programs.

The two chambers also agreed to a $185 million tax cut package, which includes six days of no sales tax, a small decrease in a tax on commercial leases and an exemption on feminine hygiene products.

As for VISIT FLORIDA, the Legislature agreed to slash the state tourism promoter's budget from $76 million to $25 million. Under its plan, Enterprise Florida would receive $16 million rather than the $23.5 million the state’s economic development partnership received this year. The reduction would virtually eliminate marketing budgets for both agencies.

“They’re playing politics,�? Scott told reporters in Miami on Monday night. “These dollars mean jobs.�?

Medical Marijuana

Florida lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a complicated set of rules to implement Amendment 2, the voter-approved constitutional change that greatly expands who can use medical marijuana.

And while key legislative leaders are saying they need to reconvene for a special session on the issue, no one has actually committed to it yet.

“I absolutely believe the will of the people of this state is to have the members of the Legislature they elected debate and discuss the issue of medical marijuana,�? House Speaker Richard Corcoran said. “I believe it would be a gross injustice to allow these decisions to be made by a group of bureaucrats at the (Florida) Department of Health.�?

Senate President Joe Negron said he’s also open to the idea, and also said the Legislature should make the rules, not the Department of Health.

Either the two must jointly call legislators back to Tallahassee for a special session or Gov. Rick Scott can do it on his own.

Seventy-one percent of voters approved Amendment 2 in November. It broadens those who can receive medical marijuana from a limited number of people with seizures and terminal illness to a much broader group suffering from AIDS, HIV, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and any debilitating illness a physician thinks medical marijuana could help.

It allows patients who are diagnosed with any of those qualifying conditions to receive full-strength marijuana, not just the non-euphoric varieties.

Negotiations between the House and Senate fell apart over the expansion of businesses that can grow and sell medical marijuana. The Department said it will continue to work on making rules to implement Amendment 2.

State Workers

The Senate kept its word and delivered to state workers a pay praise — if Gov. Rick Scott signs off on the plan. Lawmakers agreed to a $1,400 increase for employees making under $40,000 and a $1,000 hike for those making more. There also are additional increases for law enforcement and corrections officers in the proposed state budget.

“This is a beginning,�? said Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee. “Hopefully we can get back to the point where we can expect a pay raise every year. When the cost of living goes up salaries should follow.�?

State workers have seen inflation eat 20 percent of their pay since their last across-the-board raise in 2006 — a 3.5 percent hike in 2013 came after workers were required to make pension contributions.

This year’s increase also comes with a tradeoff.

In exchange for the raise, the Senate had to accept House changes to the workers’ benefits package. The Department of Management Services will come up with a four-option health insurance plan to replace the current one-size fits all by 2020.

House proponents said a tiered system would save money. Opponents didn’t buy it.

“What we are creating is an entirely new system that has a lot of uncertainty,�? said Rep. Loranne Ausley, D-Tallahassee. Ausley argued the only way the plan could save money would be to reduce benefits.

The Senate also agreed to a House plan for the Florida Retirement System default option. New hires will have nine months to choose between a traditional pension and a 401(k)-like savings plan. If no selection is made the worker will default into the savings plan.

K-12 Education

Public education moved to center stage in the 2017 session’s final hours. House and Senate negotiators assembled a trainload of initiatives into one bill which was part of a negotiated budget deal. HB 7069 included 20 separate topics including fewer tests, mandatory recess, a teacher bonus program and a plan to recruit charter school operators to neighborhoods with low-performing public schools.

The new budget increases day-to-day school spending by $241 million. Annual per-pupil spending would be about $24 more this coming year. Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee, voted against the plan.

“This could be one of the most serious challenges that traditional public education has had in a number of years,�? said Montford. “Twenty of our school districts will get less money than the current year. It’s going to be a lean, tough year for the school districts.�?

The education package does away with the Algebra II end-of-course exam, allows districts to not include student performance on standardized tests in teacher evaluations and directs the Department of Education to investigate using college-entrance exams to replace some state high school tests.

Much of the drama during the session’s final day centered on a House plan to use $140 million to entice charter school operators to set up near academically struggling traditional public schools. The Schools of Hope proposal includes an additional $2,000 per student to provide “wrap-around�? services like food, medicine, and other resources to help students learn.

The plan was overwhelmingly approved by the House and cleared the Senate with a two-vote margin.

The Best and Brightest teacher bonus program also would vastly expand over the next three school years. Every teacher rated “effective�? would get $800. Teachers rated “highly effective�? would get $1,200.

Health care

The biggest health care story of this year’s lawmaking session was the $521 million hit hospitals took in cuts from the state and federal governments for serving poor patients through Medicaid.

The money was shifted to pay for other state priorities like charter schools, a reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee and higher education.

Lawmakers hope to give some of the money back to hospitals through a Medicaid-related program known the low-income pool that gives hospitals extra money for serving poor and indigent patients.

The state’s Agency for Health Care Administration secured $1.5 billion in funds, up from $608 million last year, for the low-income pool. But, this money will not be amended to the agency’s budget until it can finalize its agreement with the federal government.

Local governments and hospitals are concerned they won’t be able to raise enough money to draw down the full amount.

Most health care policy bills died in the Legislature. One bill that did pass in the final hours was a state group health insurance bill sponsored by House Health Care Appropriations chair Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford.

The measure will, among other things, direct the state to contract with at least one provider that gives average prices for health care services by county and allow state employees to purchase additional medical procedures through tax-free reimbursements from the state.

Higher education

The Legislature approved Sen. Joe Negron’s ambitious higher education spending plan, giving a huge boost to the state’s 12 public universities and student assistance. Negron made a priority of higher education this session on the belief that Florida, the third largest state in the country, should have the best university system.

The $8 billion higher education budget includes $5 billion for the 12 public universities — a $300 million boost with no tuition increase.

Half would be split between the universities for operating expenses, hiring new faculty and building and maintenance. That includes $70.5 million for recruiting faculty and researchers, $52 million for preeminent universities and $50 million for the State University Professional and Graduate Degree Excellence Program.

Student financial aid would also get a $300 million increase to expand the Bright Future Scholarship program to include summer terms and to pay for textbooks and other student aid.

The plan includes $152 million to reinstate the Bright Futures Academic Scholars awards and provide a textbook stipend. It also includes $39.5 million for Bright Futures to extend over the summer term.

It also created the Florida Farmworker Student Scholarship fund with $500,000.

The budget expanded the needs-based Florida Student assistance grants by nearly $121 million, and the Benacquisto scholarship received $1.4 million.

While the state’s universities benefited, the state colleges did not. The $2.2 billion budget slashed $30 million from developmental education

Gambling

Lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on gambling for the third legislative session in a row that would have secured $3 billion over the next seven years for state coffers by renegotiating the state’s deal with the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

Had the House, which is generally against expanding gambling, and Senate, which is generally in favor of expanding gambling, been able to reconcile their vast differences, the state also would have been able to resolve a slew of state and federal lawsuits.

In the last five years, at least 20 lawsuits have been filed testing the boundaries of Florida’s control over the facets of gambling, many of which have expanded gaming across the state.

One of the lawsuits centers on the crux of the two chambers’ disagreement over gambling: whether to allow eight counties that have voted by referendum in favor of slot machines to have them.

The lawsuit could be decided as early as this summer. If state courts allow gaming in the counties, the state legislature would lose its decision-making power. Tallahassee nonprofit Voters in Charge also is pushing a 2018 constitutional ballot amendment that would require voters to approve the expansion of gambling in Florida.

Since lawmakers failed to pass a renegotiated agreement with the tribe or settle litigation, the tribe’s lawyer, Barry Richard, said the tribe could stop paying the state altogether.

According to the state's latest economic forecast in March, the tribe was expected to bring in an additional $1.2 billion in revenue for the state by 2026.

Gun Rights

Second Amendment enthusiasts expected this to be the year of the gun. They were loaded for bear once Sen. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, the legislature’s foremost advocate for loosening gun regulations, was appointed chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The panel, in recent years, had become Dead Man’s Hill for gun rights advocates, the place where gun bills go to die.

Eighteen bills addressing gun regulations were filed including one to repeal all gun-free zones and more targeted ones to allow open-carry on campus, at government meetings and in unsecured areas of airports.

They all failed to run the legislative gauntlet to the governor’s desk.

Judiciary remained the obstacle. Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Miami, took on the role once played by former Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla and stopped the gun bills in their tracks.

“We represent individuals from different parts of the state that have obviously different viewpoints,�? Flores explained to Steube after supporting his proposal to allow weapons permit holders to bring their guns into a courthouse.

“Anything that goes beyond that I will not allow in the Senate,�? said Flores, who held the deciding vote in Judiciary. “My word and my commitment is something I hold to be very sacred.�?

South Florida Water Wars

Senate President Joe Negron traded a number of Senate priorities, including a controversial property tax break, to secure funding to build a reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee.

The newly signed law, which is different from the initial proposal but still lauded by environmentalists, would enable the state to borrow up to $800 million for the state-federal project capped at $64 million a year.

Negron argued throughout the negotiation the reservoir would help reduce the amount of toxic blue-green slime the lake released into the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee watersheds.

In his first measure, Negron proposed the state purchase 60,000 acres of land owned by sugarcane farmers in order to store 360,000-acre feet of water.

After the sugar industry fought the proposal, Negron changed the bill to use land already purchased by the state for a reservoir to store 240,000 acre-feet of water south of the lake.

Once the changes were made, Gov. Scott and other former detractors, lent their support to the project.

Scott wanted an additional $200 million to repair the Herbert Hoover Dike but it was not included in the Legislature's budget.
