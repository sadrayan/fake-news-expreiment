Setting the Record Straight: In New Immigration Ad, McCaskill Lies About Record

Senator flip-flopped on sanctuary cities, supports open borders, against citizenship question on the 2020 Census

COLUMBIA, Mo. – In a new TV ad about border security, Senator Claire McCaskill is lying to Missourians about her record.

Hawley Campaign Press Secretary Kelli Ford said, “Claire McCaskill will do anything to hold on to power, even lie to Missourians about her record on immigration. She isn’t tough on border security. She’s weak and her record proves it. She thinks the border wall is ‘embarrassing,’ has flip-flopped on sanctuary cities, refuses to ask who is and isn’t a citizen, and wants to pass catch-and-release legislation. Instead of standing for security, she stood with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.

“That record would get her re-elected in New York or California, but not Missouri, and Senator McCaskill knows it. That’s exactly why she is trying to deceive voters about her work on immigration. She has richly earned the title of the most unpopular senator on a ballot this fall because she doesn’t stand with Missouri, she only cares about opposing President Trump. And she’s willing to sacrifice our safety and security in order to make that happen.”
