Stranger Things season 2: Directors promise there will be 'justice for Barb'
Stranger Things directors promise there will be justice for Barb in season two

While Netflix are yet to confirm whether or not Stranger Things will return for a second season, the directors have promised that if it does get the green light there will be "justice for Barb".

Fans of the show are not impressed that the town of Hawkins in Indiana appeared to forget that Barb was killed in The Upside Down after she went missing one night.

But now the series creators have promised that they will address her death if Stranger Things returns.

Director Matt Duffer vowed: "We'll make sure there's some justice for Barb.

"People get very frustrated, understandably, that the town doesn't seem to be really dealing with Barb. That stuff is all happening. We're just not spending any screen time on it."
