"The Big Bang Theory" The Workplace Proximity (TV Episode 2013)
Amy has the opportunity to work on a project at Cal Tech for a couple of months, which means that she and Sheldon would be at the same workplace. To her surprise, Sheldon is all right with her accepting the contract. But after Sheldon talks to his friends about the situation, he heeds Howard's advice about working with one's significant other not being a good idea because of too much togetherness. As such, Sheldon tells Amy that she can no longer accept the contract. A hurt Amy, who has already accepted the contract, vows to Sheldon that she will respect his space at Cal Tech. It ends up that Sheldon may be the one who will not be able to leave Amy alone at their joint work situation. Meanwhile, Howard's comments get back to Bernadette, who decides that if they can't work together, they may as well not live together either. Written by Huggo
