London terror attack hoax: police tell Tube commuters to 'keep calm'
The Metropolitan police have told Londoners to “keep calm and carry on” after a hoax text warning of a terror attack on the Tube was circulated.

The message, which went viral yesterday, said police were preparing for an imminent terror attack on the London Underground today.

The message read: “Don’t travel on the tubes tomorrow. Every single police officer in the Met has been called into work from 4am onwards, even people on holiday are being told to catch the next flight home.

“They think there is a terror threat and that it will happen on the tubes tomorrow around the West End area. So don’t go travelling on the tubes! It’s better to be safe than sorry.”

The message then asks the receiver to pass it on to all of their friends.

A Metropolitan spokesman confirmed the message was a hoax, saying “this rumour is completely untrue.”

Chief Superintendent Paul Brogden of the British Transport police tweeted: "Social media contains lots of rumours regarding threats to tube network tomorrow. There is no specific threat so keep calm & carry on."

The hoax comes after the government raised the terror threat from substantial to severe, the second highest state, amid fears of returning jihadists from Syria and Iraq.

The severe warning means a terror attack is “highly likely”, although Home Secretary Theresa May has stressed there was no intelligence about a specific attack.
