Starnes: University Hosts 'Stop White People' Workshop
By Todd Starnes

Nothing screams tolerance and diversity like a university workshop designed to target white people.

The State University of New York in Binghamton has a bit of explaining to do after they held a workshop titled, “#StopWhitePeople2K16.”

The workshop was an official part of the residential assistant training program at the taxpayer-funded university.

The Binghamton Review, the university’s conservative newspaper, exposed this nonsense and they deserve a round of applause for their efforts.

It’s not exactly clear how they intend to stop all of us white folks, but the course smacks of blatant bigotry disguised as cultural awareness.
