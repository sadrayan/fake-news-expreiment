Good afternoon. I write on behalf of the Austin American-Statesman and the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project seeking any public records related to the 1995 arrest for burglary of Robert Francis O’Rourke, DOB 9/26/1972.

I’d be happy to hear back soon by phone or email. ONLY if necessary, please consider this a request made under the Texas Public Information Act.

Thanks for your help,

Dear Mr. Gardner Selby:

Your request, received 08/20/2018, has been forwarded to me and is being treated as a request for records under the Texas Public Information Act (Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §552.001 et seq.). You requested the following information:

"...I seek public records related to the September 1998 arrest of Robert O’Rourke, DOB 9/26/1972, for DWI. O’Rourke may have had the charge dismissed in 1999 after completing a court-recommended DWI program. I am interested in all records including documents related to the arrest, detention if any and disposition.".

Please be advised that I have been informed that there are no responsive documents pertaining to your request. As no responsive documents have been located, there is no charge associated with this response and your request is now considered closed.

Sincerely,

Martin G Rodriguez
