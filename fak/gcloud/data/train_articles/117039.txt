Wisconsin company to install microchips in employees
A Wisconsin company announced this week that it plans to install microchips in employees, but they are insisting there will be 'no GPS tracking'.

Three Square Market, a company that designs software for break room markets, is about to become the first in the US to offer microchip implants to its employees.

According to their press release, the program will be optional for employees and the company will begin implementation on August 1.

The implanted Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) chip will allow workers to make purchases in their break room micro market, open doors, login to computers, use the copy machine, among other things.

'Eventually, this technology will become standardized allowing you to use this as your passport, public transit, all purchasing opportunities, etc,' Three Market Square CEO, Todd Westby, said.

The company is expecting over 50 staff members to be voluntarily chipped with the technology that is no larger than a small grain of rice.

Employees will have the chip implanted between the thumb and forefinger underneath the skin.

Westby explained that users of the chip will scan their items at a break room market kiosk and hit pay with a credit card.

Chip users will then hold their hands up, similar to how consumers pay for products using their cellphones, and it'll pay for the product.

Each chip costs $300 and the company will pay for them. Westby said the data is both encrypted and secure and for those wondering, 'there's no GPS tracking at all'.
