Where Were You on 9-11?: Janette Reynolds: 9780972284202: Amazon.com: Books
Format: Paperback

When I read the overview on this book I thought the author had hit upon a great idea for a book. But I was very disapointed after reading it. I expected the author to gather interviews with people who were either closely tied to the 9/11 attacks or were in some unique situation that made their stories compelling. There is some of that in this book such as the interview with a US Senator and one with a guide who just came out of the Grand Canyon but for the most part, the people interviewed do not have particularly interesting stories to tell. Only a small part of each chapter is devoted to truly presenting "where they were on 9/11". Too much space is devoted to giving the background on who these people are and their opinions on why the attacks ocurred and how America will be affected. That may be interesting for some but not what attracted me to this book.



I found myself doing more skimming than reading. Too much filler. Too few truly compelling "Where were you" stories.
