Hillary accuses Walker of raising taxes on students

CLAREMONT, N.H. — One day after swinging at Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton set her sights on Scott Walker during a town hall here on the rainy border with Vermont.

“Take Gov. Walker of Wisconsin, who seems to be delighted in slashing higher education in his state, in making it more difficult for students to get scholarships and pay off their debt, eliminating opportunities for young people who are doctors or dentists to actually work in underserved areas in return for having their debt relieved, ending scholarships for poor kids,” Clinton said Tuesday while rolling out her new education plan in the second day of a quick swing through the Granite State.

“And, most surprisingly to me, [Walker rejected] legislation that would have made it tax-deductible for you on your income tax, to deduct the amount of your loan payment. I don’t know why he wants to raise taxes on students, but that is the result.”

In Exeter on Monday, Clinton used multiple questions about Republican firebrand Donald Trump as an opportunity to throw elbows at Rubio for his positions on abortion. She regularly rails against Jeb Bush on the campaign trail, as well.

Walker, Rubio and Bush are widely regarded within Clinton’s circles as the candidates with the best shot at winning the Republican nomination, and the trio has been eager to fight back against the presumptive Democratic nominee.

Bush was set to go after Clinton extensively in a foreign policy speech on Tuesday evening, and both Rubio and Walker have recently spoken of her as if she were their main opponent, rather than the 17-person Republican field.
