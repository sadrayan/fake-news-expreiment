Subsidies Awarded to Amazon: at least $2,463,000,000… and Counting!

This web page tallies state and local economic development subsidy deals given to Amazon.com, Inc. for its warehouses, data centers, and film productions, and to its subsidiaries such as Whole Foods Supermarket, Zappos and Audible. For each subsidized project, we include: year awarded, state and city or county, estimated subsidy cost and the type of facility.

Since our exposé, we have encountered greater secrecy surrounding tax-break packages awarded to Amazon. This sometimes makes calculating such costs difficult. Secret project names, non-disclosure agreements, and a reluctance by public officials to fully disclose costs -- even after a deal has been awarded -- suggests Amazon and public officials know these deals have become controversial.

We will continue to publish on Amazon, as have many other retailers, especially as the drama plays out for its second headquarters, or "HQ2" tax-break auction.
