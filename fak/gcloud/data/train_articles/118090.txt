Beetlejuice 2: Tim Burton rep says sequel not in development
So, about that Beetlejuice sequel… it’s not happening.

Early Friday morning, reports surfaced that a long-discussed follow-up to filmmaker Tim Burton’s 1988 paranormal adventure was moving forward — that a script had been completed and original stars Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton confirmed to return. Trouble is, none of that was actually true, according to a rep for the filmmaker. She said the information was based on fabricated comments from the director and confirmed to EW that Beetlejuice 2 is not in development at this time.

Burton’s second feature centers on Keaton’s rambunctious “bio-exorcist,” who is hired by a pair of ghosts (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) to evict a living family from their home — Ryder plays the clan’s goth-attired daughter, Lydia. Both the director and some of the lead actors have expressed a desire to revisit the movie at various times over the last several years, but there are no active plans for a sequel to move forward at this point.

Instead, the rep said that Burton is actively working to complete his next film, Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, based on the best-seller by Ransom Riggs, which is due out Sept. 30. After that, he’s sent to begin work on a live-action adaptation of the Disney classic, Dumbo, which will see him return to the world of fairytales following on the $1 billion success of his 2010 mounting of Alice in Wonderland.

Earlier this month, Burton shared with EW exclusive first-look images from Miss Peregrine’s, which stars Asa Butterfield (Hugo) as 16-year-old Jake, who decides to investigate his late grandfather’s stories about an otherworldy orphanage that houses youngsters with special gifts. Eva Green (who teamed with Burton previously for 2012’s Dark Shadows) plays the title character, a woman Burton described as “a weird, scary Mary Poppins.”
