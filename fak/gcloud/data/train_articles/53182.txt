Rand Paul Opposes Amnesty and Believes We Must Secure The Border While Encouraging Legal Immigration

I do not support amnesty, but rather I support a legal immigration process. I recognize that our country has been enriched by those who seek the American Dream and have a desire for a better life. However, millions of illegal immigrants are crossing our border without our knowledge, and this threatens our national security.

As President, I would secure our border immediately. Before issuing any visas or starting the legal immigration process, we must first ensure that our border is secure.

While serving in the Senate, I introduced legislation that would make immigration reform conditional on Congress voting on whether the border is secure, requiring completion of a border fence in five years and a protection against the federal government establishing a national identification card system for citizens.

My "Trust but Verify" amendment requires Congress to write and enforce a border security blueprint rather than relying on bureaucracies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, to come up with a plan. The amendment also would provide new national security safeguards to track the holders of student visas and those provided asylum and refugee status.

In order to protect our nation and reform the immigration process, we must know who is and is not entering our country by first securing our border.

As President, I would implement my “Trust but Verify” plan and put pressure on the Department of Homeland Security to finally follow through on the broken promise of a secure border and an effective visa tracking system.
