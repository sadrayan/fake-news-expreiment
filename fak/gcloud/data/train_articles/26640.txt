Senate Approves Hutchison Border Fence Amendment

Amendment Provides Local Officials Input with Placement of Border Fences

WASHINGTON -- Texas’ Senior Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) today successfully passed an amendment to H.R. 2638 / S. 1644, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations bill, which will prevent Congress from dictating to states where border fencing will be built. The amendment passed by unanimous consent. The Hutchison-Bingaman amendment was co-sponsored by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Pete Domenici (R-NM), Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). “My amendment requires DHS to work with local communities to find a workable plan that protects local commerce and respects the proud heritage of border communities,” said Sen. Hutchison. The Hutchison amendment ensures that fencing along the southwest border of the United States will not be constructed without DHS engaging, consulting, and meeting with individuals in the areas affected by the enactment of the Secure Fence Act. Senator Hutchison initiated the dialogue between Texas’ border leaders and DHS at a meeting attended by Sen. Cornyn, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, and the entire senior leadership of DHS, in Sen. Hutchison’s Washington office on January 17, 2007. The bill now goes to a conference committee with the House to reconcile the different versions of the bill.
