This New Picture Against #BlackLivesMatter Rioters Is Going Viral and for a Good Reason
Wednesday, January 7th, 2015

If there is a more divisive slogan to have come out of the aftermath of the untimely deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner than “Black Lives Matter,” I don’t know what it is.

It would be so simple to use “All Lives Matter” and at least have the opportunity to unite the entire country behind their cause instead of furthering a racial divide that they claim to denounce.

But there are good reasons why the race rioters can’t put “All Lives Matter” on their signs — they don’t believe it’s true.

Many, many more black lives are taken every year by other blacks than by police officers of any color.

The fact that these deaths go without protest is a clear indicator that the demonstrations are not pro-black, but anti-cop.

Which is exactly the point made by this sign:

“#BlackLivesMatter … But only when they’re killed by cops. Killed by each other? Not so much.”

That pretty much sums it up.

But even more than those taken by other blacks are the hundreds of thousands of black lives ended each year by abortion.

Those lives don’t matter to these divisive, liberal rioters either, although they prove once again that there is, indeed, a war being waged against blacks and their families.

Unfortunately for them, it’s being waged by their supposed allies on the American left. And while some appear to finally be waking up to that fact, it’s not happening fast enough.

Please share this article on Facebook and Twitter if you agree that black lives — and all other lives — matter.
