The Simpsons Archive: Blackboard Openings
If you want your own copy of the Java applet (and source) to create your own version of this "blackboard applet" (and you can use your own quotes), Click Here

Episodes are listed in broadcast sequence

Episode numbers indicate the quote used when the episode was shown for the first time; in some cases, the one used in Canada is listed where it was "original" and the USA one was repeated

All quotes were originally in all capital letters, but any punctuation appears as it did in the original quotes

Quotes in red are done by Bart during the episode rather than at the beginning
