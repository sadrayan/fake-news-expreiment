US billionaire Donald Trump has bought Doonbeg Golf Club, County Clare
US BILLIONAIRE DONALD Trump has bought one of Ireland’s top golf resorts, Doonbeg Golf Club and five-star lodge in County Clare.

Joint receivers Luke Charleton and David Hughes of Ernst and Young this afternoon confirmed that the spectacular Atlantic-front course has been sold to the property mogul’s Trump Organization.

Doonbeg becomes the 16th golf club in the Trump portfolio, and their first in Ireland. The 400-acre development will be renamed Trump International Golf Links, Ireland.

Trump said: “Doonbeg is an already terrific property that we will make even better — it will soon be an unparalleled resort destination with the highest standards of luxury.”

The Greg Norman-designed resort was acquired by investment firm South Street Partners last year, and receivers were appointed in mid-January. The Irish Examiner reports the Trump purchase at around €15 million.

The Lodge at Doonbeg includes 218 hotel suites as well as an expansive spa and several restaurants, which will be managed directly by the Trump Hotel Collection.

“There was a tremendous level of interest from domestic and international investors in this property,” Charleton said.

“It is particularly pleasing to have sold this prestigious property to The Trump Organisation who have the vision and resources to take what is an internationally renowned tourism resort to its next stage.”

Trump’s sons Donald Jr and Eric, both of whom were involved in the deal, are expected to arrive in Ireland tomorrow.
