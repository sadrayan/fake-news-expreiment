As reported, the shootout took place after an armed man in his fifties started firing shots out of an apartment window.

Police stated during a press conference earlier today that policemen were shot at when trying to enter the gunman’s apartment. On one occasion, police shot at the man in an attempt to overcome him. The man was rushed to the hospital’s emergency ward but was pronounced dead.

The police weapons used in the operation will be used in the investigation of the case by the special prosecutor.
