On Tuesday afternoon Trump fired off six tweets in a row attacking God’s coverage of the 2016 election and accused the deity of being part of the ‘liberal attack machine.’

Trump’s tweets attacking God came after several weeks of Trump being down as much as 10% in national polls.

Trump has repeatedly claimed that he is a ‘strong Christian’ and a ‘firm believer’ in God, but his tweets seem to hint otherwise.

It is clear that Trump personally posted the messages and it was not a campaign staffer posting them under his name.

30 minutes after posting this blistering attack on God, Trump’s tweets were deleted and removed from Twitter.
