Town In Italy Switches To Silent Fireworks To Reduce Anxiety In Animals
If you’re a dog owner, there’s probably one thing you dread about holidays like New Year’s Eve or the Fourth of July. Fireworks scare dogs. Imagine you have no idea what fireworks are. Suddenly you see bright lights and hear explosions coming from the sky. You’d be pretty terrified, too. Fireworks wreak havoc on animals, and vet visits skyrocket around holidays where fireworks are common. Dogs, with their sensitive hearing, are especially vulnerable, and many hurt themselves trying to escape or hide. They can run and risk getting lost or hit by cars.

One town in Italy is taking a big step to reduce the fear of fireworks in their non-human population. The local government of Collecchio made a law that fireworks in their town must be silent. It’s a way of reducing the stress that the loud noises cause to animals–not just pets, but wildlife, as well. There’s a company called Setti Fireworks that makes these silent explosives and can customize them for each event.

Anything that reduces the amount of stress that my dogs feel around holidays is a good thing in my book. Loud noises can cause heart problems, nausea, and even panic attacks for pets. I’ve spent many holidays comforting my shaking dogs, trying to turn up the radio to drown out noises, and keeping them calm. I always enjoy the lights more than the sounds of fireworks anyway.

What do you think? Would you support noiseless fireworks to help keep animals safe? Or do you think the loud sounds are necessary to enjoy fireworks? Let us know in the comments below.
