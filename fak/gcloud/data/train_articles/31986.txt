Comparing ACS Data
The strength of the American Community Survey (ACS) is in estimating characteristic distributions. If you are looking for population totals, we recommend the 2010 Census or Population Estimates Program.

It is also important to keep in mind that all ACS data are estimates. We collect data from a sample of the population in the United States and Puerto Rico rather than from the whole population. To help you interpret the reliability of the estimates, the Census Bureau publishes a margin of error (MOE) for every ACS estimate.
