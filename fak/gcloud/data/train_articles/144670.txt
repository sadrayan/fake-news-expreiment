A son named 'Google'
A Swedish couple have named their newborn after their favorite technology company--Google. Walid Elias Kai, who has a doctorate in search engine marketing, and his wife Carol of Kalmar, Sweden, have named their son Oliver Google Kai, Google blogger Karen Wickre wrote in an official blog on the subject. Oliver Google was born on Wednesday. His parents joke that they too have taken on the Google name in a Lebanese tradition in which parents have a name related to the child. "All our friends and families are calling us Abou Google (Google's father) and Emm Google (Google's mother)," they said. The proud parents also have a Web site with pictures of the little tyke.
