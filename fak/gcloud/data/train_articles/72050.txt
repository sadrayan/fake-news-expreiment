Dr. Lauren Wright: Michelle Obama Now ‘in Legacy Mode’; ‘Free to Say What She Feels’
Dr. Lauren Wright, political scientist, member of the White House Transition Project, and author of On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday to discuss the ongoing White House transition, as well as the role of presidential spouses.

Wright said, “I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations.”

Wright added that while Laura Bush gave more public speeches than Hillary Clinton as first lady, “Michelle Obama has sort of blown both of them out of the water with a volume of public activities.”

The discussion also touched upon some of Michelle Obama’s recent comments. “She’s in legacy building mode,” said Wright. “She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come. This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”

Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.
