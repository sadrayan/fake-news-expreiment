Statement on the Administration's Purchase of Heavy Water from Iran
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) issued the following statement on the Obama administration’s reported $8.6 million purchase of heavy water from Iran:

“For Tehran, the nuclear agreement is the gift that keeps on giving. This purchase—part of what appears to be the administration’s full-court press to sweeten the deal—will directly subsidize Iran’s nuclear program. It’s yet another unprecedented concession to the world’s leading state-sponsor of terrorism.”
