Long Time Gone: The Autobiography of David Crosby: Carl Gottlieb, David Crosby: 9780385245302: Amazon.com: Books
As a musician, i always want to know more about the music making and recording aspects of an artists story. There are good doses of it in this book, and its clear that Crosby's success is the result of his love of music and his talent.



I love the quote that says when with CSN, you cant hear David sing because he is perfectly harmonizing with Stills And Nash, in the middle of the harmonic structure. That is exactly why he is one of the great talents of the generation.



However, this book reflects what Cros found much more important, a love of drugs, specifically cocaine in its various permutations.



Both Cros and co writer Gottlieb (as well as interviewed friends) give us a clear understanding of how much fun was had in the court of David Crosby in the late 60's to early 70's. Crosby's love of sailing, and all those who experiences around that were great fun to learn about, and but one example of the pleasures and privilege that his talent and work afforded him and friends.



Be forewarned however that this is a telling of a very sad story of a man who had everything who gave it up to cocaine and heroin. Despite being put into numerous expensive private detox facilities, he only came clean through the Texas prison system. He was literally dead man walking, and after many years, made the transition back to "David Crosby, a great singer and songwriter of our generation". Highly recommended.
