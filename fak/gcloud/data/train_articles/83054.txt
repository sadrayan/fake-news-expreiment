Brit Hume: Senior Citizens, Not Hispanics, Are �Fastest-Growing Demographic�
Fox’s Brit Hume gave a piece of commentary tonight that argued it’s not Hispanics that make up “the fastest-growing demographic” in the U.S. it’s senior citizens. And this is a group that the Republicans won handily last week and in the last few election cycles.

Hume brought up economic stagnation to suggest that’s why seniors are trending Republican. And that’s a problem for Democrats because, Hume explained, “It is senior citizens, not Hispanics, who are the fastest-growing demographic in the country. Mr. Obama and his party, it seems, needs a better sales job.”

Hume backed up this argument by saying Hispanics may be the fastest-growing ethnic group, but their size and percentage of the electorate is still dwarfed by the 65-and-over crowd.
