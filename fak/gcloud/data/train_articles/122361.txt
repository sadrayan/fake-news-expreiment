Blood Rave to douse Amsterdam dancers in gallons of blood
The Netherlands will have its first ever "Blood Rave" - a dance party where dancers are sprayed with 5 thousand liters of blood - in Amsterdam on Halloween night.

The event has been posted on Facebook, but with no specifics except for the date - October 31st - so far. A total of 728 guests have indicated that they are going.

One of the organizers, who want to remain anonymous due to the nature of the event, told the AD that this is will be the first blood party in the world and the demand for it is high.

The Blood Rave is based on the opening sequence of the 1998 vampire movie Blade. The opening shows a club full of dancing people suddenly sprayed with blood. The organizers want to use the same elements to recreate this scene. "In real life it is just more extreme." one said to the newspaper. In terms of attendees, they expect somewhat "freaky" people in terms of personality.

The organizers want to host a Halloween event that if focused less on pumpkins and kids and is "rawer and more exciting". They are still trying to figure out whether it will be possible to use real blood, but that is what they want. "After a long search we have developed a special sprinkler system with pipes running across the ceiling and thus making us able to spray blood over the crowd. We've already tested it a number of times a substance resembling blood", one of the organizers explained. "It is pushing the borders, but we want to see how far we can go."

Below is the opening sequence of Blade. Blood starts spraying out of the ceiling around the two minute mark and this may be disturbing to sensitive viewers.
