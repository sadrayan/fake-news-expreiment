MICHELLE OBAMA PREGNANT!
WASHINGTON - The White House announced today that Michelle Obama is pregnant with the couple’s third child.

“Michelle Obama is pregnant,” White House sources said. Outgoing White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, told reporters today that he would not confirm or deny the rumor. But WWN has confirmed that Michelle Obama is about two months into her pregnancy and the President and First Lady expect to have the baby sometime in late July, 2011.

There was a great deal of mystery about the whereabouts of the President and First Lady on Election Night this year. There were many rumors about where they might be - but now we know. The happy couple was spending quality time together, making a new baby.

The last time a baby was born in the White House was Patrick Bouvier Kennedy. He was born on August 7, 1963 and only lived two days. Patrick was the youngest child of President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy and brother to Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr.

The President and First Lady are “ecstatic” about the news of a new baby. Michelle Obama, 46, and Barack Obama, 49, waited almost seven years before having children. Their first daughter, Malia Ann Obama was born on July 4, 1999 and Natasha (often called “Sasha”)was born two years later on June 10, 2001.

It is too early to determine if the baby is a boy or a girl, but David Axelrod, the President’s Senior Adviser, said that the President is hoping to have a boy.

President Obama turns 50 on August 4th of this year, and there is a chance that the baby will be born on his birthday.
