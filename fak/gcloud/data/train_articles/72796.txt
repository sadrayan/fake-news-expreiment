Surveillance and Control of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in the United States
In the continental United States, vector control professionals use integrated vector management strategies to control Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.

Before a locally-acquired case(s) of chikungunya infection occurs, professionals conduct surveillance to understand local populations of mosquitoes and begin control efforts.

If a travel-related case is reported or locally-acquired case is suspected, vector control professionals enhance mosquito control activities to reduce both larvae and adult mosquito densities. This can help keep mosquitoes from biting infected people, which can break the transmission cycle.

Vector surveillance and control efforts should target mosquito species that can transmit viruses. Control activities are generally similar for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.
