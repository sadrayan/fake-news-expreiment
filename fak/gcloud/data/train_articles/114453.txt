Amazon.com: For God, Country and Coca-Cola: The Unauthorized History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It (9780684193472): Mark Pendergrast: Books
Comprehensive history of Coca-Cola, the drink and the Company(ies), well-written and thoroughly researched--including even the mysterious formula. But more than that, the book is a social and business history of the United States from the middle 1800s to the present time. Coke was (is) not just a drink but a cultural phenomenon, not to mention a religion all its own, with leading clergy, ministers, acolytes, and laymen. Mr. Pendergrast recounts the exploits of the many missionaries in spreading the word (Coca-Cola, that is) throughout the known world. We learn the influence of Coca-Cola on our daily lives, our cultures, the business world, the military, the political world, you name it--The Company and it's drink have made an amazing contribution (for good or ill--both actually) to the United States and the rest of the world. While I've enjoyed my visits to The World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta, I learned much more about the company and the drink from this wonderful book. The Pause That Refreshes--I'm not sure (actually I prefer Pepsi)--but pausing from daily life to read For God, Country, and Coca-Cola was certainly stimulating (without the caffeine or cocaine)
