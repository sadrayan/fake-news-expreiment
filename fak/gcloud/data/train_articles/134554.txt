Just want to thank everyone for letting me know, I also ended up finding it on Facebook. I messaged him and he hasn't responded, but has deleted the post that had the image and the 1.8 million shares. He did credit me though. Sorry I've been gone for so long, life stuff you know. I do want to get back into making new stuff again. I'm probably going to start recording the stuff I do and uploading it to YouTube also.





Update: I guess someone reported the post as spam and Facebook took it down.Update 2: Dan Asmussen has a new post up - www.facebook.com/dan.asmussen/â€¦ There is sites saying I flipped the image to make it look like a cross. lol if I did that it would be like that on here. This image is the original way it was made.Been playin around with After Effects. Learned this from a tutorial.Resolution - 1920x1080Re-uploaded the animated version.Video - youtu.be/xUETK4OFAIY
