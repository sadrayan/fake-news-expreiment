BREDESEN CALLS FOR REPEAL OF BLACKBURN LAW THAT FUELED OPIOID CRISIS
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Governor Phil Bredesen, candidate for U.S. Senate, said today that Congress needs to repeal a 2016 law sponsored by Congressman Marsha Blackburn that fueled the nation’s opioid crisis by undermining the U.S. Drug Enforcement Authority’s ability to monitor suspicious drug shipments.

“I would say that I think the first step is for the Congress to admit that it has an opioid problem,” said Governor Phil Bredesen after speaking at an opioid summit in Nashville organized by Healthy Tennessee, a non-profit organization. “It is one that needs dealing with in an effective way, not through something politically correct.”

Bredesen added that “Introducing legislation to repeal that [Congressman Blackburn’s bill] law will be my first act as a U.S. Senator.”

Last year, an investigation by the Washington Post and 60 Minutes revealed that Blackburn, at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry, co-sponsored a law that weakened “DEA enforcement efforts against drug distribution companies that were supplying corrupt doctors and pharmacists who peddled narcotics to the black market.” According to OpenSecrets.org, Blackburn has taken more than $800,000 in campaign contributions from drug companies.

Tennessee has been especially hard-hit by the opioid crisis. Earlier this week, state health officials announced that 1,776 Tennesseans died of drug overdoses in 2017.

According to the Tennessean, “prescription opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone remain the most common cause of overdoses.” Additionally, a rising number of deaths were associated with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.
