Salary data for public employees of South Carolina
HELPFUL HINTS

Note the "updated" column in results to determine how new the data is.

This databases contains names, positions and salaries of state government employees making $50,000 or more a year in base salary, as furnished by the agencies in response to S.C. Freedom of Information Act requests.

Generally, salaries of employees earning less than $50,000 a year are available in $4,000 ranges directly from the agency of interest.

Why do we publish this data? A majority of agencies, commissions and other entities contained in this database pay employees through state or local appropriations. Some receive no tax money and operate by generating their own revenue. They are included here because they were established to serve the public interest, were started with public money, and their payrolls are part of the public record.

Search tips: To search by name, type in all or part of a name. (Example: "presley" or "pres" or "elvis".) You can also limit your search by agency using the dropdown menu. On the results page, you can sort the data how you wish by clicking on the blue column headings. Clicking the same heading again switches the sort between ascending and descending on that field.

Note that results are returned in 25-record increments but all records matching your search terms will be available. To reduce the number of results pages, keep your search parameters specific (for example, limit results to certain agencies or, for large agencies, to both agency and salary ranges). The number of records returned is displayed at the bottom of the results list.
