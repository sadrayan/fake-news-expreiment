Last night/ this morning, I was so depressed I did not want to live in this world anymore (and as a type one diabetic, I honestly don't know how long I will live if I lose access to affordable healthcare). Today, I feel more optimistic, not because I think everything is going to be okay, but because I have seen so many of your posts, recognizing the fight that is ahead, and talking about organizing, not just sitting back and complaining or planning for the next election. There are rallies, meetings, and protests being announced, a feminist bookstore (probably the first one in Houston, this century) opened literally overnight, veteran activists and community organizers are sharing their stories and advice, and people who never seemed political are suddenly ready to join the fight. Last night, I was ashamed to share a country with so many mean-spirited bigots. Today I still am, but I am also proud to have so many friends (comrades) who want to change this world for the better.
