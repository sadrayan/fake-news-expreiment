Ted Cruz bashes Beto Oâ€™Rourke for accepting funds raised by PAC, which bundled individual donations
When a PAC bundles donations, the individual campaign contribution limit of $2,700 applies instead of the $5,000 limit for a PAC. The campaign can also record each individual's donations clearly, in contrast with the more opaque PAC donations.

O'Rourke told reporters in Odessa Monday that in the last three months alone, he has gotten funds from more than 200,000 donors. "I have no idea what organizations they belong to, where they work. It's too many for me to understand. Most of them [are] from the state of Texas. What is important to know is that no special interests, no political action committee, no corporation has the ability to purchase influence or access."

O'Rourke campaign spokesman Chris Evans cited a Politifact finding that O'Rourke has not accepted PAC donations, and reiterated the campaign's fundraising prowess.

"Only one of the campaigns in this Senate race is being run without a dime from political action committees," Evans said. "We're proud that it's ours and we're proud of the 215,714 individual contributions coming from real people that helped us outraise the sitting senator and his PACs by more than two to one in the last quarter."

Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at Akerman LLP, said that when a PAC bundles contributions, it helps the candidate because the PAC expends some resources to collect the donations.
