Weeks later, Crist boots Rothstein from judicial commish
Well, it took awhile, but Gov. Charlie Crist finally suspended accused Ponzi schemer and major political donor Scott Rothstein from the Fourth DCA Judicial Nominating Commission.

Crist just release the executive order, which comes about three weeks after the initial reports of Rothstein's alleged misdeeds. He also has appointed William Berger to replace Rothstein on the nominating commission.

We're not sure why this took so long. Even the Florida Bar moved faster, filing the paperwork to permanently disbar Rothstein last week.
