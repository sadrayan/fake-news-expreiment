Indiana Governor Signs Abortion Bill With Added Restrictions
The measure drew a sharp rebuke from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and other abortion rights groups, and the law returned Indiana to the center of a national debate about social issues.

Last year, Mr. Pence signed a religious objections bill perceived by many as antigay, prompting some corporations to threaten to stop doing business in Indiana unless the law was changed. Within days, Mr. Pence signed a so-called fix to that law saying that it did not allow discrimination.

Mr. Pence, who had been seen before the religious objections episode as a possible presidential contender, was widely criticized for his handling of the matter. In its aftermath, his political stock plummeted, and he is currently engaged in a re-election race that many expect to be close.

Thursday was Mr. Pence’s deadline to act on the abortion bill, and he waited until late in the day to announce his decision.

Some abortion rights advocates said that portions of the law could be challenged in court. State Representative Linda Lawson, a Democrat who opposed the measure, said the new law came close to an effective ban on abortions in the state.

“They’ve been on a mission, the Republicans in the Indiana General Assembly, to make sure that affordable health care and abortion is no longer available for women in the state of Indiana,” said Ms. Lawson, who suggested that the law was most likely to affect poor women who might not be able to travel to other states to seek abortions.

The law could also put some doctors who perform abortions in jeopardy if it is learned that a woman told them that she chose to end her pregnancy because of gender, disabilities or other reasons limited by the law.
