The President and First Lady hosted an Independence Day celebration on the South Lawn of the White House yesterday. For the occasion, Mrs. O wore a red and blue striped shell paired with a pleated, side button white skirt. The President did his part on the fashion front, sporting a patriotic red, white and blue cowboy hat. Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday!

Update: Reader N82 spotted a tweet from Brooks Brothers, confirming that Mrs. O wears a Black Fleece stripe top. A similar style is available here.
