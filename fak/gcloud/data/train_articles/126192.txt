FACT CHECK: Have Obama Divorce Rumors Been Confirmed?
In February 2017, the The Last Line of Defense website published an article reporting that Michelle and Barack Obama had filed for divorce in Illinois:

Late last week, a rumor began circulating in Washington social circles that there was trouble in paradise for Barack and Michelle Obama. While there was no confirmation, it was being tossed around that it was Barack looking to dump Michelle. This morning, a filing in the District Court of Cook County, Illinois confirmed that the couple is seeking divorce and that Barack is, in fact, the plaintiff.

The infidelity, according to the Obama’s longtime housekeeper, Analita Consuelo Gonsales, isn’t recent but rather the revelation through a recent DNA test that Obama isn’t the biological father of Sasha or Malia.

Of course there was no truth in this article, which originated with The Last Line of Defense, part of a network of junk news sites that publish political misinformation under the guise of proffering “satire.”

According to a tweet Barack sent on Valentine’s Day around the same time the fake article was published, the former First Couple were still happily married after 28 years:
