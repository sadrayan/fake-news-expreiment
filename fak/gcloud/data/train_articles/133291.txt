Talk:Albert Einstein
Unsourced and dubious/overly modern sources [ edit ]

Einstein is one of those major iconic figures to whom many statements become attributed; unsourced attributions to him should usually be treated with some skepticism, and often a great deal of it.

Please put unsourced quotes in alphabetical order for convenience.

A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it. Probably not real, earliest published version I found was this one from 1997, but it seems to have been on the internet slightly before that, see this post from 1996. Hypnosifl 18:17, 30 November 2011 (UTC)



A person starts to live when he can live outside himself. Earliest published source I could find was the 1993 book Zen and the Art of Making a Living by Laurence G. Boldt, p. 100. Was on the internet before that, as in this post from 1991. Hypnosifl 02:01, 1 December 2011 (UTC)



A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy. Earliest published source I find is the 2003 book Albert Einstein by Dana Meachen Rau, p. 19. But it appeared on the internet before that, earliest one I found was this post from 5 January 1993. Hypnosifl 01:11, 6 December 2011 (UTC)



Any fool can know. The point is to understand. Not a lot of sources for this, see the search here, oldest one seems to be Precalculus mathematics in a nutshell: geometry, algebra, trigonometry by George Finlay Simmons, from 1981. Hypnosifl 02:14, 1 December 2011 (UTC)



“Any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl is simply not giving the kiss the attention it deserves.” - saw this on my Facebook today, and it's widely repeated on the web, with no good source. --Slashme (talk) 15:18, 12 August 2012 (UTC) Earliest source I see on google books that attributes it to Einstein is the 2002 book More Sex Talk by James Wolfe, p. 91. I did find earlier sources which give the same quote but without attributing it to Einstein (I did an advanced google books search for "kiss the attention it deserves" with the date range of 1900 - 2002), like the 1968 book 20,000 Quips and Quotes by Evan Esar, p. 452, or American Gas Journal vol. 184 from 1957, see this snippet from p. 155. This post from the snopes.com board claims to give a bunch of much earlier sources where the quote wasn't attributed to Einstein, but I can't check if the attributions to various newspapers below are actually accurate: [Tennessee Ernie Ford] notes that the man who can drive while kissing a pretty girl is not giving the kiss the attention it deserves. [From Larry Wolters's "Radio TV Gag Bab," The Chicago Daily Tribune, 3 April 1955, Pg. H16.] The current edition of the Hudson Motor Car Co.'s Newsletter contains the information that this safety-first sign appears on the Alaska Highway: "The man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl is not giving the kiss the attention it deserves." [From "Personal Notes," The Washington Post, 24 December 1951, Pg. B8.] Braddock Motor hints: Never allow a girl to kiss you when you are out driving with her, for if she can drive a car while kissing you, she's not giving the kiss the attention it deserves. [The Pittsburgh Courier, 24 November 1928, Pg. 6.] "Do you allow Jack to kiss you when you're out motoring with him?" "Never. If a man can drive safely when kissing me, then he's not giving the kiss the attention it deserves." [From The Pittsburgh Courier, 15 January 1927, Pg. 3.] One of our fluffy flappers allows no kissing when she is out riding. She says a man cannot drive a car and give the kiss the attention it deserves. [From "Pen Points," The Los Angeles Times, 12 June 1924, Pg. A4.] Dorcas -- "Do you ever allow a man to kiss you when you're out motoring with him? Philippa -- "Never. If a man can drive safely while kissing me, he is not giving the kiss the attention it deserves." [From "Safety First," which appeared in an automotive supplement to the Southtown [Chicago] Economist, 12 March 1924, Pg. 24.] Hypnosifl (talk) 17:45, 13 August 2012 (UTC)



Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. Earliest sources on this search are from 1999, but it appears on the internet before that, like this post from 1996. Hypnosifl 02:38, 1 December 2011 (UTC)



As our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness surrounding it. Earliest variant I find is "As the area of light increases so does the circumference of darkness" in the 1971 book Cell and Molecular Biology by Eugene Rosenberg, p. 199.

Before God we are all equally wise, equally foolish. Appears in Albert Einstein: Maker of Universes from 1939 on p.80, but doesn't look like original source is mentioned. Hypnosifl 22:37, 30 November 2011 (UTC)



Creativity is intelligence having fun.

Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous. Earliest published source I found attributing it to Einstein is the 2000 book What every principal would like to say-- and what to say next time: quotations for leading, learning, and living by Noah benShea, p. 94. Quote itself is a lot older though, for example Love, medicine, & miracles by Bernie S. Siegel, from 1986, has this exact quote on p. 214. There are other variants before that, like in I Hurt Too Much for a Band-Aid by Kenneth J. Olson and Helen Lovell from 1980, which says on p. 111 "A coincidence is when God performs a miracle and chooses to remain anonymous". Hypnosifl 03:00, 1 December 2011 (UTC) CS Lewis "Coincidence is a miracle in which God chooses to remain anonymous."??--66.190.141.195 14:20, 7 March 2017 (UTC)



Every day, man is making bigger and better foolproof things, and every day, Nature is making bigger and better fools. So far, I think Nature is winning. Alternate: There is a race between mankind and the universe. Mankind is trying to build bigger, better, faster, and more foolproof machines. The universe is trying to build bigger, better, and faster fools. So far the universe is winning. Zero hits for "Nature is making bigger and better fools" on google books. Earliest internet post I find with "Nature is making bigger and better fools" is this one from Dec 1999, but the rest of it is different and it doesn't say anything about Einstein. The next-earliest one I find is at the bottom of this one from Dec 2000, which has the full quote as above and it's attributed to Einstein. Hypnosifl 06:17, 3 December 2011 (UTC) By Rick Cook (1989): "Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning." --Traal (talk) 23:51, 10 June 2015 (UTC)



Example isn't another way to teach, it is the only way to teach. Searching google books for "example", "isn't another way to teach" and "only way to teach", earliest instances are two books from 2002, here and here. Neither gives a source, and I didn't see a source in later books, so probably not trustworthy. As usual the original source is probably the internet since searching google groups shows posts using the quote before that, earliest one I found was at the bottom of this one from June 1998.

Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid. As quoted in The Rhythm of Life : Living Every Day with Passion and Purpose (2004) by Matthew Kelly, p. 80



I am thankful to all those who said NO to me. It's because of them I did it myself This is being attributed to Einstein on the Internet, but it appears to come from Wayne W. Dyer's book You'll See It When You Believe It, page 54, according to Google Books. Dyer does not attribute it to Einstein, but mentions Einstein in the same paragraph. In my office I have two framed posters. One is a picture of Albert Einstein, beneath which are the words "Great spirits have always encountered violent oppostion from mediocre minds." The other poster is made up solely of words: "I am grateful to all those people who said no. It is because of them I did it myself." Great thoughts! Apparently someone misread this and thought the quote was from Einstein. I don't know who was the first to do this. Imaid (talk) 23:47, 12 March 2012 (UTC)



I believe no woman could have invented calculus. Zero published examples, and only two on google groups...I wonder if someone just made this one up to add to the wikiquote unsourced list (it was added in this edit from 25 March 2007, by a user whose only wikiquote contributions were adding this quote and bolding a few others). Searching for variants on google books did turn up a quote by someone called Edward Jewitt Wheeler, who in 1908 Current Literature wrote "No woman ever invented a calculus", but this is such an obscure source that I doubt it's the inspiration. Hypnosifl 05:40, 3 December 2011 (UTC)



I could burn my fingers that I wrote that first letter to Roosevelt. Comment after the bombing of Hiroshima, regarding his letter to Roosevelt warning of the possibility of the development of a nuclear weapon. Earliest internet post I find is this one from 2002 where it seems to be part of a quote from a larger work, apparently this essay (link is to an archived copy from 22 Dec 1997, so it's at least that old) by someone called Richard V. Duffy. This 2002 book is the earliest published source with the quote, but it doesn't give a source and may have just gotten it from the internet. Hypnosifl 05:59, 3 December 2011 (UTC)



I didn't arrive at my understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe through my rational mind. According to Google Books, the earliest appearance of this quote is in the 1971 book Be Here Now by Ram Dass.



I don't believe in mathematics. He's quoted saying this sometime before 1910 on p. 3 of this paper, with the reference given as p. 21 of The Young Einstein by Lewis Pyenson. The paper talks about how his attitude towards mathematics evolved, he's also quoted at the top of p. 5 saying "I have become imbued with great respect for mathematics, the subtler part of which I had in my simple-mindedness regarded as pure luxury until now." Also, more context for the "don't believe in mathematics" comment is given on p. 76 of Einstein: A Life by Denis Brian, where Brian writes that Einstein "demonstrated his cavalier attitude toward math one afternoon in a café when he and engineer Gustave Ferriere were discussing math’s rigid rules. Einstein placed five matches on the table and asked, 'What is the total length of these five matches if each is two and a half inches long?' 'Twelve and a half inches,' Ferriere replied. 'That’s what you say,' said Einstein. 'But I very much doubt it. I don’t believe in mathematics.' " Hypnosifl 22:31, 2 December 2011 (UTC)



I don't pretend to understand the universe — it's much bigger than I am. Only published example is this one from 2008 which gives no source. Was circulating on the internet long before that, earliest post I found with it was this one from 1991. Hypnosifl 06:37, 3 December 2011 (UTC)



I fear the day when technology overlaps our humanity. It will be then that the world will have permanent ensuing generations of idiots. Above quote does not appear in The Ultimate Quotable Einstein compiled by Alice Calaprice, a renowned Einstein expert and of Princeton University Press.



I must be willing to give up what I am in order to become what I will be. Attributed to Einstein on page 175 of Jill Bolte Taylor's My Stroke of Insight . Don't think this is necessarily a reliable source though. No published sources earlier than My Stroke of Insight , but it was on the internet long before then so she probably got it from there--earliest internet post I found was this one from 1992. Hypnosifl 06:40, 3 December 2011 (UTC)



I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn. Earliest published source I find is the 1968 book Training within the organization: a study of company policy and procedures for the systematic training of operators and supervisors which on p. 126 says: "It was probably in the latter sense that Professor Einstein in talking about teaching once remarked: 'I never teach my pupils. I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.' " No source is given, and none of the other books I saw gave a source either. Hypnosifl 06:47, 3 December 2011 (UTC)



I think and think, for months, for years. Ninety-nine times the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right. Earliest appearance seems to be the 1939 book Albert Einstein: Maker of Universes , p. 96. Just says this was a comment he made to "a friend" so it's not clear if the author actually got a firsthand account or was just repeating a story he heard through the grapevine (this is the same book that has the unsourced "Before God we are all equally wise, equally foolish" quote above). Hypnosifl 22:04, 5 December 2011 (UTC)



I think that a particle must have a separate reality independent of the measurements. That is an electron has spin, location and so forth even when it is not being measured. I like to think that the moon is there even if I am not looking at it. Earliest published version found is the 1999 book Words Fail Me by Patricia O'Conner, p. 41. Earliest internet post is this one from 1996. The part about the moon is probably based on Abraham Pais' recollection in Albert_Einstein#Attributed_from_memory_and_posthumous_publications, "We often discussed his notions on objective reality. I recall that during one walk Einstein suddenly stopped, turned to me and asked whether I really believed that the moon exists only when I look at it." Hypnosifl 23:41, 6 December 2011 (UTC)



I want to know how God created this world. I'm not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts; the rest are details. said to be from E. Salaman, "A Talk With Einstein," The Listener 54 (1955), pp. 370-371 [1] Lanulos (talk) 19:10, 4 October 2012 (UTC)



If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it. Earliest references I found are two from 1996, Fad Surfing in the Boardroom and The Next Step in Database Marketing. None of the books that I saw gave an original source for the quote. Hypnosifl 19:37, 4 December 2011 (UTC)



If I give you a penny, you will be one penny richer and I'll be one penny poorer. But if I give you an idea, you will have a new idea, but I shall still have it, too. Only published source found on google books with "Einstein" and "penny richer" is Open Life: The Philosophy of Open Source from 2006, which has it on p. 21. Hypnosifl 06:57, 3 December 2011 (UTC)



If I had only one hour to save the world, I would spend fifty-five minutes defining the problem, and only five minutes finding the solution. I found LOTS of attributions of this quote including many books, but I couldn't find any that gave a source. Some references cite the ratio as 59:1. The furthest variation I found was here in another quote database. --WBTtheFROG 14:40, 10 January 2012 (UTC) Searching on google books shows it appears in a lot of business books and books on "creativity" but there don't seem to be any historical or scientific ones among them. Earliest I found was the 1995 book Creative Problem Solving and Opportunity Finding by J. Daniel Cougar, where it appears on p. 178. Hypnosifl 21:57, 10 January 2012 (UTC)



If I knew what I was doing, it wouldn't be called research. Variant: If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research, would it? Earliest published variant I find attributing it to Einstein is "If we knew what it was we were doing, it wouldn't be called 'research,' would it?" from p. 272 of Natural Capitalism from 1999 (to see it, go to the amazon page and "search inside the book" for the word "Einstein"). Was attributed to Einstein on the internet befor that though, earliest I saw was this one from 26 April 1994. And if you search google books for "if we knew what we were doing" and "research" without Einstein, you find examples that just present it as an old joke and don't mention Einstein, earliest I found was Yearbook of Procurement Articles by John Whelan from 1977, which says on p. 32 'I have a colleague who delights in saying, "If we knew what we were doing, we wouldn't need research."' And Organizing for Tomorrow: Reports from the Think-Tanks and the Trenches from 1985 has this comment on p. 19: 'I flashed back on a quote that hung in one of my old offices for several years: "If we knew what we were doing it wouldn't be called research."'

If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed. Earliest published reference found is the 2003 book Nuggest of Wisdom from the Effendi , p. 81, earliest internet reference found is this post from 27 April 1989. Perhaps a paraphrase of "Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death", from Religion and Science (it's at the end of the quote that begins with "The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation...") Another similar one is from a 1948 interview recorded in Einstein and the Poet where he said "What a miserable creature man would be if he were good not for the sake of being good, but because religion told him that he would get a reward after this life, and that if he weren't good he'd be punished."

If the solution is simple, God is answering. Didn't find any published sources earlier than Esquire: Volume 106 (1988). Hypnosifl 00:03, 6 December 2011 (UTC)



Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions. Earliest book found was Expect to Win by Bill Glass (1984), p. 20. The book doesn't give any source in Einstein's writing, other books don't either, seems pretty unlikely to be real. Hypnosifl 00:48, 5 December 2011 (UTC)



It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education. This was simply cited as an anonymous saying in the earliest publication which has been located: How to Give a Damn Good Speech: Even When You Have No Time to Prepare (2000) by Philip R. Theibert, p. 154; the earliest published attribution of this to Einstein yet located is in House-Dreams (2001) by Hugh Howard, p. 45, while it was attributed to Einstein on the internet well before that, the oldest located being this post from 4 August 1989. It has since become attributed to Einstein in several publications, but without citation of an original source. It's a rather close paraphrase of the following from his Autobiographical Notes: "It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty."



It is harder to crack a prejudice than an atom. It is easier to disintegrate an atom than a prejudice. Earliest version I found is this one from 1984, but none that I saw gave a source, I doubt it's real. Hypnosifl 18:12, 30 November 2011 (UTC) Earlier variant, still no source: "It is a sad age when it is more difficult to break a prejudice than an atom."

It's become appallingly clear that our technology has surpassed our humanity.

It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity. As quoted in Voices of Truth : Conversations with Scientists, Thinkers, and Healers (2000) by Nina L. Diamond, p. 429; no publication of this statement has been located prior to it's use in the film Powder (1995) written by Victor Salva, where it is presented as a quote of Einstein. More information about this can be found in this post from Quote Investigator Jjjjjjjjjj (talk) 00:03, 21 December 2012 (UTC)







It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer. Earliest source I found was the 1996 book Bite-Size Einstein: Quotations on Just About Everything from the Greatest Mind of the Twentieth Century , p. 17. But no source is given, and I don't see any other books that give a source either. Hypnosifl 21:20, 2 December 2011 (UTC)



Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere. Over 600K hits for this phrase on google, the top 100 attributing it to Einstein (I didn't scroll through the rest), but I can't find anything pointing to a legitimate source for this quote. Any ideas? Phlar (talk) 19:21, 6 June 2012 (UTC) Doing an advanced google groups search for "logic will get you" and "einstein" with the date range restricted to 1981-2002, earliest I found was the Oct. 14 1999 quote from Cowboy Greg here. The same search on google books with the date range 1900-2004 yields only two books I could confirm to have the quote inside, both from 2004, Machine Learning And Statistical Modeling Approaches To Image Retrieval, p. 123 and Ode to Code, at the end of the book before the "About the Author" page (pages un-numbered). Probably this is one of those quotes that got its start on the internet. Hypnosifl (talk) 15:17, 13 June 2012 (UTC) Quote is in The Ultimate Quotable Einstein by The Ultimate Quotable Einstein (Hardcover) by Freeman Dyson and Albert Einstein and Alice Calaprice on p. 481 but lists it as "Attributed to Albert Einstein" which was originally published in 1996. 2602:D8:A1BF:E600:C991:6369:6CEA:C5A3 16:59, 23 June 2012 (UTC) It's true it appears in The Ultimate Quotable Einstein , but it appears in the "Probably Not By Einstein" subsection of the "Attributed" section, indicating that Calaprice couldn't find a source and considers it unlikely to be a real Einstein quote. Hypnosifl (talk) 00:45, 24 June 2012 (UTC)



No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong. A bunch of pre-1950 sources for this but they all say this is something he is "reported to have said" without giving an exact source. Earliest I find is in Science News-Letter, Volume 14 which according to the title page collects issues from June to December, 1928, the quote appears on p. 52. In The New Quotable Einstein Alice Calaprice speculates on p. 291 that 'This may be a paraphrase of sentiments expressed in "Induction and Deduction," December 25, 1919, CPAE, Vol. 7, Doc. 28'. Einstein's Unification by Jeroen van Dongen has a quote from the article (full English title given as "Induction and Deduction in Physics") on p. 44: 'A theory can thus be recognized as erroneous if there is a logical error in its deductions, or as inadequate if a fact is not in agreement with its consequences. But the truth of a theory can never be proven. For one never knows that even in the future no experience will be encountered which contradicts its consequences; and still other systems of thought are always conceivable which are capable of joining together the same given facts.' Also, p. 18 of Albert Einstein, the Human Side has a note he wrote down on 11 Nov 1922 which expresses a basically similar idea: 'The scientific theorist is not to be envied. For Nature, or more precisely experiment, is an inexorable and not very friendly judge of his work. It never says "Yes" to a theory. In the most favorable cases it says "Maybe," and in the great majority of cases simply "No." If an experiment agrees with a theory it means for the latter "Maybe," and if it does not agree it means "No." Probably every theory will someday experience its "No"—most theories, soon after conception.'

Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet. Earliest published source I could find was this book from 1992, earliest appearance I could find on the internet was this post from 1991. Hypnosifl 22:30, 30 November 2011 (UTC) Perhaps a variant of this quote that appears in The New Quotable Einstein by Alice Calaprice, p. 281 of my edition, in the "Vegetarianism" section of the "On Miscellaneous Subjects" chapter: "Although I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind." From a letter to Harmann Huth, 27 December 1930. Supposedly published in German magazine Vegetarische Warte , which existed from 1882 to 1935.

Once you can accept the universe as matter expanding into nothing that is something, wearing stripes with plaid comes easy. Don't see any published examples before 2004, earliest internet post I see with this quote attributed to Einstein is this one from 19 August 1998, but I see this earlier post from 18 November 1996 where someone says "After accepting relativity, wearing stripes with plaid comes easy!" and they don't attribute it to Einstein or anyone else. Hypnosifl 07:57, 3 December 2011 (UTC)



Setting an example is not the main means of influencing another, it is the only means. Couldn't find any books that give an original source, earliest one I found with this quote was Words for all Occasions by Glenn Van Ekeren (1988), p. 234. Hypnosifl 22:41, 3 December 2011 (UTC)

The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits. Variant: The greatest difference between genius and stupidity is that genius is limited. Earliest published source I find attributing it to Einstein is the 1999 publication 73 amateur radio today, Issues 460-470 , p. 57. It's attributed to Einstein in internet posts before then, earliest I found was from 7 August 1995. But the quote was presented as an anonymous saying well before that, earliest I found was the 1961 Grassroots Editor which says on p. 34 "One man says that the difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits."

The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance. Only 3 published sources on google books, earliest is the 2003 book Still Life With Crows by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, p. 189.



The only source of knowledge is experience. Commonly attributed, google books returns over 600 phrase matches but I cannot find the original source amongst these results. Appears to be a restatement of an actual quote from The Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant which is already on WQ B 1



The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources. As quoted in How to Think like Einstein : Simple Ways to Break the Rules and Discover Your Hidden Genius (2000); in the earliest published occurence of this yet located, in The Art of the Shmooze (1998) by Bret Saxon and Steve Stein, p. 156, it is implied to be something said by Conan O'Brien, but no definite citation is provided. A number of posts on Usenet attributed the quote to Einstein before this, the earliest located being this post from 9 February 1989 (it is possible this post is mis-dated by google, since other posts with this quote are not found until the mid-90s, see this search). The Usenet post is probably not mis-dated by Google. If you look at the original post using "more options" it clearly shows "Date: 9 Feb 89 13:43:00 GMT" Jupiter9 (talk) 17:52, 15 April 2012 (UTC) Do you think google has a separate record for the date that appears in the "more options" version and the date that appears at the upper right of the version I linked to? Seems unlikely to me, they probably just have a single computer record of the date of a given post, so the fact that the same date appears under "more options" wouldn't qualify as independent confirmation of the date. Still, I do think the date is most likely correct despite the gap in time between this post and later ones with the same quote, there could well be other posts in between that just didn't show up in the search (I've noticed that searches of google groups are often unreliable, often I'll search for posts with a given set of keywords, then do another search with slightly different but similar keywords, and come across posts that should have showed up in the first search but didn't).

The substance of our knowledge resides in the detailed terminology of a field. Listed in the "possibly or probably by einstein" section of Alice Calaprice's The Ultimate Quotable Einstein , but the only other source I can find that gives this quote is Terminology and Language Planning: an alternative framework of practice and discourse by Bassy Edem Antia (2000), p. 100.

The world we have created is a product of our thinking; it cannot be changed without changing our thinking. Searching on google books for "einstein" and "product of our thinking", and restricting the date range to 2004 or earlier, only turns up a small number of publications (earliest is Bottom line, personal: Volume 18 from 1997), none of which provide an original source. Doing the same search on google groups, earliest post I found with this quote was this one from 1996. In Albert_Einstein#1940s there's a discussion of the quote "A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels", which mentions that Alice Calaprice speculated that some similar unsourced quotes about the need to change our "thinking" to better the world may be misquotes of that one. Hypnosifl 22:03, 3 December 2011 (UTC) Searching instead for "einstein" and "world we have created", the two earliest I find are from 1992, one is Changing course: a global business perspective on development and the environment by Stephan Schmidheiny, which on p. 82 has the totally convoluted-sounding "The world we have created today as a result of our thinking thus far has problems which cannot be solved by thinking the way we thought when we created them" (the edition on google books is the fifth printing from 1998, so it's possible the 1992 edition might not have had the quote), and the other is Forbes, Vol 150, Issues 6-10 which on p. 177 has the slightly less convoluted "The world we have created today has problems that cannot be solved by thinking the way we thought when we created them." Quotes with "the world we have made" probably predate ones with "world we have created", since the phrase "world we have made" appears in the 1969 or 1970 article by Ram Dass, mentioned above in the discussion of a variant of the quote "Problems cannot be solved by the level of awareness that created them", and the Ram Dass article also contains the phrase "thus far" which appears in both quotes above.

Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius — and a lot of courage — to move in the opposite direction. Earliest published source on google books attributing this to Einstein is BMJ: The British Medical Journal, volume 319, 23 October 1999, p. 1102. This internet post from 1994 has the same quote, except attributed to E.F. Schumacher.

Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid. Human beings are incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant. Together they are powerful beyond imagination. Seems to be a variant of a quote (not by Einstein) from the 1969 Advances in Instrumentation: Vol 24, Part 4 which says on p. 16: "Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid. On the other hand, a well trained operator as compared with a computer is incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant. We think of this feature as 'intelligent override' in our control system." Hypnosifl 03:09, 1 December 2011 (UTC) Also, it looks like this is from the article "A Paper Industry Application of Systems Engineering and Direct Digital Control" by H. D. Couture, Jr. and M. A. Keyes which starts on p. 13...you can see from the snippet of p. 13 that H.D. Couture Jr. is the Training Director at Eastex Incorporated, and searching for Eastex shows that it's mentioned on p. 15 and p. 16, which is the page where the quote appears. I see that a comment from "stevestart" on this page confirms the quote is from that article, but a comment by "Toddulus" mentions a variant of the quote was written by Robert O' Conner in April 1968 (see here), and a comment by "David" gives a reference saying it was spoken by Leo Cherne in a speech from June 1968. Possibly it was just a cliche among certain professionals in computer-related industries at the time. Hypnosifl 19:14, 2 December 2011 (UTC) And even earlier is Current from 1962, which says on p. 53: "Man is a slow, sloppy, and brilliant thinker; computers are fast, accurate and stupid." It seems from the snippet that this source is just quoting an earlier article, "Problems, Too, Have Problems" which appeared in the October 1961 issue of Fortune magazine. As mentioned on p. 101 of ASPO newsletter, Volumes 25-27 , the "Problems, Too, Have Problems" article was written by John Pfeiffer, and two other early sources credit Pfeiffer with the observation that computers are fast, accurate, and stupid, see p. 85 of Elementary English, Volume 39 (1962), and The Journal of medical education, Volume 37, Issue 2 (1962) on p. 72 (see this snippet and this one.) So, most likely Pfeiffer's 1961 article is the original source of this saying. Hypnosifl 20:15, 2 December 2011 (UTC) A similar phrase was used earlier in 1956 from the American Bar News Association newsletter Volume 1 - 6 [2]: "...into a form that can be handled by these incredibly rapid and accurate, but stupid machines", Biunno said."

No, this trick won't work... How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love? Earliest published version I found was Symposium on structure of enzymes and proteins from 1956, which says on p. 284 and p. 283: 'I asked Dr. Morgan what he was doing in genetics then and he said, "I am not doing any genetics. I am bored with genetics. But I am going out to Cal Tech where I hope it will be possible to bring physics and chemistry to bear on biology. I think it will be good for biologists to live in that atmosphere." At that time a protein molecule was not a big black ball. It was something very smeary but equally dark. And de- naturation was a very mysterious phenomenon. Enzymes were almost as mysterious as they were at the time of the Pasteur-Liebig controversy. We could measure pTL and a few things like that and that was about all. There was some resentment, I think, among some biologists that their students, the younger people, were even using pH meters. In fact, a lot of fun was made about the dominance of pH over biology. Shortly after Dr. Morgan came to Cal Tech (and I came a year after he did), Einstein was visiting our place. He came around to biology, and talking to Dr. Morgan asked him what he was trying to do there, said it was a strange thing for a biologist to be at an Institute of Technology. Dr. Morgan told him what he had told me. Einstein shook his head and said, "No, this trick won't work. The same trick does not work twice. How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?"' All this is apparently from a piece that begins on p. 283 by Henry Borsook, and is titled 'Informal remarks "by way of a summary"', as seen in the table of contents here, and searching inside for "Henry Borsook" shows that his name does appear at the top of p. 283. Anyway, it seems as though these are Borsook's personal recollections of what happened at the lab (Borsook is also given as the source in The Molecular Vision of Life , p. 95), so it could go in the "posthumous" section.

The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift. This gets almost 500k hits on google, but as far as I can tell, none has a source. I tried amazon's lookinside and online repositories of his writings. Doing a google book search and restricting the date range to 1900-1990, there are only 10 books and several of them attribute it to "Samples, 1976" which is apparently The Metaphoric Mind by Bob Samples (which also seems to be the earliest published variant). If you go to that book's google page and enter "sacred gift" into the "From inside the book" box you get snippets of two sections that attribute it to Einstein, but as a paraphrase rather than a direct quote, with no source given, and the author seems to be adding his own comment when he writes "It is paradoxical that in the context of modern life we have begun to worship the servant and defile the divine" so even if the first part is accurate, this part is probably not Einstein's. Hypnosifl 02:50, 4 November 2011 (UTC) Einstein had many quotes about the value of intuition and imagination, but the specific word "gift" can be found in a comment remembered by János Plesch in the section Albert_Einstein#Posthumous_publications, "When I examine myself and my methods of thought I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge." So, Bob Samples might have been paraphrasing that comment. Likewise Einstein had a number of quotes about the intellect being secondary to intuition, but the language of the intellect "serving" can be found in a quote from Albert_Einstein#Out_of_My_Later_Years_.281950.29, "And certainly we should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality.

There comes a leap in consciousness, call it intuition or what you will, and the solution comes to you and you do not know how or why. All great discoveries are made in this way", which is an unsourced variant of a Life Magazine quote from a 1954 interview that I added to the Albert_Einstein#Einstein_and_the_Poet_.281983.29 section. Putting the phrase "valuable thing is intuition. The intellect has little" into google books turns up only one book from 2009 that uses it, although if you put it into google there are plenty of pages that do, including some from before 2009 like this blog entry from 2007, so it likely originated on the internet. This might actually be a case where wikiquote itself is the source of this erroneous quote, as I haven't found any internet sources from before 2005 that put them together this way, and its origin on wikiquote is this 9 January 2005 edit. Hypnosifl 01:45, 9 November 2011 (UTC) Found an earlier example of someone putting the two quotes together like this is in this usenet post from 14 Sep 1996.

The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources. On a google book search the earliest ones using the phrase "hide your sources" along with "Einstein" are from 2000, but searching google groups shows it's been circulating on the internet for a while before that, here's a usenet post from 1989 that uses it.

The solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind. If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker. (1945) On the problems presented by nuclear weapons. Variant: ... If I had only known, I would have been a locksmith. The second sentence about becoming a watchmaker is discussed in Albert_Einstein#Misattributed. Searching on google books for "Einstein" and "heart of mankind", all of them seem to pair it with the watchmaker quote without giving a source, so not very trustworthy (earliest source I find is Alan Moore's 1987 graphic novel Watchmen , which at the end of Chapter IV—originally published as a single issue on Dec. 1 1986 according to this page—has the quote "The release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking ... The solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind. If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker"). It's possible the "heart of mankind" sentence could be a paraphrase of the following quote from Einstein and the Poet , p. 92: "I agree with you, intellect has never saved the world. If we want to improve the world we cannot do it with scientific knowledge but with ideals ... We must begin with the heart of man—with his conscience—and the values of conscience can only be manifested by selfless service to mankind." Hypnosifl 16:31, 4 December 2011 (UTC) The "heart of mankind" part could also be inspired by a line from the interview with Michael Amrine here: "Science has brought forth this danger, but the real problem is in the minds and hearts of men. We will not change the hearts or other men by mechanism, but by changing our hearts and speaking bravely."

Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. Variants: Only two things are infinite, the universe and the stupidity of mankind, and I'm not sure about the former.

Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former . Earliest references on google books seem to be two 1969 books by Frederick S. Perls, the founder of gestalt therapy. In one, Gestalt Therapy Verbatim , he claims to have heard it from Einstein, writing 'As Albert Einstein once said to me: "Two things are infinite: the universe and the human stupidity."' In another book, "Ego, Hunger, and Aggression: the Beginning of Gestalt Therapy" he attributes it to "a great astronomer" and then refers to Einstein separately in the next sentence: 'it is not surprising to learn that a great astronomer said: "Two things are infinite, as far as we know — the universe and human stupidity." To-day we know that this statement is not quite correct. Einstein has proved that the universe is limited.' So it's not clear whether in this second quote he's implying that Einstein was the astronomer who said the first thing but then later revised his opinion about the size of the universe (an idea Einstein was suggesting at least as far back as 1920, see here, though he never actually "proved" it, or if in this quote he's imagining the astronomer as a separate person, and the two quotes are just inconsistent (whether because he wanted to attribute the quote to someone important-sounding, or because he just remembered it differently in the two books). Also, it says here that Ego, Hunger, and Aggression was originally published in 1942, though the version on google books is from 1969, so it might be a later edition and I don't know if the quote about the astronomer and human stupidity was in the original or if it was added in a later revision ("The Quote Investigator" seems to say here that it was in a 1940s version, I guess either 1942 or the second edition in 1947). Anyway, seems pretty dubious to me. Hypnosifl 04:18, 4 August 2011 (UTC) Also, it may be unrelated, but in the 1920 book "My Second Country" by Robert Dell, on page 276 I found a somewhat similar quote: "Renan said that the only thing that gave him any conception of infinity was human stupidity". And if you search google books for keywords "Renan", "infinity", and "stupidity" you find others, including this one from 1915 which is even closer to the one Perls attributes to "a great astronomer"--in this case, the quote is "He quotes the saying of Renan: it isn't the stars that give him an idea of infinity; it is man's stupidity." Ernest Renan was not an astronomer, but he was a philosopher who apparently had an interest in the idea of an infinite universe, see p. 204 of 'Life of Ernest Renan' from 1895 (search google books for "Ernest Renan infinity" for more). According to this page the original French version was "La bêtise humaine est la seule chose qui donne une idée de l'infini" and it comes from "Dialogues et fragments philosophiques", though when I searched the text for the word "humaine" I couldn't find the quote there. I suppose it's possible the quote was misattributed to Renan before it was misattributed to Einstein; searching google books for "bêtise humaine" and "l'infini", some attribute it to Voltaire...and this 1904 book gives a different version on p. 465, "Ce n'est pas l'immensité de la vôute étoilée qui peut donner le plus complétement l'ideé de l'infini, mais bien la bêtise humaine!" which translates roughly to "it is not the starry sky that can give the most complete idea of the infinite, but human stupidity!" which sounds a lot like the Einstein quote and is from before Einstein was famous...this 1903 book also gives the same quote at the bottom of p. 19. Meanwhile the book "Des vers" by Guy de Maupassant, which says on p. 9 that it's from 1880, also has a quote from a letter by Gustav Flaubert on p. 21, "Cependant, qui sait? La terre a des limites, mais la bêtise humaine est infinie!" which translates to "But who knows? The earth has its boundaries, but human stupidity is infinite!" It may just be an old cliché rather than something Flaubert invented, this page which is also dated 1880 but is from a different author says something similar ("Aujourd'hui je sais qu'il n'y a pas de limites à la bêtise humaine, qu'elle est infinie" or "today I know that there is no limit to human stupidity, it is infinite"). Anyway, regardless of whether Renan said a quote like this, do you folks think this is enough to put it in the "misattributed" section, or at least "disputed"? Hypnosifl 07:43, 4 August 2011 (UTC) This manner of speaking strikes me as very uncharacteristic of Einstein, but it might be included in the Misattributed section if it is widely attributed in sources that might reasonably be considered reliable. I am not enthusiastic about listing everything that circulates on the web or mostly appears in unreliable sources, particularly for someone like Einstein to whom practically everything has been attributed sometime by somebody. ~ Ningauble 13:29, 4 August 2011 (UTC) In the "sourced" section I agree we should only put quotes with good sources (either Einstein's own writings/speeches or someone who knew him personally). But when there's specific evidence that a given quote is misattributed, I think it's good to add it to the "disputed" or "misattributed" sections, so it can be "debunked" for people looking for it. The problem in this case is that it's a little ambiguous, both in terms of whether Perls' two mentions of this quote are inconsistent with each other (in the earlier one it does sound like the "great astronomer" is separate from Einstein, but it's not totally clear), and in terms of whether the similar quote attributed to Ernest Renan earlier ("it is not the starry sky that can give the most complete idea of the infinite, but human stupidity!") can be considered an "earlier version" of the quote attributed to Einstein even though they aren't exactly the same.

You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat. Probably bogus; a search on Google Books for "no cat" and the name Einstein turns up no reference to the anecdote prior to he Jonathan Lear's 1988 "Aristotle: the desire to understand", which refers to it as "perhaps apocryphal". Abb3w 15:27, 5 September 2010 (UTC) Doing a advanced google book search with words "telegraph", "cat", "pull" and "tail", and restricting the date range from 1800-1988, I find the first result is Real People: Thomas Alva Edison, a book from 1950. Based on that clue I tried adding "edison" to the search terms and using the same date range, a few books tell a story about Edison where he was given the same type of explanation, except with a dog in place of a cat, and Edinburgh in place of New York and London in place of Los Angeles (see this book, for example). Turns out Edison actually wrote down this story in The Diary and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison , p. 216 (you can type "edinburgh" into the "from inside the book" search box to find it). His anecdote was "When I was a little boy, persistently trying to find out how the telegraph worked and why, the best explanation I ever got was from an old Scotch line repairer who said that if you had a dog like a dachshund long enough to reach from Edinburgh to London, if you pulled his tail in Edinburgh he would bark in London.

"Mathematician"? to what theorems did he contribute? "Mathematical or theoretical physicist", certainly; but I question "Mathematician" (ditto the main article).

"Mathematician"? Yep ... Einstein was well versed in mathematics. To what theorems did he contribute? You don't have to contribute to a theorem to be a Mathematician. He was also a theoretical physicist and experimental physicist (he got his nobel for the later not the prior) Sincerely Reddi

I e-mailed the person who made the changes, and he said he got his version from the Internet. I'm more inclined to believe that SciAm is a more reliable source than the Internet. Therefore, I've changed it back, and also took the liberty to move the quote to the verified section.

Mathematician redux [ edit ]

Regarding the bit about Einstein being a Mathematician, being well versed in Mathematics does not make one a mathematician. Furthermore, the term well-versed is subjective at best. While many laypeople would consider most physicists to be well-versed in mathematics, we mathematicians generally would only consider a mathematician to be someone who publishes work on (usually) abstract mathmatics. Note publishes, note abstract. A paper on physics, or chemistry, or, hell, island biogeography may contain a substantial amount of math. But in this context it is being used as a tool to model the real world; mathematicians study math for its own sake. Mathematicians with a predominant interest in the mathematics of physics are generally called "mathematical physicists". Einstein, as much as we all love him, was not either of these things. His primary interest was physics, and his published papers were also on physics. There is no evidence that he even tinkered in Math for its own sake. Heck, the math in his papers wasn't even much more advanced than linear algebra, PDEs and tensor algebra, all things that I studied as an undergrad, and none of them new mathematically -- he relied heavily on Reimannian geometry and Differential topology concepts, none of them new when his paper was published, and certainly none authored by him.

As you probably are neither a physicist nor a mathematician, let me let you know: there is a certain about of (friendly) rivalry between the two disciplines, and mathematicians and physicists both often resent being misappropriated. Einstein was a physicist, and a good one, but he was not a mathematician.



I agree with you on that view. It could possibly be argued, however, that he is an applied mathematician -- because he took mathematics and applied it to create a new type of science. His primary activity was Physics, however, and that is how he ought to be described. Because of the public's perception of physicists as mathematicians the laity would name the likes of Einstein as their mathematicians rather than Godel, Cantor, Ramanujan, Gauss or GH Hardy. Despite the use of advanced mathematics in physics, mathematicians and physicists are very different beasts altogether. Physics is a science in the strictest sense. Its primary methodology is the Scientific Method. Mathematics on the other hand is an art form. And it abhors the Scientific Method. -- xsistor

Accuracy of quote [ edit ]

The sentence that reads:

The equivalency of matter and energy was originally expressed in the equation m = L/c², which with trivial changes became the far more well known E = mc².

Since this is mathematically inaccurate, I suspect he didn't say it, rather he likely said

Δm = L/c²

Organizing these... [ edit ]

These quotes are pretty disorganized right now. I will probably try to add a few, organizing the sourced ones chronologically, and the attributed alphapbetically tonight or tomorrow. ~ Achilles 21:41, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Mathematician [ edit ]

He was a physicist, not a mathematician. No mathematicians consider him one, no physicists consider him one, no historians consider him one. Smart guy, good at math, not a "mathematician," which is a specific discipline separate from theoretical physics. Some people were both. Einstein was not. This is nothing negative. See [3].

The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. [ edit ]

does anyone know if this is truly a quote by Einstein or if it is in fact by Hans Selye like here http://scienceweek.com/2001/sw010316.htm. I heard it was misatributed to einstein possibly due to it being an unatributed quote in The world as I see it http://lib.ru/FILOSOF/EJNSHTEJN/theworld_engl.txt wish i could remember the book i read that in. Thought it might have been in life in the cosmos but couldn't find it.

--- Here it is: "The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out candle. To sense that behind anything that can be experienced there is something that our minds cannot grasp, whose beauty and sublimity reaches us only indirectly: this is religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I am a devoutly religious man." -- Einstein, “What I Believe,” originally written in 1930 and recorded for the German League for Human Rights. It was published as “The World as I See It” in Forum and Century, 1930; in Living Philosphies (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1931); in The World As I See It, 1-5; in Ideas and Opinions, 8-11. The versions are all translated somewhat differently and have slight revisions.WalterIsaacson

removing a recent addition [ edit ]

I doubt the authenticity of many "quotations" of Einstein that are often provided without a source, including several on the article page, but some of these have circulated for years. I am removing one from the page that seems to be of very recent creation, and almost certainly spurious, :





In the view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for supporting such views. (p.97) http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069110297X Einstein and Religion: Physics and Theology (Paperback) isbn - 069110297X

I can find no evidence that this "quotation" existed anywhere on the web, nor anywhere in the entire world, prior to its posting here on 23 April 2005. At present the only other hits that I encounter in a Google search are of a very few sites, where the material of the entire page has plainly been derived from that of Wikiquote. I am strongly inclined to believe that this is simply a made-up statement by someone who does not much knowledge of the complex opinions of Einstein, nor much of an attachment to the ideals of rigorous veracity which he greatly exhibited. Over the years I have read many of Einstein's own writings, much about him, and have encountered numerous quotations of Einstein that make plain his general embrace of both the importance of a "cosmic religious feeling" and a rejection of most existing notions and conventional doctrines of a personal "God", including explicit statements that endorse some of the concepts of Spinoza. I feel this project should permit many quotations without a source in the "attributed" sections of articles, yet, those which are of such content as stands contrary to known and sourced quotations, should be investigated, and not be too readily retained, especially if there is no evidence of them ever having been cited elsewhere, prior to their posting here. ~ Achilles 10:37, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC) What is the sense in highlighting some of the quotes? Just because some of the editors here perceive them to be important does not mean that Einstien also agrees with the subjective judgement implied. When something is emphasised it implies that it is the origional authors emphasis and does not represent the full picture of what einstien himself had to say by making the unemphasised quotes seem trivial.

Einstein didn't say quotes even -- he usually talked, or wrote, at length. The very act of quoting is deciding some part is more meaningful than others. Bolding partial quotes means that the bold part is more meaningful than the rest, which was mostly left for context. Usually it's because the bold part is famous in general. ~ MosheZadka (Talk) 09:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

I added the above discussed quote with its original source. I don't see how Achilles would have trouble finding it pre 23 April 2005 as it is cited in many locations previous,was first said to Prince Hubertus zu Lowenstein in 1941, and published in Lowenstein's book in 1968. Here's the quote with its source:

In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for support of such views. Said to German anti-Nazi diplomat and author Hubertus zu Lowenstein around 1941. Quoted in his book, Towards the Further Shore, London, 1968, 156. Although Einstein said he would be considered an atheist "from the point of view of a Jesuit priest", he repeatedly denied being one in fact. A Jesuit would consider anyone an atheist who did not believe in the personal anthropomorphic deity of Christianity. This personal deity is only one part of the spectrum of religious/spiritual beliefs. Einstein's fits on the other end, where rests the "transcendent" deity completely unconcerned with human affairs.

German, Swiss or US Citizen? [ edit ]

The nationality is not the passport you have. It is rather the place you were born or the place you choose to live. Einstein left Switzerland for good when he decided to recover his German citizenship. He explicitely renounced his German citizenship when got political asylum in the US. I think that in the case of Einstein, it is more correct to say the he was a German born, US citizen (Not American, please!!). Pedron 20:03, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

I love that everyone wants to claim him. But a German-born U.S. citizen is the kid of a U.S. citizen born in Germany. Einstein was a citizen of Germany, Switzerland, and the U.S. And yet, he was neither Swiss nor American. How about calling him a German-born Jew, who was for a time a Swiss citizen, and then became a U.S. citizen in his later years (1940).99.60.230.175

Good source for sourced Einstein quotations [ edit ]

Check out The Expanded Quotable Einstein by Princeton University Press. The web page has sourced quotes from Chapter 1. --Nickg 23:57, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

This is true, I would only expand it to say that he did retain his Swiss citizenship throughout his lifetime. 68.64.213.150 03:31, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

Removal of one unlikely "quote" [ edit ]

In adding an attributed quote, I alphabetized some recent entries, sourced one, ignored many that are likely spurious (though widely attributed), but deleted this one which had been added in a revision of 14 July 2005 by 203.197.169.20:

My thinking about God is 'the superintelligent field prevalent in cosmos from where sub-atomic particle gets created and annihilated'. Imagine before such a strong force existence of humans is nothing.

It is ungrammatical and unlikely to be a competent translation, if it is based upon any statement he actually made, but there is no evidence of this being attributed to Einstein outside of Wikiquote, and two other sites with pages derived from ours. ~ Achilles 14:39, 22 October 2005 (UTC)

E=MC2 is not exact [ edit ]

{ I don't know whats going on but Einstein E=MC2 is not exact; one must consider the energy that each object absorbs and displays as resonancy, then rotational velocity and angle of impact | Sorry My name is Albert Allen Redditt (I was doing ROOTS geneology research and found out Reddit's were Reddi's in Scotland in 1200's but came from Reddi line from Rome or India prior to scotland?? nice to know we are working on similar things!}) —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 71.102.254.114 (talk • contribs) 23:26, 15 March 2006 (UTC)

I am kapil & a student . e=mc2 is not correct as one must also consider the energy absorbed by the matter present all around the substance producing energy. I think this subject needs a lot more study. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 122.168.42.249 (talk • contribs) 09:36, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

Folks, it doesn't matter if e = MC Hammer. To the extent that "e = mc2" can be considered a quote, it is arguably the most famous "quote" of Einstein's, which makes it worth including here. Note also that the associated item is also an Einstein quote. It's not meant to be the last word on the subject, only a couple of Einsteinian quotes. The equation's accuracy and limitations are not relevant for their inclusion in a quote compendium. Such issues should be analyzed (with proper sources, of course) in the relevant Wikipedia articles. ~ Jeff Q (talk) 10:08, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

Anyway, the more exact form is E = m c 2 1 − v 2 c 2 {\displaystyle E={\frac {mc^{2}}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}} 65.96.201.130 23:56, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

Just noticed this. Actually the best and most correct form is E = m 0 c2, I cant get it to do the subscript but m-zero m 0 is the reference frame. Using the full Lorentz version is identical, but only if you specify that v = 0. :)

(A slightly alternative terminology thats a little more computer friendly is E = Mzero * Cvac ^2 ) - Lucien86 08:08, 30 August 2011 (UTC)

What matters for Wikiquote's purposes is not what it means or whether readers understand it. (Einstein's use of subscripts was different from what is currently conventional, and varied over time in different contexts, but this can be read correctly either as a statement of total energy (E T ) in terms of relativistic mass (m) or as a statement of mass energy (E M ) in terms of rest mass (m 0 ), where total energy is the sum of mass energy and kinetic energy (E T =E M +E K ).) What matters here is only that Einstein famously said it. ~ Ningauble 18:07, 30 August 2011 (UTC)

I agree with Ninguable, but in any case Lucien86 is incorrect. The symbol m 0 is used to represent rest mass rather than relativistic mass, and if you don't restrict the equation to the reference frame where the mass is at rest, the full equation should be E 2 = m 0 2 c 4 + p 2 c 2 {\displaystyle E^{2}={m_{0}}^{2}c^{4}+p^{2}c^{2}} p = m 0 c 2 1 − v 2 / c 2 {\displaystyle p={\frac {m_{0}c^{2}}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}} r (equal to m 0 1 − v 2 / c 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {m_{0}}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}} r c2 works in all frames, although I don't think Einstein was actually using the concept of relativistic mass (nor do most modern physicists) but was just writing the equation in the object's rest frame. Hypnosifl 18:52, 31 August 2011 (UTC) Except that I never mentioned relativistic mass. I was merely pointing out that the correct form was to use m 0 the mass in the rest frame. I merely hadn't bothered to lookup the tag to subscript the zero. Anyway the rest frame is identical to the Lorenz expansion with the velocity v set to zero , which is all I said. You might understand GR but maybe you should learn to read a bit more carefully. :) Lucien86 14:24, 1 September 2011 (UTC) When you said the "Using the full Lorenz version is identical, but only if you specify that v = 0", I thought it meant you were saying that your version, E=m 0 c2, was better because it would apply even if v was not 0. If that's not what you meant your comment was a bit confusing (I guess I'm not sure what "the full Lorenz version" means--version of what?), what was supposed to be the advantage of E=m 0 c2 over E=mc2? When m is presented without a subscript it generally just means the rest mass as well, and plenty of textbooks do just use m for rest mass, m 0 is only used by authors who also talk about the relativistic mass (which, as I said, most modern authors do not), in order to differentiate rest mass from relativistic mass. Hypnosifl 16:58, 1 September 2011 (UTC) He didn't say "m 0 ", so "m 0 " is not part of the quote. By "m" he generally referred to what we call rest mass, so he was evidently referring to the energy of mass at rest, or to the component of total energy attributable thereto independent of reference frame; but as is often said, it's all relative. As I often say, quotations by their very nature are taken out of context. Call it the general theory of the relativity of quotes. What he meant by what he did say, or whether he was right or wrong, is not up to Wikiquote. ~ Ningauble I didn't get what you were saying for a moment there Hyposifl and Ningauble but yes of course it makes sense not to use it. Come to think of it we all use m all the time and whatever the velocity m is always still written in terms of the the rest frame. I must have been half asleep when I did that - then compounded it with the second comment. :( It was the unsigned guy using the m without the subscript in the relativistic momentum equation that threw me, I use relativistic KE quite a lot and just kind of picked up on using it. You learn something new every time... - Lucien86 19:35, 1 September 2011 (UTC)

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough [ edit ]

Did he say this one: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"? It seems to be attributed to him quite a bit out on the Internet

Citation needed.

Here is one location that provides a citation to the above Einstein quote, [4], eaheslop 16:02 UTC, 19 November 2018

Those are 4 dead links and 1 which directly refutes the credit given (albeit contains a comment saying "einstein said this first!"). Great. 18:09, 29 December 2011 (UTC)7

And this one "It should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid." [5] [6] [7] [8] . Thanks! Ewlyahoocom 08:48, 10 April 2006 (UTC)



Years ago I spotted a similar saying attributed to Einstein:

"You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother."

But this seems to be partly misattribution and partly a variant. See under "3. Misattributed" in the article. Oaklandguy (talk) 04:43, 27 January 2014 (UTC)

I believe this comes from Michele de Montaigne (1533-1592). I can't recall the French, but it begins, "C'est qui ce conçoit bien, [what you understand well,...] And says something like "If you can't say it simply, then you don't yet understand it well enough."

The French quote is actually by Nicolas Boileau - The Art of Poetry (1674), Canto I, l. 153

Einstein didn't say it, then? Too bad, I liked that formulation bette
