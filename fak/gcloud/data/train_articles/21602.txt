Interview: Tim Moore on proposed Voter ID legislation
House Speaker Tim Moore spoke with Spectrum News's Loretta Boniti on a bill he filed Thursday.

Moore, and other Republicans at the legislature, are working to allow North Carolinians decide in November whether or not you should be required to present a photo ID before being allowed to vote.

The bill will now go to each chamber where, if it receives 3/5 approval, it will be on the ballot in November.
