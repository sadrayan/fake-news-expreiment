Today is Day 164 of liberal trial lawyer Bill White refusing to debate. He also continues to refuse to release his taxes from his years in public service.

"When reporters ask questions because they're doing stories on Bill's finances, we provide the information requested," said Bill White campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon in the Aug. 14, 2010, edition of the Dallas Morning News, which noted it requested Bill White’s tax returns from 1993 to 1995 but was not provided them by the White campaign.

Bill White refuses to release his taxes from 1993-1998, years he held public service positions that required him by law to complete annual personal financial disclosures. While Bill White was Deputy Secretary of Energy (1993-95) and Chairman of the Texas Democratic Party (1995-98), he was required by law to complete annual personal financial disclosures which have not all been made public to the people of Texas.
