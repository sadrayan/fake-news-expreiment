Here are Cruz's amendments:

Amendment #1 would have kept the work permits in place, but moved them to after the enforcement was implemented.

Amendments #2 & 3 would have kept the entire G8 framework in place, but would have increased the H-1B caps (amendment 2) and the family-based green card categories (amendment 3).

Amendment #4 would have kept the entire G8 framework in place, but blocked illegal aliens from means-based benefits.

Amendment #5 would have kept the entire G8 framework in place, but removed the path to citizenship.

Keep in mind, the Committee considered more than 100 amendments and had roll call votes on most of them. The list is here:

Yes, amendments 2-5 would have kept the legalization and work permits in place, but if you watch the markup, you see what Cruz was doing. After the "Gang", literally, ganged up on him to defeat his first amendment, which would have moved the enforcement ahead of legalization, he set out on a mission to expose them. He offered amendments that actually expanded on the Gang's original framework only to see them continue to gang up and kill every one of them. I think he was trying to make the political point that any change to their framework, even if all 8 of them supported the change, would be shot down.

Cruz once supported increases in H-1Bs and legal immigration, and may still do, but I don't think he was ever willing to support legalization before enforcement. That's a different position from Rubio who has never said he would prevent legalization until enforcement was in place and working.
