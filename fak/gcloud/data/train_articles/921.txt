Chairman Rogers: Appropriations Committee has “done our job” Rogers Congratulates Committee as All 12 Appropriations Bills Receive Approval for the First Time Since 2009

Washington, July 14, 2015

The House Appropriations Committee today cleared its 12th and final funding measure, marking the first time since 2009 that all Appropriations bills have been approved by the full Committee.

Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers congratulated the Committee on its work.

"The Appropriations Committee has done its job. We got off to one of the earliest starts in history, held more than a hundred hearings and dozens of briefings, and conducted thoughtful and thorough analysis of every single discretionary line item in the budget.

"With the approval of the 12th bill today, all committee work on funding measures is completed – the first time this has happened since 2009 – and this has been done at a rapid pace with several weeks left before the August recess. In addition, six Appropriations bills have been approved by the full House. I congratulate the Committee on this impressive work.

"These 12 bills save taxpayer dollars by prioritizing funding and trimming back or eliminating areas of waste and inefficiency. They make tremendous strides to rein in executive overreach and bureaucratic red tape that infringes on the rights of Americans and stifles economic growth. Simply put, these are good bills that should be enacted into law.

"With time dwindling before the end of the fiscal year, it is my hope that all sides can come together to find common ground on an overall budget agreement. While a short term funding extension may be needed to provide additional time for negotiations, it is my intention to shepherd all Appropriations bills to final completion as quickly as possible."
