Perdue: Economy will block free tuition in '09
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) � Gov.-elect Beverly Perdue is dialing down some expectations for her first year in office due to the economy and the Legislature.



In an interview three days before her swearing-in, Perdue said Wednesday she knows the state's bad fiscal picture means her 2008 campaign platform of free community college tuition won't happen in 2009.



"I do have tremendous concerns about college affordability and about higher ed in general," Perdue said, but "I don't believe that my first priority and my first accomplishment will be free community college because of the budget. It's much harder than it was this time last year."



The two-term lieutenant governor, who succeeds fellow Democratic Gov. Mike Easley, faces a budget shortfall that could reach $1.6 billion this year. The difference between expected revenues and expenditures could be $3 billion as lawmakers assemble a spending plan for next year.



The community college plan was part of a "College Promise" program Perdue talked up during the campaign that would target children and their parents as early as fifth grade with the pledge of a debt-free college education.



The program piggybacks on a similar Easley initiative the Legislature started in 2007 to eliminate borrowing from financial-aid packages for students in low-income families. Perdue has said she hoped to expand this year.



"I believe there are ways to partner with existing funds that might help more kids go to college," she said.



Perdue said her focus on getting people back to work would displace for now her efforts to raise state's minimum wage. She had criticized Republican nominee Pat McCrory during the general election for being wishy-washy on whether he supported an increase. The current rate of $6.55 per hour will rise automatically to $7.25 in July with an increase in the federal minimum wage.



"My priority is to keep people working. I've got folks that have talked to me who are willing to take a less-than-minimum wage job right now just to get a paycheck," Perdue said.



Perdue, a former legislator, also said it will be difficult to give a government efficiency panel she plans to name as early as next week all of the power she wants it to have.



The governor-elect has said she wants to require lawmakers to vote yes or no on the panel's biennial recommendations without amendments, in a method similar to the one Congress uses to vote on base closing recommendations. But getting legislative leaders to cede power and be put on the spot by the commission will prove difficult.



"It may take us two or three years," she said. "I may never get all that I want, but I am going to begin it."



After releasing the names of her remaining Cabinet members Tuesday, Perdue and her office focused on this weekend's inaugural festivities.



Perdue said television icon and North Carolina native Andy Griffith would again participate in Saturday's inauguration ceremony on the steps of the state archives building in downtown Raleigh. About 5,000 chairs will be set up for the public ceremony, to be followed by the traditional inaugural parade and open house at the Executive Mansion.



Perdue said her speech � only about seven minutes long � will convey an optimistic tone even as the state's jobless rate is at a 25-year high.



"It's just a tremendous opportunity for us to put together a system that will help catapult us further into the 21st century successfully," she said. "I don't think we can put our heads in the sand."



Inaugural activities organized by the Junior League of Raleigh begin Thursday evening with a reception for Council of State members and a rock concert in downtown Raleigh targeted toward young adults.



The inaugural ball will be held Friday night at the Raleigh Convention Center. A program before the ball will feature Grammy award-winning saxophonist Branford Marsalis. Perdue, North Carolina's first female governor, also released a sketch Wednesday of the red beaded gown she plans to wear to the ball, which she will attend alongside husband Bob Eaves.
