Tennessee Ends Cards for Immigrant Drivers
ATLANTA â€” Tennessee has ended its policy of issuing "certificates for driving" to illegal immigrants, citing federal investigations that uncovered applicants using fraudulent documents -- and even bribing state workers -- to obtain driving privileges, officials said Friday.

The state began giving immigrants the certificates in July 2004, with the hope of balancing domestic security and traffic concerns. The cards give holders the legal right to drive but, unlike driver's licenses, they are not to be used for identification purposes. For instance, they cannot be used to board an airplane.

By doing so, Tennessee officials had hoped to solve a problem that has bedeviled other states, including California, where some lawmakers continue to press for full driver's licenses for illegal immigrants despite opposition from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The Tennessee model was criticized early on from diverse quarters. Anti-immigration forces worried that it gave legitimacy to illegal immigrants. Immigration-rights groups feared that police and others would be confused, and therefore inconsistent, in dealing with cardholders.
