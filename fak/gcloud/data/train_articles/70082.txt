Bioethics Journal Accuses Lancet, Scientific Community of Corrupting Science

(In November 2004, the bioethics journal, Ethics and Medics, published a critique by Associate Professor of Surgery Angela Lanfranchi, MD, FACS. Lanfranchi severely criticized a widely reported review of the abortion-breast cancer research published in the British journal Lancet in March 2004. The Lancet article was authored by by Oxford scientists Valerie Beral and her colleagues. Lanfranchi's critique was published on the coalition's home page on November 20, 2004.)

The bioethics journal, Ethics and Medics, published a hard-hitting editorial in its December 2004 issue accusing the British journal Lancet and the scientific community of corrupting scientific research examining the abortion-breast cancer link. The editorial, "The corruption of science by ideology," was authored by Edward J. Furton, M.A., Ph.D.
