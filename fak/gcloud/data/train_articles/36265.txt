Over 14,000 Hondurans are in Mexico's border with Guatemala, in a quest to get to the northern border, said municipal authorities, Tapachula's diocese, and the National Migration Institute (INM).

The first group walked for 37 kilometers from Ciudad Hidalgo to Tapachula on Sunday afternoon and was comprised by 5,333 children, women and men.

When the first group arrived in Tapachula at 4:30 p.m., another 2,000 Hondurans began to walk under the rain.

Meanwhile, there are 3,000 children, women and men in the Ciudad Hidalgo international bridge, shared by Mexico and Guatemala, who are looking to enter Mexico with documents provided by the INM.

Since Sunday, the number of Hondurans crossing the Suchiate river increases and on Monday, it has followed the same rhythm.

In Ciudad Hidalgo, the first concentration point, the city council, the diocese, and the State's government set up three shelters.

Tapachula's diocese and the State government provided food and water for the caravan.

The Health Ministry is providing a permanent health program for the Hondurans by vaccinating the children and carrying out blood tests.

Tapachula's city council is providing showers and toilet services for the migrants.

On Monday, it is expected that over 1,000 arrive into the shelter.

The members of the first caravan, which arrived in Mexico on Sunday afternoon, slept on the central park and nearby streets.

The caravan, which is looking to travel to the Mexico – U.S. border, will define its plans in the incoming hours.

Help groups located in Esquipulas, Guatemala, said that they are preparing for the arrival of other two large groups of around 3,000 to 4,000 people who are looking to get to the Mexican border.
