Trump quietly signed an Executive Order allowing gov't to fund religious groups
Ever the charlatan, Trump used the National Day of Prayer to pretend he is a pious Christian and signed an executive order that allows federal agencies to work with and fund religious organizations. He claimed the move was to “ensure that faith-based organizations have equal access to government funding” because “faith is more powerful than government, and nothing is more powerful than God.”
