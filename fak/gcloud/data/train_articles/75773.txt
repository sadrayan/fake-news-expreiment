Governor orders 4.75% in cuts
Barely two months into the new fiscal year, Gov. Ted Strickland is ordering a new round of budget cuts or other adjustments to fill an estimated $540 million hole in the state budget.

Barely two months into the new fiscal year, Gov. Ted Strickland is ordering a new round of budget cuts or other adjustments to fill an estimated $540 million hole in the state budget.

The move again highlights the sorry state of Ohio's economy, coming on the heels of his call in February to fill a $733 million budget shortfall. Cuts to accomplish that resulted in hundreds of layoffs, the closing of two state mental hospitals and an expansion into Keno gambling.

Strickland yesterday ordered a 4.75 percent cut to state agencies without affecting direct funding for grades K-12 education, universities, Medicaid, prisons and other priority areas. Agencies have until Sept. 22 to identify their cuts and until Oct. 1 to implement them.

"We don't know where the cuts will come from," said Karla Warren, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Education, which needs to trim $26 million without slicing direct aid to schools. "Our goal is to minimize the impact on students."

Although he expects additional layoffs will be necessary, Strickland said it's too soon to say how many or what state services may be affected at agencies -- many of which had said they already were cut to the bone.

The governor wouldn't categorically rule out a tax increase in the future but said he thinks any tax hike would make the state's economic situation worse.

"I believe this decision that we've made is the best way forward, given the challenging circumstances and the environment we face now and are likely to face in the months ahead," said Strickland, a Democrat.

Ohio State University officials praised the governor's decision to spare primary university funding, allowing the completion of the school's first back-to-back tuition freeze since 1965-66.

"He's recognizing the importance of higher education in terms of helping to turn around the state's economy," said William Shkurti, senior vice president for business and finance at Ohio State and a former state budget director.

Meanwhile, mental-health advocates warn that more cuts would have "devastating consequences."

Service providers "who have not had a rate increase for years will have no choice but to further reduce services and lay off staff," said Hubert Wirtz, director of the Ohio Council of Behavioral Healthcare Providers.

The first-term governor had said earlier this year that he would tap the state's $812 million rainy-day fund if additional cuts were needed. But with concerns that the economy could worsen, he is using just $63 million of the fund.

"I think it's also safe to say that while it's raining now, I fear that there is a much larger storm looming ahead of us," Strickland said.

Since July 1, state tax revenues have fallen $167.3 million below estimates, or 6 percent, with the income and sales taxes making up the bulk of the shortfall. Ohio has lost nearly 24,000 jobs so far this year, and the July unemployment rate, 7.2 percent, was the highest since 1992.

Still, the governor said he hopes that after filling $1.3 billion worth of shortfalls this year, the budget will stay balanced through the end of next June, when a new two-year budget takes effect. The Ohio Constitution requires a balanced state budget.

Strickland is filling the $540 million hole with $198 million in spending cuts and $342 million in "cash management strategies," such as transferring $112 million in unspent funds; $40 million in additional interest from the sale of bonds backed by payments from a tobacco lawsuit; and $126 million in expected lapses from planned spending.

Republican legislative leaders say they will keep an eye on the cuts to determine their impact on Ohioans. Some worry about the future ramifications of Strickland's continued use of "cash management."

"Every time you're relying on the lapses or rotary raids or tapping excess interest, it does make it more difficult to deal with the next operating budget," said Rep. Jay Hottinger, R-Newark, chairman of the House Finance Committee. "That just means that is money not available next time. The next budget cycle is going to be one of great challenge."
