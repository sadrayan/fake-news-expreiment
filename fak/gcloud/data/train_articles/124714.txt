Man sues himself and wins
A Kentucky man who threw a boomerang that flew back and hit him on the head has sued himself for US$300,000 (HK$2.32 million) - and won.



And astonishingly, it will not cost him a cent because all the money he won comes from his insurance company.



Larry Rutman, of Owensboro, was awarded the windfall after a court determined he 'caused body damage through negligence and carelessness'.



'I paid all that insurance for a long time just in case something unforeseen like this ever happened,' Mr Rutman said.



After the accident - which Mr Rutman claims affected his memory and made him oversexed - he was planning to sue the boomerang manufacturer until his lawyer advised him against it.
