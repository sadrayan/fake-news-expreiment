Cane Spider Facts
Cane spiders are nocturnal, entering homes and hiding behind wall hangings and under furniture, coming out at night to hunt. They are found in cars, often behind sun visors, frightening humans with their large size. Cane spiders are reluctant biters, biting only if provoked. Their bites are small but painful. They do not produce enough venom to be dangerous to humans, but a headache may result. Some cultures welcome the cockroach-eating cane spiders into their homes.
