I write this afternoon because we’re trying to evaluate a claim by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry who recently said in a Washington, D.C., speech: “Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to 2nd highest in the country in 2013.”

It looks to us like the 2002 ranking refers to how Texas then stacked up by its averaged freshman graduation rate while the 2012 ranking was referring to graduation rates per this February 2015 federal chart.

We wrote not long ago that Texas actually was third, tied with Wisconsin, for its 2012 graduation rate. Meantime, Texas ranked 22nd, tied with four states, for its 2012 AFGR.

I seek insight from you on the accuracy of Perry’s statement. I am particularly interested in the pluses and minuses of comparing the Texas ranking based on the one indicator in 2002 to the ranking reflecting the other indicator for 2012. Maybe you have other thoughts as well.

I hope to complete this fact check very soon.

THANK YOU.

Selby,

Do you have the AFGR (by state) for 2002 and 2012? If so, how did Texas rank in both years on that metric?

Likewise, do you have the ACGR (by state) for those years?

In other words, if you compare apples to apples, how did Texas' ranking change on each metric?

Rob

Texas ranked 28th for its AFGR in 2002, by our painstaking sort of the NCES-posted PDF. It was 22nd, tied with four states, in 2011-12, the latest year available (far as we could tell). Here is where it was third in 2012-13. I suspect the latter metric wasn’t around in 2002.

The two metrics are not at all comparable. On the only metric for which you have measurements over time, there has been little change. I infer that not much has changed. Of course; that does not establish where Texas stands in relation to other states.

The fact is, America has no good measure of high school graduation rates.
