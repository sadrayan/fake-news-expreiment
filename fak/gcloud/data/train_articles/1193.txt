`Build Illinois` Nailed Down

Deal Hands Thompson A Big Win

Though Republicans and Democrats each added $90 million in immediate projects to the program, the governor gained perhaps even a larger pre-election year advantage because he is now able to determine which projects will be funded.

SPRINGFIELD â€” The raging, competing voices for pork-barrel projects quieted Monday as the General Assembly, in a somber two-hour session, handed Gov. James Thompson a coveted victory by approving his prized ``Build Illinois`` program.

In a quick special session, the House and the Senate agreed on the compromise plan, which puts the total of public works improvement projects in the first year at $380 million. But the plan also gives Thompson authority to determine which projects above the $317 million spending level in the first year will be dropped.

Monday`s action wrapped up a spring session that included landmark reforms in education, a rewrite of utility laws and an overhaul of the state`s malpractice statutes. Just as significant, the legislature shelved the 1992 Chicago World`s Fair, an elected Chicago school board and off-track betting.

It put off action on a controversial regional interstate banking bill and probably will have to come back late this month or early next month in a special session to consider additional funding for the expansion of McCormick Place.

In selling the legislature on Build Illinois, Thompson also managed to sell lawmakers more easily on a 5 percent tax on the private sale of used autos to fund it.

Previously, transactions on the sales of cars between individuals were subject to only a $30 fee. The new tax is expected to generate $52 million the first year, and in other years is scheduled to generate $70 million.

Passage of the Build Illinois projects came after days of partisan wrangling over what should be included in the ambitious five-year program.

House Minority Leader Lee Daniels (R., Elmhurst) held up the state`s $19.6 billion budget for five days last week until Democrats restored Republican projects.

Final approval of the plan was given on a 44-1 vote in the Senate and a 95-15 roll call in the House minutes earlier.

Just before the House adjourned, Speaker Michael Madigan (D., Chicago)

appealed to representatives to forget the inflamed rhetoric surrounding Build Illinois.

``It`s all history,`` Madigan said. ``. . . We ought not to leave here bearing grudges.``

The five-year program Thompson proposed in February at $1.3 billion was increased by $94 million in its first year, according to the governor`s Bureau of the Budget, though Thompson retained the authority to reduce the program to the level authorized by new taxes and bonding authority.

According to Robert Mandeville, director of the Bureau of the Budget, the compromise plan will add $94 million to the $223 million the governor had planned to spend for the first year on Build Illinois, increasing the fiscal 1986 spending to $317 million.
