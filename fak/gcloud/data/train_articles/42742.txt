Employer Responsibility Under the Affordable Care Act
The Affordable Care Act does not require businesses to provide health benefits to their workers, but applicable large employers may face penalties if they donâ€™t make affordable coverage available. The employer shared responsibility provision of the Affordable Care Act penalizes employers who either do not offer coverage or do not offer coverage that meets minimum value and affordability standards. These penalties apply to firms with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees. This flowchart illustrates how those employer responsibilities work.
