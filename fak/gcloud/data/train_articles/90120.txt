Water and Wastewater Rates

Water and wastewater customers are billed monthly. The bill includes a monthly service charge and volume charges for water and wastewater services. The rates below apply to customers with 5/8" water meters only.

Service charges for larger meters are billed at the same rate as larger meters serving commercial and industrial customers. To view these service charges, refer to the monthly service charges for commercial and industrial water customers.

The monthly service charge is a flat amount charged to the customer every month. Monthly service charges for water are based upon the meter size.

MetroCare Water Assistance Program Regulations

Monthly Service Charge Water Wastewater 5/8" Meter $14.56 $17.51 Unmetered* $62.92

*If water is not metered, then there will only be a flat charge for wastewater.

Volume charges are charges for each Ccf of water used by the customer. Volume charges for wastewater are the same regardless of the consumption.

Volume Charge Water Wastewater Any number of Ccfs $4.04 $7.01

If you use 6 Ccf of water in a one-month period, here's how your monthly water/wastewater bill is calculated:

Type of Charge Ccf Charge per Ccf Total Total Water/Wastewater Bill $98.39 Monthly Service Charge (5/8" Meter) $14.56 Volume Charge for Water 6 $4.04 $24.24 Monthly Service Charge for Wastewater (5/8" Meter) $17.51 Volume Charge for Wastewater 6 $7.01 $42.08

From March through November, when you may use water for watering lawns and gardens and for washing vehicles, your wastewater bills are adjusted because this water does not go through the wastewater treatment plant. We base your wastewater bill on whichever is less: the actual water used from March through November or the average monthly water usage billed during the preceding months of December through February.

Conservation Charges for Water

During times in which water must be conserved, additional charges will be applied for excess usage.

For an average water customer whose winter monthly consumption is 8 Ccf, they will be allowed to use 11 Ccf of water before experiencing additional charges for excess usage. This is referred to as the conservation charge threshold and is based on 140% of the winter monthly consumption.

Once a customer has exceeded the conservation charge threshold, they will be charged 150% of the volume charge for each Ccf used during a voluntary conservation period. At the current rates, this would be $6.06 per Ccf or 150% of $4.04.

During a mandatory conservation period, this rate would be increased to 200% instead of 150%. For example, the rate would be $8.08 per Ccf during mandatory conservation or 200% of $4.04.

Below is an example of how to calculate the water bill for a customer who uses 20 Ccf during a voluntary conservation period. Note that this calculation is only for the water portion of the bill.

Figure used in Conservation Calculation Calculation Ccf Winter Monthly Consumption 8 Conservation Charge Threshold 8 * 140% 11 Actual Monthly Consumption (during conservation period) 20 Consumption Subject to Conservation Rate 20-11 9

Type of Charge Ccf Charge per Ccf Total Total Water Bill $113.54 Monthly Service Charge (5/8" Meter) $14.56 Water at Regular Rate 11 $4.04 $44.44 Water at Conservation Rate 9 $6.06 $54.54

Stormwater Utility Rates

Residential Stormwater Rates

Rates per Single Family Residential (SFR) parcel Annual Fee SFR parcels less than 1,001 sq. ft $26.25/yr. SFR parcels between 1,001 and 2,399 sq. ft. $47.25/yr. SFR parcels greater than 2,400 sq. ft. $73.50/yr.

Non-Residential Stormwater Rates

Rates per Equivalent Residential Unit* (ERU) Annual Fee Multi-family Residential $45/Equivalent Residential Unit(ERU) $47.25/ERU Non-Residential ** $47.25/ERU

*Equivalent Residential Unit = 1,425 sq. ft

**Includes but is not limited to commercial, residential, non-profits, churches, schools, colleges/universities

Minimum fee for all property classes is $26.25

EXAMPLE: The fee for a Non-Residential property with 14,250 sq. feet of impervious area would be $472.50. See the following calculation: 14,250 sq. feet/1,425 sq. feet = 10 ERU's, 10 ERUs x $47.25 = $472.50 per year.
