Number of ObamaCare waivers continues to grow
Despite the fact that last year's so-called health care legislation was sold to the public as necessary to "fix" the nation's health care system, over 1,100 waivers have been granted to businesses, unions, and other organizations exempting them from much of the new laws "remedies".

For its part, the administration claims that the waivers are needed to "stabilize" the insurance market. In other words, they are admitting that their bill, if fully implemented and applied equally, would destroy the private insurance market and result in fewer (and more expensive) insurance options for Americans.

From the Hill:

“The fact that over 1,000 waivers have been granted is a tacit admission that the healthcare law is fundamentally flawed,” said Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) last month. Upton is one of three House committee chairmen who has used new oversight powers to investigate the annual limit waivers.

Some conservative groups are suing in order to obtain documentation regarding those waivers, charging that favoritism is involved since many of the recipients have been unions.

The one-year waivers are typically granted to organizations that offer low-value insurance plans, known in the industry as “mini-med” plans. But Nobody knows what will happen to the health plans after the one-year waivers expire. The number of people covered by waivers grew about 300,000 over the past month to 2.93 million. HHS says the waivers represent less than 2 percent of the private insurance market.

This is the type of problem you end up in when you have a massive government try to impose a one size fits all solution for hundreds of millions of people. It doesn't work, so the bureaucrats end up in a position of getting to decide who does and doesn't have to obey the rules that everyone else has to live by.

In other words, it's all about power.
