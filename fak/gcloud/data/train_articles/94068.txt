Colorado marijuana tax revenue rebounds after September dip
DENVER - Recreational marijuana sales in Colorado have bounced back after a slow September, when Colorado notched its first month-over-month decline for the newly legal drug.

The Colorado Department of Revenue says the state brought in about $3.2 million from recreational marijuana sales in October. That's up from about $2.9 million in September but below the roughly $3.3 million of recreational pot sales taxes in August.

Marijuana retailers say they are expecting sales to pick up this fall and winter along with ski travel. A Colorado analysis released in July estimated that 90 percent of recreational pot sales in mountain resort towns are made to out-of-state visitors.

Since Jan. 1, Colorado has brought in more than $60 million in taxes, licenses and fees for recreational and medical marijuana.
