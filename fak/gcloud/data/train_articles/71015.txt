Arizona immigration law costs and savings
The upcoming enforcement of SB 1070 has caused many illegal immigrants to flee Arizona. The scope of the monetary effects depends on how much of the illegal-immigrant population leaves. Here's a look at the effects of various exodus scenarios:

Crime and courts

Education

Public opposition

The safety net

Wages and prices

As much as any aspect of the new immigration law, its impact on police, jails and the justice system is little more than a guess. "Nobody has an idea as to what it's going to mean," said Amy Rex, the criminal-justice project manager for Maricopa County. "The county is looking at what we need to do. It's just that there are a lot of moving parts." Local police and courts around the state could face a torrent of new misdemeanor cases. If they do, it will push up county jail populations. The law carries up to a 20-day jail sentence and $100 fine. County authorities estimate that 19 percent, or 24,700, of the 130,000 inmates booked into the jail annually are illegal immigrants, Rex said. The cost to house each inmate for 20 days is about $1,600. If the number of illegal immigrants booked into the jail rises 10 percent and each inmate serves 20 days, it would cost taxpayers an extra $3.8 million annually. If the departure of many illegal immigrants causes crime to drop and jail bookings of them decline by 5 percent, taxpayers would save about $2.4 million, based on the current average jail term of 25 days. Breaking the new law is a misdemeanor, so it seems unlikely to have a sizable effect on state prisons, which typically house felons. A 5 percent change in the 6,100 illegal immigrants in state prisons, for example, could cost or save taxpayers about $6.6 million. Any cost changes figure to be dwarfed by the amount Arizona is underfunded by Congress each year for incarcerating illegal immigrants who commit felonies or are repeat offenders, state officials say. The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program provided Arizona and its counties $19 million in fiscal 2009, according to the U.S. Justice Department. There are estimates that the Arizona Department of Corrections alone spends at least $130 million imprisoning illegal immigrants annually. Gov. Jan Brewer hopes SB 1070 will shrink prison costs as illegal immigrants flee the state, said Paul Senseman, a spokesman for the governor. There are mixed reactions in police circles as to what the law's effects will be. Mark Spencer, president of a Phoenix police union, has predicted the law will have little effect on the state's largest city because officers already use a departmental policy that gives them authority similar to what is in the new law. Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris says the law will corrode relations with the Hispanic community and divert police attention from more-pressing duties. Interim Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley has said that prosecuting the cases could be more difficult because of questions involving rules of evidence, standards of proof and the 70-year-old federal statute the law is built around. Apart from SB 1070, Romley has said he will be more selective than his predecessor in prosecuting cases involving illegal immigrants. In minor cases, he will alert federal authorities rather than bring state charges, a policy shift that could affect jail and court costs in Arizona's most populous county.

Public education, the state government's largest budget expense, may be where the law has its most direct financial impact. Arizona has 130,000 to 170,000 students whose parents are illegal immigrants, according to enrollment in English-learner classes and 2009 estimates by the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center. Census data and other studies indicate that most of the families are lower income and thus more likely to be in public schools. In general, if 5 percent of the estimated children of illegal immigrants leave Arizona schools, it would reduce the state's education bill by $37 million, based on 2008-09 school-year per-student funding figures. If a quarter of the children of illegal immigrants leave, the number jumps to $187 million. If they all leave, the state would save $749 million. That doesn't necessarily mean total education spending would decline. The state could increase per-student funding levels, and the legal student population is expected to grow. Also, Pew estimates that 60 percent of the children of illegal immigrants are U.S. citizens, suggesting that some, especially older students, may remain in Arizona even if their families leave. While any loss of students would save the state money, it also would reduce the state's level of federal education funding. In 2009, the state received more than $1 billion in federal funds, based on various funding formulas. Chuck Essigs, a lobbyist for the Arizona Association of School Business Officials, worries that the law will simply drain schools of money. Unless enrollment declines are concentrated, he said, schools will still have virtually all the same needs and expenses but less money to cover them. That could bring budget cuts, loss of teachers and other jobs, and larger class sizes, he said. Schools have a number of fixed expenses, including bus routes and building maintenance. Even so, many parents still believe fewer children of immigrants will mean smaller class sizes and fewer language barriers, which they believe could improve education quality for remaining children.

One of the more speculative wild cards is the economic effect of public opposition to Arizona's law. Several major cities, including Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, are officially boycotting the state. There also are scattered calls to support Arizona because of the law. So far, the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association estimates that at least 40 group meetings have been canceled, costing $12 million in lost hotel revenue. Kristen Jarnagin, a spokeswoman for the association, said that figure doesn't include the impact on restaurants, retailers and rental-car companies. "We had an incredibly strong first quarter of 2010. And then SB 1070 hit, and it knocked us back two steps," she said. There have been public calls to move the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game from Phoenix. Last year's NBA All-Star Game in Phoenix generated about $35 million in extra economic activity, state and local officials have estimated. The impact on general tourism could be far more damaging. In 2008, visitors who stayed in hotels and motels accounted for $7 billion in overall spending, most of which came from non-residents, the Arizona Office of Tourism says. Even a 2 percent drop would mean a $140 million loss to businesses and the state's treasury. Many Arizonans recall the furor two decades ago over the state's resistance to declaring an official Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. It caused the National Football League to reject Tempe as the site of the Super Bowl. By some estimates, the boycotts then cost the state nearly $200 million. For now, experts suspect the effects of boycotts to be relatively modest compared with other, more direct economic fallout from the law. "Most boycotts don't work," said Monroe Friedman, a retired Eastern Michigan University psychology professor who wrote a book about consumer boycotts. "One of the reasons is ï¿½ you really need organization." Still, the immigration law could become the kind of issue that "hits you in the gut" and results in such organization, he said. A boycott, however, could be offset to a degree by a "buycott" in which supporters of the law go out of their way to spend in Arizona as a sign of solidarity, Friedman said. Jarnagin said radio stations in Los Angeles, Baltimore and Houston have already helped organize such trips to the state, but the efforts aren't offsetting the lost business meetings. If other states enact similar laws, the battle could shift from boycotting Arizona to fighting in Washington. Several lawsuits against the state already have been filed, including one from the U.S. Justice Department. Brewer has turned to a private law firm rather than the attorney general to defend the law. It's unclear how much those efforts may cost taxpayers, but legal action over the employer-sanctions law may offer a clue. As of June, the Attorney General's Office has identified about $116,000 in salary and related expenses since 2007 stemming from that matter. Six attorneys have divided more than 1,400 hours on the case, which is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The lead lawyer, the solicitor general, has logged at least 660 hours. The state has agreed to pay the lead attorney defending SB 1070 $450 an hour. Other lawyers will charge between $225 and $350 an hour. If the case takes comparable time, even the lowest hourly rate would cost more than double the employer-sanctions case. Private donors have given the state $705,000 so far for the legal-defense fund to uphold SB 1070, officials said. Even if SB 1070 is eventually upheld in court, the new enforcement climate could lead to more cases claiming civil-rights violations against police. One impossible-to-measure factor is the effect on attracting new residents and businesses in an increasingly diverse nation. Public-opinion polls generally have shown strong support for enforcing immigration laws, but some polls have shown similar support for providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Barry Broome, president of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, said his organization recently tried to poll representatives for about 200 large companies about SB 1070's effects on their views of Phoenix as a business location. Only one responded, a sign of how damaging the issue has been to the state's business reputation, he said. "Businesses," he said, "don't want to get caught in the middle of this."

Except for health care, public benefits such as welfare, food stamps and unemployment assistance are unlikely to be affected much by the new law, officials say. Illegal immigrants already are ineligible for most aid under Arizona law, said Steve Meissner, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Economic Security, which administers many of the programs. Illegal immigrants also are barred legally from getting Medicaid. Undocumented immigrants can obtain treatment in hospital emergency rooms because federal law requires hospitals to provide emergency care to anyone, even when a person cannot pay the bill for care. Illegal immigrants in Arizona accounted for at least $24 million in uncompensated care at hospitals in 2008, or about 6 percent of total uncompensated care after federal reimbursements, according to the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association. This isn't to say that some illegal immigrants don't try to enroll in welfare, food stamps and the like. Meissner said authorities must refer any attempts by non-citizens to enroll for public benefits to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Between late November and late June, DES made 955 such referrals, a small fraction of the "hundreds of thousands" of applications processed in that time, he said. "The bottom line is they don't get in the front door," he said. DES has a fraud unit, but there are no routine estimates that track benefits received by illegal immigrants, a sign of its relative scarcity, he said. This suggests that SB 1070 is unlikely to affect the amounts of spending on these programs, which are primarily funded by federal tax dollars. However, if many illegal immigrants leave jobs that the unemployed want, the demand for public aid from legal residents could decrease.
