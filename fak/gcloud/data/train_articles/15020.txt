Total births by race
Definitions: Live births by race and ethnicity of mother.



On birth certificates, as on most federal data collection forms, the question regarding whether a person is Hispanic is separate from the question asking whether a person is white, Black, Asian or Pacific Islander, or American Indian. Thus, people are asked to select a racial group and to indicate whether they are of Hispanic origin. A birth to a woman who reported that she was Hispanic and white would usually be included in figures for both of these groups. In order to create mutually exclusive categories, Hispanics were removed from the black and white racial categories in the tabulations presented here. This allows more meaningful comparisons between minorities and the group people typically think of when we say white. It should also be noted that these figures represent the race of the mother, not the race of the child. This is important because increasing numbers of children are born to parents of different races. Births for which Hispanic origin was not reported are included in the "Other" category.
