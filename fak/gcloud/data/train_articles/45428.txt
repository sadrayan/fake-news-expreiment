Senators & Committees
The Senate's 63 members represent districts from across New York State. Senators belong to a single conference and one or more political parties.

We've made it easy to filter senators by party, committee, and the other legislative groups in which they gather to consider the merits of proposed legislation and to better understand complex legislative issues.
