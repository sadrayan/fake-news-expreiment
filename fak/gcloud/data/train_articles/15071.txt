David Hogg Mocked for Giving Nazi/Socialist Salute to End March
Social media is going crazy after David Hogg gave what could be either a Nazi salute or the communist power salute. people are wondering what he was thinking but Iâ€™m wondering if he was thinking. After all, he isnâ€™t the sharpest crayon in the box to begin with and many of his statements are just factually wrong. Twitter is going wild claiming that Hogg is showing his true colors but Iâ€™ll wait to see if CNN included that in his script before I decide. He may have only been following orders.

Personally, I think Hogg did it to honor his heroes who disarmed their citizens before slaughtering them.
