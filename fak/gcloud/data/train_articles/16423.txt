Can you provide the raw figures that generated that percentage – as in the fall 2003 figure and the fall 2014 figure? If I have those, I can run an inflation adjustment.

Thanks! Adjusting for inflation using this BLS web page, it looks to me like total tuition and fees for the 15 hours escalated 64 percent through fall 2014. Anything seem off about that?

I asked the accountability team to check this. Here is the response: Yes, we concur with his number of 64% with inflation.
