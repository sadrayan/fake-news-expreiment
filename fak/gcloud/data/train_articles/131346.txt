Scaramucci Posts Nude Photos Of His Wife As Revenge For Divorce
Scaramucci’s wife, Deidre Ball, filed for divorce citing her husband’s “blind political ambition” as her main reason for leaving him.

Washington D.C. — Senior Advisor to the President, Anthony Scaramucci is no stranger to controversy. From the beginning of his career at Goldman Sachs to his recent successful selling of global investment firm Skybridge Capital, Scaramucci has been in the gilded spotlight. The spotlight that he is currently in may be more than he bargained for.

Scaramucci’s wife, Deidre Ball, filed for divorce citing her husband’s “blind political ambition” as her main reason for leaving him. Scaramucci has hit back by posting nude pictures of Ball to his Twitter account earlier this evening, posting “Now everyone can see her ‘blind’ ambition.” The pictures show Ball completely nude in very suggestive poses, obviously meant to be kept private.

Twitter has responded by taking the pictures down, as it violated their code of ethics. Scaramucci’s account remains active.

Republican supporter John Rosenthal spoke to the Scooper about his thoughts on the – now widely shared – Twitter post.

“Hey, I just wish I would have thought of that when my Rosie divorced me,” joked Rosenthal. “But honestly, as hot as those pics were, I think he screwed up posting them. My question is, how the hell can she bend like that?”

There has been considerable backlash in the media, as well as by democratic opposition. All saying that Scaramucci should be fired and prosecuted for posting those pictures.

Selma Yelan, a self professed “Trump Hater,” gave her opinion to the Scooper about the pictures posted by Scaramucci.

“I am in complete shock. She trusted him, just goes to show you, Republicans will kick you in the pussy as soon as you oppose them,” said Yelan. “She should post pictures of his little weenie. Everyone knows Republicans have little ones… just sayin’.”
