in 2014, the average executed price of wind power purchase agreements was $23.5 / MWh.

This is still significantly cheaper than the average cost of coal, even adding back the full value of the wind production tax credit ($23 / MWh). And wind will continue to become more competitive as research further improves technology.

â€ŽAt a state level, according to data by BNEF, the levelized cost of energy from wind in Iowa and Texas, even without subsidies, is lower than the LCOE of coal at $59/MWh.
