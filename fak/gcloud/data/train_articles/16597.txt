Thank you for sending along a link to the Tweet posted by Gov. Abbott.

In the over 15 million words written by Winston Churchill—in his speeches, articles, books and other writings—there is no evidence to suggest Churchill wrote them.

Whether he uttered the words in conversation is unknowable, but I am not aware of any of Churchill’s contemporaries who record or recall the statement.

Churchill did say, at Guildhall in London, on 10 September 1947 words that were true in his pre-Internet age and perhaps even more true our own, “… it would be a great reform in politics if wisdom could be spread as easily and as rapidly as folly.”

With kind regards,

Tim
