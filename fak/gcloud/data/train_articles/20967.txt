Pelosi: Democrats Will Repeal the GOP Tax Law When We Retake the House – NTK Network
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said that Democrats would indeed repeal the GOP tax law if they are successful in retaking the House of Representatives this November during a town hall on Wednesday.

The moderator of the event asked Pelosi if Democrats would re-write the tax bill from scratch or focus on reversing specific elements.

“One of our complaints about what they did with the tax bill is they did it in the dark of night with the speed of light,” Pelosi said.

Pelosi then declared that Democrats will win back the House in 2018, and after they do, they will work with Republicans to create a new tax bill.

“We’ll sit down at the table and say … what would be a tax bill that creates growth, that creates good paying jobs as it reduces the deficit?” Pelosi said. “It’s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it’s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future.”
