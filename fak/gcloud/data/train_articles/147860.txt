Major Terrorism Cases

Past and Present

Terrorism is nothing new in the United States; we’ve been investigating and helping to prevent terrorist attacks since the 1920s.

Below are some of our most significant cases; you can find more described in the various Terrorism publications covering from 1996 to 2008 posted on our Reports and Publications webpage.

More recent information on terrorist incidents can be found in the National Counterterrorism Center’s calendar. You can also search for terrorism incidents and significant dates in a database maintained by the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism.
