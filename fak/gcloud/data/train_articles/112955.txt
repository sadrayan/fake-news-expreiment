Passport FAQs

What is a passport?

A passport is a travel document that serves as the ultimate form of proof for your citizenship. Every country issues passports to citizens of that country. British Citizen passports are issued by the United Kingdom Identity & Passport Service (IPS). UK passports come in two sizes to accommodate frequent travellers, jumbo and regular. Jumbo passports contain 48 pages while regular passports contain 32 pages.



Do I need a passport?

British citizens require passports to exit and enter the UK and all other countries in the world. It is your responsibility to carry the correct identification while travelling abroad.



Do British Subjects have the same rights of entry to other countries as a British Citizen passport?

No. British Subject passport holders have different entry requirements than British Citizen passport holders. If you hold one of these passports and require information on passports and visas, email info@uk.visacentral.comfor further information.

When applying for a passport renewal, will my old passport be returned to me?

How long must my passport be valid for international travel?

Most countries require that a passport be valid for at least six months beyond the completion of a trip. If your passport expires sooner than that, you must apply to renew your passport.

How many blank passport pages do I need to meet entrance requirements and what is considered a 'blank' passport page?

Passports must have enough blank pages to accommodate entry and exit immigration stamps for each country of travel. At least one visa page in your passport is required for each visa. Most travel visas that are stamped into your passport require an entire blank visa page. A 'blank' visa page must be clean, clear, and not show ink or stains from any other pages in the passport.
