Engen Limited – Phembani
Phembani acquired a 20% stake in Engen in 1999. As of February 2017, Phembani leads a consortium that now holds 26% in Engen. The balance of the equity is held by Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas). Engen is the industry leader in South Africa in petroleum products, with an estimated market share in excess of 25%. Engen’s core business is the refining of crude oil (135 000 bpd capacity) and the marketing and retailing of liquid fuel products through an extensive retail network.

Engen’s activities in the petroleum sector span the entire value chain, with the exception of exploration activities. Engen has a significant presence in 16 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries.

Fuel consumption is linked to GDP growth, meaning Engen is well positioned to benefit from the high growth in SSA markets.
