And then there was there response from their own release:

Patrick Campaign Response:

“Bankruptcy and lien documents show Dan Patrick owed the federal government for unpaid payroll taxes. These documents do not prove that Patrick collected and pocketed the taxes. This is not a defense; however, it is a technical distinction. According to Patrick, these taxes were ultimately paid and the debt to the federal government was settled.”
