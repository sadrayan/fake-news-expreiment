WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that the United States should be able to boost gross domestic product growth far beyond its current levels over time.

“I really believe it,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. “We’re saying 3 (percent) but I say 4 over the next few years. And I say there’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to get at some point into the future to 5 and above.”

Last year the U.S. economy grew 1.6 percent, it’s worst performance since 2011.
