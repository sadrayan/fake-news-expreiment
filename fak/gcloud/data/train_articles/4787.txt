Tragedies like those in Orlando, San Bernardino and Paris have highlighted how dangerous terrorists are when equipped with guns and explosives, yet terrorists are readily able to purchase these weapons in the United States. Since my first term in Congress, I have supported the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act. This commonsense bill would prohibit known or suspected terrorists from purchasing guns or explosives while protecting the Second Amendment Rights of law abiding Americans.

Living near Chicago, we are also all too familiar with the disturbing pattern of gun violence. The issue is not only mass shootings, but also day-to-day violence that puts family safety at risk. I have and always will put people ahead of partisan politics. That's why I joined with former Democratic Congresswoman Gabby Giffords to introduce legislation implementing universal background checks and helped introduce a bill called the Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers Act to prevent domestic abusers from getting access to deadly weapons.

There is no quick and easy solution, but we can take steps that will make the United States safer and help prevent future atrocities while protecting the Second Amendment rights of law abiding Americans.
