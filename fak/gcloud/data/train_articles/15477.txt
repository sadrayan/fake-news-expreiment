Mike:

Good morning.

I write seeking elaboration/backup on Rep. McCaul’s statement on the House floor June 5 about the Obama administration planning to release dangerous criminals.

During discussion of the DHS Appropriations Act, McCaul said the measure provides for additional Border Patrol officers and ICE operations plus “funding for ICE’s 34,000 detention beds despite the administration’s plans to reduce the number and release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities.” I have bolded what we seek to check. I viewed the debate on C-SPAN: http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/HouseSession5411

?

Thanks.

the administration’s plans to reduce the number

President Obama's funding request was:

FY '13 31,800 beds

FY '12 32,800 beds

and release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities.”

Per ICE, specific numbers are law enforcement sensitive, but have been reported by various news outlets.

How many beds exist now? Which news reports is the congressman relying on per the release plans?

Congress currently mandates a 34,000 bed daily average. He is not relying on press reports. He has seen the stats.

If you have information he drew upon, I am interested in citing it. It won’t illuminate if I simply say McCaul relied on statistics without presenting them.

Are the fiscal years right below? One refers to the year that ended last Sept. 30, the other to our current fiscal year.

Clarification on years for the president's respective budget requests for ICE detention beds:

FY 14: 31,800

FY 13: 32,800

ICE Director Morton provided the statistics to Chairman McCaul at his request. Per ICE, the numbers are "law enforcement sensitive", therefore I am not at liberty to release them publicly.

Subject: Update

I’m reading the March testimony of John Morton about the February releases. To this moment (not done reading), it looks like about less than 2,300 individuals were released from detention in February for budgetary reasons, according to Morton, and none were violent or dangerous criminals. Morton also testified there are no plans to release dangerous criminals.

Is there other information related to McCaul’s claim that bears consideration?

I am aware of Morton's testimony. However, the statistics Morton gave McCaul show the release of felons and aggravated felons. I am not at liberty to get into specifics.

(This is a fact, not a "claim".)

He said the administration “plans” to release hundreds of dangerous criminals. I would simply like backup on that. I don’t have any, yet.

"Plans" are attributable to an ICE document found here: http://judiciary.house.gov/news/2013/ICESequestrationPlan.pdf. This document was also linked to in a Judiciary Committee press release (3/5/13) found here: http://judiciary.house.gov/news/2013/03052013%20ICE.html.

ICE routinely releases detainees to ensure it does not exceed its budget. The releases ICE cited due to deeper sequestration cuts (detailed in linked document above) were larger than routine releases and included felons. There is no reason to believe the criminal makeup of any subsequently planned releases that ICE said were also tied to sequestration, would have differed from the releases that contained felons.

'Plan' referred to reducing the number of beds, not to the release of dangerous criminals. However, the drastic reductions proposed by the president would inherently result in the release of dangerous criminals into our communities, which is why it is important to maintain the 34,000 bed average.

Even without reducing beds, ICE routinely releases criminal aliens into our communities who are approved for deportation, but whose home country will not accept them and who cannot be detained indefinitely in accordance with Zadvydas vs. Davis (SCOTUS, 2001).
