The number of people lacking health insurance in Texas remains stubbornly high more than a year after the Affordable Care Act took effect and Texas continues to lead the nation in the rate of uninsured residents, according to a federal study released Tuesday.

The National Health Interview Survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the rate of uninsured Texans ages 18 to 64 fell 2.7 percentage points to 25.7 percent between 2013 and 2014. Nationally, the percentage of uninsured Americans dropped 4.1 percentage points to 16.3 percent over the same period.
