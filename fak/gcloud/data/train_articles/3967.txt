Charlie Crist: Minimum wages, minimum economy
This is good news. Higher salaries mean more Floridians can provide for their families, buy more essentials, and also try to get ahead.??

And we should do more.??

Many Floridians are still feeling the pain of the global economic collapse. These are fellow Floridians who prepare and serve food, provide retail service, and keep Florida beautiful. Not only do they deserve a fair paycheck, they deserve our respect??

As the national economy improves, low-wage jobs are growing in our state. Unfortunately, many Floridians filling these jobs were laid off from higher-paying, higher-skill jobs. Thousands of workers are now just trying to keep work while they return to their field, learn a new skill set, earn a diploma, or just find a better paying job all of the right things. And Rick Scott is making it harder for them to get ahead.??

While I was Governor during the global recession, you and I made some tough decisions together, like saving thousands of education and first responder jobs by accepting funds from the Recovery Act. We didn???t do it because it was popular. We did it because it was right for the people and it was right for the economy just like raising the minimum wage. No other criteria should matter.??

Unfortunately, Rick Scott just doesn???t seem to get it.??

Displaced workers and low-wage workers deserve to earn a living wage, and working Floridians also deserve affordable health care coverage ??? the same coverage that Rick Scott supported, and then retreated from during the 2013 legislative session. Again, working against the people.??

Raising the minimum wage in Florida is right for our people and our economy.??

Rick Scott is wrong.
