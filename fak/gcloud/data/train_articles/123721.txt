What Michelle Obama's Staffers Earn
The Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, on the shores of Lake Michigan, north of Chicago, brings together local politicians, floats -- I loved the klezmer band on the back of a flatbed truck -- and marchers from different government agencies. (My favorite, the "Yes, you can afford to live here" banner carried by fellows from the upscale suburb's community land trust office.)I ran into Herbie, who I've known since kindergarten, and we chatted about our upcoming Von Steuben High School reunion (I'm on the committee, of course). Then I caught up with my cousins' cousin, whom I spot lined up on the parade route.This "small world" kind of a morning continued when I fell into conversation with a woman who must have seen my column in the Chicago Sun-Times about a just-released list of White House salaries, and she started talking about how her friend Joey is doing.Joey, she said, is seriously underpaid.Joey is Joseph Reinstein, a former Highland Park resident who left his job as a marketing executive to join the Obama White House as a Deputy Social Secretary.

His boss is Desiree Rogers, the White House social secretary. Reinstein met Rogers when she was running the Illinois Lottery in 1992. Reinstein was in advertising then, and the lottery was one of the accounts for his agency; Rogers recruited Reinstein to be a deputy director in her office. His salary is $65,000 a year.My sister finds it distasteful that the salaries of White House staffers are made public; then everyone compares them, and just how productive can that be? But Congress ordered the annual disclosure, and since 1995 the White House has been required to report to Congress details of most of the West Wing payroll.The president makes $400,000, and there is a big gap between that and the highest paid staffer -- $172,200.The salaries for staffers in the Office of First Lady are also on the newest list. The highest paid is Chief of Staff Susan Sher, who gets the top $172,200. Here are the rest:$140,000Frye, Jocelyn C.
