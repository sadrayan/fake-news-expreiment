Research Abstract

Rubén G. Rumbaut joined the UCI Sociology Department in 2002. He is also formally affiliated with the UCI School of Education, and the Departments of Chicano/Latino Studies and Criminology, Law and Society. His research has focused on international migration and refugee movements, types of immigrants and their contexts of exit and reception, inter-generational and life course differences in adaptation, the "one and a half" generation, transitions from adolescence to adulthood, socioeconomic mobility and inequality, educational and occupational achievement, aspirations and expectations, bilingualism and language loss, ethnic identities and pan-ethnic categories, racialization and discrimination, nativism and reactive ethnicity, citizenship and national membership, transnational ties, exile, detention and deportation, mental health, depression and self-esteem, infant health and mortality, immigrant "epidemiological paradoxes," fertility, early childbearing, family formations and family ties, crime and incarceration, and paradoxes of acculturation—as well as immigration policies and politics, the structure of refuge, demographic shifts in the U.S. population, the evolution and career of the concept of "assimilation" in American sociology, and the social origins and research orientations of immigration scholars.



Since 1991 he has directed (with Alejandro Portes) the landmark Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), still ongoing, which has followed the trajectories into adulthood of thousands of youth representing dozens of different nationalities, primarily from Latin America and Asia. Throughout the 1980s he conducted several of the principal studies of the resettlement of refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia (including the IHARP and SARYS projects); in the 1990s he also directed the first National Survey of Immigration Scholars in the United States (NASIS); in the 2000s, the Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles (IIMMLA) study (in collaboration with a multidisciplinary UC team); and in the 2010s, "The Second Generation in Middle Adulthood" (in collaboration with Cynthia Feliciano), an in-depth follow-up of the CILS San Diego subsample nearly 25 years after the baseline surveys, with respondents who completed their adult transitions during and after the Great Recession.



Professor Rumbaut serves on the Steering Committee, World Commission on Forced Displacement; and on both the International Committee and the National Language Commission of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has testified before the U.S. Congress at hearings on comprehensive immigration reform, served as expert witness in federal court trials challenging local ordinances that targeted undocumented migrants, and lectured widely throughout North America, Europe and Asia on immigration issues, with recent keynote addresses and invited lectures in Madrid, Dublin, Vienna, and Havana, as well as Siem Reap, Cambodia; Seoul, South Korea; Almería, Spain; Salzburg, Austria; and Sibiu, Romania. He served as academic advisor for the PBS television series "Americas," focusing on Latin American and Caribbean societies, as well as on Mexicans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans in the United States. And he has continued to examine the Cuban diaspora, the history of U.S.-Cuba relations, and factors affecting the future of Cuba.



He is the author of more than two hundred scholarly papers on immigrants and refugees in the U.S., and coauthor or coeditor of eighteen books and special issues, including "Immigrant America: A Portrait" (new 4th edition 2014; Spanish edition, 2010), and "Legacies: The Story of the Immigrant Second Generation" (2001; Japanese edition, 2014; Spanish edition, 2011), which won the Distinguished Book Award of the American Sociological Association and the Thomas and Znaniecki Award for best book in the immigration field. As a member of a panel of the National Academy of Sciences (with Marta Tienda et al.) he worked on two volumes on the Hispanic population of the United States, published by the National Academies Press: "Multiple Origins, Uncertain Destinies," and "Hispanics and the Future of America." He was also General Editor (with Steven J. Gold) of a research-oriented book series, "The New Americans: Recent Immigration and American Society" (LFB Scholarly); under their editorship more than 110 books were published between 2002 and 2014 on a wide range of immigration topics.
