Museitif was referring to CommUnityCare’s patient population – meaning patients in our community that Central Health serves.

The data comes from CommUnityCare’s Next Gen database, which is from self-reported data from patients.

I hope this clarifies her comment.

Best,

Ted

Here’s the chart:

Here is a clarification regarding Maram Museitif’s quote. Please note we are updating the press release as well (which is on our website).

“I’m very familiar with Central Health’s mission and the needs of the people we serve,” said Museitif. “I bring a broader representation to the board. Austin has a growing Muslim, Arab, and refugee community and they need a voice at the table. I can be that voice. I’m a Muslim and speak fluent Arabic, which is the third most common language in the CommUnityCare patient population. The passion and diversity I bring is important for now and for future generations. It is vital we close the gap of health inequities for all our underserved populations. I understand the health disparities our community faces and can make a significant difference in improving their health outcomes.”

I have also asked our data analyst about these two questions:

What are the raw numbers behind the percentages?

What question was asked that generated the results? How did this breakdown compare to 2014 and earlier years?

The FY15 chart provided first (individually) was for Oct. – Sept. (Fiscal Year). The attachment I sent second with 3 charts shows CY14, CY15, and CY16. These are based on calendar years (Jan. – Dec.). As a result, the percentages between the first chart (FY15) and the second chart are different (one is FY numbers, the other is Calendar Year numbers). As mentioned previously, these numbers are based off of the Uniform Data Set (UDS) that Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) report to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) every year. What is the same for all the charts/data is that Arabic is the third most comment language for CommUnityCare (CUC) patients (self-reported).

There are currently 21 CommUnityCare clinics (on Friday over the phone I told you approximately 24 and said I would confirm the number, which you agreed to).

Number of CUC Patients:

CY 16: 92,441

CY 15: 88,261

CY 14: 78,299

Best,

Board Member Museitif and I can call you after 2 p.m. today. She informs me that’s when her meetings conclude. What’s the best number to reach you?

As for your second inquiry – we don’t have data analysis on why Arabic has proved to be the third most common language. One of the main reasons we collect language data (other than for reporting purposes required of FQHCs) is so that we can be responsive to the needs of our patients. CommUnityCare cares for everyone who walks through the clinic doors regardless of what language they speak, where they’re from and whether or not they have insurance.

Matt Balthazar, CommUnityCare’s Director of Strategic Planning and Development (copied on this email) is asking an Arabic-speaking provider if they’re willing to speak with you and talk about their experience serving this community. Let me know if this would be helpful to you.

Best,

Ted

In my previous email, I mentioned Matt Balthazar was trying to secure an Arabic-speaking provider willing to speak with you and he’s done that.

Her name is Amneh Amro and she’s a physician assistant. In the past, she has had one of the larger Arabic speaking panels within CommUnityCare and can help provide a provider’s perspective as to why – in her opinion - Arabic is third most identified language of patients seeking care at CommUnityCare health centers.

CommUnityCare does not have statistics about countries of origin.

Thanks,
