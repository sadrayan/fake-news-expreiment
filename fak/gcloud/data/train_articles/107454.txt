Warning may be a hoax
A post about criminals using stickers to mark houses where dogs can be stolen from, has been trending on social media.

It is believed the stolen dogs will be used for dog fights.

According to the post, the stickers mark how many dogs live there and what the size of the dogs are. The photo has 551 shares and 53 likes on Facebook already.

According to the senior inspector of the Alberton SPCA, Kingston Siziba, they do not have any information about the matter. “We have sent this message to NSPCA for further scrutiny,” he said.

The Alberton SPCA also said it could possibly be a hoax. “We can act on information about dog fighting but proving it is never easy and these people are resourceful sadly enough. We can only advise people to keep their pets indoors at night and also away from front gardens, but that isn’t a foolproof solution,” said Vanja Ignold from Alberton SPCA.

An update on this matter will follow.
