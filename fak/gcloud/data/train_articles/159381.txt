FACT CHECK: Texas Church Shooter Was an Atheist on the DNC Payroll?
The 5 November 2017 mass shooting at Sutherland Springs First Baptist Church in Texas led to the spread of a number of rumors and hoaxes, among the latter a claim that the perpetrator was an atheist and was on the payroll of the Democratic National Committee (DNC):

FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee. LLOD correspondent Art Tubolls is on the scene:

“People are saying he wasn’t looking for anything other than to ‘demonstrate that it it science, not some made-up God that decides if you live or die.’ He was apparently trying to maske [sic] the point that bullets are more powerful than prayer.”

Littleberry was known in the small Texas town just outside of Arlington as a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea. He was often the only protester to show up to support BLM after some criminal is gunned down by police. Last year he held a gay pride parade through town to support his homosexual brothers and sisters and he was the only one there.

Littleberry’s frustration grew and he built an arsenal. A law-abiding citizen, nothing kept him from stockpiling.
