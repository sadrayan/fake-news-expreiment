House Appropriations Committee Documents & Reports
Documents & Reports

House Member Budget Amendment Requests, Committee Approved Amendments and the Conference Report Amendments to House Bill 1500 can be tracked on the 2017 State Budget website when they are available.

Each amendment is drawn to a specific budget item as numbered in the budget bill. Amendments are presented in numerical order, by agency, and by secretarial area. You can create a report of selected budget amendments. Also, you can select an agency to generate a report (i.e. Department for the Aging; Department of Taxation; Virginia Retirement System, etc.).

Unless otherwise noted, documents are available on this website in Adobe Acrobat "portable document format" (PDF) which requires Adobe Acrobat Reader to view and print.
