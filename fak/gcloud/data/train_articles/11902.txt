Weeks after coming under fire for his refusal to wear an American flag pin, Democratic presidential contender Sen. Barack Obama is again facing questions about his patriotism from some conservative blogs -- this time for apparently failing to put his hand over his heart during a rendition of the national anthem at an Iowa campaign event.

A video of the event in question, obtained by ABC News, shows Obama with his hands firmly clasped in front of him during the song. Meanwhile, rival Democratic candidates Gov. Bill Richardson (D-AZ) and Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) strike a traditional anthem pose beside him, holding their right hands over their hearts.

The conservative NewsBusters media watchdog group first reported on the story, linking to a Time Magazine photo of Obama at the event. "Does [Obama] perhaps believe that, like wearing the flag pin, the hand on the heart isn't "true patriotism?" asked the site's Mark Finkelstein.

The episode took place during a Sept. 16 steak fry hosted by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA) in Indianola, Iowa.

The following video is from ABC.com, broadcast on October 22, 2007.
