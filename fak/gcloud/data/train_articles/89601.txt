After a plunge which saw his job approval rating drop from 46 - 48 percent in August to a negative 38 - 57 percent December 10, his all-time lowest score, President Barack Obama has stopped the drop, but not started the rebound, with a negative 41 - 53 percent job approval in a Quinnipiac University national poll released today.





Women go negative 44 - 49 percent, unchanged from last month. Men are negative 36 - 58 percent, compared to 31 - 64 percent last month, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN- uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. Negative approval is 9 - 86 percent among Republicans and 35 - 58 percent among independent voters. Democrats approve 81 - 15 percent.





The 2014 congressional races are tied as 38 percent of American voters say they would back a Republican candidate, while 37 percent would back a Democrat.





Voters want Republicans to take the U.S. Senate 46 - 42 percent, with independent voters going for the GOP 45 - 40 percent. Looking at the House of Representatives, 46 percent want Republicans to keep control and 44 percent want Democratic control.





"The President returns to chilly Washington DC from his Hawaii holidays to a slightly warmer reception from American voters," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.





"It's too early to call it a comeback, but the 2014 midterm election year begins a bit better than 2013 ended for President Obama. His approval is right above the 40 percent mark - a red line for any president. He still has terrible scores for his handling of healthcare and other issues that mean most to Americans, but the bleeding seems to have stopped."





American voters say 49 - 46 percent that President Obama is not honest and trustworthy and say 51 - 46 percent that he is not a strong leader. They are divided 50 - 48 percent on whether he cares about their needs and problems.





Obama gets a negative 35 - 61 percent approval rating for handling health care. His ratings for handling other issues are:

Negative 39 - 58 percent on the economy;

Negative 34 - 60 percent on the federal budget;

Positive 52 - 41 percent for handling terrorism;

Negative 41 - 51 percent for handling foreign policy.

Minimum Wage and Jobless Benefits





American voters support 71 - 27 percent raising the minimum wage. Republican support is 52 - 45 percent. Given several options:

33 percent of voters say increase the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour;

18 percent say increase it from the current $7.25 per hour to something less than $10.10;

18 percent say increase it to more than $10.10 per hour;

27 percent say don't increase the minimum wage.

Raising the minimum wage will lead businesses to cut jobs, voters say 50 - 45 percent, with Republicans seeing job cuts 68 - 29 percent and Democrats saying no 65 - 29 percent. Independent voters expect job cuts 51 - 45 percent.





Voters also support 58 - 37 percent extending unemployment benefits for three months. Support is 83 - 13 percent among Democrats and 54 - 41 percent among independent voters, with Republicans opposed 54 - 42 percent.





If a candidate for Congress supports extending jobless benefits, 33 percent are more likely to vote for that candidate, with 24 percent less likely and 40 percent who say it won't affect their vote. A candidate who supports raising the minimum wage wins 41 percent "more likely" support, with 18 percent "less likely" and 39 percent saying "no difference.





From January 4 - 7, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,487 registered voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and the nation as a public service and for research.
