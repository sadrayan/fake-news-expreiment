Darryl Glenn leaves the door open to a GOP nominee other than Donald Trump
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Darryl Glenn made clear for months that he supported Donald Trump for president. He even called Trump “a patriot.”

But with Ted Cruz in Denver last week, Glenn added an “if” caveat that didn’t go unnoticed in the state that is driving the #DumpTrump effort ahead of the convention.

“Right now, we have a presumptive nominee,” Glenn started. “And if he remains our presumptive nominee, we have a responsibility, a responsibility, to get in line and support that candidate.”

(He also landed Cruz a standing ovation for this line: “If he cannot be our next president of the United States of America, I am personally going to lead the charge to make sure he’s our next Supreme Court justice.” Cruz demurred politely.)

Moments later, in a backroom at the Westin Denver International Airport, Glenn approached Cruz and told him this: “I’m telling you. If you can be there, you find a way to get there. But I’m very serious about the Supreme Court, if that doesn’t happen.”

The “there” and “that” sounds like he could mean the Republican nomination at the convention, as I stood there and heard it. And a few other political-minded folks who reviewed the comment agreed.

But Glenn’s campaign says no.

“He could have been referring to a Cabinet position, not necessarily the GOP nomination,” said Jillian Likness, Glenn’s spokeswoman. “I wouldn’t read too much into this. … Darryl has always said that he would support the Republican nominee.”

Glenn declined to clarify his statements. (A strict reading of the campaign statement above leaves the door open to someone other than Trump.) Likness said Glenn is unavailable for interviews until election night.

The candidate, whose low-budget campaign is defying expectations, recently moved his primary night party from a BBQ restaurant in Colorado Springs to the Rocky Mountain Ballroom at the Broadmoor resort.
