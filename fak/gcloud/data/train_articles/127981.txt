No insult to Washington intended, group says
No offense was intended.

The S.C. NAACP said Tuesday it was not trying to hide a State House statue of George Washington at its annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally Monday.

The group has draped the founding fathers statue at previous rallies. It did so again this year, and questions quickly arose about whether Washington was being slighted.

Not so, says the NAACP.

A three-sided structure that covered the front and sides of the statue was intended to display a rally graphic and serve as a photo-and-television backdrop for the events speakers, said S.C. NAACP executive director Dwight James. However, the graphic was not finished before the rally and could not be put in place.

Photos from the event showed a three-sided box with Washingtons statue visible only from behind the stage. What we had constructed was a background with a graphic to be placed on it, James said. We werent trying to obstruct anything.

King Day organizers have built similar structures around the statue dating back at least to 2007, according to The State newspapers archives.

Most State House rallies, including Saturdays anti-abortion rally, use the statue as an unobstructed backdrop.
