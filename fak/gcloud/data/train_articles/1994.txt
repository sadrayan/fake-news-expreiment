Texas Gov. Rick Perry launches ads to recruit New York businesses; Fact Check: Perry wrong on Big Gulp in NYC
Texas Gov. Rick Perry today launched a radio advertising campaign in New York to lure businesses here by pitching the state’s strong job creation, no income tax and other benefits.

“If you’re tired of the same old recipe of over-taxation, over-regulation and frivolous litigation, get out before you go broke,” Perry tells New York business owners in the ad. He goes on to say Texas is “a place where opportunity, freedom and innovation are flourishing.”

The 60-second radio ads will run on nine stations in New York and Albany, N.Y. In addition, TV ads will air this week on cable stations, such as CNBC, Fox News and ESPN, in Connecticut and New York. The ads are in advance of a corporate recruiting trip Perry will start on Sunday to those two states.

Those visits similar economic development trips Perry took earlier this year in California and Chicago. So far, Perry has targeted only states led by Democratic governors.

TexasOne, a privately-funded marketing group, is paying for the week-long, $50,000 radio ad, the TV ad and Perry’s trip.

My colleague, Christy Hoppe, wrote about Perry’s upcoming trip earlier this week. I wrote a story earlier this month about how the high-stakes economic development battle is back with Texas’ approaching sparking a national debate as to whether Perry is job poaching or simply recruiting companies. I also wrote another story about cities getting in on the action.

Perry has one slight inaccuracy in his radio ad. He claims New York has “bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp,” referring to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s effort last year to ban oversized sodas. The ban was eventually struck down by a judge, but convenience stores like 7-Eleven, which sells the Big Gulp drink, always were exempt from the ban.
