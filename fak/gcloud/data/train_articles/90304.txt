The prospects of Democrats picking up another Senate seat are dimming as a new poll of the Louisiana Senate run-off shows Republican state Treasurer John Kennedy holding a comfortable lead over Democratic Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell.

According to The Advocate, a poll conducted by Trafalgar Group found 48 percent of respondents were firmly behind Kennedy and a further 10 percent were leaning his way.

Only 27 percent of respondents said they firmly support Campbell with an additional 8 percent are leaning his way.

Kennedy and Campbell were the top two vote-getters in the open primary on Election Day and will meet in a run-off on Dec. 10.

The Trafalgar Group, a GOP polling outfit, said in a news release that the Senate race differed from the state's gubernatorial race last year, when Democrat John Bel Edwards beat Republican Sen. David Vitter.

“The Democrat victory for governor in 2015 was a rejection of one candidate and his personal scandals with most down ballot races all going GOP,” senior strategist Robert Cahaly said.

In that race, Vitter was dogged by an old scandal from 2007 relating to his involvement in a Washington, D.C., prostitution ring.

The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report/Roll Call rates the race Safe Republican.

The Trafalgar Group poll surveyed 2,200 likely voters from Nov. 14-17 and had a margin of error of 2.11 percentage points.
