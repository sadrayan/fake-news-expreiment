What happens if Roe v. Wade is overturned
Without Roe v. Wade, access to abortion would be governed by a patchwork of state laws. Some states have laws that explicitly protect access, while others have an outright ban. About half of the states don't have explicit policy determining access to abortion.

Why it matters: The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh throws the future of Roe v. Wade into uncertainty. During the 2016 campaign, President Trump promised to appoint judges who were pro-life and would overturn the 1973 decision.
