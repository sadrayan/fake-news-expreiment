BREAKING: Barron Trump Awarded Chess Grandmaster Title
Everyone knows Barron Trump is the smartest President’s kid ever. Or should we call him First Son?

Either way, Barron has been awarded the prestigious title of Chess Grandmaster this week from the International Board of Chessmasters.

His ELO, a score calculated to determine a chess player’s ability in a match, was the determining factor in lifting Barron to the rank of Chess Grandmaster.

Barron Trump is only 11 years old but he has already attained one of the highest titles in all of sports.

This should be no surprise considering who is father is. Donald Trump is one of the highest ranked and most celebrated American chess players of all time.

In the 1970s and 80s, Donald Trump studied under the tutelage of players like Bobby Fischer. Eventually, he won hundreds of chess tournaments abroad before retiring at the ripe old age of 40.

Donald Trump has been training Barron ever since he was a kid.

And now all of that hard work has paid off.
