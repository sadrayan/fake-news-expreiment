ePrescribe Florida
Electronic prescribing can improve prescription accuracy, increase patient safety and reduce costs, as well as enable secure, bi-directional, electronic connectivity between physician practices and pharmacies. Just one of the benefits of electronic prescribing is the ability to automate the renewal authorization process, which is extremely time-consuming and labor intensive for both pharmacies and prescribers in today’s paper world!

ePrescribe Florida No Longer Meeting

Date: March 26, 20010

Dear ePrescribe Florida Members: The national focus on meaningful use, adoption of electronic health records and health information exchange (HIE) is poised to forever change the landscape and bring new opportunities to improve the quality and affordability of health care.



New collaborative efforts are shaping up in Florida with a broad array of participating organizations. We are hopeful that by coordinating these efforts, Florida will be well positioned to receive federal stimulus funding either as Regional Extension Centers (REC), Beacon grants and the Florida Health Information Exchange. Working together with a broader community of stakeholders, there is a great opportunity to achieve even greater success of health information technology and e-prescribing adoption in Florida. In careful consideration of precious resources and the emerging opportunities, ePrescribe Florida is discontinuing formal meeting as a collaborative.



The ePrescribe Florida Website will continue to be maintained as a resource for prescribers. Information regarding the various new stakeholder collaboratives and contact information will also be posted. Please send event and other information to

webmaster@ePrescribeFlorida.com to be posted.



To each of you individually, and the organizations you work for, a warm thank you for all your support and efforts over the past three years. We can all be proud of our accomplishments in moving e-prescribing in Florida from 1.6% in 2007 to over 16% in 2009  WOW! Through your volunteer efforts, support, and leadership we have made a difference for those we are all here to ultimately serve; Florida patients. It has been our great honor to serve with our esteemed Steering Committee members: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida; Florida Academy of Family Physicians; Florida Medical Association; Humana; Pharmacy Provider Services Corporation; AvMed; Walgreens; SureScripts and the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). On behalf of the Steering Committee, we again thank each and every one of you, and look forward to working with you in the next generation of HIT to improve healthcare in Florida.



Best Regards,

Walt Culbertson, Executive Director, ePrescribe Florida
