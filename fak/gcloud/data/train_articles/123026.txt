The Rev. Al Sharpton, the national civil rights leader, spoke Sunday at New Hope Baptist Church in Elizabeth, N.J., at a service attended by over a dozen mothers whose children had been killed by the police. The mothers were led by Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after police officers put him in a chokehold.

Mr. Sharpton denounced the attack on the Baton Rouge officers. “At a time when the country needs healing, this deplorable and merciless act of violence against officers of the law is wicked and we must fight the principalities of darkness and evil spirits that are turning to violence,” he said.

“We need more people that will stand up when cops are shot and we need more cops to stand up against bad cops when innocent lives are taken,” Mr. Sharpton added. “We have got to break this cycle of violence.”
