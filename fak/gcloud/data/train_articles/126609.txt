FACT CHECK: Spam Oreos? Another Fake Flavor Goes Viral
Is Nabisco planning on releasing Spam flavored Oreos?

In May 2015, a photograph purportedly showing Nabisco’s latest Oreo cookie creation, Spam flavored Oreos, began circulating online. While many viewers were skeptical of the new flavor, some thought it plausible given that Nabisco has released several interesting varieties (such as Red Velvet Cake and S’mores) of Oreos in recent years.

However, Nabisco generally eschews suggestions for Oreo flavors based on meat products: images of bacon cream, fried chicken, or cheeseburger Oreos have all been hoaxes. And so it is with Spam Oreos.

Nabisco has not made any announcements about an upcoming Spam flavor of Oreos, and the above-displayed image is a fake created by Boss Hawaii web design studio in order to drive traffic to the Hawaii Food Porn Facebook page:
