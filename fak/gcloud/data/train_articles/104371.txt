QUILT BAG activists win as Healthline renames vagina as ‘front hole’ appease transgender men
To better identify with the transgender community, Healthline is offering their “ LGBTQIA Safe Sex Guide ” which stipulates the word “vagina” is no longer appropriate for that part of the female genitalia.

Instead, the proper term for the orifice is will now be “front hole.”

The guide writes: “For the purposes of this guide, we’ll refer to the vagina as the ‘front hole’ instead of solely using the medical term ‘vagina.’ This is gender-inclusive language that’s considerate of the fact that some trans people don’t identify with the labels the medical community attaches to their genitals.”

In January Bustle quoted “sex educator” Kenna Cook: “Language for sex that is coded in anatomy is meant to reinforce a heteronormative, reproductive-based idea of sex … The terms people use for their sexual body parts are a large contributor to them feeling comfortable engaging in certain sex acts. Some trans men don’t refer to their genitals with female-coded language, opting for ‘boy hole’ or ‘front hole.’”

Life site News countered: “ Women who claim they are men, but are still anatomically female, feel that accurately labeling their genitals is problematic because they ‘don’t identify’ with the medically correct terms. In other words, they accurately fear that if someone knows they have a ‘vagina,’ those people will assume (quite safely) that they are female, when they have decided that they are not.”

QUILT BAG, the term to cover all of the various groups, will tout the victory after trans activist criticized the over-emphasis on genitalia as part of the women’s march and other events.
