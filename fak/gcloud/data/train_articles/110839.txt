Favorite backer
Judi Dench thinks she should have a tattoo of Harvey Weinstein on her backside. The Oscar-winner for “Shakespeare in Love” said the former Miramax mogul gave her a break when others said she “didn’t have a face for film.” “[He] said, ‘Mrs. Brown’ should be a film,” Dench said of the 1997 project that launched her Hollywood career after Weinstein took it from the BBC to US cinemas. “It was thanks to Harvey, whose name I have had tattooed on my bum ever since,” Dench joked while accepting a British Film Institute award in London in front of Kenneth Branagh, Stephen Frears and John Hurt.
