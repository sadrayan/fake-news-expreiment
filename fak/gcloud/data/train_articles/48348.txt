Behind the Candidates: Campaign Committees and Outside Groups

The modern presidential campaign isn't a single organization. Once a candidate declares he or she is running, there's always an official campaign committee. In addition, leadership PACs let presidential hopefuls make donations to potential political allies. The big money is in super PACs and other outside groups devoted to boosting a single candidate, which can solicit unlimited donations and later use the funds to pummel rivals – and, as seems to be happening this cycle, take on some of the duties traditionally handled by a campaign. In addition, super PACs have been formed for the sole purpose of bashing a single candidate. Outside groups aren't allowed to coordinate with campaigns, but they're often run by friends and former staffers – even family members – of the candidate they're helping. Here, we've collected all the known groups dedicated to promoting or attacking current 2016 presidential candidates – 49 and counting. (See an explanation of committee and group types.)
