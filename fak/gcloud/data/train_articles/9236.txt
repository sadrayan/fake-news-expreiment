MIAMI BEACH (CBSMiami) – Police are being tight-lipped about a shooting on Miami Beach that left two shot and one other hurt.

So far two of the four people detained have been arrested. All three victims were hospitalized.

“I hear one shot, boom! And I say, uh uh, this is not fireworks,” a witness recalled. “The young girl, she got shot in the leg.”

It happened around 4:30 a.m. Friday in the 1400 block of Washington Avenue.

Miami Beach Police said the chaos started during an argument near Espanola Way and Washington Avenue. That led to a physical fight, which escalated into gunfire.

“When officers arrived they located two gunshot wound victims, a male and a female, both Hispanic, who suffered gunshot wounds to the legs,” said Ofc. Ernesto Rodriguez.

Police accuse 35-year-old Aleksandar Ilic of Texas of shooting two people.

Another man was hurt in the fight that led up to the shooting. He was also taken to the hospital. All three victims are from south Florida and are expected to be fine.

Just what happened before is now what police are trying to determine.

“We know there was some sort of verbal discussion prior,” said Ofc. Rodriguez. “Right now, we’re looking to piece all of that together and ensure we have everyone responsible in our custody.”

A man involved in the fight took off after the shooting. Police set up a perimeter and tracked him down.

Authorities later identified him as 26-year-old Marko Jovicic of Hollywood.

“We located, moments later, a vehicle that fled the scene near 8th Street and Meridian Avenue. It was a Jeep. We apprehended one individual who we believe is involved,” Ofc. Rodriguez added.

They are still looking for another man involved in the shooting. If you saw or heard anything, call Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.
