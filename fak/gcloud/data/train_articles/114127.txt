Burger King Offers an Adults-Only Valentine’s Day Meal, With a Different Kind of Toy Inside
Fast-food chains have done a lot of goofy things for Valentine’s Day over the years, including, most famously, the candlelight dinners at White Castle. But Burger King Israel is taking things to an awkward new level—with a very happy Valentine’s Day meal for adults only.

The meal comes with:

2 Whoppers

2 packs of french fries

2 beers

A romantic ADULT TOY inside

(emphasis BK’s)

“Kids have got their ‘Kid’s Meal.’ But what about grownups? Adults? Shouldn’t they have their own meal too? At least on Valentine’s?” the chain asks.

Yes, BK is now putting sex toys in its combo meals. The offer is available Tuesday only, after 6 p.m. Leo Burnett Israel is the agency.

BK has been experimenting with other kinds of grownup meals lately, with ad agency David helping to introduce the King Senior in Brazil. That meal that came with two Whopper combos—one for a senior citizen, and a free one for the person accompanying them. “Since every meal box comes with a gift, this one is no different. A gift that is more valuable: company,” BK said of the King Senior.
