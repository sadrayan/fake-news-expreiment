Maxine Waters Leads Anti-Trump Crowd in 'Impeach 45' Chant
Rep. Maxine Waters renewed her call for the impeachment of President Donald Trump at a Tax Day rally in D.C. this past weekend.

“I don’t respect this president. I don’t trust this president. He’s not working in the best interests of the American people… I will fight every day until he is impeached,” Waters vowed.

The California Democrat continued by leading the anti-Trump protesters in an “impeach 45” chant. She pleaded with “my Millennials” in the crowd to “stay woke.”

Rep. Waters previously raised the President’s potential impeachment during a April 2, 2017 appearance on CNN, saying, “We want to know about the hacking…and the interference with our elections. And I really want to know, because I know that if we can prove collusion, then he is impeachable.”

She also predicted that Congress would take that course of action in a March tweet:

Get ready for impeachment. — Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) March 21, 2017

During a previous appearance on CNN in February, anchor Brooke Baldwin sparred with Waters over her push against the President. “You do have to find evidence before using such a huge word, such a tremendous word, as the I word, the I in impeachment,” Baldwin warned.

The left-wing politician even broached the impeachment subject days before Mr. Trump took the oath of office in January 2017.
