LeeAnne Walters, Flint questioner: Hillary Clinton’s answer ‘made me vomit’
The Flint whistleblower who asked both Democratic presidential candidates about the Michigan city’s water crisis during Sunday night’s CNN debate said she “hated” Hillary Clinton’s answer so much that it made her vomit.

“I hated Hillary Clinton’s answer,” LeeAnne Walters, a former Flint resident who now lives in Virginia, told The Huffington Post Monday. “It actually made me vomit in my mouth.”

Ms. Walters, an early whistleblower in the Flint water crisis, had asked whether Mrs. Clinton or Sen. Bernard Sanders would promise to remove lead pipes from public water systems.

“We will commit to a priority to change the water systems and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere,” Mrs. Clinton answered.

But Ms. Walters said five years is unacceptable.

“To tell a Flint resident that ‘we’ll handle this in five years’ is no different than what the city was telling us and what the state was telling us,” she told The Huffington Post.

She also took issue with Mrs. Clinton focusing her answer on lead from paint and dust, instead of water.

“If you look at the numbers, most of the grants and funding go to lead paint, so to lump it all together is unacceptable,” Ms. Walters said.

Ms. Walters, 38, is set to receive the Freedom of Expression Courage Award on May 16 in New York for working to expose dangerous levels of lead in the water in Flint, PEN America announced last week. Last year, the honor went to French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
