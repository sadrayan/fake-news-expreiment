Cell Phones Are Useless
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhonesAreUseless

Mathew Buck, Bad Movie Beatdown on "While She was Out" "The widespread adoption of mobile phones must be one of the worst things to ever happen to horror movies, since now every movie now has to include a bullshit explanation for why they can't use their phone, like losing their battery or their signal. It's become a laughable cliché."

With the advent of the computer age, writers still don't quite know how to work Cell Phones into a story. It used to be all you had to do for a survival adventure story was plop a bunch of people away from electricity to completely strand them at the mercy of wild animals/serial killers/zombies—but cell phones are making that harder and harder for writers to do believably . Even in comedy situations, there are some plotlines (such as Locked in a Room) that only work if the characters don't have cellphones. This means that cellphones are lost, broken, stolen, and run out of power far more than they should . The range of cellphones is also ridiculously reduced from what they are in real life even if elsewhere in the story reception is better than normal—maybe writers are confusing them with two-way radios, or don't realise that most modern phones allow long-distance and international calls. Or they're deliberately using Artistic License to artificially preserve the drama.

Note that, during widespread disasters such as the London bombings or 9/11, cell networks often fail, for several reasons: Overload due to everyone trying to reach each other, cell towers being damaged, and civilian phones being locked out to let emergency personnel have all the capacity. However, in many situations where this trope takes place, the problem is far more localized; being lost in the werewolf-infested woods isn't a national emergency.

A simpler solution is to mention that cell phones are not an available option: the guy has just lost it, forgot it at home, or even refuses to have one to begin with (such as those Hopeless with Tech). Note that, for those cases to be a valid example, the reason is merely mentioned as a Hand Wave and no further developments come from them, such as trying to locate the cell phone.

Often watching older sitcoms, from the early days of cellphone use ('80s'90s), the time of the cellphone's primitive ancestor, the car phone ('60s'70s) and the days when mobile phones were not available ('50s and before—early mobile phones existed as far back as The '40s, but were not available for civilian use) you may suffer many a facepalm as you count how many situations could have been prevented with just having a cellphone (Larry David and others have commented on how prevalent this is in Seinfeld—the plots of almost half of the episodes in the series simply wouldn't work if the characters had cell phones). You can even make a Drinking Game out of it.

The period the work is set in or created in, the lifestyle of the characters involved, as well as the setting have a major influence over when this trope applies. A rich character living in a major metropolitan area could reasonably expect to have a cell phone on their person (and coverage in the metropolitan area) by the early '90s or so. By 2000, 50% of Americans owned cell phones; and by 2015, 93% of Americans owned smartphones. Coverage steadily increased from major metropolitan areas only in the '80s to near complete coverage except in some extreme rural areas/wilderness by 2015.

A sub-trope of Plot-Sensitive Items, and see also The Radio Dies First for this trope applied to military or naval communications. Futuristic communications not working have a Phlebotinum Breakdown. See Sudden Lack of Signal for when it happens due to being transported to another world. See Super Cell Reception for when the cell phone does not fail when it rightly should. See Useless Without Cellphones for the opposite problem. Also compare No Phones Tonight when a plot excuse allows the characters to have cellphones that would have worked, if they hadn't been turned off.

One justification for not using a cellphone was shown in an old campaign from the early 2000s by T-Mobile for their unlimited plan. This was before all companies even had unlimited plans, and had a set amount of "minutes" that you could talk on the phone for free. After that, you'd have to pay-per-minute. In these commercials, with Jamie Lee Curtis as the spokesperson, some sort of emergency would be presented and a group of people would argue over whether or not to risk wasting their minutes. This would make it a Justified Trope if the party in question isn't using their cellphone because they're out of minutes. Many people are still using pay-per-minute plans, as they generally don't have contracts with high early termination fees and they can work out to be cheaper than unlimited plans if you don't make many phone calls. But even on a phone with no SIM card or any minutes, as long as it has power and a signal, you can dial 911 in North America or 112 in Europe (in some cases, both of those numbers work, with one redirecting to the other), and even a locked phone is capable of making an "Emergency Call" to these numbers. In fact, United States and Canadian Federal Law requires ALL cell phones to be able to dial 911, even if there is no sim card installed, the phone was never assigned to a carrier, and even if the phone is registered as stolen.

The author of the Glee Slash Fic Clouds Between Their Knees , in which Kurt and Dave Karofsky are lost in the woods after a plane crash, actually asks the reader to ignore the fact that Kurt would probably be able to use his phone to at least find out where they are.

, in which Kurt and Dave Karofsky are lost in the woods after a plane crash, actually asks the reader to ignore the fact that Kurt would probably be able to use his phone to at least find out where they are. In The Cries of Haruhi Suzumiya, there's no contact between Hinamizawa and anything outside it. Whatsoever. Justified, because Hinamizawa is actually in 1983, and cell phones don't exist yet. The first phone call from a truly portable handset (still the size of a brick, though) to the general phone network was made on April 3, 1973, by Motorola's Martin Cooper, and by 1979 the world's first mobile network appeared in Japan, though initially only around Tokyo. So it's possible that by 1983 it reached Hinamizawa (the nationwide coverage was achieved in 1984), but it's still unlikely that modern phones (most of which are 2G systems like GSM) would work on this 1G system.

The Total Drama story, Legacy mentions that cell phone coverage in the vicinity of the camp is "spotty". This is presumably why the show's staff used two-way radios.

In The Fifth Act, Cloud tries to call Tifa for the the call not to connect. It turns out its because the number doesn't exist yet due to him being in the past.

Funky Winkerbean: In 2010, the series' title character was seriously injured in a car accident, caused by a young woman whose car veers into the path of Funky's car while she was talking on a cellular telephone while driving. He then appears to readers in the following day's strip as though he simply drove off the road and was uninjured. He attempts to call for help on his cell phone but is unable to get it to work. He then realizes he is in Westview as it appeared in 1980, and had seen (and in some cases, visited with) teen-aged versions of himself, Crazy Harry and Holly Budd (Funky's wife-to-be), and a younger Mr. Dinkle - all as they appeared in Funky Winkerbean strips in the early 1980s. It is only several days later that readers realize the seriousness of Funky's injuries that had rendered him unconscious, and that he was dreaming. As late as 2011, Les Moore (Funky's best friend and one of the main characters) did not own a cell phone, causing situations such as him not realizing that his daughter was injured during a game.

Averted in Old World of Darkness. Elder vampires are extremely powerful, even compared to younger vampires. But the younger one have the power of technology with them, specially when it comes to communications. Vampires born before the invention of the telephone find really hard to trust and adapt to new gadgets, and this might put them at a disadvantage despite their greater physical/mental powers.

GURPS Horror has an entire text box devoted to addressing "The Cell Phone Problem".

Justified in the Sluggy Freelance story "That Which Redeems", thanks to the demons having a very poor understanding of cell phone technology. Tryka: What's it roaming for? Shouldn't it stay here?

Reakk: Bad phone! Justified again in the "bROKEN" story, when the Fate Spider's Apprentice intentionally makes Torg forget to charge his cell phone, forcing him to leave it off when communication would have been vitally important.

El Goonish Shive: Nanase is unable to call for help during a wizard attack on her school in this strip. It this case, the attacking wizard was explicitly blocking all phone communication through magical means. In the "Family Tree" arc, Ellen and Nanase once again find themselves unable to call for help. This is immediately Lampshaded by Ellen. Once again, it is suggested that the villain of the arc knocked out cell phone reception and internet connectivity as part of his attack, although it's unknown if magical or technological methods were used. Even then, cell phones don't end up being completely useless, as the characters did their best to get outside of the range of the jamming so that they could call for help.

In Silent Hill: Promise, Vanessa's cell phone hasn't worked correctly yet.

In Narbonic, Dave calls his boss to tell her he's in trouble. Unfortunately, he's just been shoved out the airlock of a spaceship. Helen: Hello? ... Hello? ... Hello?

Discussed by The Distressed Watcher. Horror movies were better before they always had to figure out a reason to explain why the main character cant just use their cell phone to call for outside help. Now every movie has to come up with some clever excuse: "Oh, the vampires stole all the phones in the night!" Or, this is a dead zone, or the government blocked all the cell signals to cover this whole event up. Or, were all Amish!

Played straight and justified in Worm during the events of Chapter 16, Monarch. Dragon shuts down all cell phone communication in the city. It provides a tactical advantage and she uses the cell towers to help control her armors.

In Cracked's 5 World-Changing Trends That Will Transform Pop Culture , Robert Evans mentions how cell phones have become a Trope Breaker for 1990s sitcom plots.
