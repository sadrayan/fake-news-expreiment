The "Million Muslim March" turned out to be more like a few hundred people walking down the street.

The event was set to be held in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, the 12th anniversary of the Septembe 11 terrorist attacks.

A memo for the rally, which was later renamed the "Million Americans Against Fear," was said to reach hundreds, not thousands of participants.

The few that did show up began marching around noon, organized by the American Muslim Political Action Committee.

Then, they were overwhelmed by the counter-demonstration by bikers that wanted to honor armed forces and 9/11 dead, which they dubbed "Two Million Bikers to D.C." The bikers were denied permits from the National Park Service, but carried on, even without having streets blocked off for them.

They saw more than 75,000 participants, but some that witnessed the ride said that the riders may have run into the hundreds of thousands.
