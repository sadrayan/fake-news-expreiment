Senator Tom Cotton tonight held a town hall that became rather rowdy, just one of many such Republican town halls in the past few weeks.

He received questions on everything from Obamacare (one constituent asked those in the room affected by the law to stand) to President Trump‘s tax returns to Russia.

At one point a woman stood up, introduced herself, and said, “I am not a paid protester.” A lot of people at the town hall applauded wildly.

Cotton said this in response:

“I don’t really care if anybody is paid or not, you’re all Arkansans and I’m glad to hear from you. So I know… there’s been some talk about that in the media, some politicians have said that. I just want to say thank you to everyone for coming out tonight, whether you agree or me or disagree with me. This is part of what our country’s all about.”
