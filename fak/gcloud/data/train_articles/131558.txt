DISNEY RESORTS

All Disney Resorts have begun normal operation, with the exception of Fort Wilderness Campground and Disney's Saratoga Springs Treehouse Villas.

We anticipate that Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground will reopen next week, but it remains closed at this time as we clean up the property following the storm. Disney's Wilderness Lodge remains open.

To allow Disney’s Fort Wilderness to prepare the property after Hurricane Irma, all shows at The Hoop Dee Doo Musical Revue and Mickey’s Backyard BBQ will be canceled up to and including Tuesday September 19th. Any existing reservations will be automatically canceled and refunded.

The Treehouse Villas at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort are tentatively scheduled to reopen on Sunday, Sept. 17.

Disney's Vero Beach and Disney's Hilton Head Island Resorts will remain closed at this time.
