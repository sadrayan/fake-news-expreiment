Sean Penn Mourns Death of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez
"I lost a friend I was blessed to have," continued Penn, whose relationship with the nationalist Chávez made him the target of much scorn—and the butt of many a tweeted joke about being on suicide watch today.

"My thoughts are with the family of President Chavez and the people of Venezuela," he said. "Venezuela and its revolution will endure under the proven leadership of Vice President Maduro."

Penn, who appeared alongside Chávez at an election rally last August, attended a vigil for the ailing leader in December during a trip to Bolivia.
