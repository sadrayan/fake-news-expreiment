1. As we discussed, there are no US CENSUS numbers yet for 2014 that would allow us to compare 2013 (last year before ACA marketplace coverage and Medicaid expansion took effect) to 2014 (August-Sept release usually)

2. NO comprehensive national numbers yet for 2015, so our best info so far is only capturing the change from 2013 to 2014, the FIRST year of ACA expanded private and public insurance. But Gallup and Baker surveys offer some high-quality estimates.

3. Texas’ Baker Institute reported

Recent Baker Institute Reports: Texas adult (18-64) uninsured rate down almost 8 points from 2013: dropped from 24.6% in 2013 to 16.9% March 2015. (All results are from TEXAS survey, not national)

– Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) is a quarterly survey of adults ages 18-64

– Standout findings:

• Adults 50-64; Women; Hispanics; Employed showed the largest percentage decrease in rates of uninsured among Texas adults

• 139-399% FPL saw MUCH larger gains in coverage than the potential Medicaid expansion group (<139% FPL)

• From the report: AT A GLANCE:

– The percent of adult Texans without health insurance fell from 24.6% in September 2013 to 16.9% in March 2015

– The decrease in the uninsured is almost entirely attributable to a rise in individually purchased health plans

– Had Texas opted to expand Medicaid, the gains in coverage would have been more substantial

4. Gallup also reports BIG drop in CA rate from 2013 to 2014 : http://www.gallup.com/poll/181664/arkansas-kentucky-improvement-uninsured-rates.aspx?utm_source=medicaid&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=tiles

5. New CDC Health Interview Survey (HIS) data (NOT directly comparable to Census or Baker or Gallup numbers) file:///C:/Users/Adunkelberg/Documents/State_estimates_insurance_2013_2014.pdf

a. See Tables 1 and 4 especially: CA all-age uninsured rate drops from 23.7% to 16.7%, a decline of 7.0 points, while TX only from 28.4% to 25.7%, a decline of 2.7 points. Similar comparison when we look at ages 18-64 in Table 4.

b. ALSO from the new HIS release: --Everywhere in US, we see a much bigger improvement (reduction) in uninsured rate among working age adults than for kids or all ages, and the improvement is particularly high in the age 19-25 group. (table 1) (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm, under “what’s new”)

- table 5: across US, dramatic improvements in uninsured rates among below poverty and between 100-200% FPL

-- Table 9: remaining uninsured working-age adults still strongly linked to income (see poverty status in chart)

--Table 12: Medicaid Expansion states see much larger improvement in uninsured rate than non-MedEx states like Texas in the 18-64 age group , compared to the 0-17 group. -- expected because Medicaid-CHIP coverage FOR KIDS across the US states is much more consistent, while non MedEx states like Texas cover only a tiny handful of parents and NO uninsured adults without dependent children at home (unless aged or disabled).

--Table 15: see 18-64 stats, TX uninsured at 25.7% compared to 16.3% for US!
