Muslim Nurses refuse to wash hands in UK Hospitals according to Sharia Law – Terror News Network
As if there are not enough allowances being made for minority groups, and Islamic’s, Muslim nurses in the UK have now been granted permission to participate in medical procedures without washing their hands.

You are probably feeling a little repulsed at this point, and you should be. Hand washing is the basics when it comes to hygiene and let’s face it the operating room is one place where you really NEED hygiene. It is directly related to stopping the spread of diseases and infection.

I am quoting Jews News when it comes to the reasoning behind this…

The demand first derived from Islamic Sharia Law. Muslim nurses feared that washing their hands in the operating room, “compromises their modesty.” Of course, medical experts argued that not practicing proper sanitation before a procedure compromises the safety of patients instead.

Still, Muslim nurses now have the option to wear disposable plastic over-sleeves, rather than scrubbing their hands.





The Department of Health in the UK addressed concerns about the solution by stating that “the guidance is intended to balance infection control measures with cultural beliefs.”

Now, I don’t know about your but the operating room is not a place for anyone’s cultural beliefs, it is a medical procedure.

It has been said that UK medical officials are taking a few steps to limit the nurse’s exporusre to patients. This still shouldn’t be allowed.

Let’s face it nurses are always short staffed, and if they are on shift they should be working as hard as anyone else, not being limited.

Freedom daily agrees “If washing their hands in public violates their religion, they have the freedom to pursue a different career path.”

Allowing this has now set a precedent for other countries, and that really concerns me.

I would love to know your thoughts in the comments.
