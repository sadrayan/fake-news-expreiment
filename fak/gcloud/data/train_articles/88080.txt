Aqua Pennsylvania, which is based in Bryn Mawr, needs to collect $10.2 million more a year, or about 2.4 percent, to make up for its reduced tax-loss benefits. But its customers will not be immediately affected because Aqua told the PUC that it intends to file for a general rate increase this summer, and the tax impact will be considered at that time as part of its broader request for more money.
