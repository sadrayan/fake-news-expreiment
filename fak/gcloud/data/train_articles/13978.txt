Scalise vows to block new tax on Christmas trees
Washington, D.C. - Congressman Steve Scalise today released the following statement after President Obama announced he would implement a new tax on every Christmas tree sold in America.

"It is shocking that President Obama tried to sneak through this new tax on Christmas trees. He might have thought nobody would realize what he did, but I will fight to prevent President Obama from becoming the Grinch who taxed Christmas,‚Äù Scalise said. "At a time when hard-working families are struggling in a tough economy, it is hard to believe that President Obama would single out Christmas as a time to break his promise that he would not raise taxes on middle class families. This new tax is a smack in the face to each and every American who celebrates Christmas, and may be the best example to date of President Obama's obsession with taxing and regulating hard-working American families. A new tax on Christmas trees is something not even Dr. Seuss' Grinch could imagine, yet now it exists on the books in America unless we can reverse it quickly. President Obama has pledged repeatedly not to raise taxes on those earning less than $250,000, but this multi-million dollar tax does just that - hitting hard-working middle class families squarely in their wallet at the peak of holiday season. I'm calling on President Obama to stop acting like the Grinch and repeal this absurd tax."
