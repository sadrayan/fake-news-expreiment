Record crowd in Anderson to hear Donald Trump
A record crowd showed up in Anderson to hear from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday.

Trump was originally scheduled to speak at T.L. Hanna High School, but the event was moved to the Anderson Civic Center due to the number of people expected to attend, according to the Trump campaign.

"I think (campaign officials) were so well surprised with the enormous response just right off the bat that they saw early on that Hanna was not going to be able to handle this event so it's here," said Anderson County Republican Party Chair Dan Harvell.

Before the doors opened to the public, the crowd lined up outside.

The civic center can hold up to 6,000 people.

By 5:30 p.m., crowds was estimated at 5,000 people, according to Harvell.

"This is the largest political event in Anderson's history," said Harvell.

Previously, the record for the most people in the civic center was 4,400 people for a Willie Nelson concert, said Anderson County Parks, Recreation and Tourism Director Glenn Brill.

"This is the fifth presidential candidate we've hosted since July 1, so we have an existing security plan, a parking plan, a staffing plan in place, so it was just modifying it to fit the Trump event," said Brill.

Harvell said he's trying to get all Republican presidential candidates in Anderson and worked for three months to get Trump to visit.

"We were very persistent with, of course, the front-runners at the time, and of course Mr. Trump was one (of them)," said Harvell.
