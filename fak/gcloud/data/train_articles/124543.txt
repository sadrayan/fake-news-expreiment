Martin Luther King Jr.

On the national holiday named for the civil rights leader, Sen. Bernie Sanders called the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., “one of the great leaders in American history.” Sanders, then a college student, was in the crowd on The Mall in Washington when King delivered his “I have a dream” speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. “We must never forget his heroic efforts to end segregation and racial injustice. It is also important, however, to remember that he fought for a society in which all people had good jobs at good wages and that quality education and health care were available to all. At a time when we have an almost record number of Americans living in poverty, obscene levels of income and wealth inequality and millions working longer hours for lower pay, we still have much to learn from Dr. King’s extraordinary life.”
