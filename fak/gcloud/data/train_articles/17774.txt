Every year, Colorado sends millions of dollars to Washington, DC, to the Department of Education. Michael Bennet wants DC bureaucrats who don’t know our kids making decisions about what’s best for Colorado students. I believe those dollars should be returned to Colorado so parents, teachers and superintendents have the freedom to make choices and direct the education of their kids.

Let’s be clear: I’m not talking about cutting one dime out of education. I’m talking about who is in charge. I trust Colorado families and teachers way more than I trust DC central planners who think they know better than parents do.
