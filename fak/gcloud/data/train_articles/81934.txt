Obama's potential executive order one of many on immigration
When Congress refused President Truman's request for a commission to study immigration reform, the president created his own through an executive order in 1952. The President's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization recommended that the country do away with its restrictive immigration quota system, which placed tight restrictions on the number of immigrants from parts of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It would take until 1965, under President Lyndon Johnson, for the quotas to be canceled.
