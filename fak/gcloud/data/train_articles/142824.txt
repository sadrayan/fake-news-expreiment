Starbucks CEO: White Men Are Root Of All EvilYou
quote:

I always thought Starbucks was the root of all evil.





I have had Starbucks maybe two or three times and only because it was the only coffee shop nearest my gate at the airport. I rarely had time to venture to another coffee shop so I settled for Starbucks. I do not like the burned flavor or whatever it is they do to their beans. I just want regular coffee; no flavoring, no latte', no cappuccino - I just coffee.Sooooo, they won't miss me a bit.
