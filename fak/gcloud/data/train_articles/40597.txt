(2) The budget for fiscal year 2006 submitted to Congress by the President on February 7, 2005, requests no funds for fiscal year 2006 for ongoing military operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. (3) According to the Congressional Research Service, there exists historical precedent for including the cost of ongoing military operations in the annual budget requests of the President following initial funding for such operations by emergency or supplemental appropriations Acts, including-- (A) funds for Operation Noble Eagle, beginning in the budget request of President George W. Bush for fiscal year 2005; (B) funds for operations in Kosovo, beginning in the budget request of President George W.

(5) In February 2005, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that fiscal year 2006 costs for ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $65,000,000,000. (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that-- (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year after fiscal year 2006 for an ongoing military operation overseas, including operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, should be included in the annual budget of the President for such fiscal year as submitted [[Page 119 STAT. 253]] to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code; (2) <<NOTE: President. Deadline.>> the President should submit to Congress, not later than September 1, 2005, an amendment to the budget of the President for fiscal year 2006 that was submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, setting forth detailed cost estimates for ongoing military operations overseas during such fiscal year; and (3) any funds provided for a fiscal year for ongoing military operations overseas should be provided in appropriations Acts for such fiscal year through appropriations to specific accounts set forth in such appropriations Acts.
