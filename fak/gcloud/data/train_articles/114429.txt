Big Shots: Rock Legends and Hollywood Icons: Harvey Kubernik, Guy Webster, Brian Wilson: 9781608872404: Amazon.com: Books
I have always loved Hollywood portraits, from George Hurrell to Bert Stern, close ups of such beautiful faces are studies of unequalled beauty, that you never tire of looking at. Growing up in the sixties, I saw a new gendre of gorgeous photography- the Record Album Cover. The first album cover that I fell in love with, was of The Doors 1967 debut album. I found out that the photographer was a talent like no other named Guy Webster. Guy is in a category all his own. He captures the raw close up of the stars face, only unlike Hurrell's airbrushing of the imperfections, the freckles and imperfections are left to see.



For lovers of the gorgeous 60's album covers or of the 60's Hollywood stars, this large book has it all. These photographs embody all the beauty of the sixties, close up, in large breathtaking portraits and scenes. Guy Webster not only captures the details of the stars in their close up portraits, he captures their very essence. The same goes for his fantastic album covers- you can almost feel the sunlight coming through the trees in his Simon and Garfunkel photos for the album Sounds Of Silence. I will list some of the famous people who are magnificently portrayed on these large pages that simply take your breath away. As if the photos aren't enough, Guy also has many comments from what he recalls of his photo shoots with the 60's most gorgeous people, as well as some of the star's comments. There are not enough STARS to rate this book, but if 5 STARS is the highest, Guy Webster deserves 10.
