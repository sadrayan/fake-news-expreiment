Uniforms in the Middle School: Student Opinions, Discipline Data, and School Police Data
Uniforms and School Safety

For the majority of the last century, many countries around the world have had mandatory uniform requirements for students. The more privileged classes often adopted dress codes in private schools that have been called preppy, consisting of khaki or grey pants, white or light blue Oxford-style shirts, and sometimes coats and ties (Dussel, 2005 Dussel, I. 2005. When appearances are not deceptive: A comparative history of school uniforms in Argentina and the United States (nineteenth-twentieth centuries). Paedagogica Historica: International Journal of the History of Education, 41: 179–195. doi:10.1080/0030923042000335538). This style became the basis for many public school uniform codes. Dussel pointed out that, historically, no uniform style of dress had been adopted in public schools in the United States, but schools do have policies that convey the expectation of acceptable appearance, such as attending school in a clean and properly dressed manner.

One of the rationales given for dress codes and uniform policies is, purportedly, to improve school climate and student deportment, which in turn is thought to affect school safety and student achievement. Dinkes, Kemp, and Baum (2009) Dinkes, R., Kemp, J. and Baum, K. 2009. Indicators of school crime and safety: 2009, Washington , DC : National Center for Education Statistics. NCES No. 2010-012/NCJ No. 228478 recognized that “our nation's schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning, free of crime and violence” (p. iii). Robers, Zhang, Truman, and Snyder (2012) Robers, S., Zhang, J., Truman, J. and Snyder, T. D. 2012. Indicators of school crime and safety: 2011, Washington , DC : National Center for Education Statistics. NCES No. 2012-002/NCJ No. 236021 reported indicators for U.S. school crime and safety and indicated that there were 33 school-associated violent deaths from July 2009 to June 2010. Also, in 2009, 22% of students attending public schools reported that there was a gang presence at their schools, with 33% of Hispanic students reporting a gang presence (Robers et al., 2012 Robers, S., Zhang, J., Truman, J. and Snyder, T. D. 2012. Indicators of school crime and safety: 2011, Washington , DC : National Center for Education Statistics. NCES No. 2012-002/NCJ No. 236021). Furthermore, an estimated 1.9 million school crimes were reported, with 85% of the public schools reporting one or more crimes (Robers et al., 2012 Robers, S., Zhang, J., Truman, J. and Snyder, T. D. 2012. Indicators of school crime and safety: 2011, Washington , DC : National Center for Education Statistics. NCES No. 2012-002/NCJ No. 236021). In addition, 28% of students ages 12–18 indicated being bullied at school during 2009. At the middle school level, 33% of seventh graders and 32% of eighth graders reported being bullied. These were only some of the many key findings identified by Robers et al. With such findings in mind, administrators might consider implementing school uniform policies to lessen the potential for school violence and improve school safety.

As many as 25% of elementary and middle schools require uniforms for students in the United States (Bodine, 2003 Bodine, A. 2003. School uniforms, academic achievement, and uses of research. Journal of Educational Research, 97: 67–71. ; Key, 2000 Key, A. 2000. Uniforms are runway ready. Fortune, 16: 76–76. ), which is similar to the 26% that Yeung (2009) Yeung, R. 2009. Are school uniforms a good fit? Results from the ECLS-K and the NELS. Educational Policy, 23: 847–874. doi:10.1177/0895904808330170 reported for public and private schools. In the 2009–2010 school year, 35% of city schools reported requiring students to wear uniforms and 19% of middle schools reported having a uniform requirement (Robers et al., 2012 Robers, S., Zhang, J., Truman, J. and Snyder, T. D. 2012. Indicators of school crime and safety: 2011, Washington , DC : National Center for Education Statistics. NCES No. 2012-002/NCJ No. 236021). Long Beach Unified School District was one of the first and largest districts in the United States to mandate school uniforms in 1994, and after one year the district reported improvements in student behavior and attendance (Firmin et al., 2006 Firmin, M., Perry, L. and Smith, S. 2006. School uniforms: A qualitative analysis of aims and accomplishments at two Christian schools. Journal of Research on Christian Education, 15: 143–168. doi:10.1080/10656210609485000).

Yeung (2009) Yeung, R. 2009. Are school uniforms a good fit? Results from the ECLS-K and the NELS. Educational Policy, 23: 847–874. doi:10.1177/0895904808330170 indicated that the “transformative power of clothing provides the theoretical rationale behind school uniforms, though acceptance of this particular maxim is far from universal” (p. 847). Individual displays of flashy adornment, including makeup, bareness, miniskirts, and earrings are seen in schools (Cruz, 2001 Cruz, B. 2001. School dress codes. A pro/con issue, Berkeley Heights , NJ : Enslow. ). Moreover, adolescents face peer pressure to wear specific labels, styles, and name brands (Murray, 2002 Murray, R. K. 2002. Tinkering with student dress: A review of school uniform law. Thresholds in Education, 28: 27–41. ). In Swain's (2002) Swain, J. 2002. The right stuff: Fashioning identity through clothing in a junior school. Gender and Education, 14: 53–69. doi:10.1080/09540250120098889 study, “styles of dress formed a part of how the pupils wished to be publicly represented, and the designer labels and names so prominently displayed were a vital visible component in that promotion” (p. 60). Also, students may display specific colors and attire to represent gang affiliation (Darden, 2008 Darden, E. C. 2008. What not to wear: Controlling the wardrobe of minors in a learning environment through dress codes, clothing bans, and school uniforms can be a legal minefield. American School Board Journal, 195: 36–37. ). Clearly, clothing plays a prominent role in adolescents' lives and is frequently used to show affiliation to a particular group or style.
