Colorado lawmakers' joint marijuana committee sets first meetings
The first two meetings have been set for the legislative committee that will write rules for recreational marijuana in Colorado.

The legislative committee — with the mouthful name of the Joint Select Committee on the Implementation of the Amendment 64 Task Force Recommendations — will meet on Friday and again the following Friday, March 22. Both meetings will be at 1:30 p.m. in the Old Supreme Court Chambers of the state Capitol, according to a calendar for the state Senate.

The joint committee — the name is not a pun; it means that both House and Senate members will sit on the panel — was formed to take the recommendations of the Amendment 64 Implementation Task Force and cobble them into laws. The task force finished its work last month and is expected to present its report to the legislature this week.

Among the recommendations for lawmakers to consider is allowing out-of-staters to buy pot in Colorado marijuana stores, allowing employers to fire workers for smoking marijuana off the job and referring to the voters proposals for hefty sales and excise taxes on pot.

Democrats appointed Reps. Dan Pabon, D-Denver; Jonathan Singer, D-Longmont; and Jenise May, D-Aurora; and Sens. Cheri Jahn, D-Wheat Ridge; Gail Schwartz, D-Snowmass Village; and Jessie Ulibarri, D-Commerce City to sit on the committee.

Republicans have not yet announced their appointments.

The committee must review the recommendations and propose bills by March 29, according to legislative leaders. Those bills will then go through the normal legislative process, requiring multiple votes in the House and the Senate before being sent to Gov. John Hickenlooper.
