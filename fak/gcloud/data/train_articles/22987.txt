Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of the goods and services produced by the nation’s economy

less the value of the goods and services used up in production. GDP is also equal to the sum of personal

consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and

government consumption expenditures and gross investment.

Real values are inflation-adjusted estimates—that is, estimates that exclude the effects of price changes.
