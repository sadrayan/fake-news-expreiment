Marilyn Monroe chest X-rays sell for $45,000
A set of three Monroe chest X-rays from a 1954 hospital visit sold at the Hollywood Legends auction at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.

The image was produced in November 1954 at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Florida, USA .

The actress had been admitted for surgery for endometriosis, a condition of the womb which caused her a lot of physical pain.

She was still married at the time to American baseball star Joe Di Maggio although the couple had split and were going through divorce proceedings.

Two months earlier she filmed her famous scene from classic movie Seven Year Itch where a warm air vent billows her white dress up around her waist.

The x-ray carries her married name of Marilyn Di Maggio.

A young doctor working in the hospitalâ€™s radiology department later obtained the x-rays and, when he taught at the centre's medical school, used it to show it to students.

It later passed to his daughter who has put it up for sale.

Julien's Auctions, which sold the X-rays, estimated that they would only fetch a total of about $3,000.

Other Monroe memorabilia that sold included a chair from her last photo shoot that went for $35,000.

The auction included items from other actresses, including a pair of earrings worn by Kate Winslet in the film, Titanic, that sold for $25,000 and a dress Audrey Hepburn wore when she starred opposite Fred Astaire in the musical Funny Face that fetched $56,250.
