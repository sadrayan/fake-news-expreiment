About CNAS
Bold. Innovative. Bipartisan.

The mission of the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) is to develop strong, pragmatic and principled national security and defense policies. Building on the expertise and experience of its staff and advisors, CNAS engages policymakers, experts and the public with innovative, fact-based research, ideas and analysis to shape and elevate the national security debate. A key part of our mission is to inform and prepare the national security leaders of today and tomorrow.

CNAS is located in Washington, and was established in February 2007 by co-founders Dr. Kurt M. Campbell and Mich√®le A. Flournoy. CNAS is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt nonprofit organization. Its research is independent and non-partisan. CNAS does not take institutional positions on policy issues and all views, positions, and conclusions expressed in its publications should be understood to be solely those of the authors.

CNAS board members, founders, leaders, scholars, and interns have held or gone on to prominent positions in the U.S. government, at the departments of Defense and State; the White House; the Central Intelligence Agency; Congress; and the private sector. CNAS enjoys a strong network of supporters in all corners of the policymaking community as a result.
