Goldie Hawn on Hillary Clinton and not being married to Kurt Russell for 33 years
Hollywood star Goldie Hawn has underlined her belief that Hillary Clinton would be best-equipped to be the next president of the United States.



Speaking to CNBC, she said she loved the idea that there was a woman in the running for the White House, but iterated that she wouldn't vote for someone solely because they were a women.



"I am voting for Hillary (Clinton) because I think that she is most equipped to be able to deal with this world. Reactivity right now, emotional reactivity right now, is very dangerous and it's one of the things that we have seen over and over again where we have made terrible mistakes because we haven't taken that breath," she said.



"We haven't given our brain the ability to actually analyze something clearly and appropriately before we speak and before we take action."



She added that she wanted a "stable, unflappable, knowledgeable person" and had decided to back Clinton for the presidency. When asked about Donald Trump, she said that people have "every right" to make that decision to vote for the Republican presidential candidate.
