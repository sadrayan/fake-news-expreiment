US man arrested after woman spots him inside septic tank beneath toilet
Kenneth Enslow, 52, was arrested on Sunday after a woman called police. She had taken her 7-year-old daughter to the bathroom and noticed a man looking up at her from inside the toilet, Tulsa County Sheriff's Maj. Shannon Clark said.

"He went in there, climbed down in the septic and was looking up at the people utilizing that facility," Mr Clark said.

Mr Enslow, who was covered in human waste, was helped from the septic tank by members of the Keystone Fire Department, who sprayed him off with a fire hose and then transported to a hospital for evaluation, according to a sheriff's report.

Court and jail records do not indicate if Enslow has an attorney.

Mr Enslow told police that a woman hit him in the head with a tire iron and dumped him in the toilet, according to the report.
