the speaker... fails to mention out migration. These data are from the US Census for 2011 (last available data). The Numbers include estimates for the population 1 year and over for each state,

I used the data from the following source

http://www.census.gov/hhes/migration/data/acs/state-to-state.html

For Texas

Outmigration 405283 Per Day 1110.364

Inflow 514726 Per Day 1410.208 ---- possible that you have 400 new republicans or leaners coming to texas

Net Increase 109443 Per Day 299.8438 ----- No matter how he swings it, they are not adding 400 republicans a day when you include who is leaving

so if you look at the data, it is possible that of the 1410.208 per day 400 of them are Republican.

Under this scenario all these are people that are legal citizens from other states and they are all eligible to vote. If this is the case than 28% of the new people need to be Republican or Republican leaners to get at 400 per day. This is plausible, but we know not everyone is eligible to vote or 18 years old

If you use census data regarding people who are at least 18 years old (23.5% of the US Population are not) and assume they are all eligible to vote (citizens who meet texas voting law).

The number of eligible voters drops to 1078.809 per day and 37% would have to be Republican to get at 400 per day. This is also plausible, but more difficult given the percentage of independents and democrats in the electorate. Here is where "republican leaners" really comes into play. The chart below from PEW in 2012 and shows the number of GOP identifiers and leaners at 40%.

I don't think we can "prove" him wrong, but neither is his statement true...

I misread the original quote. 500 a day is less likely!

For Texas 2011

Outmigration 405283 Per Day 1110.364

Inflow 514726 Per Day 1410.208 ---- At 500 per day, 35.4% would have to be republican or leaners

Net Increase 109443 Per Day 299.8438 ----- No matter how he swings it, they are not adding 500 republicans a day when you include who is leaving

Using the national data for 18 year olds, 46.3 of new Texans would have to be Republicans to get 500 a day. This is very difficult given the national partisan breakdown. If 46% of americans were Republican, romney would be president.
