Loan Servicers
A loan servicer is a company that handles the billing and other services on your federal student loan. The loan servicer will work with you on repayment plans and loan consolidation and will assist you with other tasks related to your federal student loan. It is important to maintain contact with your loan servicer. If your circumstances change at any time during your repayment period, your loan servicer will be able to help.

Why pay for help with your federal student loans when your loan servicer will help you for FREE? Contact your servicer to apply for income-driven repayment plans, student loan forgiveness, and more.

Do I select my loan servicer?

No. Your loan is assigned to a loan servicer by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) after your loan amount is first disbursed (paid out). The loan has been disbursed when your school transfers your loan money to your school account, gives money to you directly, or a combination of both. Your loan is usually disbursed in at least two payments, and your loan servicer will contact you after the first payment is made to you.

Whom do I contact to get information about my loan?

If your loan is for the current or upcoming school year, contact your school’s financial aid office directly for information about

loan status,

loan cancellation within 120 days of disbursement, and

loan disbursement amounts and timing.

Only your school's financial aid office can provide this information.

If your loan was disbursed in a past school year and you’re still in school, contact your loan servicer when you

change your name, address, or phone number;

graduate;

drop below half-time enrollment;

stop going to school; or

transfer to another school.

If you’re no longer in school, contact your loan servicer when you

change your name, address, or phone number;

need help making your loan payment;

have a question about your bill; or

have other questions about your student loan.

Will ED ever transfer my federally held loans to a different servicer?

Possibly. In some cases, ED needs to transfer loans from one servicer to another servicer on the federal loan servicer team. ED transfers loans as part of its efforts to ensure that all borrowers are provided with customer service and repayment support. If ED needs to transfer your federal student loans from your assigned servicer to another servicer, your loans will still be owned by ED. The “transfer” to another servicer on ED’s federal loan servicer team simply means that a new servicer will provide the support you need to fully repay your loans.

Here’s what you should expect if your loan is transferred to a new servicer:

You may receive an email or a letter from your assigned servicer when your loans are transferred to the new servicer.

You will receive a welcome letter from the new servicer after your loans are added to the new servicer’s system. This notice will provide you with the contact information for the new servicer and inform you of actions that you may need to take.

All of your loan information will be transferred from your assigned servicer to your new servicer.

There will be no change in the terms of your loans.

Your previous loan servicer and new loan servicer will work together to make sure that all payments you make during the transfer process are credited to your loan account with the new servicer.

After you receive the welcome letter from your new servicer, you should do the following:

Begin sending your loan payments to your new servicer. If you use a bank or bill paying service to make your loan payments, update the new servicer’s contact information with the bank or bill paying service.

Follow the new servicer’s instructions for creating an online account so that you can more easily communicate with the new servicer and keep track of your loan account.

What should I do if I am contacted by someone who wants to charge me fees to consolidate my federal student loans or to apply for an income-based repayment plan?

Contact your federal loan servicer; these services and more can be completed by your servicer for free! If you are contacted by a company asking you to pay "enrollment," "subscription," or "maintenance" fees to enroll you in a federal repayment plan or forgiveness program, you should walk away.
