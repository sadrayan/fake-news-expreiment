What's with all the FB ladies' gift exchanges? : OutOfTheLoop
I've seen probably 4 of my friends post about a gift exchange for ladies. It's the same message copied and pasted and the part that piqued my curiosity is that they promise 6-36 gifts in return for for a single $10 gift. Honestly just curious. Here's the message, google the first few lines to see similar messages all over craigslist and message boards:

"Anyone interested in a Holiday Gift exchange? I don't care where you live - you are welcome to join. I need 6 (or more) ladies of any age to participate in a secret sister gift exchange. You only have to buy ONE gift valued at $10 or more and send it to one secret sister and you will receive 6-36 in return!

Let me know if you are interested and I will send you the information!

‚ù§

Please don't ask to participate if you are not willing to spend the $10.

TIS THE SEASON! and its getting closer. COMMENT if You're IN and I will send you a private message. Please don't comment if you are not interested and aren't willing to send the gift!"
