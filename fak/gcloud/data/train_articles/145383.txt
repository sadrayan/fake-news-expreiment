Members
71 Members representing 117 organizations in 56 countries

Membership is for broadcasting organizations whose countries are within the European Broadcasting Area, as defined by the International Telecommunication Union, or are members of the Council of Europe.

Members guide the EBU's direction in a number of ways. They are entitled to vote at the EBU's General Assembly and in EBU elections. They are encouraged to participate in EBU Committees and Assemblies and nominate candidates for EBU bodies such as the Sports Committee, News Committee, Legal & Policy Committee, Television Committee, Radio Committee and Technical Committee. Members also enjoy all the benefits of EBU membership including participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, access to know-how, networking, training from the EBU Academy, and access to the News Exchange and Sports acquisitions if they contribute to these services.
