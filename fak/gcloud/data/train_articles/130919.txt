Woman says Harry Potter ride 'fat-shamed' her
(Dailywire) A plus-sized woman claims she visited the “Wizarding World of Harry Potter” and was denied entry onto the Hogwarts ride because her size did not meet safety standards.

In a piece for the Huffington Post, Jana Schmiedling of the “Woman of Size” podcast says that she mostly enjoyed her experience at the theme park until a dark cloud descended upon her day when she attempted to participate in the “Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey” ride.

When Jana reached the front of the line, she and her friends allegedly made it all the way into the seats until “one of the 20-something ride managers walked over and asked us all to step off because of a ‘safety’ issue.'” It should be noted here that prior to Jana’s entry, a plus-sized friend who previously made the venture cautioned her that this might happen. Jana, however, decided to take her chances.
