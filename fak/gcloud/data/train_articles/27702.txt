Each year, many states test a portion of or all public high school 11th graders as part of ACT’s state-testing program. Similarly, a broad range of school districts also test some or all of their 11th and/or 12th grade students in the same manner. Any of these students meeting ACT’s present-year graduating class criteria are included in the graduating class average score results above.
