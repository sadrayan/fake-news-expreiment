Bush, Mcbride Keep Debate Civil
ORLANDO â€” Gov. Jeb Bush and Bill McBride clashed over school spending, classroom crowding, gay adoption and tax reform but broke little new ground on Tuesday in their second debate of the governor's race, broadcast live from Universal Studios.

The Town Meeting, sponsored by Florida Radio Network, was a tame affair, leading to few of the sparks that have marked previous gubernatorial radio debates. The debate was broadcast on 30 stations, including locally on WJNO news radio 1290 and WIOD news radio 610, and reached about 1 million.

The state of Florida's public schools continued to dominate, as it did in the candidates' first faceoff on Sept. 27 and as it has in their television ad campaigns. The third and final debate in the series is scheduled for next Tuesday at the University of Central Florida and will be televised.

Locked in what polls show is a statistical dead heat, Bush and McBride kept the radio debate civil, clashing philosophically -- but mostly politely -- over how the state has fared under Bush's leadership.

"The governor has suggested the schools are just fine, but that's not my experience," said McBride, a Democrat who has two children in public schools. "I ask the people of Florida to step back and decide whether what's going on is what you like. If you do, you should rehire the governor."

Bush, a Republican, said he has worked hard to fulfill his promises from the 1998 campaign by backing programs to reduce crime, make schools more accountable, help the state's educationally disadvantaged, create more jobs and keep taxes low.

"Our schools are better now. Our crime rate is the lowest since 1973. Our economy is stronger than it would have been had we raised taxes," Bush said.

He repeatedly attacked McBride for not having more detailed plans on how he proposes to run the state if elected.
