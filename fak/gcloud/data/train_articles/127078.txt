Colin Kaepernick collusion case: Teams saw free-agent QB as starter, report says
Multiple NFL teams believed in 2017 that Colin Kaepernick not only was good enough to be on their rosters but also could be their starter, Pro Football Talk reported, citing an unidentified source.

The revelation appears to bolster Kaepernick's collusion grievance against the league and NFL owners.

According to Pro Football Talk's source, who purportedly has knowledge of the situation, internal franchise documents generated as part of the free-agency evaluation process and witness testimony in the collusion case say that Kaepernick was seen as a potential starting quarterback and not just an NFL-caliber QB.

Moreover, the report asserts, teams still view Kaepernick as a potential starter, which is counter to claims by teams that not signing him was a football-only decision.

Yet he remains unsigned â€” or, as he claims, blackballed from the NFL because of his kneeling during the national anthem as a form of protest against social and racial injustices. (Teams have admitted since the initial football-only talk that there are other considerations that have prevented them from signing Kaepernick.)

"The deeper question," Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio writes, "becomes whether Kaepernick and his lawyers can prove coordination among the teams and/or through the league office in connection with the decision to steer clear of Kaepernick based on his role at the forefront of protests that occurred during the national anthem."
