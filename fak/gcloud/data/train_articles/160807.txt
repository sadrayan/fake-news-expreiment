Mandate

UBOS is the principal data collecting, processing, analysing and disseminating agency responsible for coordinating and supervising the National Statistical System.

The Uganda Bureau of Statistics, formerly known as the Statistics Department under the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, was transformed into a semi-autonomous body by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics Act No. 12, 1998.
