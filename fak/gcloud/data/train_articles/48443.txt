Andrew Gillum to rally at UCF Saturday with rapper Common, politicians
Democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum will rally students Saturday at the University of Central Florida, joined by the rapper Common and politicians and celebrities.

The rally will take place at CFE Arena from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Joining Gillum are Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama; U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Winter Park; State Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando; and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, according to event details on Gillum’s official Facebook page.

Common and “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett are also expected at the rally. The pair add to a growing list of prominent black celebrities showing support for the Tallahassee mayor’s gubernatorial bid.

Gillum appeared Friday alongside President Barack Obama for a get-out-the-vote rally in South Florida.

The events come just days before the Nov. 6 election.

Polls have mostly shown Gillum narrowly leading his Republican opponent, former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis.
