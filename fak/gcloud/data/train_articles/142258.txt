Bent out of shape... illegal aliens caught in desperate attempts to cross U.S. border
Photo Credit: INS A woman peering out from the automobile dashboard of a vehicle was discovered before the vehicle could cross the U.S.-Mexico border. Every year, federal officers from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Customs Service discover increasing cases of "human contraband" secreted in unusual places and wrapped in innovative disguises. The man in the photo below was actually hidden inside an automobile seat occupied by another "legal" occupant. The woman peering out from the automobile dashboard of another vehicle (above) tried a similar "spaced-out" ploy - she was also discovered before the car could get across the U.S.-Mexico border, cramped, but none the worse for wear.
