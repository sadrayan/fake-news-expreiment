How to vote in Maryland Tuesday
Marylanders will vote for the Democratic and Republican nominees for president Tuesday, among other competitive races.

Voters will select a member of each party to compete for an open U.S. Senate seat, as well as eight seats in the House of Representatives.

Primary election voters in Baltimore will also select each party's nominees for mayor, comptroller, City Council president and 14 council districts.

For decades, the winners of Baltimore's Democratic primary won the general election in November. Democrats outnumber Republicans 10-to-1 in the city.

It's the first year of a new election schedule for the city. In 2012, the General Assembly passed legislation that lined up Baltimore's election with the presidential campaign.

The shift was made in an effort to increase voter turnout.

Some jurisdictions also have competitive races for county school boards and judgeships.

Here's what voters need to know before heading to the polls:

•Each voter is assigned a polling place based on their address. Voters can visit the Maryland State Board of Elections website (elections.state.md.us) to find their polling place.

•New this year, voters will select candidates by filling in bubbles on paper ballots — like a standardized test.

•The polls open at 7 a.m. Tuesday and close at 8 p.m.

•You must already be registered to vote on primary election day — there is no same-day registration.

•Independent and other third-party candidates will not be included on the ballot Tuesday. Baltimore's Green Party is holding a separate primary on May 1. Other candidates may appear on the ballot for the general election in November.
