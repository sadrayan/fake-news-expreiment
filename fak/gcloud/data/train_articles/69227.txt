Charlie Crist: I can't support Sotomayor

Gov. Charlie Crist, who has made diversity a hallmark of his own judicial philosophy, today came out against President Obama's selection for the U.S. Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, who would become the first Hispanic on the nation's highest court.

Crist is running for a U.S. Senate seat in 2010.

"While I have not had the opportunity to meet personally with Judge Sotomayor--a crucial step in the selection process -- I have reviewed and reflected upon her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and come to the conclusion that I cannot support her appointment to the United States Supreme Court," Crist said. "Judge Sotomayor is worthy of respect for her many accomplishments and her remarkable story of success. However, I have strong concerns that Judge Sotomayor would not strictly and objectively construe the constitution and lacks respect for the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. For these reasons, I cannot support her appointment to the highest court in the land."

Crist had been taking some heat from the press and his Republican primary rival in the Senate campaign, former House Speaker Marco Rubio, for not taking a position on Sotomayor.
