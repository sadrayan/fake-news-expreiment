Crisis Text Line
Texting In





HOW DOES CRISIS TEXT LINE WORK?

You text 741741 when in crisis, available 24/7 in the United States. A live, trained Crisis Counselor receives the text and responds quickly. The Crisis Counselor helps you move from a hot moment to a cool calm to stay safe and healthy using effective active listening and suggested referrals - all through text message, using Crisis Text Line’s secure platform.

For more detail, see How It Works.





WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "MOVE FROM A HOT MOMENT TO A COOL CALM?"

Our Crisis Counselors bring texters "from a hot moment to a cool calm" using techniques in empathetic listening. Once they’ve built rapport and trust, explored the issues, and established the texter's goal, they collaboratively problem-solve to help the texter come up with a plan to stay safe.



WHO ARE THE CRISIS COUNSELORS?

Our Crisis Counselors are dedicated, trained, supervised volunteers from around the United States. After a rigorous multi-stage application process, background check, and training program, each commits to 200 total hours of volunteering. Supervisors (Staff who all have Master's degrees in a relevant field, or commensurate crisis intervention experience) oversee the Crisis Counselors.



WHAT CAN I EXPECT WHEN I TEXT IN?

You’ll receive an automated text asking you what your crisis is. Within minutes, a live trained crisis counselor will answer your text. They will help you out of your moment of crisis and work with you to create a plan to continue to feel better.



IS CRISIS TEXT LINE CONFIDENTIAL?

Yes. Crisis Counselors only know what texters share with them, and that information stays between you, unless sharing it with emergency services is absolutely necessary for your safety. We take your confidentiality seriously. Check out our terms of service here.



HOW MUCH DOES CRISIS TEXT LINE COST?

We do not charge texters. If your cell phone plan is with AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, or Verizon, texts to our short code, 741741 are free of charge. If you have a plan with a different carrier, it works just like texting a friend: standard text message rates apply.



WILL CRISIS TEXT LINE APPEAR ON MY CELL PHONE BILL?

Nothing will appear on your bill if your cell phone plan is with AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, or Verizon. (Read about how this happened here). If your plan is with another carrier, our short code, 741741, will appear on your billing statement.



WILL CRISIS TEXT LINE WORK ON MY CELL PHONE?

Crisis Text Line works on all major US carriers and most minor regional carriers. However, shortcodes (like 741741) are not allowed on many prepaid plans like T-Mobile's. If you are unable to reach us via text, you can do so via Facebook Messenger at facebook.com/crisistextline.



CAN I TEXT IN MORE THAN ONCE?

You can text in again if you are experiencing a crisis. However, you should not feel dependent on us. Crisis Text Line is not a replacement for long-term counseling, in-person therapy, or a friend.



HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR A COUNSELOR?

Our goal is to respond to every texter in under 5 minutes. During high volume times, like at night or when we “go viral” on social media, wait times may be longer.



IS THERE A CHARACTER LIMIT WHEN TEXTING CRISIS TEXT LINE?

Yes, our system is only able to process 160 characters in one message.



WHY AM I RECEIVING AN ERROR MESSAGE OR NO RESPONSE AT ALL?

Sadly, there are some carriers who have not adopted the use of shortcodes--and the small percentage of people with these phones can't use Crisis Text Line via SMS. (We hear that sometimes you get an auto-error response. Sometimes nothing at all. We know this isn't ideal, and we wish those carriers would enable us!) If your phone carrier doesn't enable shortcodes, contact us via Facebook Messenger at facebook.com/crisistextline.



WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A TEXTER IS IN IMMINENT RISK OF SUICIDE?

In cases when a texter is in immediate danger of suicide or homicide, as determined by a risk assessment by the Crisis Counselor and Supervisor, our first step is to try to work with the texter to form a safety plan. If the texter is unable to plan for their own safety, the Supervisor may contact emergency services, who may dispatch a wellness check.











Messaging Apps





IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO REACH CRISIS TEXT LINE BESIDES TEXT?

Yes, we’re leveraging messaging apps!

You can reach us through Facebook Messenger. Using the “Send Message” button at facebook.com/crisistextline button will connect you to a live Crisis Counselor. We are NOT yet available on other messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Google Voice, and TextNow. We apologize for any inconvenience and invite you to use Facebook Messenger if you're unable to use regular SMS for any reason.

These services are for people in crisis. Have a general inquiry? Email info@crisistextline.org.





IF I REACH OUT VIA AN APP, DOES CONFIDENTIALITY APPLY?

Yes. Crisis Counselors only know what texters share with them, and that information stays between you, unless sharing it with emergency services is absolutely necessary for your safety. We take your confidentiality seriously. Check out our terms of service here.





IF I REACH OUT VIA FACEBOOK MESSENGER, WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE DATA?

Three parties: you (in your Messenger thread), Crisis Text Line, and Facebook.





IF I REACH OUT VIA A MESSAGING APP, HOW DO I GET MY DATA DELETED?

Message us back with the word LOOFAH. We’ll scrub your data from our system, and make a request to Facebook to do the same.

HOW ARE VOLUNTEERS TRAINED?

Crisis Counselors graduate from a 30-hour program that includes: video modules that cover (a) specific skills such as good contact techniques; (b) issues such as self-harm, suicide, depression, bullying, and LGBTQ issues, as well as quizzes, role plays, and observations shifts. Our training has been vetted by representatives from national organizations like American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and RAINN (Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network).

We offer our training in a traditional six-week format or an accelerated 15 day format. Both courses cover the same material and have equal requirements. Accepted applicants should evaluate their personal commitments and needs when selected the program that best suits their needs.



WHEN IS YOUR NEXT CRISIS COUNSELOR TRAINING?

We accept applications on a rolling basis. A new training cohort starts every two weeks, so apply whenever you're ready. (Note that an acceptance into training is valid for two attempts - you will be asked to re-apply if unable to complete training after two attempts. We’re excited to meet you!

CAN I VOLUNTEER FOR SCHOOL CREDIT?

We love students and welcome them to apply to volunteer with us! Our 200-hour commitment applies to all Crisis Counselors, including those who are volunteering to meet a shorter external commitment. Crisis Text Line is currently unable to serve as a field placement for MSW and similar programs, or provide: personal performance evaluations, field instruction, in-person/remote campus visits, virtual meetings/conversations, or sign any third-party community service documentation.

We offer letters of verification detailing the number of hours completed, number of texters supported, and gives a short summary of the work you do as a Crisis Counselor. Crisis Counselors can download a letter of verification from their Profile at any time. When a Crisis Counselor completes their 200-hour commitment, they may be eligible for a Letter of Recommendation.

Yes. Our experienced, full-time staff Supervisors oversee and assist our volunteers on the platform.
