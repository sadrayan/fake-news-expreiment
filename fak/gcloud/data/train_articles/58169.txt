What could happen if Roe v. Wade gets struck down?
Regulating abortion would revert fully to state legislatures, many of which have become more conservative and have passed more than 400 laws that restrict access in the past six years alone.

There are four states where abortion would be banned as soon as Roe v. Wade were overturned: Louisiana, Mississippi, and North and South Dakota have enacted “trigger laws” with delayed effective dates. Ten states still have pre-Roe abortion bans on the books that never were repealed. Nine states have laws that explicitly protect abortion rights.

Many state laws are challenged in the courts for placing an “undue burden” on women who seek abortions, the current federal standard that the Supreme Court, with Kennedy in the plurality, established in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. And some of those cases will land before the bench, where a new conservative justice may be more open to arguments that the state’s obligation to protect the health of mother and fetus outweighs a woman’s constitutional right to privacy.

The heated battle has been central to Democrats’ arguments against the confirmation of Kavanaugh. When former Senator Jon Kyl has been seated to fill the vacancy left by the death of Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the Republicans will restore their 51-49 majority in the chamber.
