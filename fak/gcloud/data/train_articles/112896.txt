Sources say the list of co-hosts also includes Thomas Tull and his wife Alba, Megan and Peter Cherin, Robert Iger and Willow Bay, Casey and Laura Wasserman, Jeffrey and Marilyn Katzenberg and Jon and Ellen Goldsmith-Vein. Tickets start at $2,700 per person, and run to $27,000 for co-host level and $100,000 for host. The latter includes a dinner and photo with Clinton.

Another event is in the works for earlier in the day that will be a lower dollar event.

Clinton also plans events on Aug. 23 in Laguna Beach.

Per the invite, co-hosts along with DiCaprio include Tobey Maguire and his wife Jennifer, Jennifer Aniston, Yael and Scooter Braun, Shonda Rhimes and Chris Silbermann.
