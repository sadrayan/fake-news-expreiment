UPDATE: Chatham County deputy sheriff killed in wreck was 14-year veteran of the force
The Chatham County deputy sheriff killed in a Bryan County wreck Wednesday afternoon was a 14-year veteran of the force, the sheriff’s office said Thursday.

Richard Allen Hall, 45, was on his way home but technically on duty about 5:15 p.m. Wednesday when he attempted a U-turn on U.S. 280 and his patrol car was struck by a Ford F-150, said Gena Bilbo, Chatham County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman.

He died on the scene.

Bryan County Sheriff Clyde Smith said Hall was travelling west on U.S. 280 just north of Interstate 16 at the time of the wreck. The driver of the pickup was taken to a local hospital for treatment of injuries Smith said were not believed to be life threatening.

Smith said Tuesday night that it was unclear why Hall made a U-turn.

Hall was assigned to Internal Affairs and on call 24/7, Bilbo said. Some of his former assignments include the Sex Offender Registration Team and patrol with the former Chatham County Police Department. He was hired in April 2001.

The Georgia State Patrol’s Specialized Collision Reconstruction Team is investigating the wreck.
