Super premium domains from our marketplace generally rise in resale value, and can be reused or resold at any price if you are ever done capitalizing on them, or if you are a domain investor. Sales prices at our market have doubled over the last few years, and likely will again due to worldwide Internet growth, prestige, the general scarcity of super premium .Com domains, historically high demand, and the failure of all competing "gTLDs".

It's much less risky to purchase a super premium domain and name your business accordingly, than any other choices; or at least redirect the free customer traffic to your site.

The ever increasing demand for internet sourced information and services, and premium domain investments is the very bandwagon you need to hop on. The trend is your friend! You may own all the tradenames, trademarks, logos, and social sites in the world, but exact match .Com possession ranking in Google is ten tenths of marketing/branding 'law'.

You need to control the keywords and keyword combination strings relevant to your company and industry, forever if possible; bidding on words and paying over and over for advertising is a considerable risk, but buying the .Com is a certainty. The perfect domain, without compromising yourself and your brand, has to come first for a serious business, in order to set yourself apart from all wannabe competitors, and create long term leverage with your other communications and potential advertising. If you pick this domain you may not need expensive, super risky advertising at all, or at least not as much.

You also need properly branded professional email if you want to appear professional and convert the highest number of customers at the highest profits.

Premium domains will keep going up in price due to a "flight to quality", millions of global companies, people and projects requiring great branding perpetually.

Your competition for a great domain, and therefore your opportunity to arbitrage or capitalize, is even greater than your normal business competition, because it includes your normal competition, plus any other company or person in the world that wants to invest in domains for the future, plus anyone who competes for the same word, expression, or brand in any marketing or media.
