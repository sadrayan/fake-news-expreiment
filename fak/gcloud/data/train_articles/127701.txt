Another Woman Installed As Commander At Air Force Academy
POSTED: 10:44 a.m. MDT April 26, 2003

A new commander of training operations formally took over at the Air Force Academy on Friday as part of a leadership shake-up after a sexual assault scandal first uncovered by 7NEWS.

Col. Clada A. Monteith assumed command of the 34th Training Group, which oversees cadet training, in a ceremony before about 4,000 cadets standing at attention in camouflage uniforms.

She replaces Col. Sue Slavec, who has been reassigned to the Pentagon. Monteith will be responsible for the welfare, discipline and professional development of the cadets. She was most recently deputy director of Security Forces at Ramstein Air Base, Germany.

The Air Force is replacing four top commanders at the academy after at least 56 female cadets said they were reprimanded or ostracized when they reported being raped at the school. The allegations are under investigation by the Air Force, the Defense Department and the El Paso County district attorney.

Brig. Gen. Johnny Weida and Col. Debra Gray took over as commandant and vice-commandant of cadets two weeks ago.

Maj. Gen. John Rosa will become superintendent in late May, replacing Lt. Gen. John Dallager. Weida is acting as superintendent until Rosa arrives.

Weida said Friday that everyone at the academy is cooperating with the effort to change.

"I have yet to talk to somebody that hasn't said, 'Hey, sir, we're committed to doing everything possible to get this behind us,"' he said.

Academy officials have announced several changes to address sexual assaults, including clustering female cadets' dormitory rooms, establishing round-the-clock security, training medical personnel to respond to assault cases, offering amnesty to cadets who raise sexual assault allegations and expelling cadets for underage drinking.

On March 28, the Air Force removed a large sign from the academy that said, "Bring Me Men."
