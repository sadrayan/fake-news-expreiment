Pneumoconiosis
Because there is no cure, living with pneumoconiosis involves taking the best care of your lungs and your general health as you can and following up regularly with your healthcare provider to manage your symptoms, to monitor you for worsening of your lung function and to watch for other diseases that can develop in patients who have pneumoconiosis.
