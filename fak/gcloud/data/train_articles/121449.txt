Sugababe Jade Ewen has landed a film role - weeks after declaring bankruptcy.

The singer, who joined the girl group in 2009, will star alongside acclaimed actor Steven Seagal in the action thriller End of a Gun.

Jade hasn't wasted any time throwing herself into the role as she flew to Romania to film scenes earlier this week.

She tweeted: "On my way to Romania to shoot my first ever action movie 'End Of A Gun' with Steven Seagal! Wish me luck."

The gig appears to have come in the nick of time after Jade was reportedly forced to declare bankruptcy in the face of owing thousands to the taxman.

"Jade put her all into her music but sadly things simply havenâ€™t gone well," a source told The Sun.

"She joined the Sugababes full of optimism and had high hopes given the band were very much established in the charts. But it seems she fell victim to their shelf life expiring."

We have contacted Jade's reps for a comment.

Jade, who replaced Keisha Buchanan in the group in September 2009, is believed to have run into trouble when the band went on a break in 2012 to pursue their own projects and never got back together.

In September 2013 the songstress revealed the band weren't going to get back together after 'fizzling out two years ago'.

She added: "I kind of was unlucky in that I came in [to Sugababes] towards the end of the cycle when things naturally came to the end."
