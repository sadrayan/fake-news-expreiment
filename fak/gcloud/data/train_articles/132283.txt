Marley and Me
: The Real Story Mike Henry , Don Taylor LMH Pub. , 2001 - 316 pages , 2001 - Biography & Autobiography 0 Reviews "Bob Marley books are proliferating, and the bad ones are gaining the upper hand as authors strain for a fresh take. This, one of the good ones, covers Marley's life and career from a vantage of relative intimacy. Taylor was Marley's business manager until the singer's last days, and he sheds needed light even though he does not solve the riddles of the Marley saga: What exactly was the nature of Marley's relationship with wife Rita? Where did Bob come down on the split between the Twelve Tribes and other strains of Rastafarianism? What divinity, if any, did Marley believe he embodied? A figure revered for both his music and implied divinity, Marley was incredibly complex. Taylor was supposed to straighten out many details of Marley's life and carry out his business wishes, which, given the swirling, ganja-steeped world Marley inhabited, must have been the occupational equivalent of combing out dreadlocks. His account is a must read for anyone who cares about the legacy of one of the most charismatic pop musicians ever. --Mike Tribby"--Booklist.
