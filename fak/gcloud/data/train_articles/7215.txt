Incentives
Indiana promotes your growth, innovation and profits.

We offer many business tax incentives, corporate tax credits and economic development programs for companies creating new jobs and investment in Indiana. Our business tax structure is also very competitive. Indianaâ€™s corporate income tax is decreasing from the current 6.5% to 4.9% by 2021. As the decrease is phased in, the tax rate will drop each year. Indiana has a flat state corporate tax rate on adjusted gross income and no gross receipts tax or inventory tax.
