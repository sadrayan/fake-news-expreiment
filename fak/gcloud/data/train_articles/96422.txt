A new poll shows a majority of Granite Staters support proposals that would limit access to guns, but there is less support for banning military-style assault weapons.

The WMUR Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, shows that a large majority of people favor background checks to keep felons from buying guns.

"We find that 94 percent favor background checks to keep felons from buying any kind of weapon, and even among gun owners, that's about 90 percent," said pollster Andy Smith.

The poll of 581 randomly selected New Hampshire adults was conducted by landline and cellphone from Jan. 30 through Feb. 5 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.

The poll also shows 91 percent strongly or somewhat support a law requiring background checks for all purchases made at gun shows.

But support for gun-control measures starts to slip when Granite Staters are asked about banning military-style assault weapons. The poll shows 59 percent support a ban, but it also reveals a partisan split, with 88 percent of Democrats favoring a ban compared to 46 percent of Republicans.

A similar gap exists when asked about a ban on magazines that hold more than 10 bullets, with 86 percent of Democrats favoring a ban compared to 41 percent of Republicans.

"When you get to those sorts of levels with specific guns themselves, that's when the Second Amendment thoughts of Republicans really kick in," Smith said. "The databases, the background checks are things that the Republicans aren't having anywhere near as much opposition to."

Next week, the Granite State Poll looks at the state budget, expanded gambling and possible future presidential candidates.
