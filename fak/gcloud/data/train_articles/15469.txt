I looked back at Abbott’s quote and, if that’s all I’d heard, would assume that he is saying having more state FTEs per capita is in some way an indicator of “failed big government.”

But just as with state government spending, you can’t jump to any conclusions if all you look at is state govt employment – knowing what’s a local responsibility in one state versus another is important, because it’s the combined effort that matters. That’s why many analysts doing state-level comparisons use the State + Local FTE count.
