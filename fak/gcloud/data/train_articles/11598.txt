Pompeo Offers Amendment To Clarify NSA Programs
Congressman Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, offered an amendment to H.R. 2397 to ensure that no taxpayer funds may be used by the National Security Agency to target a U.S. person or acquire and store the content of a U.S. person’s communications, including phone calls and e-mails. The amendment further clarifies that the government is not permitted to listen to or store Americans’ telephone conversations through this provision.

The text of the amendment is below:

At the end of the bill (before the short title), add the following: None of funds made available by this Act may be used by the National Security Agency to—(1) conduct an acquisition pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 for the purpose of targeting a United States person; or (2) acquire, monitor, or store the contents (as such term is defined in section 2510 of title 18, United States Code) of any electronic communication of a United States person from a provider of electronic communication services to the public pursuant to section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.
