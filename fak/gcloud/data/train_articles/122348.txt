Supporters seek to get Sanders on N.J. primary ballot
WASHINGTON -- New Jersey supporters of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign are beginning their effort to put the Vermont senator's name on the ballot for the June 7 primary.

A kickoff event with state Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), Sanders' state chairman and his highest-profile backer in New Jersey, is scheduled for Wednesday at Sayreville Democratic Headquarters in Parlin.

The deadline for filing petitions with the Division of Elections is April 4.

Sanders (I-Vt.) is challenging former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton, as she did in 2008, has gotten the support of more of the state's top Democrats than her opponents.

Wisniewski, a 20-year member of the Assembly, has led the legislative investigation into the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal involving former aides to Gov. Chris Christie, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.
