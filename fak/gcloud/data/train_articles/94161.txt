New Nickname For Governor
Just in case anyone thought that he was being soft on crime by seeking to automatically restore voting rights for some felons, Gov. Charlie Crist reminded people who he is: "I'm Chain Gang Charlie."



When Crist served in the Florida Senate from St. Petersburg, he was given the "Chain Gang Charlie" nickname for a proposal to put inmates in chains to do roadside cleanup and other chores. Wanting to take the state back to the "Cool Hand Luke" days earned him criticism and praise - and the nickname.



"I'm Charlie Crist," he said in a campaign ad last year. "In the Florida Senate, they called me 'Chain Gang Charlie' for a reason - I made hard time HARD for criminals." He also pressed for them to serve at least 85 percent of their prison sentences at a time when many served less because of prison overcrowding, and time off for good behavior and other offsets.



Yet here is Chain Gang, talking to his fellow Cabinet members, who were sitting as the state Executive Clemency Board, last week: "Justice delayed is justice denied, and people are waiting. ï¿½ It is significant that we visit this issue this week - this holy week, a week that is all about forgiveness. The debt for a person's wrongs can be paid in full. People can be forgiven by their Creator."



Florida is one of three states in the nation (Virginia and Kentucky are the other two) that does not automatically restore voting rights for felons who have served their time. Calling it "simple human justice," Crist proposed that Florida change its system.



His effort proved successful. He was supported in the 3-1 vote by Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson, a Republican, and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democrat. Attorney General Bill McCollum, also a Republican, voted against it, saying it was "a grave mistake."



But the compromises in the final measure hardly open the floodgates for the tsunami of horrors McCollum paraded around. Automatic restoration of rights includes the right to serve on a jury and the right to vote. It does not include the right to own a firearm.



Those who have been convicted of one of a list of more than 30 crimes will not be eligible to automatically have rights restored. They still must go through the lengthy petition process.



And Bronson successfully amended the measure so that if a felon whose rights have been restored commits a second crime, he or she will have to wait 10 years before having rights restored again.



Corrections Secretary James McDonough said that, of the 38,000 cases pending before the Florida Parole Commission, more than 30,000 would be eligible for automatic restoration.



And although there isn't general agreement on exactly how many eligible ex-felons are out there, nearly all agree the number exceeds 500,000. McDonough said the corrections system will try to locate those who are eligible so they can have their rights restored quickly.



Not everyone was happy. Howard Simon, state head of the American Civil Liberties Union, said while the governor was to be commended, rights would not be restored unless complete restitution payments had been made to victims, which would prove a burden.



Crist took the criticism in stride. "I felt I was duty-bound to do the very best I could,'' Crist told The Miami Herald. "I try to do as much as I can given the constraints we had to deal with.''



It's a sentiment Crist had earlier this month, when he was lobbying behind the scenes to gain support for the rights-restoration plan. "It's not everything I would like," he said. "But it's a huge step in the right direction, to at least get the ball rolling."



Spokesmen for both Sink and Bronson said the restitution angle needed to be included in the final proposal if Crist expected their support.



And Crist noted that the Clemency Board can still restore rights on a case-by-case basis, even if money hasn't been repaid. As an example, he cited the case of Lisa Burford, who served 30 days in jail as a young woman for stealing money from the bank where she worked. She has $25,000 in restitution to make, but her desire to be a nurse can't happen until her rights are restored. Other jobs have been unattainable as well.



"There's somebody who truly is trying to be productive and do the right thing," Crist told the St. Petersburg Times' editorial board this month, "and we're going to say no to her?"



It looks as if "Chain Gang Charlie" has been replaced by "Second Chance Charlie."
