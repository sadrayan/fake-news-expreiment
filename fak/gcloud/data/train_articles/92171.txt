Texas children are back at school, and while our schools are keenly focused on educating young minds, that doesn’t mean parents don’t face certain anxieties when seeing a child leave for class. One typical worry is whether kids are receiving the proper care during their time at school.

Recently, I learned some Texas school districts, such as Dripping Springs ISD, have adopted a policy deemed “Meatless Mondays” for some of their campuses. These actions have me very concerned.
