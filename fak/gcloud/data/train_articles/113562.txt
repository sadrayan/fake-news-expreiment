26 of the Democrats Who Participated in the Gun Control Sit-In Own Guns

Congressional Democrats ended their 25-hour sit-in on the House floor this afternoon, failing to force a vote on two pieces of gun legislation. The controversial sit-in included 26 Democratic lawmakers who themselves own guns, Heat Street learned after examining 2013 USA Today data on congressional firearms ownership. The participants also included 12 more Democrats in Congress who either didn’t respond to USA Today’s gun survey or declined to say whether or not they possessed a firearm.

The sit-in, launched by civil-rights leader Rep. John Lewis, centered on two pieces of proposed gun legislation. One would expand background checks to cover all commercial gun sales; the other seeks tougher prohibitions against gun purchases for terror suspects.

The participation of Democratic gun owners can be viewed as the pursuit of reasonable compromise by left-wing firearm fans—or, potentially, as hypocrisy.

Here are some past posts about guns by weapons-owning Dems who participated in the sit-in.

We have responsibility to do what we can to prevent gun violence. Let's start by closing loophole allowing terrorists to purchase weapons. — Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) June 13, 2016

Americans are depending on us to help prevent gun violence. We need universal background checks so that the deranged can’t buy a gun. — Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) June 9, 2014
