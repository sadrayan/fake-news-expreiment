DAC member profile: United States
USA: a generous donor, is committed to making aid more effective. The United States has significantly enhanced its development strategies, policies, and programmes. It should continue to reduce overlaps and improve co-ordination, according to the DAC's Review of the Development Co-operation Policies and Programs of the United States. The U.S. should also better incorporate and reflect the goals and strategies of developing countries, continue to rebuild the capacity of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and identify key priority areas where it will pursue coherence between development goals and its domestic and other foreign policies.
