‘I saw a UFO’ Buzz Aldrin PASSES lie detector test revealing truth about aliens
MOON walker Buzz Aldrin and three other astronauts have passed lie detector tests over claims they experienced alien encounters.

The space travellers’ accounts of strange space sightings were examined under laboratory conditions. All four astronauts taking part passed the test, carried out using the latest technology. Experts say the results prove they were “completely convinced” signs of alien life they claimed to have witnessed during historic missions were genuine. Aldrin, Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper all took part in the study.
