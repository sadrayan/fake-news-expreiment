New Hampshire Wind Farm Gets DOE Loan
While not known as the windy state, New Hampshire gets ample wind, enough that the U.S. Department of Energy granted a conditional loan of $135.76 million to Granite Reliable Power for the largest wind farm in the state. The project is headed by Brookfield Renewable Power and its partner, Freshet Wind Energy. Total investment for the wind farm would equal $275 million.

The turbines will be located in Coos County in northern New Hampshire and will create nearly 200 construction jobs. The plant will consist of 33 Vestas V90 3.0-MW wind turbines and create 99 MW of energy, which is reportedly enough to power 20,000 local homes and offset 124,000 tons of carbon annually. Most of the energy will be sold to Central Vermont Public Service and Green Mountain Power.

Ground was broken for the project in February, and developers believe that it should be completed by the end of the year. Steven Chu, U.S. Energy Secretary, said of projects like this that “our support for clean energy projects is increasing our global competitiveness and positioning us to win the future.” The current administration has offered nearly $33 billion in conditional loans for 36 clean energy projects across the country.

Besides this wind farm, other things the DOE has also committed financing for support to include four of the world’s largest solar generation facilities, the world’s largest wind farm and the nation’s first new nuclear power plant in three decades.
