Bill Clinton shaking hands does not appear to violate election law, official says
Story highlights Bill Clinton stumped for his wife's presidential campaign in Massachusetts on Tuesday -- including inside a polling place

The secretary of the commonwealth's office said shaking hands alone isn't prohibited

(CNN) Election officials in Massachusetts say no official complaints have been filed against former President Bill Clinton, who was spotted Tuesday shaking hands with those inside a Boston polling station.

His wife, Hillary Clinton, is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Stumping for his wife's presidential bid, Clinton met with voters and election workers at Holy Name Parish School's gymnasium, according to pool reports.

Brian McNiff, spokesman for the secretary of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, says shaking hands alone isn't prohibited. Explicit campaigning is what's banned within 150 feet of a polling places.

"Just meeting people doesn't constitute campaigning," McNiff told CNN. "We received no information that anything like that happened."
