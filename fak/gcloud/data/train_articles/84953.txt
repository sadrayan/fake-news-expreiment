Paris Agreement climate proposals need a boost to keep warming well below 2 °C : Nature : Nature Research
A large share of the potential warming until 2100 is determined not just by the INDCs until 2025 or 2030, but also by what happens afterwards. Several conceptual approaches can be followed to extend INDCs into the future, which basically assume that climate action stalls, continues or accelerates. Stalling action is often modelled by assuming that emissions return to a no-climate-policy trajectory after 2030; continuing action by assuming that the level of post-2030 action is similar to pre-2030 action on the basis of a metric of choice (for example, extrapolating INDC trends in terms of carbon-price development or emissions intensity of the economy); and accelerating action by post-2030 action that goes beyond such a level. Because of the path-dependence and inertia of the global energy system44, 45, the INDCs have a critical role in preparing what can come after 2030.

Each of the above-mentioned approaches leads to different global temperature outcomes, even when starting from the same INDC assessment for 2030. It is therefore essential to spell out post-2030 assumptions to understand global temperature projections for the twenty-first century based on the INDCs. As a conservative interpretation of the Paris Agreement, we here assume that climate action continues after 2030 at a level of ambition that is similar to that of the INDCs (Supplementary Text 3). The assumption that climate action will continue or accelerate over time is supported by the Agreement’s requirement that the successive nationally determined contribution of each country must represent a progression beyond the earlier contributions, and reflect the highest possible ambition, of that country. Stalling climate action after 2030 would be in contradiction with the provisions of the Paris Agreement.

Under these assumptions of continued climate action, the 2030 unconditional-INDC emission range is roughly consistent with a median warming relative to pre-industrial levels of 2.6–3.1 °C (median, 2.9 °C; full scenario projection uncertainty, 2.2–3.5 °C; Table 1, Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 1), with warming continuing its increase afterwards. This is an improvement on the current-policy and no-policy baseline scenarios, whose median projections suggest about 3.2 °C and more than 4 °C of temperature rise by 2100, respectively. The successful implementation of all conditional INDCs would decrease our median estimate by an additional 0.2 °C, but keeps the outcome far from the world the Paris Agreement is aiming for, with well-below 2 °C and 1.5 °C of warming. Moreover, all above-mentioned values represent median projections. Because the climate response to GHG emissions remains uncertain46, it is also possible that substantially higher temperatures will materialize with compelling likelihoods (Table 1). For example, at the 66th percentile level, warming under the unconditional INDCs is projected to be about 0.3 °C higher (3.2 °C, with a range of 2.9–3.4 °C). Finally, the INDC cases that we assess here will exceed the available carbon budget for keeping warming to below 2 °C by 2030 with 66% probability (that is, roughly 750–800 Gt CO 2 implied emissions under the INDCs during the 2011–2030 period compared to the 750–1,400 Gt CO 2 available; Supplementary Text 3, Supplementary Table 6, Fig. 2d). The budget for never exceeding 1.5 °C with a 50% probability (550–600 Gt CO 2 ) will be entirely gone, indicating that active removal of CO 2 at a later point in time will be required to return to within this budget (Supplementary Table 6). Median warming under the INDCs is projected to cross the 1.5 °C and 2 °C limits by 2030–2045 and 2045–2075, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4).

The vertical orange lines show the unconditional INDC range in 2025 and 2030, as shown in Fig. 1. The 2 °C range shown in Fig. 1 starts global least-cost mitigation action in 2020 instead of 2010 and is not included here. b, Relationship between global GHG emission levels in 2030 and median global-mean temperature increase by 2100 based on scenarios shown in a.

The question thus arises whether global temperature rise can be kept to well below 2 °C with accelerated action after 2030. Global scenarios that aim to keep warming to below 2 °C and that achieve this objective from 2030 GHG emissions similar to those from the INDC range have been assessed in detail by recent large-scale model-comparison projects16, 40. Our re-analysis of these scenarios shows that even with accelerated action after 2030, options to keep warming to well below 2 °C from current INDCs are severely limited, particularly if some key mitigation technologies do not scale up as anticipated. This is easy to understand if one appreciates that even if all INDCs are successfully implemented by 2030, the 2 °C carbon budget might already be virtually exhausted by that time (see earlier and Fig. 2d). The Paris Agreement does not define precisely what its “well-below 2 °C” aim means. Typically, policymakers in the UNFCCC have been concerned about limiting warming to below 2 °C with >66% probability47. However, from current INDC levels, all available internally consistent scenarios manage to limit warming to below 2 °C with only a lower, 50%–66% probability, increasing the risks of climate change impacts. No scenarios are available that are consistent with both the current INDCs and a 1.5 °C warming limit with 50% probability.

The available scenarios show rapidly declining emissions after 2030, with global CO 2 emissions from energy- and industry-related sources reaching net-zero levels between 2060 and 2080. The global economy is thus assumed to fully decarbonize17 in the time span of three to five decades and from 2030 levels that are higher than today’s. Furthermore, about two thirds of these scenarios achieve a balance of global GHG emissions (as mentioned in the Paris Agreement) between 2080 and 2100. Because some non-CO 2 emissions are virtually impossible to eliminate entirely (for example, those from specific agricultural sources39), reaching such a balance will involve net-negative CO 2 emissions48 at a global scale to compensate for any residual non-CO 2 emissions17, resulting in a gradual decline in global-average temperatures over time. Technologies that might be able to achieve this feat are still surrounded by important uncertainties (see below). In general, lower near-term emissions allow for a later timing of reaching global net-zero CO 2 emissions17 (see 1.5–2 °C versus dark-orange range in Fig. 2a) and, moreover, reduce the overall future reliance on negative emissions technologies16, 40, 41.

To illustrate the challenges involved, we take a critical look at some characteristics of the scenarios. Scenarios that broadly follow the INDCs until 2030 and still manage to keep warming to below 2 °C (with 50%–66% probability only) are associated with a very rapid decline in CO 2 emissions from energy- and industry-related sources after 2030. The decarbonization between 2030 and 2050 is particularly decisive in these scenarios40, 45. For this period, the scenarios show average rates of decline in annual emissions of about 3.5% (2.0%–4.2%, full range across scenarios; Supplementary Text 4). To understand what this means in a historical context, it makes sense to distinguish between (1) the phase-out of CO 2 generation over time (a proxy for the reduction in fossil-fuel use and upscaling of low-carbon energy sources) and (2) the required upscaling of industrial-scale CO 2 sequestration with carbon capture and geological storage (CCS) technologies49, 50. The latter mitigation option has not been applied in the past. It can thus be seen as an additional technological option that is included in scenarios, but that did not contribute to the past experiences.

In the 2 °C scenarios that start from INDC levels in 2030 (dark-orange range in Fig. 2a), CO 2 generation is reduced at a median annual rate of about 2.3% (0.0%–3.3%, full range) between 2030 and 2050. Historically, countries have been able to achieve reductions in CO 2 generation at rates of about 2%–3% per year as a result of dedicated (energy-security) policies40 (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Text 4). Limiting warming to below 2 °C from year-2030 INDC levels thus implies that the pace of such a precipitated phase-out of fossil-fuel use needs to be replicated globally. These historical reductions were all achieved for non-climate reasons, with a focus on energy security and not on emissions reductions. There is thus no clear historical analogue for reductions under a dedicated and stringent climate policy. The challenge remains nevertheless important. This becomes even clearer when appreciating that all historical analogues for reductions were achieved in highly developed countries, such as France, Sweden and Denmark. Achieving similar results in developing countries, with energy-intensive sectors that are still growing and with weaker institutional frameworks, higher investment risks and less capacity, will be more difficult43, but, at the same time, readily available low-cost zero-carbon alternatives could also allow those economies to leap-frog carbon-intensive development in some sectors.

Scenarios complement the global phase-out of CO 2 generation with a scale-up of CCS infrastructure to capture and geologically store part of the CO 2 that continues to be generated. This scale-up is massive in scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C from INDC levels. Because such scenarios have limited CCS deployment until 2030, the annual rate of CO 2 sequestration is assumed to increase 10- to >100-fold in the 2030–2050 period, reaching about 10 Gt CO 2 yr−1 in 2050 (8–14 Gt CO 2 yr−1 range). To put this challenge into perspective, about 85 GW (measured in coal-equivalent power generation; Supplementary Text 4) of new CCS capacity would need to be installed each year to capture this amount by 2050, which corresponds roughly to the combined capacity of solar and wind power generation that is annually globally installed today51, 52 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Altogether, the global energy-system transition that is required to limit warming to well below 2 °C and further to 1.5 °C is unprecedented.
