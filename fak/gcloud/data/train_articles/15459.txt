Hello Gardner,

After conferring with the researchers involved with this study, what it actually means is that 7 in 10 physicians DO accept Medicaid.

Please spell out how you reached that conclusion, pointing out or sharing data, especially for Texas.

11:10 a.m.

Attached are estimates included in the QuickStat. Estimates are based on data from the 2015 National Electronic Health Records Survey.

It shows the percent of primary care physicians (PCPs) accepting any new patients. Differences in percent of PCPs accepting new patients expecting to use Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance is also shown; the denominator for those percentages is the number pf PCPs accepting any new patients.

Please note that all estimates exclude PCPs with missing data on acceptance of new patients using Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance.

Hope this helps
