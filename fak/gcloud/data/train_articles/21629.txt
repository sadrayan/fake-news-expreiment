Perdue: Georgia’s Farmers Heart of Local Economy



ATLANTA, GA – Republican candidate for United States Senate, David Perdue, today joined Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture, Gary Black, at Lane Southern Orchards to highlight the importance of Georgia’s farming and agricultural communities. Perdue also expressed his desire to serve on the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, if elected.

David Perdue said, “Georgia’s farmers are the heart of our local economy. I deeply respect the values and enterprising spirit of Georgia’s farm families. The safe, affordable supply of food and fiber they provide to the rest of us is a vital component of our economic security. If given the privilege of representing the people of Georgia, I will make every effort to continue our state’s longstanding tradition of serving on the Senate Committee on Agriculture. I hope to bring fresh ideas that will help relieve burdensome regulations and ensure our local farmers succeed in growing a strong Georgia.”

Commissioner Gary Black added, “David understands that agriculture is a business and a fundamental component of our nation’s economy. The onslaught of federal intrusion into the lives of farmers and private property owners must stop. Georgians deserve to be well represented in Washington and they will have a strong voice in David Perdue.”
