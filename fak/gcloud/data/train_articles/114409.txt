The Rush Limbaugh Story: Talent on Loan from God : An Unauthorized Biography: Paul D. Colford: 9780312099060: Amazon.com: Books
This plodding narrative of Rush's life story highlights some intereting facts (such as that he never voted in the Reagan years) and talks with significant people (Rush's first wife). But it's carefully written so as not to offend the talk show host. Since the author had access to Rush's mom and brother, he skews the information in Rush's favor and is too careful in presenting a story that could have been much more interesting.



For being written by a "journalist," this book has a number of errors about radio and the book seems padded (with chapters devoted to comparing Rush to Arthur Godfrey??)



The book also has no footnotes, no information sources listed and no photos. So it's incomplete.



The facts are that Rush was fired from his first four radio jobs, had a couple of fast early marriages, dropped out of college after a year (and failed classes while he attended)--yet there isn't much "dirt" in this book. Even his first wife hasn't much negative to say--is everyone fearful of what Rush would say on the air or somehow get back at them legally?



So if you want the basic facts they are here--but they are presented in such a way as to not offend the host.
