Update: Iowa DPS says number of missing persons recently is 'in line with historical numbers'
CLEAR LAKE, Iowa - It’s a scary statistic: 48 people have gone missing in the state of Iowa in the last 10 days, according to the Iowa Department of Public Safety.

It's important to note that many of those listed as missing may have chosen to leave on their own accord.

Of the most recent 20 people reported missing in Iowa as of Friday morning, 17 are teenagers.

While the numbers may be surprising to some, the Iowa Department of Public Safety said the numbers are in line with history.

Iowa DPS issued the following statement Friday:

"In light of the missing person investigation of Mollie Tibbits, concerns have come to light about the number of juveniles reported missing in Iowa in recent weeks. In FY 2017 4,311 juveniles were reported missing to The Missing Person Information Clearinghouse. This is an average of approximately 12 juveniles a day. The vast majority of which are found or returned home within 24 hours. Typically these cases are runaway situations. The number of missing juveniles reported in recent weeks is in line with historical numbers."

The Clear Lake Chamber of Commerce is doing its part to try and help those who go missing and become sex trafficked by teaching hotel employees and anyone else the signs of a person in danger.

They say people need to be looking out for anything out of the ordinary and report it to police. But with some many people gone missing, they say it hits close to home.

“We have so many events in our community so there’s always people you don’t recognize,” said Libbey Hahn, the Tourism Director for the Clear Lake Chamber of Commerce. “That is worrisome because you might not notice people, so the key is just to notice people and just to be aware.”
