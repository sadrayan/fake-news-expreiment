Ramada Hotel near UB closing in September
A long-standing hotel operation near University at Buffalo’s North Campus will be closing at the end of September, a victim of heavy competition from newer hotels together with increased wage and regulatory burdens.

The family-owned Ramada Hotel and Conference Center in Getzville, located at 2402 North Forest Road, at the corner of John James Audubon Parkway, will cease operations as of Sept. 30, although it will continue to operate and service all previously-booked functions until then.

The DiVita family, whose DiVita Enterprises has owned and operated the hotel since it opened in 1992, has sold its interests in the property to its co-general partner, Benchmark Group, which may convert the property to student housing, according to a statement from Richard A. DiVita Jr. He blamed a tougher operating climate, with higher state minimum wages, more state oversight and the arrival of new hotels – such as the Wyndham Garden Hotel and the Hyatt Place Hotel, both on Main Street, and new hotels closer to UB on Sweet Home Road.

“Closing was not an easy decision,” said DiVita, who was president and chief operating officer of the hotel. “It has been difficult to compete with all the new properties being built in Western New York, along with all the new proposed increases in wages and state regulations.”

Separately, DiVita purchased a 7,029-square-foot multi-tenant office building around the corner at 60 Bryant Woods South, paying $950,000 to an affiliate of Buffalo Structural Steel, which had owned the building and occupied part of it. Buffalo Structural Steel will remain a tenant, but DiVita said the rest of the space will be used by ProServe Solutions, currently a tenant of DiVita’s at the Ramada building.
