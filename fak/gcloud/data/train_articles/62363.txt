President Trump’s message to 2019 graduates of the U.S. Air Force Academy

The 61st graduating class of the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado had a very special guest deliver today’s commencement address: their Commander-in-Chief.

“You could have chosen any school, any career you wanted, but you chose a harder path and a higher calling to protect and defend the United States of America,” President Donald J. Trump told the group of nearly 1,000 cadets. “You know what—in the end, it’s better.” “You are ready to fly, fight—and win! Always win.” Watch the President’s full speech here.
