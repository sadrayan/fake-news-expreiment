Bureau of Justice Statistics Crime and Justice Data Online
BJS is enhancing and re-launching its 'Data Online' tools. The new BJS 'Data Online' tools, available soon, will allow users to conduct customized analyses of large databases. Users can move beyond the published statistics to explore topics in more detail. During this transition, the former 'Data Online' tools will no longer be available to users. Please visit the BJS Data Analysis tools page (http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=daa) to access available tools. To create custom UCR data tables, please visit the revised UCR Crime Trends tool at: http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/. This new site provides access to the latest available crime data. Please adjust your bookmarks accordingly. Thank you.
