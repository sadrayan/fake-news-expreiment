Clemson quarterback dismisses fake quote about White House visit
Clemson University quarterback Trevor Lawrence on Tuesday dismissed a post circulating on social media incorrectly quoting him saying that the team's fast-food dinner at the White House was "the best meal we ever had" before blasting "the coastal elite media."

Lawrence said on Twitter that he "never said this" but called the trip to the White House "awesome."

"I never said this by the way... I don’t know where it came from," he tweeted. "However the trip to the White House was awesome!"

The Clemson football team on Monday night visited the White House, where the team was served an assortment of fast food from McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King and Domino's Pizza.

The original post quoted Lawrence praising the meal and criticizing the "coastal elite media."

“President Trump got all our favorite foods. It was the best meal we ever had. Then we go and see the coastal elite media trashing it for not being organic vegan. We’re football players, not bloggers. This was a perfect blue collar party," the quote read.

Ross Taylor, a spokesman for Clemson football, told The Associated Press that the entire quote was "fabricated."

“Everything that is presented in that meme is fabricated,” Taylor said.

The Clemson football team was at the White House to celebrate its recent victory in the NCAA football national championship game.
