The American Health Care Reform Act
“I would urge all Congressmen to co-sponsor and vote for this pro-taxpayer bill. This legislation is perfectly consistent with The Taxpayer Protection Pledge, and is a quantum leap forward for both health and tax policy.”



– Grover Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform

"On balance, the RSC plan builds on what has made American health care unique and a step ahead of all the rest. It would reinvigorate competition based on value—that is, competition focused not only on reducing costs but also on increasing quality and benefit—and would encourage innovation. Those are the characteristics that, in the past, have led others around the world to look to America for the highest quality care."



– Nina Owcharenko, Director, Center for Health Policy Studies: The Heritage Foundation



“Such a shift toward portability in coverage would better align tax policy with today’s dynamic workforce and help to expand insurance options by providing financial flexibility directly to individuals and families...I hope the tax and fiscal provisions of the American Health Care Reform Act are quickly adopted into law. NTU applauds you for your dedication to repealing Obamacare and implementing those important reforms.”



– Brandon Arnold, Vice President of Government Affairs, National Taxpayers Union

“On behalf of Americans for Prosperity’s two million activists across this country, I applaud you for introducing the American Health Care Reform Act…Americans for Prosperity is encouraged by efforts to repeal ObamaCare and finally move towards a free-market health care system.”



–Christine Hanson, Federal Affairs Manager, Americans for Prosperity

"With Obamacare failing on virtually all fronts this is a truly well thought out legislative solution in an effort to fix what's broke, preserve what's right and enhance quality, access and affordability for millions of Americans, particularly the elderly. 60 Plus enthusiastically endorses your proposals."



- Jim Martin, Chairman, 60 Plus Association

"A constant trope of the left, repeated yet again by President Obama, is that the right doesn't have alternatives to Obamacare -- that they just care about cost, that they want to take healthcare away, that they don't care about helping people or providing real solutions to the problems that beset out health care system even before the Affordable Care Act passed. And if you ask if people who don't yet support repealing the ACA why not, even if they don't like it, it is because they see no other options. It is critical that opponents of this law -- which will do so much to harm medical care and the choices and innovation we used to take for granted -- put forth a range of reform bills that expand choice and personal control, reduce costs, ensure access, and maintain and enhance the quality of medical care in this country."
