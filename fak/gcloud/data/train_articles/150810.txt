Cannabinoid concentrations in plasma after passive inhalation of marijuana smoke.
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its metabolite, 9-carboxy-THC, were detected in the plasma of a subject during a one-hour passive exposure to the smoke from four marijuana cigarettes containing a total of 104.8 mg of THC. Plasma concentrations of THC were determined by RIA and reached an apparent steady-state concentration of 2.2 ng/mL after 20 minutes of exposure. The presence of THC was confirmed by GC/MS analysis. Results from the two analyses exhibited excellent correlation (r = 0.990), although the concentrations determined by GC/MS were higher than those determined by RIA. Concentrations of 9-carboxy-THC were also determined by GC/MS, and remained consistently below the GC/MS determined concentrations of THC. By administering an infusion of THC, the dose that was inhaled and absorbed during the passive exposure was estimated to be 3.2 micrograms/min.
