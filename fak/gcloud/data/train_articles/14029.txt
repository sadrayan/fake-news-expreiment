Congressman John Carter : Press Releases : Carter Tells Obama "No" to Housing Illegal Immigrants at Fort Hood
(WASHINGTON, DC) – Representatives John R. Carter (R-TX-31) sent a letter to President Obama, and the Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security urging the Obama Administration not to provide temporary housing for unaccompanied alien children (UACs) at any U.S. military installation, including Fort Hood.

“It is outrageous that this Administration would even consider using our military installations to shelter illegal immigrants that have crossed our southern border,” said Rep. Carter. “President Obama needs to enforce our immigration lawsand secure our border, not undermine our military at a time when our country is facing increased threats from radical Islamic terrorists. I urge him not to further burden our military by forcing them to babysit hundreds of illegal immigrants on their bases, especially when their sole focus should be fighting the war on terror and keeping America safe.”

The letter was sent in response to a notification from the Office of the Secretary of Defense that a survey team will assess the possibility of using military bases, including Fort Hood, to house unaccompanied minors who have crossed our border illegally.

A copy of the letter is below:

Washington, DC 20500

Dear Mr. President,

The Department of Defense (DOD) has received a formal request for assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide temporary housing for unaccompanied alien children. We have been informed that a survey team will soon be investigating Fort Hood as a possible location for housing these illegal immigrants.

We strongly urge your Administration not to house illegal immigrants on any military base. Furthermore, your Administration should commit to securing the border and focus your efforts on reuniting these children with their families in their native countries.

While housing these unaccompanied minors may be a challenge for you, seeking support from military bases when their resources have already been stretched thin is unacceptable. Our country is at war with radical Islamic extremism at home and abroad, and our military assets must be used to train and prepare our troops, not house illegal aliens. Fort Hood has already suffered two shootings, including one terrorist attack. This military base is clearly a target and our country cannot afford to further burden it with the duties of running a safe house.

As Members of Congress who represent Fort Hood, one of the largest military installations in the United States, we ask you to reaffirm that our military installations exist to project power around the world and to serve our men and women in uniform and their families – not house illegal immigrants. In addition, we ask that Secretary Jeh Johnson and Secretary Sylvia Burwell meet with us before any action is taken to use Fort Hood as a housing unit for illegal aliens.

We respectfully request your immediate attention and quick response to this matter.

Sincerely,
