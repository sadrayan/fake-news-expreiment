North Carolina Ranks #1 Fastest Growing Economy Since 2013
Since 2013, North Carolina has the #1 fastest growing economy in the nation, according to the latest data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has seen a 13.4 percent increase since 2013.



“We have delivered $4.4 billion in tax relief, fixed our broken unemployment insurance system and reformed our economic development strategy to strengthen North Carolina’s economy and put more people back to work,” said Governor Pat McCrory. “These efforts have positioned North Carolina as one of the fastest growing populations as well as fastest growing economy in the country.”



Since Governor McCrory entered office in 2013, North Carolina has fostered an economic environment that has created more than 275,000 private sector jobs. Additionally, as a result of historic tax reform, North Carolina’s business tax climate improved from 44th to 16th, the largest single rate jump in the history of the Tax Foundation rankings.
