UPDATE: Cowboys Just Forced Players Who Kneeled Last Week To Sit On The Bench
The Dallas Cowboys are playing this Sunday without some of their normal starting lineup. The Cowboys have decided to take a stand against kneeling players in the best way possible: by forcing them to sit

David Irving and Maliek Collins thought they were big men by taking after their hero Colin Kaepernick and kneeling during the National Anthem last week. But coach Jason Garrett wasn’t impressed.

“Football is about football, not politics,” Garrett told ESPN earlier today . “It’s time that our players realize that they are being paid to do a job. They can protest on their own time. Not on the field.”

Garrett benched both Irving and Collins this Sunday for their “unsportsmanlike behavior.”

This is the first time a team has taken such a strong stance against unpatriotic behavior on the field, but it may not be the last. Americans are getting sick of the grandstanding and the NFL is getting sick of dropping ratings and interest in football.

As Americans, we should applaud the patriotic decision to bench troublemakers even if it means your team will not do as well as before. Besides, we may discover some unnoticed talent who comes in from the bench. Maybe they can just be permanently replaced.
