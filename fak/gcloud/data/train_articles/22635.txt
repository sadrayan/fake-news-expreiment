Removing The 1940’s Blip
As of 1975, there was nearly unanimous consensus among experts that the first half of the 20th century was exceptionally warm, and that temperatures had plummeted after 1940. In fact, by the late 1960s, temperatures were colder than they were in 1900.

The National Academy of Sciences published this graph, showing that the late 1960’s were cooler than the turn of the 20th century.

From 1900 to 1950, there was dramatic retreat of ice in the Northern Hemisphere

POLAR ICE THAW INCREASING GLACIERS SAID TO BE MELTING CLEVELAND, Feb. 16 (A.A.P.) Dr. William S. Carlson, an Arctic expert, said to-night that the Polar icecaps were melting at an astonishing and unexplained rate and were threatening to swamp seaports by raising the ocean levels. The glaciers of Norway and Alaska are only half the size they were 50 years ago. The temperature around Spitsbergen has so modified that the sailing time has lengthened from three to eight months of the year,” he said. ‘ 18 Feb 1952 – POLAR ICE THAW INCREASING GLACIERS SAID TO [?] M… The Courier-Mail Monday 6 May 1940 Professor Ahlmann was speaking on the collated results of his expedition to north-east Greenland, and he stated that the glaciers there showed clear signs of a change towards a warmer climate. As had been observed in other parts of the Arctic, especially in Spitzbergen, the melting had increased rapidly. By far the largest number of local glaciers in northeast Greenland had receded very greatly during recent decades, and it would not be exaggerating to say that these glaciers were nearing a catastrophe. 06 May 1940 – Greenland’s Climate Becoming Milder

But by 1970, the Arctic was rapidly freezing, with scientists reporting a large increase in ice. The CIA reported a 10-15% increase in ice and snow. there can be little doubt that the early 1970’s were much colder than earlier in the century – when glaciers were rapidly melting.

And scientists reported there was no end in sight to Northern Hemipshere cooling

The 1940 spike in temperatures doesn’t fit the current global warming narrative, so government funded climate scientists decided to get rid of it.

Cc: Ben Santer <santer1@llnl.gov> It would be good to remove at least part of the 1940s blip, but we are still left with “why the blip”. di2.nu/foia/1254108338.txt

And they did exactly that. The Hockey Team removed almost all of the 1940s blip, and the post 1940 cooling.

They accomplished this by massively cooling the period from 1901 to 1960. The graph below shows haw Northern Hemisphere temperatures have been rewritten since the 1975 National Academy of Sciences report. The Hockey Team knocked more than 0.4ºC off 1920 temperatures, relative to the late 1960’s.

By doing this they paved the way for Michael Mann’s hockey stick – which of course wouldn’t have worked if 1970 was colder than 1900.

But it wasn’t just the Northern Hemisphere, the Hockey team has also dramatically cooled the Southern Hemisphere’s past.

Without all of this massive data tampering by the Hockey Team, the global warming story collapses.
