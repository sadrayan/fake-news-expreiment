DOVE IMAGING
Hurricanes have been frequenting North Carolina long before recorded history. Today, the state, a large portion of which protrudes well out into the Atllantic, is well described as "Hurricane Alley"

In September 1999, almost immediately after receiving two strikes from Hurricane Dennis, Hurricane Floyd came roaring through Eastern North Carolina. In his path lay nearly 2,000 factory farm cesspools loaded with hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic fecal waste, wastewater treatment plants, factories and communities, many of which were in the flood plain.

Hurricane Floyd produced some heavy rains. Unsustainable development greatly aggravated the storm's impacts. Most areas received around 10 inches of rain. A few received 20 inches.
