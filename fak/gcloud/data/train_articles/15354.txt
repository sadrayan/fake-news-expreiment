Today, 65 million adults have a criminal record. There are about 245,000,000 adults in the US. Thus, 27% of the adult population has a criminal record. The media usually state one in three have a criminal record.

The 65 million comes from the Justice Department and is routinely used in analyses by government agencies and research organizations. See http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/cc_HiT_CriminalRecords_profile_1.pdf

You wrote: Today, 65 million adults have a criminal record. There are about 245,000,000 adults in the US. Thus, 27% of the adult population has a criminal record.

Can you point me solid sources for each of those figures?

Iâ€™m using the low end of the estimates of adults with a criminal record. A solid source for that is Th Sentencing Project at http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/cc_HiT_CriminalRecords_profile_1.pdf

The adult population was from the Census Bureau at http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html
