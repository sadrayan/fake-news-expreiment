We might not have even covered this story except the Note from Erin: Our hearts go out to Dr Jennifer Ashton, the famous ABC News medical contributor. We might not have even covered this story except the previous ABC News medical contributor who was holistic (may she rest in peace) also died in an alleged fall (not suicide) in Hawaii less than a year and a half ago, at age 31. We did report on her death at that time. Dr Jennifer Ashton was also on 258 episodes of The Doctors according to IMDB. The producer of that show, and colleague Del Bigtree, left (he stated publicly) to make the movie “Vaxxed”. Two other doctors left the show as well reportedly because they have both spoken out publicly about vaccines.

Dr Jennifer Ashton went on to the Doctors after she left the show..

See story below on her husband, also a prominent MD.

A famous MD (who had been married to ABC medical contributor Jennifer Ashton) allegedly took his own life in New York City over the weekend, when he jumped from the George Washington Bridge.

Ms Ashton wrote on her Facebook and Twitter:

“Our hearts [are] broken that the father of my teenage children took his own life yesterday. As an MD, he helped so many and we will remember his warmth generosity and kindness. We know that many families struggle everyday with depression while others like us don’t have any warning. We hope by sharing some of Rob’s story it will save others the heartache we feel. You are never alone.”

The 52-year-old doctor, who was a thoracic and cardiac surgeon in the Bronx and affiliated with Burke Rehabilitation Hospital, jumped at 8:40 a.m., Saturday. His body was recovered from the river some time later when it was found at Hazard’s Dock in Palisades Interstate Park. The two were divorced just two weeks ago. Source: Source: NY Daily News
