“Where’s the fire?” said President Donald Trump as he jumped into the cab of a Pierce Manufacturing Co. fire truck. "Put it out fast."

The image of the President and Vice President Mike Pence posing for pictures in the fire truck made in Fox Crossing was widely copied and circulated on social media Monday night.

The Pierce truck was Wisconsin's contribution to the Made in America Product Showcase held Monday on the White House lawn.

"I think it’s fantastic that they were chosen to represent Wisconsin. Obviously they’re a well-thought-of company with a great reputation," said village president Dale Youngquist. "We’re very proud that they’re based in our village."

The Monday event was designed to encourage manufacturing in the U.S. to “further stimulate the economy and create jobs,” according to a White House press release.

“Later this week, the President will meet with a group of businessmen and women to discuss how the federal government can continue to negotiate on behalf of the American worker and continue to negotiate trade deals that will benefit all.”

A photo released by the White House on Tuesday showed Jim Johnson and Jay Kimmitt, executive vice presidents at Oshkosh Corp., the parent company of Pierce Manufacturing.

Oshkosh Corp. declined to comment for this story.
