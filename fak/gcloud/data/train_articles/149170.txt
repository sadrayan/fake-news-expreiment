Jennifer Lawrence says Donald Trump's election left her devastated and helpless: 'My head exploded'
Jennifer Lawrence has said the election of Donald Trump left her “devastated” and compelled to educate herself about politics.

The 27-year-old actor, who has starred in Silver Livings Playbook, X-Men, and American Hustle, said her “head exploded” after the billionaire property developer was elected president in 2016.

“I felt helpless, I felt scared, I felt devastated, and I found the only thing I could actually do is educate myself,” Lawrence said at a talk at The Wing, a co-working and community space for women, in New York City.

“The more I educated myself on our government the more I realised everything that I care about… is affected by corruption,” she added.

“It doesn’t matter who we have in office, these problems will still exist. That is what we have to fix.”

The Oscar-winning actor has long been an outspoken critic of the US President and has frequently lambasted him.

During a sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey for Hollywood Reporter in December, Lawrence said she had never met Mr Trump in the flesh but a meeting would no doubt end with “a martini to the face”.

“I’ve got a pretty good speech. And it ends with a martini to the face,” she said with a laugh.

After Winfrey asked if she would be prepared if the chance to speak to Mr Trump arose, Lawrence said: “Oh, I would, definitely. Oh, my God, I’ve been waiting for this moment.”

“I’ll give you a hint - it’s not nice. You wouldn’t want me to say it to you.”

Lawrence, who is a steadfast advocate for feminism and gender equality, has previously revealed she had two ferocious words for the billionaire property mogul if they were to encounter one another.

“I was at a concert that I heard he was attending, so I had my full security. I was like, ‘Find Donald Trump’,” she told the Graham Norton Show in May 2016.

“I was adamant on finding him and then making a video of me going, ‘Hey, Trump. F*** you!’ I think he knew I was looking for him.”

Despite being raised as a Republican, Lawrence stopped supporting the party because she said they do not espouse women’s rights.
