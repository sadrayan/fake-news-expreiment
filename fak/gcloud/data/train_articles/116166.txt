Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is among the lawmakers accompanying President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One as he travels to Dallas to speak at an interfaith memorial service for five police officers killed on Thursday.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest says Tuesday that Cruz's presence, as well as speeches from former President George W. Bush and GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, are examples of how the country is not nearly as divided as it might seem given political debates, campaign rhetoric and congressional dysfunction.

Earnest says that "it's in moments of tragedy, that this unity is revealed."

Other members of Congress flying with the president include Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California and Texas Democratic Reps. Marc Veasey and Eddie Bernice Johnson.
