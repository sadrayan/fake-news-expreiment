Growth of U.S. Dairy Exports

From 2004 to 2014, the value of U.S. dairy product exports more than quadrupled, and the United States became the worldâ€™s third-largest dairy product exporter, behind New Zealand and the European Union. In 2015, as global conditions changed, the value of U.S. dairy exports fell by almost 30 percent. The U.S. dairy industry will be challenged to increase market share in the years to come.
