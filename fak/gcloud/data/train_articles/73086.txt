CFI Press Releases > Big Donations Supply 79% of Presidential Early Money
While most eyes are on the “horse race” for funding among presidential candidates, it is noteworthy that the most successful campaigns depended mainly on large donors. As the chart below indicates, the top three Democratic fundraisers, who greatly outdistanced the others, got from 68% (Obama) to 86% (Clinton) of their individual contributions from $1,000 and over donations, including from 38% (Edwards) to 68% (Clinton) from maximum $2,300 givers. Similarly, the three way out in front Republican fundraisers received from 74% (McCain) to 88% (Romney) of their contributions from large donors, including 38% (McCain) to 54% (Guiliani) from “maxers out.”

Note: Totals include primary and general election contributions.

While some of these candidates have boasted about their tens of thousands of small , $100 and under donors (including those mobilized through the internet), only $18 million of a total of $132 million in contributions to all the candidates came from $200 and under donations. Obama was tops in small donations ($5.8 million) but that amounted to only 22% of his total individual contributions. McCain was second at $2.5 million (19%}. On the other hand, Clinton raised only 9%, and Romney 6%, of their contributions from small donations.Michael Malbin, Executive Director of CFI, commented, "Despite the growing number of small donors, our presidential system continues to give an enormous advantage in the primaries to a few candidates who are able to rapidly develop large donor networks almost a year ahead of the primary elections. The danger is that other voices with different messages will never even be heard during these future campaigns, and that will impoverish our democracy."For further details about the ranges of donations to all candidates, comparisons with the two last presidential elections, and a breakout of funds raised specifically for the general election, click here
