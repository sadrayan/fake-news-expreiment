Designated countries of origin
On 23 July 2015, the Federal Court made a decision that affects the right to appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) of Canada. Check the IRB website to find out more.

Most Canadians recognize that there are places in the world where it is less likely for a person to be persecuted compared to other areas. Yet many people from these places try to claim asylum in Canada, but are later found not to need protection.

Too much time and too many resources are spent reviewing these unfounded claims.

Designated Countries of Origin include countries that do not normally produce refugees and respect human rights and offer state protection.

The Designated Countries of Origin policy is meant to deter abuse of the refugee system by people who come from countries generally considered safe. Refugee claimants from Designated Countries of Origin will have their claims processed faster.

This will make sure that people in need get protection fast, while those with unfounded claims are sent home quickly.

Every eligible refugee claimant, including those from Designated Countries of Origin, will still have a hearing at the independent IRB.

Hearings on these claims should be held within 30-45 days after they are referred to the IRB. The timeframe for other refugee claimants is 60 days.
