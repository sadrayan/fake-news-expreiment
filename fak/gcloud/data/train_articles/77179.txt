40 of Obama’s White House aides owe a total of $333,485 in back taxes – media silent
Obama is a do as say, not as I do type of guy, and apparently so are his aides. 40 of Obama’s White House aides own a total of $333,485 in back taxes. Imagine what that money could do. Like maybe even keep White House tours open for the children or something? Novel concept I know. In fact, this is the third straight year that at least 40 Obama aides owe back taxes. Democrats love to tax because they just don’t pay them.
