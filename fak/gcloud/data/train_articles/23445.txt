TOP STORY NOV 6TH 2016

Stop the Steal is a coalition of Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, and Green Party members, supporters of Donald Trump, Governor Gary Johnson, Dr. Jill Stein and Sen. Bernie Sanders, as well as, Conservatives, Progressives and Independents. We all support an honest election.

Our goal is to conduct scientifically valid, methodologically sound exit polls outside certain targeted precinct polling places in eight swing states. We plan to then compare the reported voting machine total to the exit poll results in that targeted precinct.

Our goal is to identify potential computerized manipulation of the voter machines if it exists.

The US State Department (under Hillary Clinton) required not more than a 2% deviance between actual reported results and exit poll results in judging the integrity of foreign elections. All we ask is the same standard apply to the 2016 Presidential election.

We target precincts to include historically partisan areas as well as swing precincts and our methodology is no different than that used in the network consortium exit polls. We only seek a valid and accurate exit poll in which voterâ€™s participation is entirely voluntary.

We seek only to determine if the election is honestly and fairly conducted and to provide an evidentiary basis for a challenge to the election if that is not the case
