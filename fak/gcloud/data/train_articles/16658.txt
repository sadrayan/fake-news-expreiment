Emails, Chris Evans, communications director, Beto O’Rourke campaign, Oct. 17, 2018

Hello again on behalf of the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project.

Beto O'Rourke said in the debate that only one senator has a worse record of bipartisanship than Ted Cruz. How did Rep. O'Rourke reach that conclusion?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories. I am trying to complete this one soon.

You might hear separately from the Austin American-Statesman's Johnathan Silver. He's focused on Sen. Cruz's claim about voting on an oil tax.

Thanks,

Here is what Beto said during the debate:

"There's only one other senator from either party over the last 25 years who has a worse record on bipartisanship."

Here is the Dallas Morning News on October 14th of this year:

"His reputation for partisanship is borne out by rankings from the Lugar Center at Georgetown University. Only two Republicans worked with Democrats on legislation less often in 2017, and Cruz’s career average is even more partisan. From 1993 to 2016, the only senator of either party who worked less often across the aisle was South Carolina’s Jim DeMint, a tea party godfather who recruited and promoted Cruz for the 2012 race in Texas, before moving on to run the conservative Heritage Foundation."

Here is the Lugar Center's McCourt School Bipartisan Lifetime Index for senators since 1993:

Third worst bipartisan score, Roland Burris (D-IL)

Second worst bipartisan score, Ted Cruz (R-TX)

Worst bipartisan score, Jim DeMint (R-SC)
