Behind the Lens: Photographing the President in 50 States
This week, the President will visit South Dakota, marking the 50th state he has visited during his administration (as such, it's also my 50th state with him). To mark the occasion, I chose one photograph from each state that we’ve visited. This was not as easy as I thought it would be. With help from photo editor Phaedra Singelis, I tried to depict a variety of situations. Some are more lighthearted, some are sad, and some are poignant. Some are with the Vice President, some are with the First Lady and a couple are with the entire family. A selection of photos are centered on policy, and others on politics. Some focus on the President' as Commander-in-Chief — others on his role as consoler for the nation.

I hope you enjoy this gallery. And stay tuned -- we’ll be adding a photograph from South Dakota following his visit there on Friday.
