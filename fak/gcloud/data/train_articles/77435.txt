Florida Redistricting
Welcome to FloridaRedistricting.org. House Speaker Steve Crisafulli and Senate President Andy Gardiner have called for a Special Session to redraw Florida’s State Senate districts. The Special Session (Special Session “C”) will be held from October 19-November 6, 2015.

Please see the base maps that were drawn by legislative redistricting staff. A full explanation of the map will be provided to all legislators and the public on Monday, October 19 at 9:00 AM. The base maps were released to legislators and the public simultaneously on October 14, 2015. Statewide and regional views of the maps can be found at the links below. A memo written by legislative redistricting staff to the Chairs of the House Select Committee on Redistricting and the Senate Committee on Reapportionment outlining the two methodologies used in the map drawing process can be found here.

The Legislature has also published all draft versions that led to the final base map as well as the audio recordings of the map drafting sessions. Those materials can be found at the Map Drafts & Audio Tab to the right.
