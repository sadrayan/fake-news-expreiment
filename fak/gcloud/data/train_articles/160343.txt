Body lay undiscovered for three years
The skeleton of a woman was discovered in her flat nearly three years after she is believed to have died, it emerged today.

Joyce Vincent was surrounded by unopened Christmas presents, and the television and heating were still on. The 40-year-old's body was so decomposed that the only way to identify her was to compare dental records with a holiday photograph of her smiling.

Police believe she probably died of natural causes in early 2003 and was only found in January this year when housing association officials went to the bedsit in Wood Green, north east London, because thousands of pounds of rent arrears had piled up.

Details of the case emerged during an inquest at Hornsey coroners court on Monday, which was attended by relatives including Ms Vincent's sisters.

A spokesman for the coroner said today that Ms Vincent had apparently been a placed in the women's refuge accommodation as a victim of domestic violence.

When representatives from the Metropolitan Housing Trust arrived at the flat on January 25 they drilled the door open and discovered stacks of unopened post. Some mail was marked February 2003, and medication and food had February 2003 expiry dates, the spokesman said.

Ms Vincent was found lying on her back on the floor of the living room, which also doubled as a bedroom.

Pathologist Dr Simon Poole told the inquest he had been unable to establish the cause of death because the remains were "largely skeletal", but police do not regard the circumstances as suspicious. Deputy coroner Andrew Walker recorded an open verdict.
