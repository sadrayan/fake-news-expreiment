Over 200 skydivers set new world record for largest formation skydive
— Two-hundred-and-two skydivers from around the world set a record when they all linked up thousands of feet above Southern California.

The Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper reports the group formed the largest sequential skydiving formation of all time Tuesday afternoon over Perris.

The jumpers grabbed each other’s arms and legs and created a giant lattice-like configuration at about 7,000 feet.

The feat smashed the previous record of 164, set over central Illinois in the United States this past April.

The group co-organized by Skydive Perris included jumpers from the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Italy, France and Germany.

Patrick Passe, a Frenchman who helped organize the jump, says about 80 percent of skydivers who show up for such record attempts are experts.

The other 20 percent, he said, need coaching.
