Men Quit Male Birth Control Study Because It Was Giving Them Mood Swings
As most anyone with a uterus can attest to, hormonal contraception can have some serious side effects, including nausea, headaches, weight gain, decreased libido, depression, and yes, mood swings.

Broadly reports on new research from the University of Edinburgh that suggests that men might also be able to effectively take hormonal birth control, meaning women wouldn’t solely have to suffer than burden. But before you throw a parade/throw out your pills, you should know that the study was stopped because men were experiencing side effects that many women using hormonal contraception currently experience.

The study found that a male contraceptive injection could have a success rate of 96 percent — that’s almost as effective as the pill, which is 99.9 percent effective. They studied 320 men between the ages of 18 and 45, injecting them with two hormones: progestogen to lower sperm counts, and testosterone to reduces the effects of the progestogen (progesterone also reduces testosterone).

It was working until 20 men claimed they had issues and the study was halted.

From the study: "Of these 20, 6 men discontinued only for changes in mood and 6 men discontinued for the following single reasons: acne, pain or panic at first injections, palpitations, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction." The other eight men dropped out because of mood changes.



Sound familiar?

Although the study ended early, the researches see this as a win.

Researcher Mario Philip Reyes Festin from the World Health Organization said, "The study found it is possible to have a hormonal contraception for men that reduces the risk of unplanned pregnancies in the partners of men who use it."



Well, it sounds like men will just have to woman up during the next study. Come on, boys! Ovary up!
