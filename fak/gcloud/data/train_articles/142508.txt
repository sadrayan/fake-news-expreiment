Wilhelmina Model Paid to Destroy Bill Cosby Comes Forward. (FYM Exposes the Truth!)
On November 15, 2014, FYM, received an email from a Free Housing Project member. (All Free Housing Members are verified through a background check prior to membership. This female member has been a member for 2 years and has worked on several missions.) She explained in her email that she trusts FYM’s to post the truth about Bill Cosby. She would like to remain anonymous. (FYM fact checks all information prior to release.) FYM has verified the identity of the model who worked with Choice and Wilhelmina Models in 1982. She also provided (FYM) with the booking agents information; names of each casting agent and location. She was given Bill Cosby’s location during that time and we confirmed the location. (Important note: Choice & Wilhelmina had no prior knowledge of this situation. Bad people book models all the time.)





(Before we start down this road. This is what happened in 2004. ‘A woman claimed she was assaulted in 2004 by Bill Cosby. The prosecutor said she didn’t report it for over a year. No evidence. She never said she was raped. The rest happened over 30 years ago. The following information has been fact check and verified and provides evidence that Mr. Bill Cosby is being setup. The casting agent that contact Choice provided the model with two addresses: one to the casting appointment at the Ritz Carlton and a second address to Cosby’s location.)



oooooo

“I wasn’t going to send this email to FYM, but, the feeding frenzy on Bill Cosby’s character made my response necessary. In 1982, I had a photographer named Choice. Choice was contacted by a casting agent, I was told to meet the client at the Ritz Carlton for lunch in New York in the summer of 82’. This client wanted to talk to me about a film project. I arrived at the Ritz Carlton at 11:30 AM. Two male clients arrived; a Caucasian male (late 30s) and an Asian male (early 50s). They indicated that I’d be perfect for a film project.

ooooo

I was told the project paid $5000 cash. I thought that was strange, who pays $5000 cash for a modeling job? The job was to meet Bill Cosby and to try to seduce him; it would be apart of the script. I was confused by this job request? They told me I would be recording the session to see if I was successful and believable? My response to them… I would like to meet Mr. Cosby first and discuss the script. They said no, it wasn’t necessary to meet him. They said it was a spontaneous casting call? I have never in my life heard of a spontaneous casting call.

oooo

As a legitimate model this seemed strange and unethical. I immediately turned down the job. The Asian man continued speaking and offered me $10,000 cash upfront and $5000 upon delivery of some seductive photos and some of his sperm. Sperm?

(I was in shock when they said sperm?) I then realized that these two men had unethical intentions. I excused myself, went to the bathroom, and then I left the hotel and went home. Now, as a model in New York, I’ve been offered drugs, trips around the world, films, videos, money from rich men, casting couch and the list is endless.

ooooo

As a naive model you’re offered many compromising projects, but, this blew my mind. I was offered $15,000 to seduce and destroy Bill Cosby. Why else would they need suggestive photos and sperm? I also realized that America has a history of oppressing, killing and destroying successful and poor people of color.

oooo

I wasn’t going to send this letter to FYM, but, the media lynching of one of our global icons (Bill Cosby), is simply unacceptable. Also, after watching Nightline, Associated Press, CNN, CBS, NPR, Fox, and many other news outlets blatantly misconstrue and lied about old dismissed allegations of Bill Cosby. I’m shocked by the lack of integrity of our major news media. Why would CNN, ABC, CBS, AP and the like lie about 30 year old untrue news?

oooo

Nightline simply cut, deleted and distorted the Cosby interview– making him appear guilty. What has happened to the integrity of our nation?

oooo

I was offered $15,000 cash to discredit and ruin Bill Cosby. I’m 100% convinced that all the women coming forward have been paid off to discredit Bill Cosby as well. Why? He is simply too powerful, his intentions is to empower people of color and his net worth would anger any white man.

oooo

I think most people are good people. My intentions aren’t to insult white people, but, the facts are the facts.

It’s a fact that–9/10th of the global population are people of color and only 1/10th of the global population are whites. As in Ferguson, 14,000 people of color are controlled and abused by 60 white city officials. Reminds me of a plantation. The world doesn’t want powerful people like Bill Cosby to empower people of color and teach them that we have always had the power in numbers and economically.

oooo

Lest we forget, over the last 500 years our government has hunted, oppressed, enslaved and murdered: millions of Indians, millions of black slaves, millions of people of color globally, Black Wall Street, Medgar Evers, Malcom X, Martin Luther King, the Black Panthers, Mike Brown, etc.

ooooo

In America, in 2014, white police officer(s) murders black unarmed men at a rate of every 28 hours. Sadly, America has a long history of killing and oppressing powerful people of color. This is why I came forward. I hope this open letter reaches the media and our beloved Bill Cosby and his loving family.

ooooo

I simply trust http://freeyourmindandthink.com because they are a open source sharing community. FYM educates people on creating a world that provides: free housing, free organic healthy food sources, free educational resources, free health care for all and heals the earth. FYM has nothing to gain by posting this ‘open letter’ and I simply don’t trust the news media.

ooooo

Please don’t get angry at my photographer, the modeling agency and or FYM. I simply came forward because no one should lose their good name because of an allegation or lie. It’s like burning a witch to death because her neighbor said she was a witch. I hope we are better than ancient practices. I have to say, I’m very disappointed in how the media frames the news.”

ooooo
