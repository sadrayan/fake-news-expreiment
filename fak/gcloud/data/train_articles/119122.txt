Eddie Murphy NOT Dead in Accident
Truth rating: 0

By Daniel Gates

Eddie Murphy, who’s been falsely purported to be “dead” in multiple Internet death hoaxes, is the victim of yet another sick, wrong rumor.

According to the losers at prank site Global Associated News, “Actor Eddie Murphy is reported to have died shortly after a snowboard accident earlier today – August 28, 2012.”

The alleged accident, of course, occurred in Zermatt, Switzerland, where Murphy has been “killed” about a dozen times in the past, including last month — twice.

It is 100% false.

Murphy is NOT dead.

He’s alive and well.

We’re not sure why Murphy is such a popular target of death hoaxes, but his this new “death” is just as unfunny as the first hundred.
