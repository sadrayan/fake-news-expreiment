Leticia Van de Putte Launches New TV Ad: “Rape is Always Rape”

San Antonio, TX — Today, Leticia Van de Putte released her new English-language television ad, titled “Rape is Always Rape.” The 30-second spot is part of a multimillion-dollar ad buy across major markets in the state.

In “Rape is Always Rape,” Texans witness Dan Patrick’s dangerous actions against rape survivors and their families. Patrick claims that some people can have “differing opinions” when it comes to rape and incest. The truth is, rape is always rape. For Patrick, when a rapist chooses the mother of their child, government should force the woman to comply. In 2013, Patrick turned his back on rape survivors and their families by voting against funding to test the backlog of rapekits, allowing rapists to walk free. Patrick is dangerous for Texas women.

Leticia Van de Putte makes a direct appeal in the advertisement, speaking to Texans from her neighborhood pharmacy. She demands respect for Texas women and their families. As Lieutenant Governor, she’ll fight for all Texas families.

Leticia Van de Putte released the following statement:

“Shame on Dan Patrick.He turned his back on rape survivors when Texas had a massive backlog of rape kits. His reckless words and actions threaten the progress Texas women have made. Dan Patrick is dangerous for women, and wrong for Texas.

“As a pharmacist, I’ve listened to women across the prescription counter. I’ve seen desperation in the eyes of women following rape. As a legislator, I have fought for survivors of human and sex trafficking. I know that rape is always rape.

“As a mother and grandmother, I love the women in my life too much to let Dan’s words and actions take us back in time. Women have come too far. As Lieutenant Governor, women and their families can trust that I will fight for them.”
