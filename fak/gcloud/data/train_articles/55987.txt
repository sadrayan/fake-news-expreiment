Sweden probes 'arson attack' on nation's largest Shiite mosque
Fire and emergency services were alerted to the scene a little before 12:30am on Monday, where "flames were engulfing the outer facade" of the Imam Ali Islamic Centre in the northern Stockholm suburb of Jakobsberg, a police spokesman said.

No injuries were reported.

"A man who earlier in the day had been arrested and was scheduled for a hearing, was, after interrogation, taken into custody," police said in a statement.

However, they released no information on the man's identity or possible motive.

"This is Sweden's largest Shia mosque with thousands of faithful... They are really concerned," mosque spokesman Akil Zahari told broadcaster SVT. Zahiri said that there were a few people in the mosque when the fire was first noticed. A party had been held earlier in the evening.

The fire raged for over an hour but by 3am fire fighters had the flames largely extinguished.
