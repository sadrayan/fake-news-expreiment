"He does not intend to attend," George W. Bush's personal aide Freddy Ford said in a statement to POLITICO.

Both former presidents said Wednesday that they will not endorse Trump for the Republican nomination, with Ford saying that the 43rd president "does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign."

In a separate statement provided to POLITICO on Thursday, George H.W. Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said, "At age 91, President Bush is retired from politics. He naturally did a few things to help Jeb, but those were the 'exceptions that proved the rule.'"

Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee, "has no plans to attend the convention," an aide to the former governor said Thursday, and Arizona Sen. John McCain has also indicated that those anticipating his presence should not hold their breath.
