Fact and Fiction



​​​​Nutrition, the oldest preventive and therapeutic science, has been a crucially important component of health and health care throughout the ages.

With common sense as a guideline, it should be relatively easy to make sound decisions regarding healthy eating. However, the information explosion in the science of food and nutrition very often creates the impression that the available information is contradictory. Confusion reigns and perspective is lacking. Indeed it is no longer easy to distinguish between fact, misinformation and fiction.



The dictum, "You are what you eat", has often become "You are what you believe you are eating".

The Nutrition Information Centre of the University of Stellenbosch (NICUS) was established in 1997 to act as a reliable and independent source of nutrition information in South Africa.

Backed by the Stellenbosch University's Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, NICUS aims to provide the public, the media and health professionals with the most up-to-date, authoritative information on nutrition in order to create a scientifically sound nutrition culture.

NICUS is part of the Division of Human Nutrition, Department of Interdisciplinary Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.​
