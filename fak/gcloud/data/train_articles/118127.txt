It's not their fault, it's yours! Swedish GIRLS blamed for rise in migrant sex attacks
The damning police report, which is looking at why Sweden has the worst rates of physical and sexual violence committed against women and girls in Europe, has also excused refugees who it says “cannot handle the alcohol”.

Shockingly, the report revealed the majority of sex attack victims were under the age 15.

Police also admitted the majority of attacks have taken place in public places had been committed by migrants.

But it says refugees might not be able to “handle the alcohol” and simply feel “horny” and have “ignorance of the consequences for the girls”.
