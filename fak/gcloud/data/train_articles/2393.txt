RPOF: Shredding truck outside HQ was a coincidence
Around noon, as Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer was preparing to announce his resignation, a shredding truck was seen outside the party's headquarters in Tallahassee.

Just a coincidence, according to a party spokeswoman. Apparently the truck comes by each month to dispose of old documents.

(hat-tip to Capitol News Service reporter Whitney Ray, who tweeted about the truck.)
