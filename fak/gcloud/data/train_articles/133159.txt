International recognition of Kosovo
Overview of states recognizing Kosovo as sovereign state

Since its declaration of independence from Serbia, enacted on 17 February 2008,[1][2] international recognition of Kosovo has been mixed, and the international community continues to be divided on the issue.

As of 4 November 2018, the Republic of Kosovo has received 115 diplomatic recognitions as an independent state, of which 10 have been subsequently withdrawn. As of 9 February 2019, 102 out of 193 (53%) United Nations (UN) member states, 23 out of 28 (82%) European Union (EU) member states, 25 out of 29 (86%) NATO member states, and 34 out of 57 (60%) Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states have recognized Kosovo. The government of Serbia does not recognize it as a sovereign state, but has begun to normalize relations with the government of Kosovo in accordance with the Brussels Agreement.

Background [ edit ]

A number of states expressed concern over the unilateral character of Kosovo's declaration, or explicitly announced that they would not recognise an independent Kosovo. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) remains divided on this issue: of its five members with veto power, three (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) have recognised the declaration of independence, while the People's Republic of China has expressed concern, urging the continuation of the previous negotiation framework. The Russian Federation has rejected the declaration and considers it illegal.[3] On 15 May 2008, Russia, China, and India released a joint statement calling for new negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina.[4]

Although EU member states individually decide whether to recognise Kosovo, by consensus the EU has commissioned the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) to ensure peace and continued external oversight. Due to the dispute in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the reconfiguration of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and partial handover to the EULEX mission met with difficulties. In spite of Russian and Serbian protests, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proceeded with the reconfiguration plan. On 15 July 2008, he stated: "In the light of the fact that the Security Council is unable to provide guidance, I have instructed my Special Representative to move forward with the reconfiguration of UNMIK ... in order to adapt UNMIK to a changed reality." According to the Secretary-General, the "United Nations has maintained a position of strict neutrality on the question of Kosovo's status".[5] On 26 November 2008, the UNSC gave the green light to the deployment of the EULEX mission in Kosovo. The EU mission is to assume police, justice, and customs duties from the UN, while operating under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (UNSCR 1244) that first placed Kosovo under UN administration in 1999.[6]

As of late July 2008, UNMIK no longer provides the citizens of Kosovo with travel documents, while their ability to travel using the new Kosovan passport does not coincide with diplomatic recognition: for example Greece, Romania, and Slovakia accept Kosovo-issued documents for identity purposes, despite not officially recognising its independence. The three neighbouring states that recognise Kosovo—Albania, Montenegro, and North Macedonia—all accept the Kosovan passport, which Serbia refuses.[7]

Formal recognition of Kosovo by UN member states over time Legend Recognised Other states Other states Year

A United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution adopted on 8 October 2008 backed the request of Serbia to seek an International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence.[8] On 22 July 2010, the ICJ ruled that the declaration of independence of Kosovo "did not violate any applicable rule of international law", because its authors, who were "representatives of the people of Kosovo", were not bound by the Constitutional Framework (promulgated by UNMIK) or by UNSCR 1244 that is addressed only to United Nations Member States and organs of the United Nations.[9][10]

Serbia's reaction [ edit ]

Due to Serbian claims that Kosovo is part of its sovereign territory, its initial reactions included recalling ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo for several months, indicting Kosovar leaders on charges of high treason, and litigating the case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Serbia also expelled ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo after the UNGA vote adopting Serbia's initiative to seek an ICJ advisory opinion.[11]

In December 2012, as a result of European Union mediated negotiations on Kosovo's status, Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dačić agreed to appoint a liaison officer to Kosovo.[12] In March 2013, Dačić said that while his government would never recognise Kosovo's independence, "lies were told that Kosovo is ours" and that Serbia needed to define its "real borders".[clarification needed][13]

In April 2013, Kosovo and Serbia reached an agreement to normalise relations, and thereby allow both nations to eventually join the European Union. Under the terms of the agreement, "Belgrade acknowledged that the government in Pristina exercises administrative authority over the territory of Kosovo – and that it is prepared to deal with Pristina as a legitimate governing authority."[14]

On 17 June 2013 Kosovo and Serbia exchanged liaison officers.[15]

Withdrawn recognition [ edit ]

The Serbian Foreign Ministry claimed in November 2018 that there are thirteen nations that have withdrawn the recognition (Burundi, Comoros, Dominica, Guinea-Bissau, Grenada, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Palau, Papua New Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands, and Suriname).[163][164] Kosovo's foreign ministry has called this "fake news" and "Serbian propaganda".[165][166] Guinea-Bissau withdrew recognition in November 2017, but then sent a note verbale to the government of Kosovo stating that the previous note revoking recognition had no effect.[106] Just a few days after revoking its recognition in June 2018, the government of Liberia issued a statement "reaffirming bilateral relations with Kosovo".[167]

There are conflicting reports on whether Oman has recognized Kosovo, or de-recognized it.[168][169] In February 2011, Kosovo announced that it received a note from Oman which stated that it "will welcome Kosovo’s membership to the United Nations, as well as to other international and regional organizations" and that the countries had established diplomatic relations.[168] However, in September 2011 Kosovo's deputy Foreign Minister Petrit Selimi stated that "Oman never recognised us".[170] Later that month, Kosovo's MFA announced that Oman's Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah had informed them of his country's recognition of Kosovo.[169] Kosovo's charge d'affairs in Saudi Arabia was quoted in 2012 as saying that Oman had not recognized Kosovo.[171]

Entities that do not recognise Kosovo as an independent state [ edit ]

Diplomatic recognition is an explicit, official, unilateral act in the foreign policy of states in regards to another party. Not having issued such a statement does not necessarily mean the state has objections to the existence, independence, sovereignty or government of the other party. Some states, by custom or policy, do not extend formal recognitions, on the grounds that a vote for membership in the UN or another organisation whose membership is limited to states is itself an act of recognition.

Country Position Namibia In September 2010, following talks with Namibian officials, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić stated that Namibia has no intentions of recognising Kosovo. The Foreign Minister of Namibia Utoni Nujoma said that the most important thing is to continue to search for a peaceful solution to the problem of Kosovo and that the opportunities should be sought for reconciliation between nations in the Balkans.[354] Nepal A leaked 2009 cable from the US Embassy in Kathmandu states that during a meeting with US Assistant Secretary Richard Boucher, the Foreign Secretary of Nepal, Gyan Chandra Acharya, said that the Government of Nepal had yet to decide if it would recognise the independence of Kosovo. Acharya acknowledged that Nepal understood the US interest in Kosovo's recognition but could not make a decision at the time because of regional sensitivities.[355] Nicaragua In February 2008, the Chancellor of Nicaragua, Samuel Santos, said that the government of his country maintains a position of "observation" to the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo. "Nicaragua is watching the issue of Kosovo's independence, we have friends who are in agreement with this independence and other friends who disagree, there are some who are saying that [independence] is a threat to peace in that tender area. We just look at [this case and] we have no opinion on this issue."[356] Nigeria In July 2009, Umaru Yar'Adua, President of Nigeria, said that Nigeria will not recognise Kosovo as an independent nation. He said the decision not to recognise Kosovo was informed by Nigeria's historical experience of the civil war of 1967 to 1970, fought to maintain its territorial integrity and sovereignty saying that "Since the end of the civil war, Nigeria has continued to embark on nation-building policies and strategies to forge a heterogeneous, yet inclusive nation".[357] In November 2009, Ojo Maduekwe, Foreign Minister of Nigeria (and former advocate of Biafran independence), emphasised that Nigeria will never recognise the independence of Kosovo.[358] In August 2011, Kosovo's First Deputy Prime Minister Behgjet Pacolli said that he had received from senior Nigerian state leaders support and guarantee that Kosovo recognition would be seriously dealt with in a short period of time.[359] Reports of Nigeria recognising Kosovo appeared in 2011.[16][360] In a 22 September 2011 statement, a spokesman for the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Damian Agwu, said that the Nigerian Federal Government had decided to "open a trade office in Pristina".[361] However, the following day the Ministry reversed course and said no trade office would be opened.[362] It was reported in September 2012 that Olugbenga Ashiru, Nigerian Foreign Minister, had denied that the recognition took place.[363] Behgjet Pacolli, the First Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo, reiterated that the recognition occurred and claimed that Ashiru never spoke with the Gazeta Express.[364] In January 2013, former Foreign Minister of Kosovo Skënder Hyseni said that the recognitions by Nigeria and Uganda were "contested, not only by the respective states, but also by the US State Department". Current Foreign Minister, Enver Hoxhaj, stated that he is certain that the number of recognitions is valid.[365] The lack of recognition was confirmed by the Nigerian Foreign Minister in March 2014.[366]

Country Position Paraguay In February 2008, the Ministry of Foreign Relations of Paraguay published a statement saying that Paraguay took note of the independence declaration and was analysing the situation.[367] In April 2010, it was reported that the Paraguayan president had told Kosovan pilot James Berisha, who was on an awareness-raising journey around Central and South America, that Paraguay had already recognised Kosovo's independence but had not made this known so as not to jeopardise their relationship with Russia.[368][better source needed] Philippines In February 2008, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo said in a statement: "Considering the existing sensibilities in the region, continued dialogue should be encouraged among all the parties concerned to ensure regional stability". He also said the Philippines is not willing to recognise Kosovo as an independent nation.[369] On 19 February 2008, Romulo stated that recognition could complicate peace talks with Muslim separatists in Mindanao. He said that "while the Philippines does not oppose the idea of independence for Kosovo, it would prefer a settlement ... taking into account the internationally accepted principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity".[370] In a November 2012 meeting with Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Enver Hoxhaj, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary, Rafael E. Seguis, pledged support for Kosovo, saying that his country has full understanding for the independence of Kosovo and that he would consider the request for recognition.[371]

Country Position Venezuela In February 2008, Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez announced that Venezuela does not recognise Kosovo's independence on the grounds that it has been achieved through U.S. pressure and criticised a recent political movement calling out for a more autonomous Zulia State.[230][433] On 24 March 2008, Chavez accused Washington of trying to "weaken Russia" by supporting independence for Kosovo. He called Kosovo's prime minister Hashim Thaçi, a "terrorist" put in power by the U.S. and noted that the former rebel leader's nom de guerre was "The Snake".[434] Vietnam In February 2008, the Vietnamese UN Ambassador Le Luong Minh "reaffirmed Vietnam policy that the fact that Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence is not a correct implementation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 and that will only complicate the situation in Kosovo and the Balkan region".[435] In a 23 February 2011 meeting with Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić, Vietnamese deputy prime minister, Pham Gia Khiem, reaffirmed Vietnam's position of supporting "Kosovo-related issues under the United Nations Security Council's decree to gain comprehensive measures in terms of respecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and assuring the benefits of involved nations".[436] In a 24 November 2011 meeting with Albanian deputy prime minister and Foreign Minister, Edmond Haxhinasto, Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Pham Binh Minh, said that Vietnam is following the developments in Kosovo, and that Serbia and Kosovo should continue the dialogue to find common ground that will be acceptable to both parties.[437]

Country Position Zambia In March 2008, Zambian Foreign Minister, Kabinga Pande, said that Zambia has not decided its position on the declaration of Kosovo's independence. Pande said the government needs more time to analyse the matter.[438] According to leaked US cables, Zambia does not want to take a position on Kosovo due to concerns with the precedent for the Lozi tribe, an ethnic group primarily inhabiting western Zambia, which has an active sepratist movement for independence from Zambia.[439] In a September 2010 meeting with Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Skënder Hyseni, Mr. Pande said that Zambia is carefully studying the opinion of the ICJ and that the request for recognition will be processed soon.[440] In a subsequent meeting with the Albanian Foreign Minister, Edmond Haxhinasto, Mr. Pande said that Kosovo's independence is an irreversible reality and that the decision of the ICJ's opinion eased the decision on recognition of Kosovo for many African countries.[441] On 27 February 2011, regarding a request to recognise Kosovo, Pande stated that "We will evaluate that request. It will have to undergo scrutiny like we always do".[442] In September 2012, Zambian Foreign Minister, Given Lubinda, said that his country has no reason not to recognise Kosovo.[443] Zambia's Minister of Home Affairs, Edgar Lungu, stated in December 2013 that his government will thoroughly discuss and clear all the grey areas before any decision can be made over Kosovo,[444] and that recognition of Kosovo was Zambia's priority.[445] Zimbabwe In April 2011, Claudius Nhema, Deputy Director of Protocol in the Foreign Ministry of Zimbabwe, reportedly told Kosovan pilot James Berisha that Zimbabwe would be considering Kosovo's recognition, but that they should wait for a recommendation from the Zimbabwean UN representative who should bring it to the Foreign Ministry after which it would be taken to Parliament for ratification.[446] In February 2013, the then Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Morgan Tsvangirai, said that he would consider recognising Kosovo.[447]

Positions taken by intergovernmental organisations [ edit ]

Intergovernmental organisations do not themselves diplomatically recognise any state; their member states do so individually. However, depending on the intergovernmental organisation's rules of internal governance and the positions of their member states, they may express positive or negative opinions as to declarations of independence, or choose to offer or withhold membership to a partially recognised state.
