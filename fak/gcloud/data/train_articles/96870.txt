Morrisey Lies About Ties To D.C. Lobbying Firm

Morrisey’s financial disclosure proves he has financial stake in anti-Trump lobbying firm

CHARLESTON, WV — Yesterday, Pat Morrisey was called out for financially benefiting from a lobbying effort to torpedo President Trump’s pick to the Supreme Court on behalf of Planned Parenthood.

Caught red-handed, Morrisey tried to deny his direct ties to Capitol Counsel and flat out lied to the media.

The truth is that Morrisey’s wife is one of the owners of the lobbying firm. As reported by the Charleston Gazette-Mail, U.S. Justice Department records show that Denise Henry Morrisey holds a 15 percent stake in Capitol Counsel, the second-largest ownership stake at the firm.

TRANSCRIPT FROM MORRISEY’S PRESS CONFERENCE (7.10.2018):

REPORTER: So your family is not connected to Capitol Counsel?

PATRICK MORRISEY: No. This is the same stuff that you heard in the past. My wife has never been involved in lobbying for Planned Parenthood. She has said that over the last year and a half.

REPORTER: But does she still work for this firm?

MORRISEY: Yes, she works for the firm but she doesn’t derive any money from it.

THE FACTS:

“Denise Henry Morrisey receives compensation based on the firm’s profits, including those derived from fees paid by clients, according to testimony her husband gave in 2015 amid a lawyer disciplinary board investigation of Patrick Morrisey’s ties to another Capitol Counsel client, drug wholesaler Cardinal Health.” — Charleston Gazette-Mail

Morrisey listed Capitol Counsel on his Personal Financial Disclosure with U.S. Senate Clerk, confirming that he benefits from his family’s lobbying firm:

“Morrisey won’t come clean about profiting from a lobbying firm that is actively working against Trump’s judicial nominations,” said Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party. “Patrick Morrisey’s lies won’t fool West Virginians.”
