This is the latest that supports the correct calculation and refers to a Moak Casey report showing a corresponding calculation.

Got it, thanks. What date did the executive director’s post go up?

Also, it now looks to me like when you follow Wisnoski’s guidance, you still reach a below 40-percent figure for teacher salaries as a share of operating expenditures.

Wisnoski, like you, suggested it’s more appropriate to compare spending on teacher salaries to operating expenditures, which means setting aside what districts raise in bond proceeds or what’s spent on capital projects such as buildings or to pay off debt. According to the TEA’s posted figures for 2015-16, Wisnoski noted, that 2015-16 “all funds” operating expenditures for the schools totaled nearly $49.5 billion statewide--of which the spending on teacher salaries would have accounted for 36.4 percent, by my calculation.

Gardner,

The following calculation is based upon teacher payroll and benefits as a percentage of operating expenditures for school districts. It does not include charter schools; however, adding amounts for charter schools would not result in a statistically significant change to the calculation.

Teacher Payroll $19,131,375,774.00 Teacher Payroll Benefits $3,429,356,293.12 Total Teacher Payroll and Benefits $22,560,732,067.12 Total Operating Expenditures $47,303,105,584.00 PCT Teacher Payroll and Benefits 47.7%

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Tom

Could you call me about the source for the presented figures? Here, I don’t see a teacher payroll number like the $19 billion one below. Nor do I see entries for payroll benefits while total operating expenditures are presented as $49.499 billion.

I am sending the dataset.

Working from the figures in the PEIMS financial report you emailed me, here’s a reasonableness test to my calculation used PEIMS detailed data from ISDs.

$28 Billion (total expenditures function 11)

less 2.6 B (nonpayroll under function 11)

divided by $49.5 B

equals 51 %.

Times .928 (pct professional teacher salaries in function 11)

Equals 48 % Teacher payroll and benefits

Let me know if you have additional questions. Another calcuation is to
