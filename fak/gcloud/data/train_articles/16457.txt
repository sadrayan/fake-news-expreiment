Subject: Fox & Friends today, two topics

When Gov. Perry said this morning that he flagged “this issue” in 2012 and has yet to get a response from the Obama administration, was he referring to the letter described in this past fact check? If not, what was he referring to?

The governor also said to Fox & Friends: “We have record-high numbers of Other Than Mexicans being apprehended at the border.” How did he reach this conclusion?

Thanks.

The Other Than Mexicans data comes from DPS – would refer you to them for details.
