Malia Obama Lands Internship in Spain
First Daughter Malia Obama is heading to Spain!

The soon to be 18-year-old has landed an internship at the U.S. Embassy there, ABC Espana reports. Malia turns 18 on July 4.

After graduating from Sidwell Friends School, Obama decided to take a sabbatical year before starting at Harvard University in the fall of 2017. According to ABC, Malia’s decision to intern in the Spanish capital may be related to the Obamas’ friendship with the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.

Malia’s internship in Madrid could start as soon as the president’s official visit to Spain on July 9 is over, the news outlet reported.

“The visit to Spain, which is an important ally, is aimed at intensifying cooperation in terms of security and strengthening political and economic relations,” the White House said in a statement.

It is common for American embassies to take recent grads as State Department interns during the year.
