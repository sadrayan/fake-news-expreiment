Work

Contracts play a fundamental role in society and the economy by protecting against uncertainty and contribute to cooperation. Bengt Holmström has developed theories on contracts. At the end of the 1970s, he analyzed how a "principal", for example, the owner of a company, should formulate an optimal contract for an "agent", for example, the company's CEO, whose actions the principal cannot fully monitor. These analyses have been significant for, among other things, governance of companies and the design of laws and institutions.
