We hadn't seen the linked story.

Is Sen. Cruz saying that Beto O'Rourke wants to legalize all narcotics? Is the O'Rourke campaign asking for a fact-check of that?

Thanks,

I trust you got my reply with questions.

Is there any inaccuracy in the Daily Caller story’s quotation of O’Rourke or its recap of the resolution at issue?
