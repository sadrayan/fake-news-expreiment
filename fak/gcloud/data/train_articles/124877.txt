If you’ve been on the Internet at all today, you might have seen Jonathan Nimerfroh’s astounding “Slurpee Wave” photo. The image (above), which went viral today, was shot on Nantucket recently.

While many websites and blogs have posted Nimerfroh’s slushy ocean image without permission, we asked the photographer/surfer if we could use the shot and he agreed. He also provided us with the following backstory on this amazing photo.

“When I pulled up to the beach I could see the horizon just looked strange,” Nimerfroh told us in an email. “When I got to the top of the dunes I could see that about 300 yards out from the shoreline the ocean was starting to freeze.

“The high temp that day was around 19 degrees. The wind was howling from south west which would typically make rough or choppy conditions not so good for surfing but since the surface of the sea was frozen slush the wind did not change the shape. They were perfect dreamy slush waves. Most waves were around two feet with some larger sets slushing thru around three foot or waist high. What an experience to be absolutely freezing on the beach watching these roll in while I mind surfed them. I wonder if a shaper can make me a special designed slurfboard?

The next day I drive up to see if things melted but that same 300 yards out of water froze solid on the surface. No waves at all. I’ve been asking all the fishermen and surfers if they have ever seen such a thing. This is a first they all said.”
