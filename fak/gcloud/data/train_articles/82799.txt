Manila Water Company, Inc.
Water rates will go down starting January 1, 2016

â€‹Manila Water will implement a negative 1.41% adjustment on the 2015 basic charge effective January 1, 2016 following the approval and confirmation of the new rates by the MWSS Board of Trustees as stated in its Resolution No. 2015-147-RO dated December 10, 2015.

Total basic water charge went down from P25.25 to P24.89 per cubic meter, while all-in weighted average tariff decreased from P34 to P33.65.

A Foreign Currency Differential Adjustment (FCDA) of 0.59% of the basic charge equivalent to P0.15 per cubic meter will also be applied for the first quarter of 2016. The Q1 2016 FCDA is 0.38% or P0.10 higher than the Q4 2015 FCDA.

Once the new rates take effect, residential customers consuming 30 cubic meters per month will experience a decrease of about P6 in their monthly bills from P603.40 to P597.04, while those consuming 20 cubic meters per month will experience a decrease of around P3 from P296.32 to P293.26. Non-lifeline or regular residential customers consuming 10 cubic meters monthly shall pay P133.06 in their monthly bill versus P134.44 in the last quarter of 2015.

Lifeline customers from the low-income residential bracket with a monthly consumption of 10 cubic meters or less will experience a slight reduction of P1.11 from P81.16 to P80.05 in their monthly billing.
