Alaska Governor Sean Parnell
Letter from Governor Sean Parnell

Fellow Alaskans,

In December of 2009, I pledged that Alaska would take every step necessary to stop the epidemic of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child sexual abuse in Alaska. Since then, we have witnessed more and more Alaskans finding the courage to speak, and the strength to act.

We started with 18 partner communities. By March of 2013, more than 150 Alaska communities participated in Choose Respect marches, rallies, and community events. Together, we are sending messages of hope and healing to the many who have suffered from these crimes.

Please look at our Choose Respect map of Alaska, and if you don’t see your community listed, contact our office to inquire about how your community can get involved. Our next Choose Respect event will be March 26, 2015.

Together, let’s take back some ground for safer homes and stronger families.

Best regards,



Sean Parnell

Governor
