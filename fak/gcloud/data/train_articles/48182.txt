Politically active non-profit organizations are not required under current law to disclose the names of businesses, organizations and individuals who provide their funds. However, 501(c) non-profit organizations are required to disclose their contributions to other organizations, so the Center for Responsive Politics has begun collecting data based on the disclosures of contributing organizations, rather than relying on reports by the organizations conducting the spending. 501(c)(3) organizations face tighter restrictions on political activity than 501(c)(4)s or other types of 501(c) groups with which they may be affiliated. However, in many cases the affiliates share offices, staff and other overhead expenses, and money may flow between them via grants or loans.
