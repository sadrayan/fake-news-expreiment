Supplies for IV Therapy
For more than 80 years, Baxter has been a leading supplier of sterile solutions. More than a million units of intravenous (IV) solutions are shipped to U.S. customers every day.* These products are not only foundational to our legacy but also to our future.

Baxter is a world-leading manufacturer of commercially prepared intravenous (IV) and other sterile solutions, which are critical to virtually every aspect of treatment in a healthcare setting. They are used for the regulation of blood pressure, hydration calories and electrolyte balance, medication and nutrition delivery, flushing or clearing out IV lines and feeding tubes, wound cleaning, renal dialysis, and plasma collection. Baxter ships more than one million units each day and maintains an extensive supply chain and customer service network to support customers, distributors, and regulators and to ensure patients can receive the therapy they need.*

Through our technology, Baxter offers an aseptic filling process for premixed drugs in flexible IV containers. Plus, we offer a broad portfolio of premix medications to support IV drug therapy without the need for admixing.



Through our frozen premix medications, Baxter offers the only manufacturer-prepared premix system for unstable molecules. We also offer a broad line of liquid premix medications that are stable at room temperature.
