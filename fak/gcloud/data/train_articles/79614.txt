Human Trafficking Legal Center
Faith* was trapped in the home of a prominent diplomat in an affluent Washington, D.C. suburb. She was forced to cook, clean, and care for the family around the clock. For the first few months, Faith was paid nothing. Later, she earned merely 50 cents per hour. Three years into her servitude Faith escaped with only the clothes on her back.

Faith went to the authorities to report the crimes. But, the U.S. government did not bring criminal charges against her vicious trafficker.

But she still wanted justice. Courageously, she decided to sue her trafficker in civil court. HT Legal introduced Faith to a team of talented pro bono lawyers. Our in-house attorneys provided step-by-step technical assistance to Faith’s pro bono lawyers throughout her complex legal process.

“I have my peace, justice, freedom and now… I can raise my voice even higher than before with no fear.”
