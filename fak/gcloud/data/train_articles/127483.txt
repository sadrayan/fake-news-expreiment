Sadiq Khan warns Donald Trump's 'ignorant' view of Islam could make Britain and US less safe
However the new mayor has hit back.

"This isn't just about me - it's about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world," he said.

Mr Khan added: "Donald Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both of our countries less safe - it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of extremists.

"Donald Trump and those around him think that Western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam - London has proved him wrong."

Mr Trump has vowed a “total and complete” temporary shutdown of America’s borders to Muslims following last December’s deadly attack in San Bernardino by a husband and wife team who swore loyalty to swearing loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil).

The Republican candidate has stuck rigidly to his proposed ban despite an international outcry and an online petition, debated in Parliamentafter attracting more than half-a-million signatures, calling for Mr Trump to be barred from the UK in response.

When asked by the New York Times how his proposed ban on Muslims would apply to Mr Khan, Mr Trump said: "There will always be exceptions."
