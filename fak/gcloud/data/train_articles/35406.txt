Memories Christopher A. "Drew" Leinonen

Ebonee Peterson It was a pleasure working with you. I still can't believe this. I know your light continues to shine bright.

Charles Whiteside Hi Christopher DREW lienonen! I have never met you but I have read a lot about you. You were a very loving CARING humorous person with a great personality. You and Juan your husband to be was perfect you both were so happy. I'm so sorry this happened to you. Drew IT BROKE MY HEART TO FIND THIS OUT ON THE NEWS ABOUT YOU. broke my heart. Would have loved to have met you. You will never ever be forgotten. God bless you Juan your beautiful mom your friends and Juans family friends amen. R.I.P. DREW, JUAN!!

Hugs

A pflag mom

Cara S. Drew have been blessed to have known you. I will remember you as one of the kindest souls I ever met. Sweet dreams. Cara

David Heath IF ONLY I KNEW

If I ew it would be the last time

That I'd see you fall asleep,

I would tuck you in more tightly

and pray the Lord, your soul to keep.

If I knew it would be the last time

that I saw you walk out the door,

I would give you a hug and kiss

and call you back for one more.

If I knew it would be the last time,

I could spare and extra minute

to stop and say "I Love You,"

instead of assuming you would KNEW I do.

If I knew it would be the last time

I would be able to share your day,

Well I'm sure you'll have so many more,

For surely there's always tomorrow

to make up for an oversight,

and we always get a second chance

to make everything just right.

There will always be another day

to say, "I Love You,"

And certainly there's another chance

to say our "Anything I can do?"

But just in case I might be wrong,

and today is all I get,

I'd like to say how much "I Love You"

And hope we never forget.

Tomorrow is not promised to anyone,

Young or old alike,

And today may be the last chance

you get to hold your loved one tight.

That you didn't take that extra time

for a smile, a hug, or a kiss

and you were too busy to grant someone,

what turned out to be there last wish.

So hold your loved ones close today,

and whisper in their ear,

Tell them how much you love them

and that you'll always hold them dear

Take time to say "I'm sorry,"

"Please forgive me," "Thank you," "It's okay."

And if tomorrow never comes,

you'll have no regrets about today.

Steven Think about you every day, Christine. Stay strong and keep fighting. We all stand with you. Christopher will always be in our hearts

Sheli Bentley Your light and love shines on and you didn't die in vain. Deep and sincere condolences to your grieving mother. Shine on, young man.. ‚ù§

Fran Garrigus Dear Christine, All the way from us, here in Michigan, to you and your son's friends, know that you will never be forgotten, always in our hearts. I pray for you everyday. I pray that you will find strength and courage. When my family experienced our tragic loss, we felt desperate. But with patience and love, I found that I could only deal with one day at a time. Dear friend, it's ok to feel sad. It's ok to cry. It's ok to take all the time in the future, to find your way. As you, I also, struggled with WHY? I never found the answer, but I walked into my own calm space very slowly, and found the inner peace that helped me begin to believe in all the good things that he believed in. It calmed my soul, to connect with him on my terms, by myself. That was the time, I knew how to think of the positive legacy left behind for me to pursue. No one else had any answers, solutions, remedies. I didn't think they understood. But, I needed to understand, just me. Please know, I share with you, in every moment. You were blessed to give birth to a joyous, wonderful, son, only you!!! Live through his eyes and heart. Feel his soul. You will find your way, I know you are strong. All of these loving kind people send you sincere love and kindness. I will continue to pray for your spirit, health and inspiration. You have helped so many of us, tonight, at the DNC. You will realize that in the future. You were very courageous and genuine and I thank you for that. We all love you and your son's friends equally. Peace be with you all. Love from Michigan. Fran Garrigus

Alai Meta I didn't know Drew, but was very touched and overwhelmed reading about him on the social media and elsewhere. Such a FINE SOUL! So compassionate, helpful, so full of zest, LOVEthe list looks endless! As in life, in death too, he has left a profound & positive impact on so many people, which can be seen in the many posts about him, left in the wake of his passing! In his very TRAGIC death, Drew has opened up his Life to countless souls all over the world, seemingly prodding them to get the best out of their LIVES!!! TO LIVE GOOD, TO LIVE HAPPY and TO ENJOY LIFE to its FULLEST! THIS IS HIS EVER LASTING LEGACY, which will be a guiding light, giving hope to many in the times to come! For this, he will be dearly remembered, not just by his family and friends, but even many others like me who did not know him in person, all across the globe!!! His mother and his closest friends were truly gifted to have him in their lives.



He & Juan personified true LOVE! My heartfelt prayers, for them both to find eternal happiness together and for God to give strength to all their close ones, especially Christine, to bear this huge loss and cherish the very fond and happy memories forever!!! God Bless!!

Michael Petrik I felt compelled to send this note of condolence. As a 55 year old semi retired gay man, I had the time to read all that was provided by the media on this solemn event. I was so touched by the love, care and concern that the Orlando community expressed. In particular, you, Ms. Christine had so much taken from you and, in turn, provided through social media, an avenue to know who your son is. You opened your heart and revealed a very beautiful man. In my entire life, based on what I have read, and seen on the instagram platform, never have I had the pleasure of seeing someone so completely balanced in all areas- family, social outlets, love, and career. Christopher strikes me as a one a million man. I would have loved to have known him personally. Ms. Christine, you do get some of the credit too. From what I can glean, you are a great mother. I am sure that all who have come in contact with him are blessed. He has a lot of the care concern, and love that you have, based on the interview I watched. Juan, his fiance, is a lucky man. Although I do not know any of you personally, I do feel that I have gotten to know all of you somewhat through the social media avenues that you provided. I thank you for that opportunity. I do want you to know that I suspect the bright light of love, family, friendship, care and concern that I believe he possesses shall never diminish. Energy cannot be destroyed, and neither can memories. His light, as well as Juan's and the other men and women shall shine on forever in all of our hearts, minds, and bodies. As a former middle manager for the NYC gay pride rally and parade, we honored all of you in Orlando, and we shall keep all of you in our hearts and prayers. I do know that all of us shall meet some day. Physically, I will come to Orlando in the near future to honor those bright lights in person. Ms. Christine, may God continue to provide you with strength, guidance and peace. When in doubt, look up, God and Christopher will guide you. May you and your loved ones continue to be richly blessed and comforted in the days, weeks, months, and years to come. With warmest regards.

Jennifer To Drew's mom:

I don't know you, and didn't personally know Drew, but please know that my heart weeps for you and your family. I watched your impassioned pleas on the television, trying to find your son, and wished I could hug you. As a mom, I can only imagine... I am so sorry for your loss.

My son, Jesse, worked with Drew for a period of time at Lakeside. They were both assessors. He told me he how much he enjoyed Drew's wit and sense of humor, as well as his professionalism.

I also want to tell you that my son, daughter, another friend, and I were outside of St. Luke's during Drew's service. The boys joined with the angels guarding and protecting your family with Orlando's incredible love. This was so important to Jesse's friend, Hiro, that fact he's a paraplegic, making travel very difficult didn't matter. He rode his wheelchair over a mile to the bus stop, and took the bus across town to be there in support. One of my daughters and I prayed for you out front. We were only a tiny drop of the overwhelming support there. I share this with you because I saw first-hand that Drew's memory and legacy have touched so many - he will never be forgotten. May God bless you and keep you always... and give you peace. Much love, Jen Loveleen Gill Don't stand on my grave and weep.

I am not there; I do not sleep.

I am a thousand winds that blow.

I am the diamond glints on snow.

I am the sunlight on ripened grain.

I am the gentle autumn rain.

When you awaken in the morning's hush

I am the swift uplifting rush

Of quiet birds in circled flight.

I am the soft star that shines at night.

Do not stand at my grave and cry;

I am not there; I did not die.



Such a handsome young man. Sending love from Canada. Lizette Hernandez RIP Love Wins !! Stephanie Werner I didn't know you but you seem to touch so many live unclueding mine I am so sorry for the loss may you rest in peace. My thoughts and prayers to your mother and family!!!! R.I.P.

Peace brother. Penny Delerme Penny Delerme My deepest condolences to the family.Please be comforted knowing that God is there for you as a refuge during this sad time. Brent Adams Rest in peace.

Brandon Reynolds Dear Christopher - I wanted to say thank you for taking a stand at such a young age to bring gay and straight people together. You made a difference in the lives of so many, and everyone in the LGBTQ community morns over you and the other victims. Your legacy will live on through us!! The first thing I heard about the shooting was a video clip of your mother looking for information on you. This broke my heart! However, her most recent interview with Anderson Cooper filled my heart with so much comfort and happiness! The love you both shared for each other was evident by the big smile on your mothers face.



To the Leinonen Family - our thoughts and prayers are with you all and the entire LGBTQ community is here for you! Sending love to each of you! patricia Kaspi Drew will be missed. May we find solace in knowing that one day we will meet again in the shelter of our loving God Almighty. David Harding my prayers are with your family and your brave mother .

Thank you for what a good son he has been. We remember how he always supported us through the difficult seasons and rejoiced with us in the good times.



Thank for the ways in which Christopher has given to our society. We think about what a kind neighbour Christopher has been, and his love for community life. May his many acts of service be a lasting light to us all.

Jehovah has experienced just such pain when his son was brutally put to death and laid in a grave for three days. He understands your pain and lovingly invites you to draw close to him.

Your unconditional love for your son, were with him all his life.Your acceptance of his partner, Juan, made them love you so much. There is no formula to help you get over this terrible loss. But, please find comfort in knowing that you had an amazing relationship in your sons life. I wish I had the opportunity to know this "perfect" son you had. Since you are planning a funeral instead of a wedding, find comfort they are together in eternity!!God bless ...
