Active Antigovernment Groups in the United States
Toward the end of 2016, the antigovernment movement was readying for “civil war” in the event of a Hillary Clinton presidency. Just a few months later, the movement had to reconcile its antigovernment ideology with its widespread support for Donald Trump.

A spate of protests in liberal cities following the election allowed the militia movement, part of the larger antigovernment sector, to thrust itself into the spotlight of urban America in a significant way for the first time since the Oath Keepers deployed militants to protect mostly white-owned businesses in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2015. Piggybacking on hard-right rallies organized in blue cities across the nation, militias sought to capture public attention and put their training to the test. They hoped that the public exposure and their attempts to work cooperatively with police would lend legitimacy to their cause and shake the movement’s extremist image. In Oregon, that state’s GOP moved to have militias provide security for its events.

Unite the Right attracted a network of militia members under the command of the Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia.

Alex Michael Ramos, a former militiaman with the Georgia Security Force Three Percent, led by Chris “General Bloodagent” Hill, attended the rally and was arrested in connection to the brutal gang-style beating of DeAndre Harris, a black male who protested the white supremacist rally.

Ramos’ arrest marks the second time in two years that individuals with connections to Chris Hill’s Three Percenter organization were linked to racist or ethnically based violence — the first known instance took place in 2016 when a splinter of the Kansas Three Percent Security Force plotted to commit mass murder of Muslims and people of Somali descent in Garden City, Kansas.

At the same time, some antigovernment groups grew closer to hate groups. In 2017, Oath Keepers were asked by the anti-Muslim Act for America to provide security at June 10 rallies that took place in 28 cities across the country. Oath Keepers founder and president, Stewart Rhodes, responded by putting out a “call to action” endorsing the events and asking his followers to go and “protect free speech.” Rhodes and a gathering of Oath Keepers attended one of the events in Dallas, Texas, with long guns and tactical gear; other Oath Keepers appeared at many rallies around the country.



Antigovernment patriot groups from 1996-2017.

Historically, the SPLC has found that antigovernment activity and membership has risen sharply when Democrats take the presidency, as fears of gun grabs and federal action against such groups surges, and decline during Republican administrations, when such fears abate. That doesn’t seem to be the case with Trump in the White House, as the movement appears to be growing instead of shrinking, or at least treading water. Perhaps Trump’s radical views and bigotry are having an energizing effect on antigovernment groups, drawing them into politics in the same way that he has emboldened white supremacists and others in the hate movement. Their growing collaboration with anti-Muslim groups in particular shows that their concerns have moved far beyond guns in the past years.\

Listing here (below) does not imply that the groups themselves advocate or engage in violence or other criminal activities, or are racist. The list was compiled from field reports, group publications, the Internet, law enforcement sources and news reports. Groups are identified by the city, county or region where they are located.
