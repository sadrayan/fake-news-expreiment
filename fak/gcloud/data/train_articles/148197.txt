The Return of Geopolitics
So far, the year 2014 has been a tumultuous one, as geopolitical rivalries have stormed back to center stage.

A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY

When the Cold War ended, many Americans and Europeans seemed to think that the most vexing geopolitical questions had largely been settled. With the exception of a handful of relatively minor problems, such
