Why is Charlie Crist bragging about Cover Florida?
A success rate of less than a tenth of a percent might not sound like much, but to Gov. Charlie Crist it's campaign-trail bragging material for healthcare reform.

Crist's new Cover Florida healthcare proposal has signed up only 3,757 people in a state with nearly four million uninsured. Meantime, an estimated 77,250 Floridians have lost health-insurance coverage since Cover Florida began releasing statistics in March.

Yet Crist touts Cover Florida as a ``national model'' and as a private-sector alternative to the government-run insurance plans of congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama.
