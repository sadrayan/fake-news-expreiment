Obama To Force Congress To Let Him Run For An Illegal 3rd Term In 2016
According to recent reports, it appears that one college professor has been toting an absurd solution for “fixing” our nation’s problems: voting President Obama into a third term.

While most of us shudder at the thought, Jonathan Zimmerman, a history professor at New York University, recently wrote an article for The Washington Post, in which he suggested that the U.S. government allow Obama to serve for a third term.

According to Zimmerman, who even addresses Obama’s 37 percent approval rating, Obama would be more effective at governing if he was allowed to run in the 2016 election. Zimmerman argued that this action would make the current President “less likely to ignore the will of the American people.”

“It’s time to put that power back where it belongs,” Zimmerman wrote in his article. “Barack Obama should be allowed to stand for reelection just as citizens should be allowed to vote for—or against—him. Anything less diminishes our leaders and ourselves.”

What do you think? Are Zimmerman’s comments completely absurd?
