We have state-specific results for a variety of measures from the 2015 National Electronic Health Records Survey.

You can see these—including data specifically about Texas—here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db261.pdf.

We also have Texas data for some other measures that may be of interest to you: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/stats_of_the_states.htm

There is currently no analyzed Texas data readily available this evening for the percent of primary care physicians accepting new patients. We can research if there could be some available in the coming days and weeks, though in your original inquiry at the bottom of this string, your deadline of March 30, 2017, has passed. Please advise what your new deadline is.

In this list of tables, it details the types of physicians included in the survey and the states that were sampled https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ahcd/nehrs/2015_nehrs_web_table.pdf. I’ve extracted some of this here for your convenience:

“…2015 National Electronic Health Records Survey (NEHRS). NEHRS, which is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics and sponsored by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, is a nationally representative mixed mode survey of office-based physicians that collects information on physician and practice characteristics, including the adoption and use of EHR systems. NEHRS sampling design allows for both national and state-based estimates of EHR adoption. NEHRS is conducted annually as a sample survey of nonfederal office-based patient care physicians, excluding anesthesiologists, radiologists, and pathologists.

The 2015 NEHRS sample consisted of 10,302 office-based physicians.”

Regarding your question on wanting to know who was surveyed and when, that data is protected by law.

We do not provide identifiable information here at NCHS. Our vital statistics data are subject to all appropriate provisions of the Privacy Act and Section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act, which protects confidentiality. Our survey data are protected by those two laws as well as the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, or "CIPSEA", which refers to Title V of the E-Government Act of 2002, Public Law 107-347. CIPSEA is one of three confidentiality laws that apply to NCHS data.
