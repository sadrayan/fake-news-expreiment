Trump in denial about his own debt comments

"You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt." — Hillary Clinton

"Wrong." — Donald Trump

Trump is wrong here. Earlier this year he suggested that: “I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal."

He has since tried to clarify his position, saying he would not ask the nation’s creditors to accept less than they were owed.
