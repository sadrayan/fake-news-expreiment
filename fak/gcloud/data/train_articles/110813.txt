Senator calls for changes to eyewear regulations
Washington, DC—U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) recently called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to change regulations on eyeglasses prescriptions to promote competition in the eyecare industry and lower prices on eyewear.

Schumer cites $300 as the average price for glasses and says the average American is now struggling to afford the price. He says current regulations limit competition because they do not require eyecare providers (ECPs) to provide complete prescriptions to patients or to verify prescription information to third-party dispensers and that this omission can limit consumer choice and lead to higher prices. Schumer believes that consumers should have the ability to shop around in search of a more affordable price and not be limited to the eyeglasses offered in the store where they get their eye exam.

“Eyeglasses are a necessity for millions of Americans, yet sky-high prices are making them unaffordable,” he says. “We need more oversight when it comes to the cost of eyeglasses, and one way to do that is to require patients get their full prescriptions so they can shop around in stores and online for the best deal. Consumers need more options when it comes to eyeglasses and that's why the FTC should update the 'Eyeglass Rule' in a way that helps spur competition and dramatically lower prices.”
