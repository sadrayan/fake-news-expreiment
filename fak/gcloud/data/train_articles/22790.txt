Georgia Official and Statistical Register
The Georgia Official and Statistical Register was published from 1923-1990 by the Georgia Archives. Considered an important reference work for historical research, the Register covers Georgiaâ€™s executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, providing biographical sketches of elected and other state officials. Georgia members of U.S. Congress and federal judges are included, as are county officials and regents of the university system. The Register contains election returns, provides basic reference data on Georgia counties, and covers Georgia miscellany, such as the state flag, state flower, state song, rosters of Georgia governors, and legal holidays.

The Georgia Official and Statistical Register site is a project of the Digital Library of Georgia as a part of the Georgia Government Publications program.

Plug-in Requirements

The Register is available in JPG, PDF and DjVu versions.

The JPG versions can be viewed in any Web browser and do not require a plug-in. They do not allow you to search within a page or zoom in on a page image.

The DjVu versions are recommended for Web browsing, providing better image quality than the JPG and faster download speed than the PDF version. The DjVu files require a DjVu browser plug-in or a stand alone viewer.

PDF versions are available for download, though these files are too large for optimal Web browsing for lower-bandwidth users. To view the PDF files you will need Adobe Reader 7.0 or higher. The files are readable in Adobe Reader 6, but they do not display properly.
