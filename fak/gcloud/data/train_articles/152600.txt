Attention: Pedo Symbology in Child Adoption Agencies. Clinton email connections to Haiti, possible leads to child trafficking : pizzagate
PART 1

Clinton email: 10620 https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/10620

-Battle over orphans: Gov. Rendell (Pa) and co. vs Buchannan and co.

Let’s begin at the source. Clinton email 10620 is not an indexed email, you have to enter the email ID to find it. I was looking at a few Haiti related emails and I tried entering a few numbers sequentially and came up with this.

It is an interesting email on its own and it is quite lengthy. I’ll try my best to summarize the key points.

The email is date February 19th 2010 detaining events occurring after the January earthquake. It involves Haitian orphans and a chaotic tug of war between two different missions looking to bring the children to the United States.

12 BRESMA children at embassy (Haiti).

Only 2 on official orphan list (they are listed as “waiting children”)

10 children are not listed at all.

(From what I can gather, there are 54 children in total that US citizens/officials are trying to extract from Haiti and bring to Pennsylvania.)

Governor’s office believed all these children were “in the adoption pipeline” before the earthquake.

USCIS found info on only 2 children.

Early efforts to transport the 54 Haitian orphans to Pittsburgh have devolved into a competition with political undertones.

Mary B. Buchannan (former US attorney / congressional hopeful GOP) opened a bid to extract the children from BRESMA orphanage in PaP (Port au Prince)…organized supplies and an airplane.

Leslis M McCombs a consultant for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center got a list of the children…was involved with helping ship medical supplies as part of Buchannan’s effort on plane carrying Gov. Ed Rendell (PA) and Mr. Altmire (congressional encumbent DEM).

(The story is chaotic and confusing, but the main point is that there was an effort to get the children out of Haiti as quickly as possible, but there were problems with paper work and legalities and at the same time became a competition between Buchannan’s side and McCombs side as to who would get credit for the ‘rescue mission’). At some point Buchannan enlists the help of Diana Boni who is in charge of Haitian adoptions for Kentucky Adoption Services with links to All Blessing International (see below).

Buchannan, Boni and Valarie May (immigration lawyer) come up with a 3 point list

1) BRESMA Children close to final adoption

2) Those with prospective parents but in early stages

3) Children with no current prospects

They need legal clearance to ‘remove the children’ and through diplomatic networking a US customs port director relays that his supervisor has given the go ahead to grant “humanitarian parole” (see links at the bottom of the page) a rare exemption in the law.

Clinton Email: 30201 Per: Governor Rendell

https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/30201

A sort of custody battle between the different parties ensues. Clinton staffer Cheryl Mills is notified of the situation as it unfolds and, well, it’s a giant mess.

This story could be a scandal on its own and as Cheryl Mills states in her response – “No heat yet today” – using children as political pawns and seem more concerned about the good press they’re going to receive than the welfare of these children. It’s disgusting.

Here’s how the NYT describe the chaos of US adoptions:

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/world/americas/04adoption.html

NYT Excerpts – Under a sparingly used immigration program, called humanitarian parole, adoptions were expedited regardless of whether children were in peril, and without the screening required to make sure they had not been improperly separated from their relatives or placed in homes that could not adequately care for them.

https://www.uscis.gov/archive/haitian-child-paroled-under-special-circumstances

(a sparingly used immigration program) The results are playing out across the country. At least 12 children, brought here without being formally matched with new families, have spent months in a Pennsylvania juvenile care center while Red Cross officials try to determine their fate. An unknown number of children whose prospective parents have backed out of their adoptions are in foster care. While the authorities said they knew of only a handful of such cases, adoption agents said they had heard about as many as 20, including that of an 8-year-old girl who was bounced from an orphanage in Haiti to a home in Ithaca, N.Y., to a juvenile care center in Queens after the psychologist who had petitioned to adopt her decided she could not raise a young child. “We did something so fast,” Ms. Reitz said at a conference in New York in March. “We did something that normally takes a couple of years and that we normally do with excruciating care and delay. There’s so much time for deliberation in the way the program normally goes, and we condensed all that into a matter of days.” There is no evidence to suggest that the evacuations were driven by anything other than the best of intentions. And with untold numbers of unaccompanied children in Haiti, the hemisphere’s poorest country, left fending for themselves or languishing in institutions, it is not hard to make the case that those who were evacuated are better off than they would have been in Haiti. Even though the humanitarian parole program has officially ended, it remains a source of tensions between American-run orphanages in Haiti and international child protection organizations. The advocates, led by Unicef, have refused to place children who have lost their parents or been separated from them in some foreign-run orphanages, fearing they would be improperly put into the adoption pipeline before they had the chance to be reunited with surviving relatives.

And the pro-adoption groups, led by the Joint Council on International Children’s Services, accuse the advocates of using endless, often unsuccessful, attempts to locate the children’s biological relatives to deny tens of thousands of needy Haitian orphans the opportunity to be placed in loving homes.

PART 2

However, I decided to dig a little deeper into BRESMA the adoption agency. And this is what I found.

BRESMA Adoption Agency is listed on Adoption.com have a look at the company’s triple heart logo. Not a smoking gun but still a little bit concerning considering the Pedo symbology we’ve all come to know from Podesta and Alefantis.

Here’s a recent July 2016 post from BRESMA in Haiti

Reference to 2014, Haiti became a participatory to the Hague convention on intercountry adoption

I did some more searching of mainly international adoption agencies and I came up with this

Here, they state that they’re not currently active in Haiti

https://sli.mg/FAvXiW You need to register to see ‘waiting children’

https://sli.mg/F5MUQi

There’s More - An Open Door Adoption Agency – This one is the most disturbing in my opinion. Look closely at the girl’s jacket and she has a super creepy look on her face.

After seeing this picture the name of the agency also started to bother me.

An Open Door Adoption Agency

Girl’s jacket (Monarch Butterfly Symbol)

Probably the most disturbing find

Mission statement (Walter Gilbert)

This is a list of almost 20 more possible pedo symbols related to adoption agencies.

HUGE DISCLAIMER HERE – I’m not suggesting that all of these agencies are linked to child trafficking or pedophilia, or any of them for that matter! I have been sitting on these finds for a few days because the thought of wrongfully pointing the finger at agencies that may be doing amazing things in this world was very heavy on my heart. Especially since I have worked with several NGOs related orphanages and childcare. However, considering the current state of affairs, the mounting evidence of powerful international pedo-rings, the CF preying on Haiti and enriching themselves off the backs of the very poor I believe we must investigate because this shit runs DEEP.

Some of the Agencies (eg. America World Adoption) listed above have a connection to the now defunct: Joint Council on International Children's Services (JCICS). Please see -

http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/74784

The copy of an internal Stake holders initiative dated 2009 JCICS was leaked to this website. Here is the pdf from the Joint Council

http://poundpuplegacy.org/files/JCICS%20-%20Stakeholder%20initiative.pdf

Some key findings of the report: The second issue addressed is even more interesting. JCICS, as a trade association of adoption service providers has a credibility problem. The document states: Joint Council is seen by many public policy makers, the press, NGOs and the public as:

Serving the self-interest of Adoption Service Providers

Not having Adoption Service Providers of the highest quality, ethics or standards

Having an inherent conflict of interest

Protecting individual Adoption Service Providers

A trade organization, rather than an objective advocate

A TRADE ORGANIZATION???

Adoption agency inside Second Life! Never Be Solo Adoption Agency.

https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=Mzi77J (Duckduckgo search results)

https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=Of2U27 (Teleport into second life)

This is weird – I think it’s common knowledge that there are pedo-rings throughout Second Life. I connected to the link and I was teleported to a courtyard with a group of people standing around. I was immediately greeted by a female avatar. She asked me what I was looking for and I avoided the question for a while and ran around but there was nothing in the area. Eventually I told her I was looking for and adoption agency. She disappeared and teleported to the agency. There was a wall with pictures (animated photos) of children and teens for ‘adoption’. They had some prices listed and the one that led me their answered my questions. I was FREAKED out. She told me I should interview the one I liked. I played dumb and asked a few questions. You need to pay a fee to join the club but I lost it and logout of the game. It was too much for me to handle. I took a ton of screen shots but I don’t think it’s a good idea to post them. Maybe someone has the nerve to check it out. It is probably avatar-pedo shit but I didn’t want to find out.

PART 3

What did I just see/read??

There is a lot to take in here. There are many leads to follow: heads of organizations, connections from Haiti to adoption agencies, why the JCICS went bankrupt, finding more solid connections, identifying agencies that are involved in child trafficking, direct ties to CF and affiliates…I plan on posting more. I hope you can help!

What I hope to establish here is that there is a trail of evidence suggesting that children, orphans of the poorest nations, the most vulnerable citizens imaginable are being preyed upon and fed into the ‘adoption pipeline’.

They are often sold to or given to orphanages by their own families

The orphanages often starve the children so they look more needy and when they receive the donations that money goes to the families of corrupt directors

They are abused in these institutions

They are taken by foreign adoption agencies with a promise of a better life

They are often re-institutionalized, where they are abused again

Some disappear

Some end up in the hands of the most sadistic

EDIT: I just want to reiterate that I am NOT accusing any organization here of any crimes. I do see that adoption agencies could be an ideal vehicle to traffic children for a criminal enterprise.

I KNOW from personal experience that many orphanages/agencies do fantastic work.
