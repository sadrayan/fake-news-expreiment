Now Trump Supporters Are Boycotting Star Wars Based on No Evidence
The alt-right doesn't really understand the concept of protesting. First, they spent a lot of money at Starbucks...to protest Starbucks. Then, they boycotted Hamilton (because hey, let's boycott the things that are ultra expensive, right?). And now, they're dumping Rogue One (which hits theaters later this month) with the hashtag #DumpStarWars, because of (oh, hey, shocker) fake news.

Twitter user Jack Posobiec, who's allegedly the "special projects director" for a group called Citizens for Trump, tweeted claiming that the writers of Rogue One rewrote and reshot the film to "add in Anti Trump [sic] scenes calling him a racist."

"I started [the hashtag] this morning with a Periscope in response to the writers of Rogue One calling Trump a Nazi," Posobiec told Esquire Thursday evening, adding that he was previously a "big time" Star Wars fan and was "really excited" to see Rogue One.

Of course, a Disney representative told TheWrap that this claim is entirely untrue, but that didn't stop Posobiec from starting a Star Wars boycott with a tweetstorm:

Here's the truth: Rogue One certainly underwent reshoots. Also, when Trump won the election, the screenwriters tweeted what could be interpreted as anti-Trump messages, including that "the Empire is a white supremacist [human] organization". When Esquire spoke to Posobiec, he used this tweet to say that the writers called Trump a Nazi. However, there's no evidence that the changes had to do with any political ideologies whatsoever, and films undergo massive changes all the time.

"I haven't seen the movie yet, but if the writers are so virulently anti-Trump, I would be surprised to not find that bias embedded in the film," Posobiec told Esquire.

Though this is purely based in conjecture, facts haven't stopped the alt-right from loudly shouting that they'll boycott the entire series:

But other Star Wars fans say, hey, good riddance!

White supremacists Trump supporters may #DumpStarWars, but the majority of the country have already shown that we prefer a female lead. â€” Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) December 9, 2016

So, the same people mad at Star Wars for being political don't mind THE PRESIDENT staying on to produce Celebrity Apprentice?#DumpStarWars â€” Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) December 9, 2016
