[Page H7748] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] FUNDING TO REBUILD AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, Katrina breaks my heart. When I consider its tragic aftermath, the ancient parable comes to mind: ``And the rains descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash.'' For most American families, when a tree falls on your house, you tend to the wounded, rebuild, and then figure out how you are going to pay for it. Later today Congress will continue funding the work of relief and recovery for Hurricane Katrina, and well we should, by speeding more than $50 billion to FEMA and other agencies. But as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do in like circumstances and expects this Congress to do: let us figure out how we are going to pay for it. Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren. ____________________
