Subject: Urgent inquiry for a fact check

Hello again. I just left a voice mail because we’re checking a claim, included here, by Baker Harrell of It’s Time Texas: “Seventy percent of all Texans are overweight or obese.”

Harrell told me today this figure traces to 2009 survey results posted by DSHS. Does that hold up? Is there more recent survey data available? If this figure does hold, has the agency or state analyzed why it’s so?

I would benefit here from an email or phone interview about the relevant surveys.

I also hope to complete our look into this claim today.

My assumption is those data come from our Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a telephone survey of adults we do annually. Our most recent published data are from 2014 and show 67.8 percent of adults surveyed were overweight or obese, according to their self-reported height and weight.

2013: 66.2%

2012: 65.1%

2011: 65.8%

We also conduct the Texas Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a classroom survey of high school students done in alternate years. The 2013 data show 31.3 percent of high school students surveyed were overweight or obese.

I’ve attached the 2014 BRFSS results.

How about children before high school?

The School Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey is a good data set.
