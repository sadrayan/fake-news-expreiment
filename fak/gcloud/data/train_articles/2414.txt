Marco Rubio's economic plan: Tax cuts and more tax cuts
, who as House speaker published a book of 100 ideas that became a road map for the state Legislature, unveiled a new set of ideas Tuesday that he said he wants to take to the U.S. Senate. Rubio unveiled 23 ideas to improve the nation's economy and to address the impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in front of three dozen supporters at a seafood restaurant in Tampa.

Many of the ideas mimic the tax and economic policies of most Republicans â€” from making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush permanent, to ending the inheritance tax, plus opposing any new energy tax or the creation of a value-added tax. Other ideas, like creating a sales tax holiday for areas affected by the oil spill and offering affected property owners property tax relief, appear to be state issues, not federal ones.

Rubio promised to unveil more ideas during the campaign. "Some of these ideas will be so straightforward it's amazing that Washington has refused to do them," Rubio said. "And some will be controversial because politicians believe they aren't convenient to winning an election." (Story here)
