Subject: Texas reporter, inquiry for a PolitiFact Texas fact check

Hello from Austin. I write seeking more information (the original basis of) this portion of your story here stating: “Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states.”

Thank you for quick help if possible.
