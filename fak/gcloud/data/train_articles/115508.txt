This map shows how divided the United Kingdom is right now
The United Kingdom right now is a tale of two countries.

The UK voted to leave the European Union on Thursday by a final vote of 51.9% to 48.1%.

The map below shows how the vote swung in each region of the country â€” you could almost rip the nation in half.

Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as London and other major cities in England had Remain majorities. Leave won the majority of votes in Wales and England.

The historic decision to leave the EU has led to chaos in global markets and the resignation of UK Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday morning.

It's too late now if you didn't hedge your bet on the dollar.
