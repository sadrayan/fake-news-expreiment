The Concord Coalition, founded in 1992, is a non-partisan organization that advocates putting the national debt on a sustainable course and protecting future generations.

Concordâ€™s founders believed, like the Minutemen at Concord, that we have a moral obligation to leave the country better off for our children and grandchildren. Our founding co-chairs were former U.S. senators Paul E. Tsongas (D-Mass.) and Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.). Former U.S. commerce secretary Peter G. Peterson was the founding president.

Our current Board of Directors and regional advisory groups include former members of Congress and state legislatures, recognized experts on the federal budget, and business and civic leaders.
