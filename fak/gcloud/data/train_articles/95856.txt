Obama signed a House bill that reforms the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act of 2012 – the law intended to help the National Flood Insurance Program get out of debt.

The bill, Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, was signed by Obama Friday, making it law.

The legislation was crafted by Congressman Bill Cassidy and Rep. Michael Grimm of New York. The focus was to provide long-term flood insurance relief for Louisiana families, Cassidy's office said in a news release.

“Today is a great day for Louisiana. The Grimm-Cassidy flood insurance reforms will reinstate grandfathered rates, cap premium increases, reform the FEMA flood mapping process and help stabilize our housing market," Cassidy said. "Today’s signing was made possible due to the broad coalition we built to push the House, Senate and President to back the legislation.”

With the president’s signature, 5.5 million Americans including over 200,000 in Louisiana, will begin to see relief from soaring premiums, according to Rep. Cedric Richmond.

“My colleagues and I heard your calls for reform and immediately got to work on a bipartisan solution and after a long journey we passed significant legislation that will ease the burden of rising flood insurance premiums. This legislation is an example of what we can accomplish when we work together on behalf of the American people,” he said in a news release.

The law includes affordability protections for homeowners that prevent “year-over-year skyrocketing rate hikes for homeowners and an affordability target that strives to keep flood insurance rates at under one percent of a property’s total coverage,” Sen. Mary Landrieu said in a news release.

"It has been a long and arduous two-year battle to reach today. But by building a coalition of individuals, businesses groups and local leaders, we are now closer in our ongoing efforts to provide affordable, accessible and sustainable flood insurance to middle class American families,” she said. “But our work is not done. Nothing is perfect. Nothing is permanent. We must continue our efforts to craft an affordable flood program that works decade after decade so generation after generation can continue to affordably and safely live along our coasts and inland waterways where they work to power our nation’s economy.”

Landrieu said the new law includes the following:

Affordability

* An annual individual property rate cap (18 percent) that will prevent skyrocketing, year-over-year rate increases for homeowners.

* FEMA must strive to keep flood insurance policies under one percent of a property’s total coverage and report when it is unable to do so while Congress works toward a long-term solution.

* FEMA must review and report how new rates and surcharges are affecting small businesses, churches and nonprofits within 18 months.

Accurate Maps

* Language requiring that FEMA’s flood maps are accurate and reliable, along with improved coordination and cooperation with communities during the mapping process.

* Provide funding to reimburse individuals and communities that successfully appeal their FEMA flood map.

* Ensures communities get credit for local levees and non-structural mitigation features in new FEMA flood maps.

Other

* Providing homeowners, especially in dense urban areas living in row homes, more commonsense options to mitigate flooding.
