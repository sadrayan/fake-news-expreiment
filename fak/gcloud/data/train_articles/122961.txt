John Ashe, Ex-Diplomat Accused in U.N. Corruption Case, Dies at 61
UNITED NATIONS — John W. Ashe, a former senior United Nations diplomat who was accused in a major corruption scheme last year, has died, his lawyer said Wednesday evening.

Mr. Ashe, 61, was a veteran diplomat from Antigua. He was elected president of the General Assembly and served from September 2013 until the next September. In that time, United States prosecutors said, he was part of a bribery scheme that involved more than $1 million in payments from sources in China for assistance in real estate deals and other business interests.

He died at home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., on Wednesday afternoon, according to his lawyer, Jeremy Schneider. United Nations officials said the cause of death was a heart attack.

Mr. Ashe was accused of accepting payments from a real estate developer from Macau, Ng Lap Seng, to splurge on luxuries: hand-tailored suits, Rolex watches and a $40,000 lease on a new BMW X5. In one instance, federal prosecutors said in their criminal complaint, $200,000 was wired to Mr. Ashe’s private account. In return, he took a trip in his official capacity to discuss a conference center that Mr. Ng wanted to develop. The charges remained pending.
