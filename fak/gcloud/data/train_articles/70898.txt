Take a virtual tour of Pacific Park Brooklyn’s 8 acres of open space via Google Cardboard. TAKE THE TOUR

Welcome to Pacific Park, Brooklyn’s next great neighborhood. Conceived by the world-renowned architect Frank Gehry, Pacific Park offers all New Yorkers the chance to live in a brand new community at the heart of everything that makes Brooklyn great.

At the center of Pacific Park is a new park designed by landscape architect Thomas Balsley. Stretching across two city blocks, this 8-acre park has something for everyone—sloping lawns for picnics and sunbathing, a public promenade, children’s play areas, a dog run, and athletic spaces—right at the nexus of Brooklyn’s most vibrant neighborhoods.

Pacific Park will also include all of the amenities that we expect from a modern urban community, with office space to support a true live/work experience, world class retail featuring neighborhood amenities, shopping and restaurant spaces that Brooklyn is famous for, and even a brand new public school.
