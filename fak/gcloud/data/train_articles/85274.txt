State Renewable Portfolio Standards and Goals
States have been very active in the past year revising their Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), which requires that a specified percentage of the electricity that utilities sell comes from renewable resources. States have created these standards to diversify their energy resources, promote domestic energy production and encourage economic development. Renewable energy policies help drive the nation’s $64 billion market for wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. These policies can play an integral role in state efforts to diversify their energy mix, promote economic development and reduce emissions. Roughly half of the growth in U.S. renewable energy generation since 2000 can be attributed to state renewable energy requirements.

Iowa was the first state to establish an RPS and since then, more than half of states have established renewable energy targets. Twenty-nine states, Washington, D.C., and three territories have adopted an RPS, while eight states and one territory have set renewable energy goals.

State renewable portfolio standard policies vary widely on several elements including RPS targets, the entities they include, the resources eligible to meet requirements and cost caps. In many states, standards are measured by the percentage of retail electric sales. Iowa and Texas, however, require specific amounts of renewable energy capacity rather than percentages and Kansas requires a percentage of peak demand. while most state targets are between 10 and 45 percent, seven states—California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Vermont, and Washington, D.C.—have requirements of 50 percent or greater. RPS requirements can apply only to investor-owned utilities (IOUs), although many states also include municipalities and electric cooperatives (Munis and Co-ops), sometimes with a lower target. Utilities that are subject to these mandates must obtain renewable energy credits or certificates ( RECs )—which represent the environmental benefits of one megawatt-hour of renewable energy generation. RECs are created when renewable energy is sent out to the grid and are used to verify that utilities are meeting their targets. Eligible resources for RPS compliance include wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and some hydroelectric facilities—depending on the size and vintage. Several states also include additional resources such as landfill gas, tidal energy, combined heat and power, and even energy efficiency. According to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 20 states and Washington, D.C., have cost caps in their RPS policies to limit increases to a certain percentage of ratepayers’ bills. One state caps RPS gross procurement costs.

To promote a diversified resource mix and encourage deployment of certain technologies, states have established carve-outs and renewable energy credit multipliers within their RPSs for specific energy technologies, such as offshore wind or rooftop solar. Carve-outs require a certain percentage of the overall renewable energy requirement to be met with a specific technology, while credit multipliers award additional renewable energy credits for electricity produced by certain technologies. At least 21 states and Washington, D.C., have credit multipliers, carve-outs, or both for certain energy technologies in their RPS policies.

In recent years, the role of RPS policies has diminished, accounting for only 34 percent of renewable energy capacity additions in 2017. Although RPS policies are still important to encouraging deployment of renewables, other factors, including declining renewable energy costs and other state energy policies, such as net metering, are also driving growth. As renewable energy becomes increasingly competitive, some states are considering whether RPS policies are still needed to drive growth. In 2017, at least three states—Maryland, Montana and New Hampshire—enacted legislation to study the costs and benefits of their RPS policies.
