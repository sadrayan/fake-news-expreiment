Box office numbers fared well this past week, pulling in $18,593,843 in ticket sales, down somewhat from the previous reporting period of $18,725,752. Both outshined the same week last season of $18,416,615. Overall, this season's ticket sales have totaled $190,209,610 compared to last season's $193,180,779 at the same point. Despite last fall's strike on Broadway, there is only a 1.5 percent difference in box office gross receipts.

There are currently just 27 productions on the Way including one special entitled Cirque Dreams: Jungle Fantasy at the Broadway Theatre, four plays, and 22 musicals. "Cirque" saw its audience wane a bit, dropping $46,808 in revenue from the previous week. Of the four plays, August: Osage County at the Music Box and Boeing-Boeing at the Longacre continue to hold the lead in ticket sales. The six million-dollar leaders among the musicals were Wicked at the Gershwin Theatre, The Lion King at the Minskoff, The Little Mermaid at the Lunt-Fontanne, Mamma Mia! at the Winter Garden, Jersey Boys at the August Wilson and In the Heights at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. Ten productions saw 95 percent or better attendance, though none of them plays.

Once again, [title of show] at the Lyceum presents the "Best Bargain" at $44,70 Average Paid Admission while Jersey Boys continues to enjoy the highest Average Paid Admission at $114 and the Top Ticket at $350.

Gypsy at the St. James saw the biggest drop monetarily, $54,533, a loss of 5.6 percent attendance, but Cirque Dreams saw the biggest drop in percentage at 7.2 percent. Fans of Xanadu, playing at the Hayes Theater, came out in full force as musical saw the greatest increase in revenue and attendance at $75,157 and 13 percent, respectively. As usual, none of the figures include Young Frankenstein playing at the Hilton Theatre.
