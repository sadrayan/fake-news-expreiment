Adam Gadahn: Al Qaeda terrorist, California native and grandson of a Jew
Friends say Gadahn fell under the spell of Diab, an accountant who lived in the Little Gaza section of Anaheim. Diab was a follower of Omar Abdel Rahman, known as the "blind sheikh," who is serving life in prison for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Gadahn and Diab shared extremist views and considered leaders of the Islamic Center who worked with Christians and Jews "infidels," the center's president told the Los Angeles Times in 2006.
