Education Dept. Won't Be Abolished : Reagan Backs Down, Citing Little Support for Killing Agency
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan, citing little congressional support, will not recommend closing down the Education Department, a major goal when he took office in 1981, it was revealed today.

"I have no intention of recommending the abolition of the department to the Congress at this time," Reagan said in a letter to Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.

Reagan said: "As you know, I have previously recommended the abolition of the Department of Education.

"This was because I believed that federal educational programs could be administered effectively without a Cabinet-level agency. While I still feel that this is the best approach, that proposal has received very little support in the Congress."

Questions Answered

Reagan's letter, released today by Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.), was sent to answer questions about the Administration's position on the department during hearings Monday on the nomination of William J. Bennett to become the new secretary.
