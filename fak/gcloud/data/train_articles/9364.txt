Donald Trump drops first anti-Marco Rubio TV ad in Florida
@PatriciaMazzei

Donald Trump slams Marco Rubio as "corrupt" in a brutal new TV ad, the first one by the Republican front-runner attacking the senator in his home state.

"Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is a dishonest person," Trump said in a statement accompanying the ad's release. "He has cheated with credit cards, and does favors for lobbyists. In my opinion, he is a total crook and I am doing the people of Florida a great favor by further exposing him."

Here's the minute-long ad, titled "Corrupt Marco Rubio":

Rubio's campaign responded with a lengthy, point-by-point rebuttal that accused Trump of sounding like Rubio's one-time U.S. Senate rival in Florida, Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist.

"First, Donald Trump gave big bucks to Charlie Crist in 2010 and now he's recycling the same false and negative attacks about Marco," Rubio spokesman Joe Pounder said in a statement. "Charlie Crist's and Donald Trump's con didn't fool Floridians in 2010 and it won’t fool them now. These attacks didn’t even stop Trump himself from saying Mitt Romney should pick Marco as his vice president just two years later."
