Donald Trump says climate change is a 'hoax' but tries to protect his Irish real-estate from its impact
But behind closed doors he is using the case for climate change to argue that he needs to protect his real estate, legal documents show.

Mr Trump bought the golf resort in County Clare, Ireland in February 2014, promising invest up to €45 million (£35 million) in the property. He said he would "make it one of the greatest golf courses in the world".

But before he could even close the deal a single storm eroded as much as eight metres of valuable golfing terrain.
