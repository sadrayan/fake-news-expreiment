In Texas the gross income cutoff for most households for SNAP eligibility is 165% of the Federal Poverty Level, which is equal to $19,608/yr for a household of 1 or $33,264/yr for a family of 3. So yes, a minimum wage worker in Texas would qualify for SNAP, even if they didnâ€™t have dependents. How much they would get in SNAP benefits would vary widely according to their expenses.
