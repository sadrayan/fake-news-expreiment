Tucker Carlson debated Kathy Sheehan (D), the mayor of Albany, N.Y., over the legitimacy of her municipality being a sanctuary city.

Carlson laid out statistics that showed that almost every arrested member of the dangerous gang MS-13 is an illegal immigrant.

"Isn't that all the proof we need that immigration policy has a direct effect on crime?" he asked.

Sheehan said it is helpful to have federal law enforcement assist localities like New York State's capital, but that she will not order her police to go around "checking papers."

"A sanctuary city by definition offers sanctuary to people here illegally," Carlson said.

Sheehan said that such a name does not mean Albany is "hiding undocumented immigrants in the basement of city hall."

Carlson asked whether she would allow bank robbers and kidnappers to have sanctuary in Albany.

"Being here without documentation isn't a crime," Sheehan said, to which Carlson disagreed.

She said that Albany is using its Tenth Amendment protections against being forced by the feds to do things not delineated in the Constitution.

"The truth is that this is political," Carlson responded. "It's hard to take a lecture from you about the Constitution."
