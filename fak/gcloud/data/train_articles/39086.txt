The Grants Management Modernization Program
The Grants Management Modernization (GMM) Program, is a FEMA-wide initiative that began in 2015 to modernize and consolidate existing FEMA grants management systems and business processes into one single IT Platform and one common grants management life cycle to better support the agency’s mission.



The new IT Platform (also known as FEMA Grants Outcomes, or FEMA GO) is targeted towards the entire grants community of users, which include FEMA personnel and grant recipients/sub-recipients across States, Local Governments, Tribal and Territorial partners.

GMM’s development approach uses Agile methodology, a type of project management process where software demands and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort between development teams and FEMA grant recipients.

The Grants Management Life Cycle consists of program management and business intelligence. There are five phases in the life cycle, including pre-award, award, post-award, closeout, and post-closeout. Download Original
