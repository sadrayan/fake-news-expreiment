Current activities

Peter is the Scientific Strategic Head for the Climate Monitoring and Attribution areas. He leads the development of the scientific research for developing a better observational evidence base for responding to climate variability and change and and for improving our understanding of the causes of observed changes. The group is responsible for developing observational data sets for monitoring, including the HadCRUT global surface temperature series, and for enabling the better use of observations to improve the skill of climate forecasts through better model initialisation, and through better understanding of current model deficiencies to improve the representation of processes in models.

His personal research interests include the development of attribution to regional scales and to the analysis of extremes and the use of past changes to infer observational constraints on future changes. He is interested in the development of operational systems for attributing the causes of extreme weather events in near-real time by calculating the odds of such events and how they have changed as a result of different factors. Better information of this sort could help to better inform adaptation strategies and help avoid "misattribution" whereby people can be over-eager to blame an extreme weather event on either climate change or natural weather fluctuations. An important component of future research will be incorporating better process understanding into attribution analyses.

He is a co-editor of the annual report in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society which explains previous extreme weather and climate events of the previous year from a climate perspective.

Career background

Peter joined the Met Office Hadley Centre in 1996 to work on detection and attribution of past climate change. During that time he wrote many scientific papers, often in collaboration with colleagues from other institutes, and was involved in the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a Contributing Author. In 2006 he became Manager of the Understanding and Attributing Climate Change team and in 2008 became the Head of the Climate Monitoring and Attribution group. From 2004 he was heavily involved in the production of the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC as a Lead Author for both the Working Group 1 report on the Physical Science Basis and the Synthesis Report, which in addition covers impacts, adaptation and mitigation. He was Coordinating Lead Author for Chapter 10 (Detection and attribution of climate change: from global to regional) of the Working Group 1 of IPCC AR5.

He thinks it is important to communicate scientific findings about climate to the public and has given many media interviews, including on TV, radio and to many print journalists. He also appeared in documentaries for Channel 4 and National Geographic TV about Extreme Weather and Climate Change and has written articles for New Scientist, the Guardian and a Carbon Brief blog on recent floods.

Peter has a first degree in Mathematics from Durham University and completed Part III of the Mathematics Tripos at Cambridge University. The research for his PhD at Imperial College, London was atmospheric modelling of the environmental consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. After that he carried out post-doctoral research at Edinburgh University on stratospheric ozone depletion.
