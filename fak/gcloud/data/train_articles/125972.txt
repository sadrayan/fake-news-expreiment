FACT CHECK: Did Kurt Cobain Predict a Donald Trump Presidency in 1993?
On 30 July 2016, the pro-Donald Trump Facebook page “Trump Train” posted an image of the late Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain overlaid with a message ostensibly uttered by him in 1993 endorsing Donald Trump for president:

The “Trump Train” Facebook page didn’t provide any information about where Cobain allegedly made this prediction (e.g., in an interview, as part of a television appearance, during a concert) and noted only that it he supposedly uttered it sometime in 1993.
