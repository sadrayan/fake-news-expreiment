Email, Ted Eismeier, director of communications, American Council of Trustees and Alumni, Jan. 27, 2017

8:46 a.m.

My colleague Michael Poliakoff asked me to follow up with you directly as he will be unavailable in offsite meetings in another state all-day today.

ACTA does not have anything further to add to your fact-check of Judge Willettâ€™s comment, other than to again point back to the original findings in our No U.S. History report (https://www.goacta.org/publications/no_u.s._history), which looks at top private universities and liberal arts colleges, and our What Will They Learn? findings on the state of history requirements at 1,100 undergraduate programs across the U.S. (http://whatwilltheylearn.com/disciplines/history).

While there is a distinction between course requirements and the courses that students actually take, AHA is the best source of information about the percentage of students who are actually concentrating in U.S. history versus other subjects.

Please call if you have further questions.

Sincerely,

Ted Eismeier
