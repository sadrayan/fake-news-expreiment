Great Engineers - Biography of Elijah McCoy, Steam Engine Oil Cup Inventor
After Elijah earned his degree, he returned to Canada for about a year before he and his parents moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan. Because black people were not allowed to work as engineers, Elijah had to accept a job as a locomotive fireman and oiler. This job was very physically demanding, requiring him to shovel two tons of coal per hour into the locomotiveâ€™s fire box.

Another part of his job was to oil the parts of the steam engine that were constantly bombarded with steam, which was extremely corrosive to the metals the parts were made of. At first, oiling all the parts that needed it required the train to stop and for the oiler to use an oilcan to lubricate the moving parts. This was a cumbersome arrangement that delayed rail traffic and raised risk of a catastrophic failure of the steam engine.
