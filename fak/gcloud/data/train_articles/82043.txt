White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly on Thursday gave an emotional defense of Trump's calls to the families of soldiers killed earlier this month in Niger, and assailed a Democratic congresswoman who was among the president's chief critics.

Kelly said he was “stunned” and “broken hearted” to see a member of Congress, Rep. Frederica S. Wilson of Florida, describing Trump's conversation with the widow of Stg. La David T. Johnson, one of four U.S. soldiers who died in an Oct. 4 ambush in the West Africa country.

Wilson, a friend and mentor to the Johnson family, was with Myeshia Johnson in a car when the widow took Trump's call, and heard him on a speakerphone. Wilson later described Trump's message as insensitive for suggesting the sergeant knew what he was getting into when he joined the Army.
