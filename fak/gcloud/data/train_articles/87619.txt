What's Next for Steve Jobs and Apple?
When Steve Jobs and his team started working on the Mac back in the early 1980's, he had one major goal in mind: he wanted to reinvent the PC. As you may know, Eddie Roberts and Altair lay claim to the actual invention of the first personal computer in 1974, and two years later Jobs and Wozniak created the Apple 1. At that time, Jobs and Wozniak's goal wasn't to reinvent the Altair, but to create a PC for their own use. However, by the time Jobs began working on the Mac, the IBM PC had already become a major market leader. However, he thought that its approach was archaic, and its boxy design was inelegant.

So, with the Mac, his actual goal was to reinvent the PC by creating a new user interface (UI) and a complete re-design. I was sitting in the third row of the Foothill Community College auditorium when he showed us this funny looking device that he called the Mac. The graphical user interface (GUI) was unique and introduced a completely new way to interact with the PC. At the time though, I was only mildly impressed. But over time, the Mac and its GUI did help reinvent the PC, and it forced Microsoft away from DOS and to Windows, making this type of UI the standard.

Not long after the Mac was introduced, Jobs was pushed out of Apple, and he eventually created a new company called Next Computers. The name of his new company is a dead giveaway of what he had in mind. At the time, he was really angry at Apple, and on the surface, it looked like he was doing this to spite the company, or at least that's what the media made it look like.

In reality, when he created the first Mac, he compromised on his re-design concept, and with Next, he was actually using those ideas. Although Next Computers ultimately failed, the Next computer was just another "reinvention" of the PC.

When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he was determined to never let the IBM PC bypass Apple again. So he gave us the new all-in-one Macs that were available in eight colors. Then, he started to make the Mac OS better than any Windows version of a GUI that Microsoft could dream up. Not long after that, he created a new version of the all-in-one design that is still at the heart of the desktops Apple designs today. He also introduced a line of new laptops, including the MacBook Air, that continue to push the idea of what a laptop should look like. Jobs made industrial design and enhanced software part of Apple's trademark.

To really understand Jobs and Apple, one has to look at his past goals for reinventing products with the overall vision of making them better. He did not invent the PC. He did not even invent the GUI. But he reinvented them and ultimately made them major commercial successes. So Steve Jobs is not necessarily an inventor, in the classic sense of that term, and although Apple does invent new technologies, what it is really famous for is reinventing products.

MP3 players are another example of this. Jobs and his team did not invent MP3 players, but he reinvented them with the iPod, and now Apple owns about 70 percent of the MP3 player market. This gave him a new platform to create things like the iTunes store and radically change the music distribution business. He introduced a completely new concept in mobile entertainment with the iPod Touch, and he clearly reinvented the smartphone with the iPhone, which then gave him a platform for creating mobile apps and new forms of mobile commerce. And although the tablet form factor has been around for 20 years, the iPad reinvented the tablet and is on track to completely reshape the world of mobile computing.

I have followed Jobs' career for 30 years, and I am convinced he doesn't sit around and say, "What can I invent today." Rather, I believe he takes his eye for design and his desire to make things easy to use and says instead, "How can I apply this to things that are inelegant and hard to use." With that focus, he has changed the lives of millions of tech users. He constantly delivers devices that are extremely elegant and, in some cases, pushes the limits of technology and design. Even though he was not at the heart of the invented technology itself, he forces the competition to follow him.

Of course, within the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, there will be reinventions and enhancements, even though all of these products are very successful. Jobs has been known to chuck a successful product in favor of recreating it with a new design. A good example of this is when he transitioned the original iPod's and introduced the iPod Touch, which many believe was a complete reinvention of his original MP3 products. I would not be surprised if he did something radical with the iPhone, Mac, and iPad at some point. In fact, I think that he could apply his touch UI to the Mac and make the desktop experience even better, and one-up HP's TouchSmart PC in the process.

So, what's next for Steve Jobs and Apple? What else could or should he and his company reinvent that is already on the market? He has already taken a shot at reinventing the TV experience. While not actually reinventing the TV itself, Apple TV has made the viewing experience better. Some analysts I know believe he could someday apply the Apple design approach to the creation of an actual Apple television with the Apple UI experience integrated right into the design. Apple also made big strides in delivering video conferencing to the Mac, iPhone, and iPod touch, so perhaps Apple can bring video conferencing on the TV to the masses as well.

Or what about reinventing the eBook? While Apple's iPad can be used for reading books, it's still a bit too heavy for that purpose, and it doesn't do well in direct sunlight. Maybe Jobs and Apple could re-invent this market. Or Apple could integrate gestures and voice interfaces into a future Mac design and in a way reinvent the PC UI again. No matter what Jobs and company creates in the future, you can almost bet that instead of trying to invent a new device or even a new tech category, they will turn their talents to either dramatically enhancing what they already have, or make an existing tech product better and easier to use. Apple's history shows us that reinvention is the cause of its dramatic growth, and I suspect that it will continue to follow this roadmap well into the future.
