We are using birds of prey to intercept hostile drones
After a preliminary threat analysis, we will help you to select the best suitable C-UAS solutions. When that solution is using C-UAS Birds of Prey, we carry out a site survey, during which our specialized team will check the location on access points, obstacles and best positions to deploy the birds. In most cases this will be a static position on the high ground, guard tower or on the roof of a building. We will assist you in all steps needed to build you own C-UAS Capability tailored to your needs.

When deployed at a location, a GFA certified Team (bird handler and bird of prey) will report to the Force Protection Unit or Protective Services Detail (PSD), which can also deploy additional C-UAS tools (e.g. additional means of Drone Detection or Electronic Counter Measures). Rules Of Engagement (ROE) and follow-up procedures after interception of a hostile drone are set, after which the team is ready. We have been researching and collecting intelligence on drone-incidents around the world from 2013.

We can provide in-depth intelligence reports tailored to your site and on request also provide red-teaming exercises. Because of our network of partners around the world we can also provide additional C-UAS solutions and or incorporate these in Hybrid solutions. This includes providing C-UAS Operators through our partners.
