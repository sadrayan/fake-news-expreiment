REMARKS BY SENATOR JOHN McCAIN INTRODUCING TAA AMENDMENT
“Mr. President: I have an amendment at the desk numbered 625, and I ask unanimous consent that it be made pending. “This amendment would authorize the continuation of Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, for two additional years at the level of funding that the program maintained prior to the President’s stimulus. “Prior to the Stimulus in 2009, the TAA program cost taxpayers about $1 billion per year. Stimulus increased and expanded to the program to a cost of about $2 billion in 2010 and according to Department of Labor estimates, $2.4 billion in 2011 if the stimulus expansions had stayed in place. We don’t yet have a cost score for the Reid Substitute before us, but estimates indicate that the TAA ‘agreement’ may lock in at least 65% of the 2009 stimulus expansions for the next several years. Architects of the agreement will say that these provisions sunset at the end of 2014. But, we all know that ‘sunsets’ can be fiction. “My friends on the other side of the aisle have long insisted that the price of passing trade agreements in Congress is passing TAA and other programs like it – domestic spending legislation geared to assist U.S. workers who have been adversely affected by foreign trade. For this reason, in 2002, Congress passed the TAA legislation that provided short-term temporary support for worker retraining and other assistance. Many Republicans, including myself, were skeptical about whether this program and others like it achieve their goals, but we went along for the sake of our national interest in expanding free trade. “However, in 2009, without any action taken on our three pending trade agreements, my friends on the other side of the aisle dramatically expanded the TAA program as part of the stimulus bill and increased spending on this program annually by approximately $1 billion. In essence, a program that was designed to assist workers that had been adversely affected by free trade was transformed into a domestic spending program for reasons that had nothing at all to do with expanding free trade. “What’s worse, after repeatedly claiming it supports the three free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and Korea, the White House earlier this year announced that the cost of its support was reauthorization of the new TAA – with funding set not at the original 2002 level, but the 2009 stimulus level. So here you had a program that had been expanded from its original cost, under the dubious guise of a temporary economic stimulus. And then we were told that this temporary funding increase, which was designed to expire along with the stimulus, should in effect be turned into a permanent domestic spending program. “After much discussion and debate, there now appears to be a proposal to reauthorize TAA and fund it between the pre-stimulus and post-stimulus levels. This proposal is contained in the substitute amendment offered by the Majority Leader. Some would say this is a good deal, and Republicans should accept it. Others say that Trade Adjustment Assistance is ineffective and unproven, and Congress should kill it altogether. “Mr. President: I have a different view, and I am offering this amendment as a matter of principle. As I have said many times on the floor of this body, I am not opposed to TAA, nor do I seek to kill this program. I read the same media reports as my colleagues, which suggest that the White House is holding hostage the trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama until Congress passes TAA. Many of us do not like this. Many of us think this is contrary to our national and economic interests. But it is a fact. So I recognize, as in the past, that Congress must reauthorize TAA. The question is, how much of the taxpayers’ money should we spend to do it? “That is why I am offering this amendment. I believe that Congress should reauthorize TAA because we are being compelled to do so, but I also believe that we should reauthorize this program at its pre-stimulus funding levels – and not one dollar more. Let me explain why. “The following are the ‘temporary’ expansions to TAA that were included in the stimulus, which cost about $2 billion in 2010 and according to the Department of Labor, was estimated to cost approximately $2.4 billion in 2011 if the 2009 stimulus expansions had stayed in place:

• The stimulus expanded TAA to cover workers whose employers shifted production to any foreign country, not just those (as under prior law) whose jobs were outsourced to countries with which the U.S. has free trade agreements;

• It expanded TAA coverage to the service sector and government employees who lose their jobs because of trade;

• It increased the tax credit available to cover private health insurance premiums from 65 percent to 80 percent;

• It increased the appropriations cap for training from $220 million to $575 million, a 160% increase over the previous cap;

• It created the TAA for Communities program, which authorizes $230 million for trade-affected communities to assist in strategic planning grants (up to $5 million), sector partnership grants (up to $3 million over a 3 year period), and community college and career training grants (up to $1 million).

• It gave $17.5 million to states for employment and case management;

• It lengthened the amount of time workers could receive the Trade Readjustment Allowance assistance by 26 weeks;

• And finally, it revived the TAA for Farmers and the wage insurance program, estimated by CBO to total about $100 million for two years. “So here you had a program that had been expanded from its original intent, with benefits going to government employees, service sector employees, TAA benefits going to ‘communities,’ TAA benefits going to Farms, TAA benefits going to ‘firms,’ under the dubious guise of a temporary economic stimulus. This is what the White House and Democrats in Congress were telling us had to be reauthorized in order to pass the trade agreements. “My amendment also addresses the claim made by some that the agreement in the Majority Leader’s substitute amendment not only reduces TAA from stimulus levels, but also much lower in several areas. However, according to a recent Heritage Foundation analyst, this may not be accurate. “This is important, so let me read this analysis at length. Quote: ‘Instead of cutting TAA back to pre-stimulus levels, the proposal restores and solidifies the most alarming aspects of the stimulus expansion at a yet unknown cost.’

• It keeps the 2009 stimulus expansion for service-sector workers. TAA was originally intended to provide income maintenance and job training to workers from the manufacturing sector. The stimulus bill expanded eligibility to include workers from the service and public sectors. This expansion expired in February, but the proposal restores TAA eligibility for service-sector workers.

• It restores the stimulus expansion of benefits for job losses unrelated to FTAs. The proposal retains the stimulus expansion of providing TAA benefits to any workers who lost their jobs to overseas production, not just TAA-certified jobs that were lost to FTAs.

• It reinstates the stimulus’s 161 percent increase in TAA for workers’ job training spending. The proposal cements the stimulus spending expansion of TAA for workers’ job training at $575 million per year from $220 million—an increase of $355 million per year.

• It continues the stimulus’s creation of a new and duplicative job-training program. The proposal keeps the TAA Community College and Career Training Program, which has appropriation authorizations of $500 million per year from fiscal years 2011 through 2014. This new job-training program is just one of the 47 employment and training programs operated across nine agencies by the federal government.

• It partially reinstates the stimulus increase in the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC). The stimulus expansion raised the HCTC reimbursement rate that covers private health insurance premiums to 80 percent from the pre-stimulus rate of 65 percent. However, the HCTC rate returned to the pre-stimulus level when the stimulus expansion expired in February. By splitting the difference at 72.5 percent, the proposal effectively increases the HCTC rate by 7.5 points.

• It solidifies the wage subsidies for older workers as a permanent program. The pre-stimulus Alternative TAA was a temporary five-year demonstration program that paid 50 percent of the difference between new and old wages of displaced older workers. It subsidized the wages of older workers earning less than $50,000 per year for up to $10,000 over two years. After changing the program’s name to Reemployment TAA, the stimulus expansion increased the wage subsidy to $12,000 over two years for displaced older workers earning less than $55,000 and made the program permanent. While the proposal reduces the wage subsidies to pre-stimulus levels, it also cements into law the permanency of the wage subsidy program.

• It retains the stimulus expansion of the union VEBA handout. Despite having nothing to do with international trade, the stimulus expansion of TAA extended the HCTC to Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations (VEBA). A bankruptcy court can allocate a portion of an out-of-business employer’s assets to a VEBA, which assumes responsibility for retirees’ health coverage. This expansion primarily benefits unions. Under the proposal, the federal government would cover 72.5 percent of the cost of retiree health benefits at bankrupt companies. This coverage occurs regardless of whether the bankruptcies are related to free trade.” “Let’s look at an example of excess created in the ‘temporary’ stimulus expansion of the TAA program that taxpayers are still on the hook for. According a February 2011 study by Senator Coburn entitled, ‘Help Wanted: How Federal Job Training Programs are Failing Workers’:

‘Taxpayers may have a case of indigestion when they learn, nearly two years after the stimulus was enacted, their money is paying lobsterman, shrimpers and blueberry farmers $12,000 each to attend job training sessions on jobs they are already trained to do.

‘The stimulus re-authorized the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers program administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a program that provides subsidies to producers of raw agricultural commodities and fishermen so they can adjust to import competition. Under the stimulus, TAA benefits were enhanced to focus more on employment re-training.’ “While the Reid substitute includes a compromise to ‘pare back’ some of the expansions in the ‘temporary’ stimulus spending legislation of 2009, it still expands TAA benefits and eligibility beyond the pre-stimulus levels. By going back to pre-stimulus levels, my amendment could save the taxpayers approximately $600 million per year by returning the TAA program to the pre-stimulus levels for two years through 2014. “Now, I acknowledge that expanding trade does temporarily put some of our workers at a disadvantage. I remember being roundly criticized during the 2008 presidential campaign when I had the audacity to tell Michigan workers the truth – that many of the jobs that had left their state for cheaper labor markets overseas were never coming back. So I understand that trade can create difficulties for some American workers. And I am not opposed in principle to supporting those workers temporarily so they can develop new skills and find new jobs. That said, let’s look closer at how the federal government has been going about programs like this. “Earlier this year, the GAO released a study entitled ‘Multiple Training and Employment Programs: Providing Information on Collocating Services and Consolidating Administrative Structures Could Promote Efficiencies.’ Here is what the GAO reported on federal employment and retraining programs, including Trade Adjustment Assistance. Quote:

‘Based on our survey of agency officials, we determined that only 5 of the 47 programs have had impact studies that assess whether the program is responsible for improved employment outcomes. The five impact studies generally found that the effects of participation were not consistent across programs, with only some demonstrating positive impacts that tended to be small, inconclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.’ “So not only are many of these worker employment and training programs duplicative; the GAO has found very little empirical evidence to support whether these programs are even accomplishing their intended goals – and what empirical evidence they have found is, I repeat, ‘small, inconclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.’ TAA is among these programs.

“This is bad enough, but what’s worse, we have not even been told how much this expansion of TAA will cost the taxpayers. We’re told the legislation includes ‘offsets,’ but we know they are not real. Offsets allegedly include:

• Rates for merchandise processing fees,

• Changes to the “time for remitting certain merchandise processing fees,

• Unemployment compensation program integrity provisions to create a mandatory penalty assessment on fraud claims

• Prohibition on non-charging due to employer fault

• Reporting of rehired employees to the directory of new hires. “I can’t tell you what most of these mean. But I can tell you they are not real. “Even while extending the TAA pre-stimulus program, we need to analyze whether the TAA program is really doing what it was intended to do. The following are some of the questions and concerns we must consider: “Does the TAA program provide overly generous benefits to a narrow population? “According to analysis from the Heritage Foundation, based on statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the third quarter of FY 2009, only 1% of mass layoffs were a result of import competition of overseas relocation “Is there evidence that TAA benefits and training help increase participants’ earnings? “An analysis by Professor Kara M. Reynolds of American University found ‘little evidence that it (TAA) helps displaced workers find new, well-paying employment opportunities.’ In fact, TAA participants experienced a wage loss of 10 percent. “The same study found that in FY 2007, the federal government appropriated $855.1 million to TAA programs. Of this amount, funding for training programs accounted for only 25%. “In 2007, OMB rated the TAA program as ‘ineffective.’ The OMB found that the TAA program fails to use tax dollars effectively because, among other reasons, the program has failed to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of achieving its goals. “Let me close by reminding my colleagues how we got to our current predicament. It is mid-September of 2011, two and a half years since President Obama took office. And we still have not received these important trade agreements that were finalized half a decade ago. All because of the White House’s insistence on making a ‘temporary’ stimulus program – the dubious extension of TAA – into a permanent domestic spending program. “This is how George Will summed it up, writing in the Washington Post on June 8, 2011. The piece is as appropriate now as it was then:

‘President Obama is sacrificing economic growth and job creation in order to placate organized labor. And as the crisis of the welfare state deepens, he is trying to enlarge the entitlement system and exacerbate the entitlement mentality…

‘On May 4, the administration announced that, at last, it was ready to proceed with congressional ratification of the agreements. On May 16, however, it announced it would not send them until Congress expands an entitlement program favored by unions.
