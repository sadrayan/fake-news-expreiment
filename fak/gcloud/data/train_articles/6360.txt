Cancer registry data are essential for global and national cancer control planning. Close cooperation with population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) around the world is an essential aspect of our work, and IARC’s Section of Cancer Surveillance (CSU) serves as the Secretariat for the International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR), working closely with this umbrella organization as well as with individual registries on collaborative projects, including Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5).

The International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR) is a professional society of population-based cancer registries. IACR’s 500 member registries are at the forefront of the development and application of cancer registration to inform local cancer control approaches and to build cancer research opportunities. You can read more about the IACR at the association’s website (http://www.iacr.com.fr/).

The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development (GICR) is a partnership based on a commitment from key international organizations to address inequities by helping underserved countries prevent cancer and improve outcomes. Coordinated by IARC, the GICR is the first global strategy for strengthening the ability to collect, analyse, and disseminate cancer data.
