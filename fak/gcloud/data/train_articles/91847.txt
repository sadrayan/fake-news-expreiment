Georgia owes more than it owns.

Georgia has a -$3,900 Taxpayer Burden.™

Georgia is a Sinkhole State without enough assets to cover its debt.

Elected officials have created a Taxpayer Burden™, which is each taxpayer's share of state bills after its available assets have been tapped.

TIA's Taxpayer Burden™ measurement incorporates both assets and liabilities, not just pension debt.

Georgia only has $22.1 billion of assets available to pay bills totaling $33.2 billion .

Because Georgia doesn't have enough money to pay its bills, it has a $11.1 billion financial hole. To fill it, each Georgia taxpayer would have to send $3,900 to the state.

Georgia's reported net position is inflated by $2.6 billion , largely because the state defers recognizing losses incurred when the net pension liability increases.

The state is still hiding $5 billion of its retiree health care debt. A new accounting standard will be implemented in the 2018 fiscal year which will require states to report this debt on the balance sheet.
