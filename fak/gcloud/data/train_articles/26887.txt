When Keanu Reeves was filming Speed, in 1993, he spent every spare minute learning lines in his trailer. These lines weren’t from the film he was working on – as Jack Traven, the SWAT officer who takes control of a bomb-laden bus, Reeves didn’t have a great deal to say – but from William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, a well-thumbed copy of which he would carry around on set.

His day job was zooming through Los Angeles with a flustered Sandra Bullock and a coachload of screaming extras. Monologuing as the tragic Prince of Denmark, on the other hand, was me-time.

“I finished playing Jack, went into the trailer, and, you know – ‘How all occasions do inform against me,/ And spur my dull revenge’,” he says, reeling off the opening few lines of Hamlet’s last soliloquy. Did it help him cope with what was, at that point, his most commercially prominent role to date? “Hum.” He pauses. “I don’t know. There was definitely a yin and yang thing going on.”

As he continues, what soon becomes clear is that those snatched moments of Shakespeare helped Reeves make sense not so much of Traven or Hamlet, but of himself. He was 29 years old at the time, with a career that was skyrocketing. But Reeves didn’t see himself as an action hero – or not just an action hero, at least.
