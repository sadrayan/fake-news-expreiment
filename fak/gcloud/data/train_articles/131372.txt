Just saying there maybe a connection. It’s quite a coincidence. Just saying...

Coincidence, but different Schiff. Adam doesn’t have a sister.

Different Schiffs.

Adam's parents are Edward and Sherrill Ann (Glovsky) Schiff.

Adam Schiff is from Massachusetts and his parents are Edward and Sherrill Ann. Soros’ ex-wife is from New York City and her parents are Haskell and Marlene. We’re being played for fools by the usual kooks.

Thanks for the correction.

Look at the name of her parents. Then look up Adam Schiff’s. They are not the same. She is not his sister or even related that I can tell, perhaps distantly. Schiff is not that uncommon of a surname.

Thanks.
