THE WEEK; Ban Is Passed on Smokingn In Cars Occupied by Children
Keyport, in Monmouth County, became the first New Jersey municipality to pass a law that bans smoking in cars while children are present. Under the law, approved by a 5-to-1 vote of the Borough Council last Tuesday, Keyport, population 8,000, can levy fines of $75 to drivers who smoke with passengers under the age of 17 inside their vehicles.

Chatham, in Morris County, rejected a similar ban last month.

''This is about protecting children against secondhand smoke,'' said Robert J. Bergen, Keyport's mayor.

He said the law would be a secondary offense, meaning officers could not pull over a driver simply for smoking with children in the vehicle, but could issue a summons for the smoking offense if the driver was breaking another traffic law. The law is expected to take effect in the next month.

In April 2005, the state passed a law making it illegal to smoke inside restaurants, bars and buildings; violators are subject to fines starting at $250. Casinos had been exempt from the law, but earlier this month an ordinance went into effect in Atlantic City that limits smoking to 25 percent of the casino gambling floor.

''There is still work that needs to be done, but New Jersey is a leader in creating smoke-free environments, and this is another step to making children safer,'' said Karen Blumenfeld, a spokeswoman for New Jersey GASP, which stands for Group Against Smoking Pollution. JOHN HOLL
