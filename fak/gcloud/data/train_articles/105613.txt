But, the leader of a patrol team of the Operation Whirl Stroke, Flight Lieutenant Abubakar Mohammed, said: “I led my team on patrol of the area today (Wednesday) and in the course of our routine patrol, we came across herders with over 500 coŵs. As soon as they sighted us, they opened fire on us. So, my troops replied and then we left the axis.”

The Force Commander of OPWS, Major-General Adeyemi Yekini, said: “This is the kind of encounter we face everyday whereby herders open fire on our troops. When they (herders) kill us, nobody sympathises with us and nobody cares to hear our side of the story.”
