WV tourism growth above national rate
On one hand, Justice said he was excited to get a paving project to Mullens underway. On the other, he said he was dismayed that the Coalfields Expressway had just now gotten off the ground â€” 29 years after it was planned. The project, an 8.9-mile section that will extend the road from Slab Fork to Mullens, is the front end of a project planned to pass by Pineville, Welch and Bradshaw before entering Virginia. While excited to open up construction to Mullens, Justice shared his belief that construction along the entire route needs to be fast-tracked. Explaining that two phases, one between Mullens and past Pineville and the other from beyond Welch to the Virginia border, have yet to be designed, Justice said he is setting a timeline of 10 months for that task to be completed.
