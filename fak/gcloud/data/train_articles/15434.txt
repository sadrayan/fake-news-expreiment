Good evening. I write because Iâ€™m fact-checking a January statement by US Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. He said Homeland Security is the only federal agency not funded through the current fiscal year.

It looks to me like your group would have a solid grip on this.

Visit further by email or phone?

Other suggestions?

THANKS.

True. From one of our policy guys:

At the end of last year Congress passed legislation (the CRomnibus) providing funding for 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering all government agencies except DHS for all of fiscal year 2015 but only continuing funding for the Homeland Security appropriations through February 27. The CR in CRomnibus was for continuing resolution for Homeland Security. If Congress doesn't pass legislation funding DHS for the rest of the year before Feb 27th, there will be a partial government shutdown affecting DHS while the rest of the government is funded and will remain open.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Jack

Who is the policy expert and what is his or her title?

Also, did CRFB write up this wrinkle at the time? Is there a link to the write-up?
