Veterans
Currently, 1 in 5 homeless men is a veteran of war, with nearly 107,000 homeless male veterans sleeping on the street each night as a result.



HELP USA, one of the country's largest providers of housing, jobs and services for

America's homeless and low income populations, is developing permanent housing for male and female war veterans and their families in states along the east and west coasts.



HELP USA's strong collaborative relationships with the US Dept of Veterans Affairs both locally and nationally ensure that services and benefits are coordinated for each veteran placed in permanent housing at each of the HELP USA sites. The sites incorporate HELP USAâ€™s innovative model of comprehensive on-site human services tailored to meet the complex needs of veterans including specialized day care services to aid in re-establishing emotional attachment and allow service men and women the time they need to address personal issues; and family therapeutic counseling services to address issues of family reunification and reintegration that veterans and their families need. Additionally, professional case managers assist veterans with the often difficult transition to civilian life by offering counseling and employment programs.
