Without Abortion Changes, Stupak Will Defeat Health Care: 'We're Prepared to Take Responsibility'

That’s what Congressman Bart Stupak – who voted yes on health care last year – told me this morning on GMA.

He says he has 12 yes votes who will switch and vote against the President’s plan, unless Democratic leaders find a way to add his abortion language – which he says is the only clear prohibition of public abortion funding out there.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – also on GMA – disagrees, saying the President’s plan does “maintain the status quo” on abortion funding. But if Stupak and his allies don’t buy that argument, can the bill pass? Hard to see, unless Stupak’s group is much smaller than he says.
