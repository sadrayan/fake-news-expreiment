Although DACA was not intended to be a path to citizenship, data released by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on September 1, 2017 indicates that 39,514 DACA recipients have been approved for Lawful Permanent Resident status (green cards). This data was recently requested from Citizenship and Immigration Services by the House and Senate Judiciary Committee and published by Senator Grassley.

Thank you,
