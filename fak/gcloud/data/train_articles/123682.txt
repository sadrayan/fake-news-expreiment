It’s been a little more than a month since Sen. Ted Cruz conceded the Republican presidential nomination, but the Texas firebrand still isn’t ready to say he will vote for Donald Trump.

In an interview on Capitol Hill with MSNBC’s Hallie Jackson, Cruz wouldn’t offer a timeline on when he’ll make a decision on whether or not to support the GOP nominee, offering only that he was “giving it time, watching and assessing.”

“I, like many other voters am watching and listening what he says and what he does,” Cruz said. “That's what millions of voters are doing. That's the way the democratic process is meant to operate.”

Cruz did offer clues that he might try to exercise some conservative influence over the Republican Party’s platform at its convention next month in Cleveland. Asked by Jackson about rumors that he might “cause some mischief at the convention, that you may have some surprise up your sleeve,” Cruz chuckled and said he would push for a platform that matched the conservative vision he based his campaign on.

“There is no surprise in the simple fact that I going to work to defend the conservative principles, the common sense principles that built this country. I think the platform should reflect those principles,” he said. “People are struggling. People are angry with Washington. Much of this election reflects that anger and I’m going to continue fighting as long as there is breath in my body to get government off of the backs of the working men and women of this country.”
