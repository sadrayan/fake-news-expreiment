I am excerpting below pay related proposed provisions from Senate Bill 19. Lt. Gov. Patrick proposed a bonus of $600 to $1,000 based upon qualifying events related to years of experience. A bonus is not a pay raise in that his proposed changes to statutory provisions did not involve increasing the amounts to be paid teachers that are specified in the statutory minimum salary schedule. Additionally, the bonus amounts he proposed in Senate Bill 19 were far less than $10,000. There is no evidence that any bills were introduced by the Senate in the 85th Regular and First Called Sessions to amend Section 21.401 of the Texas Education Code for the purpose of giving teachers a pay “raise.”

“SECTION 2. (a) The amount of $193,000,000 of the unencumbered appropriations from the general revenue fund for the state fiscal biennium ending August 31, 2019, made by S.B. 1, Acts of the 85th Legislature, Regular Session, 2017 (the General Appropriations Act), to the Health and Human Services Commission is transferred to the Texas Education Agency to be used by the agency to provide the following bonuses to public school classroom teachers under Section 21.417, Education Code, as added by this Act:

(1) a bonus of $600 to be paid in September 2018 for each classroom teacher with at least 6 but less than 11 years of teaching experience at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year; and

(2) a bonus of $1,000 to be paid in September 2018 for each classroom teacher with at least 11 years of teaching experience at the beginning of the 2018-2019 school year.”

Thanks,

Tom
