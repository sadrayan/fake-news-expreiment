425-pound teacher suspended for sitting on student’s head and farting in his mouth
Des Moines | An Iowa teacher at Kensington elementary school has been suspended from her functions after allegedly sitting on a student’s head and farting in his mouth leaving him gasping for air.

The 34-year-old teacher, Ann Margaret DeVille, apparently wanted to teach the student a valuable lesson after the young man allegedly made a public comment on her “ugly fat ass.”

“She pushed him to the ground, lifted her robe and just sat her ass on his face and then just let out the biggest fart in front of all his classmates,” she added.

“He was gasping for air. He thought he was going to die,” explained the victim’s mother to reporters.

“Worst of all, she wasn’t wearing any panties. What kind of sick person does that to an 11-year-old?” she asks, visibly horrified.

Kensington elementary school psychiatrist, Ashley Simmons, said the child is under psychological evaluation after his teacher sat on his face and farted in his mouth while wearing no underwear.

“Wearing no panties”

According to the young boy’s mother, the most offending part of the whole affair is that the teacher wasn’t wearing any underwear.

“My son told me he had seen her vagina and her anal cavity and described them to me in detail,” she told reporters in shock.

“My son’s first sexual experience was with his 6th-grade teacher farting inside his mouth,” she said, visibly angered.

“He also said he could still feel the taste of her anus on his lips and the fart in his mouth hours after the incident,” she recalled.

Ann Margaret DeVille, 34, has been accused of professional misconduct and the Des Moines District School Board has officially suspended her for two weeks with pay.
