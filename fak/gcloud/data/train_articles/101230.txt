WaterAid Global
Malawi is often called ‘the warm heart of Africa’ because of its vibrant feel and welcoming people. Although it’s one of the smallest and least-developed countries in the continent, it’s showing great progress and leadership in clean water.

Since the early 2000s, Malawi’s Government has made clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene for every person a priority. Globally, nine in ten people now have clean water to drink and almost everyone knows about the health risks of going to the toilet in the open.

But these successes are under threat. Local councils need more support to develop resilient services that can deal with the country’s drastic water shortages and the mass movement of people due to climate change.

Decent toilets remain vital to enable people to keep healthy and unlock their potential, but 10 million people – more than half the population – are still living without one.

Together, we will reach every last person in Malawi with water, toilets and hygiene. We know that doing so will have a lasting impact, helping poor and marginalised communities escape poverty for good.

To do this, we’re working with government, communities and partner organisations. We share our skills, knowledge and experience to make these basic services a normal part of everyday life.

At the same time, we’re making people aware of their rights, through citizen’s action groups and community-led initiatives, to make sure every voice is heard.
