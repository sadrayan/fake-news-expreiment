What’s in the new GOP health care bill, in one (simple) chart
The heart monitor on the Republican health care reform effort is suddenly beeping again, thanks to four GOP senators who released a 140-page bill that’s keeping conservative hope for overhauling the Affordable Care Act alive.

How does this latest bill — backed by Republicans Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Dean Heller of Nevada and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — compare with the two major GOP efforts that failed earlier this year? (That would be the House-passed “American Health Care Act” and Senate Republican leaders’ “Better Care Reconciliation Act”).

They all effectively wipe out Obamacare’s mandates to buy insurance, give more power to states and dramatically alter Medicaid, the health care program for the poor.

But the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson measure stands out for its much more aggressive proposal to shift funding to states. It would move a trillion dollars in federal health care spending directly to states, in a formula the senators say would be based on the state’s percentage of lower-income people and (to a lesser degree) older and sicker residents.

This chart breaks down the differences.
