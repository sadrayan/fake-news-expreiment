World Trade Center Health Program
The World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program offers high-quality, compassionate healthcare to those directly affected by the September 11th terrorist attacks.

We provide medical monitoring and treatment for emergency responders, recovery and cleanup workers, and volunteers who helped at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the crash site near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. This group is known as Responders.

The Program also provides initial screenings and treatment to those who were present on the day of the attacks or who worked, lived, or went to school in the New York City disaster area on September 11th or the months that followed. This group is known as Survivors.

The WTC Health Program was established by the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. In 2015, the Program was reauthorized until 2090.
