O.J. Simpson’s White Bronco Police Chase Happened 19 Years Ago Today
Do you remember where you were 19 years ago today? It’s quite possible that you, like a good number of Americans, were glued to a television set following the progress of a white Ford Bronco as it cruised along a Los Angeles freeway with the police in slow-motion pursuit.

The Bronco’s passenger was, of course, O.J. Simpson; its driver was Al Cowlings, Mr. Simpson’s friend and former teammate in high school, college and the N.F.L. The police had expected Mr. Simpson to turn himself in that afternoon on charges of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her companion, Ronald Goldman. But he never showed. Later, after tracking cellphone calls, the police located Mr. Simpson in the Bronco as it traveled on an Interstate south of Los Angeles.

The resulting low-speed chase — with Mr. Simpson lying in the back seat with a gun to his head as Mr. Cowlings drove along the freeway at about 35 miles per hour, some 20 police cars and as many helicopters in close but seemingly polite pursuit — ended rather anticlimactically in the driveway of Mr. Simpson’s home. The rest is well-covered history.

The Bronco nameplate was discontinued in 1996, but the white truck that rode into history on June 17, 1994, is still kicking around. Word has it that it can be rented for parties and special events, although how much that would cost is anyone’s guess.
