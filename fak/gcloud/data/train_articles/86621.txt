DEAL SEALED IN TRUMP TOWER SUIT
TWENTY YEARS after a squad of nonunion Polish demolition workers cleared the way for Trump Tower by tearing down the old Bonwit Teller building on Fifth Ave., Donald Trump has quietly settled a lawsuit brought on their behalf. The lawsuit against Trump was filed in 1983 by a crusty ex-boxer and dissident member of the housewreckers union named Harry Diduck.

"The money was to go to the [union] funds.
