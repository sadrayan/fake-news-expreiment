California Today: Are We Undercounting the Homeless?
Good morning.

Today’s introduction comes from Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief.

Is California’s homeless crisis much worse than the official data show?

A study released last week makes the case that the federal government undercounts homelessness in California’s largest cities by more than 25 percent.

Using the estimates in the study, Los Angeles has 60,000 homeless, not 47,000, and San Francisco has 9,000 homeless, not 7,000, according to the research, which used 2016 data.

The study is important, experts say, because it could provide justification for greater federal funding for programs that address homelessness.
