Here are several of Vice President Mike Pence’s emails obtained by IndyStar through a public records request.

They are among nearly 30 emails that show he routinely conducted state business from a personal AOL email account while governor of Indiana.

They are only a small fraction of the state-related emails that Pence sent or received from that account, according to an official with Pence’s vice presidential office.

An unspecified number of additional emails were withheld by the administration of the current governor, Eric Holcomb. His office said the withheld emails contained material that was deliberative or advisory, confidential under rules adopted by the Indiana Supreme Court, or the work product of an attorney.
