Appendix E--Earthquakes in Kansas

The following list of earthquakes is chronological and includes the location of the epicenter, wherever possible, by latitude and longitude. Intensities are based on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale of 1931, the scale used by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. If the intensity was given in another scale, the value has been converted to Mercalli units of I to XII; if no value was given in a reference, one is estimated. The sources of information are listed at the end of this appendix and are cited in the descriptions by number. An asterisk indicates that the epicenter was in Kansas.

1811, December 16--(36.6° N, 89.6° W; X.) The epicenter was near New Madrid, Missouri, and the earthquake affected at least 2,000,000 square miles. This was the first of three severe shocks and numerous minor ones in the area. The three earthquakes were probably the most catastrophic ever recorded in the central region of the United States. (4, 7)

1812, January 23--Same as December 16, 1811. (4, 7)

1812, February 7--Same as December 16, 1811, and January 23, 1812. (4, 7)

*1867, April 24--(39.5° N, 96.7° W; VIII.) The epicenter was located near Manhattan, Kansas. It was felt over an area of 300,000 square miles in Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and possibly Ohio. Several persons were injured, though not seriously. People rushed into the streets; buildings swayed; clocks stopped; animals were alarmed in the fields; a heavy wave about 2 feet high was observed in Kansas River at Manhattan; stones from buildings were loosened; the walls of many buildings cracked; windows and glassware were shaken; objects were thrown from shelves; a train stopped and the engineer and fireman got out, thinking the boiler was going to blow up. A low rumbling sound accompanied the vibrations. At different places there seemed to be either one or two ground waves. The shock, which occurred at about 2:45 P.M., lasted 10 to 30 seconds. Topeka, Manhattan, Lawrence, Junction City, Atchison, and Solomon, in Kansas; Omaha, Nebraska; St. Louis, Missouri, reported effects of the earthquake; and it may have been felt in Carthage, Ohio. (4, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20, 21, 31, 32)

*1875, November 8--(39.3° N, 95.5° W; V.) The epicenter was near Valley Falls, Kansas, and the earthquake was felt over an area of about 8,000 square miles. Dishes rattled; windows shook; people were awakened; some buildings rocked or quivered; the shock was felt in the Capitol at Topeka. Two shocks, which lasted about one minute each, were felt in Lawrence, Kansas, between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m. The earthquake was also felt in Leavenworth, Manhattan, and Burlingame, Kansas, and in western Missouri. (4, 7, 21, 23)

1877, November 15--(41° N, 97° W; VII.)

There were two shocks, one at 11:45 a.m. and the other at 12:30 p.m., causing buildings to sway and people to run into the streets at Atchison Kansas. The earthquake was also felt in the Kansas communities of Lawrence, Topeka, and Kansas City. (4, 7, 21, 31; Topeka Journal, July 6, 1927; Arkansas City Traveler, May 1, 1925)

The second shock was felt over an area of about 9,745 square miles; there were two small areas of maximum intensity, one centered around Kansas City and the other around Lawson, Missouri. Noises were associated with the earthquakes and were described as jets crashing the sound barrier, explosions, roars, thunder, blasting, etc. People were awakened in Lawson, Liberty, Kearney, Excelsior Springs, and Kansas City, in Missouri, as well as in Kansas City, Kansas. There were reports that plaster cracked, dishes and windows rattled, Christmas tree ornaments shook, furniture vibrated, and a 4-inch water main broke.
