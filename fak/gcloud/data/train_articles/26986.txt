BREAKING: Shep Smith To Be Canned Because He Can’t Control His Hate For Donald Trump
Last week, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith attacked President Donald Trump for his assertion that the news media frequently underreports on radical Islamic terror attacks. To support his point, Smith listed several terror attacks that were on the White House’s controversial list, saying Fox News covered them extensively.

“The president’s assertion is false,” Smith argued. “The White House knows that it was false or could have known that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth.”
