Mail-In Ballots Might Require Extra Postage
November’s ballot is a lengthy one with 17 state propositions and numerous races and local measures. Some mail-in ballots, like the ones in Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties, may require additional postage.

San Joaquin County’s mail-in ballot has 35 races, 5 measures in Stockton, and 17 state propositions.

San Joaquin County Registrar of Voters Austin Erdman says about a quarter of the ballots he's seeing have insufficient postage.

“San Joaquin County has made a deal with the United States Postal Service that, in fact, all the ballots will be delivered to the Registrar of Voters office. However, if the postage is not complete or no postage is on the ballot, San Joaquin County is stuck with paying the bill.”

Voters can also drop off their mail-in ballots without postage at their registrar of voters office or at any polling place on election day.

“We sent out over 200,000 ballots here in San Joaquin County. 80 percent are going to vote. We’re looking at over 160,000 being returned. There’s going to be close to 40-50 thousand that are going to be short postage.”

However, Erdman says the post office will still deliver those ballots with insufficient postage.



He says the county will pick up the bill for the postage due which will probably be about $10,000 dollars.



Sacramento County also requires extra postage for its mail-in ballot but Stanislaus County only needs one stamp.
