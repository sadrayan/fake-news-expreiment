Meet Donald Trump's air fleet
New York (CNN) Donald Trump is known for his larger-than-life personality, a trait visible from his fleet of aircraft: A large commercial sized plane, a corporate jet and two helicopters.

The largest is a Boeing 757-200 and emblazoned with "Trump" in golden letters and a huge red "T" on the four story tall tail.

In a commercial configuration it could carry as many as 228 passengers if it were filled with economy seats, but there's nothing "economy" about this plane.

Trump's 757 is designed to carry 43 passengers secured with 24 caret gold plated seat belts, according to a video tour of the aircraft his company posted in 2011. It features a dining room, big screen TVs, a master and a guest bedroom and even a shower.

"Everything that they did on it is very very spectacular." John Dunkin, Trump's pilot told the Smithsonian Channel's Mighty Planes. "It's very fast airplane for a large airplane. It's extremely comfortable. It takes turbulence very well. It's kind of like the Ferrari in the airline category airplane."
