DNR secretary says she’s considering selling naming rights for state parks
MADISON (AP) — The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources secretary says she’s considering selling naming rights to state parks over the next two years.

Cathy Stepp told the Legislature’s budget committee during a hearing Tuesday that she’s looking for ways to boost financial support for the parks. Gov. Scott Walker’s budget calls for cutting all tax support for parks and raising admission and camping fees.

Committee member Sen. Jon Erpenbach pressed Stepp on whether she plans to sell park naming rights and for how much. Stepp said everything’s on the table and she’d like to get legislative input on selling naming rights. She said no corporation has approached the agency about naming rights.
