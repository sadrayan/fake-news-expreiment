Kansas Caucus Results
At local caucuses held Feb. 9, participants vote by secret ballot for presidential candidates. Based on the results, 36 of 39 delegates to the national convention are allocated to presidential candidates. The candidate who receives the most votes in each of the state’s four congressional districts receives all three of that district’s delegates. If there is tie, one delegate is allocated to each of the candidates who tied and one delegate is unpledged. The candidate who receives the most votes statewide get 27 at-large and party-leader delegates, as long as that candidate also received the most votes in two congressional districts. If no candidate receives the most votes in two or more congressional districts, 24 delegates will go to the national convention unpledged. In addition, three party leaders automatically become pledged delegates.
