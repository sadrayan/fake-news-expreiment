U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit - Brief History

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, often referred to as the Fifth Circuit, is one of thirteen federal appellate courts. The Fifth Circuit convened for the first time on June 16, 1891, in the Customs House in New Orleans, and appointed James M. McKee as the first Clerk of Court and swore and admitted sixty-six attorneys to practice before the court. Today, the courtâ€™s home is the John Minor Wisdom United States Court of Appeals Building in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act divided the Fifth Circuit into two circuits, reorganizing the judicial districts of Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and the Canal Zone as a new Fifth Circuit and Alabama, Georgia, and Florida as the Eleventh Circuit. The act transferred all judges whose official duty stations were located within the Eleventh Circuit to the court of appeals for that circuit. Of the twenty-six judgeships authorized for the former Fifth Circuit, fourteen were assigned to the new Fifth Circuit and twelve to the Eleventh Circuit. Today, the Fifth Circuit is authorized seventeen active judges, but currently has fifteen active judges and nine senior judges.

Chief Judge

There have been eleven Chief Judges for the Fifth Circuit since the office was created in 1948. To serve as Chief Judge, a judge must have been in active service on the court for at least one year, be under the age of 65, and have not previously served as chief judge. A vacancy in the office of chief judge is filled by the judge highest in seniority who meets these requirements. A Chief Judge serves for a term of seven years or until age 70, whichever occurs first, although the age restrictions are waived if no members of the court would otherwise be qualified for the position. A Chief Judge returns to regular active service at the expiration of his or her term.
