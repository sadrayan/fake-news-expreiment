April 14, 2011 - Property Tax Cap Is Top Priority For New York Voters, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Strong Support For Gay Marriage, Redistricting Reform



Word format



New York State voters support a proposed property tax cap 79 - 17 percent and in another question 46 percent say this should be the top priority for Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the State Legislature, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.





The independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds strong support for several other issues pending in Albany:

56 - 38 percent for a law allowing same-sex couples to marry;

51 percent for a commission independent of the State Legislature to draw district lines for members of Congress and the legislature, with 29 percent supporting a commission with some input from the legislature and 12 percent for allowing the legislature to continue drawing district lines;

55 - 40 percent for requiring legislators who practice law to disclose their clients.

But voters oppose 52 - 41 percent public financing for state elections.





Asked which of these items should be the top priority:

46 percent want the property tax cap;

29 percent want ethics reform;

7 percent want redistricting reform;

6 percent want same-sex marriage.

"New Yorkers think property tax relief should be the Number One legislative priority now that the state budget is out of the way," said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.





"Next on the list is governmental ethics. Same-sex marriage? Political re-districting? Voters support these ideas, but they want that tax cap first.





"An independent commission should draw the legislative and congressional district lines, most voters think, but a fairly good number would have some legislative input in the process."





"Ethics questions get complicated. Most New Yorkers think lawyer-legislators should list their clients. A small majority oppose public financing of campaigns," Carroll added.





Support for same-sex marriage is 70 - 25 percent among Democrats and 60 - 35 percent among independent voters, with Republicans opposed 61 - 34 percent. Men support the measure 52 - 43 percent and women support it 61 - 34 percent.





New York State voters say 82 - 14 percent that teacher layoffs should be based on performance rather than seniority, matching the 85 - 12 percent finding in a February 24 Quinnipiac University poll. Even voters in union households support performance-based layoffs 67 - 28 percent.





By a 49 - 25 percent margin, voters have a favorable opinion of public school teachers, but they say 49 - 42 percent that teacher unions play a negative rather than a positive role in improving the state's education system.





Public school teachers who do an outstanding job should be rewarded with merit pay, voters say 67 - 30 percent. But firing bad teachers should be easier, voters say 64 - 31 percent.





"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's call to end LIFO, the last-in-first-out system for deciding how teachers should be laid off, wins solid approval. New Yorkers like the people who teach their kids, not their unions," Carroll said.





New York State voters support rent regulation 59 - 33 percent. Support is 69 - 24 percent among Democrats and 59 - 33 percent among independent voters, while Republicans split 46 - 47 percent.





Support for rent regulation is 68 - 26 percent among New York City voters, 57 - 35 percent among suburban voters and 52 - 37 percent among upstate voters.





Pensions for local government employees should be negotiated by local officials rather than set by the State Legislature, voters say 50 - 38 percent, including 53 - 38 percent in union households.





From April 5 - 11, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,704 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.4 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.
