Frankel Statement on FAA’s Decision to Delay Closure of Boca Raton Airport Control Tower
Boca Raton, FL — After the FAA announced on Friday that it would delay the planned closure of 149 air traffic control towers including at Boca Raton Airport until June 15, Congresswoman Lois Frankel released the following statement:

“This is welcome news that Boca Raton Airport will have more time to find a temporary fix to avoid the closing of its control tower. There are both safety and economic impacts at issue. Congressman Ted Deutch and I will continue to work with the Boca Raton Airport and FAA on a long-term solution.”

The Boca Raton Airport is an important economic engine and its control tower plays a key role in helping ensure the safety of the planes taking off and landing at the airport and the surrounding community. The airport is two miles from the main business area and adjacent to FAU and I-95.

The estimated local annual economic impact of the airport is $154 million and this includes the direct economic impacts of the tenants and businesses at the airport and construction projects that are undertaken at the airport. The airport and businesses on the property support over 1,200 jobs.

Airport officials have estimated it would cost $650,000 to take over tower operations at the Boca Raton Airport from the FAA. The FAA is being forced to trim $637 million from the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, resulting in the furlough of employees and closing 149 airport control towers across the country.
