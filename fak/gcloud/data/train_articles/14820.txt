Curbelo Opposes Environmental Regulation Committee's Toxins Vote
Homestead, Florida—Yesterday, the Environmental Regulation Committee of Florida voted 3-2 to approve a new proposal that will increase allowed levels of toxins for over two dozen known chemicals in Florida’s waterways.

“Yesterday’s proposal is ill-timed, ill-advised and unnecessarily exposes Floridians to greater health risks. Increasing “acceptable” levels of known carcinogens in our water will in no way improve our already fragile ecosystem. I strongly urge the state of Florida to adhere to federal water quality standards to ensure the health and continued safety of Florida families. The recent unfortunate events surrounding Flint, Michigan’s water supply should serve as a reminder to government officials throughout the United States of the importance of keeping our waters as clean as possible.”
