McCain blasts deal for Sgt. Bergdahl as ‘mistake’
Sen. John McCain on Tuesday called the deal to free five Guantanamo Bay terrorists in exchange for the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl a “mistake.”

“This decision … is ill-founded, it is a mistake and it is putting the lives American servicemen and women at risk and that to me is unacceptable," the Arizona Republican said at a press conference about veterans issues. “This agreement puts future men and women who are serving in the military at great risk.”

McCain, who himself was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, had expressed concern since the deal was reached over the weekend, but his remarks Tuesday appeared to be his mostly strongly worded yet.

McCain repeatedly raised his voice during his comments Thursdays, saying the deal “shouldn’t have been made.”

Taliban fighters in Afghanistan released Bergdahl to U.S. forces in exchange for the release of five “high risk” Guantanamo Bay detainees, President Obama announced Saturday.

The controversial deal was the result of indirect negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban, with the Qatari government serving as an intermediary.
