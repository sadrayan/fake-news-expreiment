OSCE Chairmanship reaction to the unilateral measures recognizing documents issued on territories of certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine
VIENNA, 20 February 2017 – With regard to the 18 February presidential decree by the Russian Federation recognizing documents and license plates of vehicles issued to Ukraine’s citizens and stateless persons who reside in certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, a spokesperson of Austria’s OSCE Chairmanship said today: “The OSCE Chairmanship expresses strong concern about this measure taken by the Russian Federation. In our view, this decree is in contradiction to the objectives of the settlement process in eastern Ukraine.”

“The OSCE Chairmanship notes that documents issued on the sovereign territory of Ukraine are only valid if done so by the internationally recognized authorities.”

While the OSCE Chairmanship supports efforts to normalize the situation of people living in Donbas and to encourage freedom of movement, it cautions that this should be done in full compliance with OSCE principles and commitments as well as the Minsk agreements. Unilateral actions jeopardize efforts to resolve the crisis in and around Ukraine.
