FOX Still Shunned at Obama Press Conferences
The favorite news outlet of conservatives ranks just ninth in presser questions in Obama’s first term, getting to ask questions at only half the rate of the Big 3 broadcast networks

During Barack Obama’s news conference on Monday the president called on seven reporters.

And while these reporters challenged the president (e.g. on the debt ceiling) in a manner that some conservative media critics believe has been a rarity at these events, FOX News was not one of the outlets pushing Obama’s buttons on Monday.

Over the course of the president’s first term, he has generally maintained the tiered approach as to which outlets ask the questions (with the Big 3 and Associated Press usually getting the green light), although the president has departed from tradition on occasion – famously calling on a digital-only media outlet’s reporter (Huffington Post’s Sam Stein) during his first news conference in February 2009.

But as for FOX, these have been relatively lean years in terms of getting the presidential nod at news conferences, particularly in light of the news outlet’s reach vis-à-vis some of the other media organizations which have received more questions.

How lean?

A Smart Politics analysis finds that ABC reporters have been called on the most frequently during Barack Obama’s solo news conferences followed by CBS, the Associated Press, and NBC with FOX News coming in at a distant ninth at less than half the rate of the top outlets and less than 40 percent of press conferences overall.

Through Monday, President Obama has held 36 solo news conferences (formal and otherwise) during his first term – press conferences not held in conjunction with another foreign head of state.

ABC News reporters have been called on by the president in 29 of them – including the broadcast outlet’s new Chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl on Monday.

CBS comes in second with 28, followed by the Associated Press with 27, and NBC with 26.

Bloomberg is #5 with 20, then Reuters with 17, and the New York Times and CNN with 16.

FOX is all the way back at #9, with Obama calling on the outlet in just 14 press conferences during his first term or 39 percent – including just once over the last six news conferences held since May 2012.

(FOX’s Ed Henry was called on and asked a question about the Benghazi fallout during Obama’s post-election conference on November 14th).

That means Obama has called on each of the Big 3 networks at approximately twice the rate as FOX, although only slightly more on fellow cable network CNN.

The frequency with which their outlet is selected for questions by the president does not change with which correspondent they send to the White House.

Former FOX Chief White House correspondent Major Garrett (now with CBS and National Journal) was called on in six of the 15 Obama news conferences during his tenure there, or 40 percent of the time.

Since Garrett’s departure, Wendell Goler, Mike Emanuel, and Ed Henry have been called on during eight of 21 news conferences collectively, or 38 percent of the time.

Overall, 50 news outlets have received at least one questions at Obama pressers, from Ebony to Stars and Stripes to Telemundo to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

As for individual reporters, Obama called on NBC’s Chuck Todd and former ABC White House correspondent Jake Tapper the most during his first term at 23 times each.

CBS’ Chip Reid is third with 14, followed by Ben Feller (AP) with 13, Julianna Goldman (Bloomberg) with 11, Ed Henry (CNN/FOX) with nine, Hans Nichols (Bloomberg) and Major Garrett (FOX/CBS) with seven, and Jackie Calmes (New York Times) and Jennifer Loven (AP) with six.

(Note: This ranking is somewhat dependent on how long a White House correspondent served in that capacity during Obama’s first term as well as how many different such correspondents a news outlet keeps on staff).

Todd, who is perhaps the King of the follow-up question, has made the most of the 23 news conferences in which his name has been called by the president.

Todd has been able to parlay this into 52 series of questions and follow-up questions (excluding multiple questions posed within one series), including multiple queries to the president on the debt ceiling on Monday.
