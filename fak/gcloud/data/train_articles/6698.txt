Hawaii Health Department Grants President Obama's Request for Certified Copies of 'Long Form' Birth Certificate





President Obama's letter to the Hawaii State Department of Health and the Director of Health's response





Department of Health's policy on the issuance of certified copies of vital records Below are responses to frequently asked questions related to all records and documents maintained by the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) related to the vital records of President Barack Hussein Obama II. Frequently requested records and documents which can be released to the public are attached by electronic link below or, for those records and documents that are not available electronically, directions are provided for requesting copies. The States public records law, the Uniform Information Practices Act (Modified) (UIPA), found at chapter 92F, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) requires that all government records be open to public inspection unless access is restricted or closed by law. Government records means information maintained by an agency in written, auditory, visual, electronic, or other physical form, see HRS §92F-3. The UIPA does not require an agency to provide access to government records that state law protects from disclosure, see, HRS §92F-13 (4), nor does it require agencies to respond to all questions asked of the agency. Unless a request for DOH records is specific enough to be understood, the request cannot be responded to by the DOH. The DOH may not have a record which is responsive to a request. The UIPA does not require an agency to compile or create information to respond to a request. State law prohibits the DOH from disclosing any vital statistics records or information contained in such records unless the requestor has a direct and tangible interest in the record, or as otherwise allowed by statute or administrative rule. See HRS §338-18. Direct and tangible interest is determined by HRS §338-18(b). In light of the unprecedented number of requests for information relating to the vital records of President Barack Hussein Obama II, the DOH has reviewed the requirements of UIPA and the confidentiality provisions of HRS Chapter 338. Based upon that review, the DOH has determined that the information listed below constitutes all of the publicly available information related to requests for vital statistics records pertaining to President Barack Hussein Obama II, and the only disclosures pertaining to those records that can be made in accordance with Hawaii law. The Department of Health is providing links to copies of the records in the form that they are available to the public. Birth Certificate or Certificate of Live Birth State law prohibits the DOH for disclosing any information about a Hawaii vital record unless the requestor has a direct and tangible interest in the record. This includes verification of vital records and all the information contained in a record. Vital records disclosure laws protect all birth, death, marriage and divorce records held by the department and all amendments, changes, supporting records, and requests related to vital records. Direct and tangible interest is determined by HRS §338-18(b). This statute may be accessed on the state legislative website at:

http://hawaii.gov/health/about/pr/2009/09-063.pdf The statements speak for themselves and there are no other public records maintained by the department related to these statements that are available to the public Records pertaining to the Department of Health database for vital statistics information: Records pertaining to the Department of Health database for vital statistics information are not required to be disclosed by the Uniform Information Practices Act because those records, by their very nature, must be confidential in order for the government to avoid the frustration of a legitimate government function (see HRS §92F-13(3)). Disclosing such information compromises the departments ability to protect the integrity of vital statistics records, to ensure their proper use, and to ensure the efficient and proper administration of the vital statistics system as is required by HRS §338-18.
