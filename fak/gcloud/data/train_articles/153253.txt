Antonio Cromartie anthem protest led to Colts cut, wife says
Antonio Cromartie’s wife says her husband was cut by the Colts because of his decision to kneel during the national anthem.

In an Instagram post Thursday that has since been deleted, Terricka Cromartie responded to recent comments from Colts owner Jim Irsay regarding players protesting the anthem. She said her husband was told not to kneel and decided to anyway, leading to his release on Oct. 4.

Cromartie was among a wave of NFL players following the lead of 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, continuing to protest racial injustice and police brutality before games.

Her comments were as follows, according to ESPN:

“You are Nothing More than an Entertainer. Just Shut and do what we say. You have No rights as along as you are working for me.. there are other places for you to fight and stand for what you believe.

“One things for sure I know my husband was told Not to take a Knee and he went with his heart and he took one. And that cost him his Job.. and Clearly this Statement backs that up... Just a Paid To put on a show.”

Cromartie, still a free agent, wrote a post on Instagram on Thursday that appeared to be in reference to the situation.

Earlier this week, Irsay suggested the players’ protests was hurting the NFL’s product.

“It hasn't been a positive thing,” Irsay said. “What we all have to be aware of as players, owners, PR people, equipment managers, is when the lights go on we are entertainment. We are being paid to put on a show. There are other places to express yourself.”

Cromartie was starting at cornerback for the Colts, and his release was labeled a football decision by head coach Chuck Pagano. Cromartie protested before his final two games with the franchise, which came as the Colts returned healthy players including top corner Vontae Davis to their secondary. He wrote another Instagram post after his release that expressed no ill will toward the franchise.
