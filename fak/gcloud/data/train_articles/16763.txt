Subject: Texas reporter, urgent inquiry for a fact check

As mentioned on the phone, we’re fact-checking a recent claim by James Quintero of the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Quintero said at SXSW Eco on Oct. 10 that when San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, “you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses” spike.

We understand Quintero based his claim on this 2012 paper<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2196481>—and I have read the paper as well as this memo<http://blogs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SF-Health-Officer-MEMO-re-Reusable-Bag-Study_V8-FIN1.pdf> from an official with San Francisco County.

My questions for the department for our story: Has there been more discussion since the paper and memo came out? Anything fresh to consider? Did the professors in their paper raise a reasonable concern or develop a rational hypothesis? Why or why not?

I’d be happy to visit more by phone or email. I hope to complete this fact check Monday.

Thanks.

I heard back from Dr. Aragón and we have nothing new to add at this time.

Thanks for your inquiry!

Did the professors (or one of them or someone on their behalf) respond to the memo in any way?

3:07 p.m.

They did respond. We agreed to disagree and they have not updated their paper since.

Los Angeles County extended Dr. Aragón work and may have published a more completed analysis. They did pass the ban on plastic bags http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-plastic-bags-20161111-story.html

The Washington Post covered the disagreement https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/02/16/is-san-franciscos-ban-on-plastic-bags-making-people-sick-perhaps-not/

I hope that helps!
