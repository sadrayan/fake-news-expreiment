to commit suicide in interrogation room

La Voz de Aztlan has received a large amount of e-mail concerning the mystery of how Ricardo Alfonso Cerna, now determined to be an immigrant from Guatemala and not Mexico, supposedly managed to pull a large .45 caliber handgun from a front pocket of his pants to shoot himself, in the head, inside the interrogation room of the San Bernardino Sheriff's Headquarters. Cerna who was arrested for the shooting injury of a S.B. Sheriff's deputy on Friday, was thoroughly searched by the arresting officers from the San Bernardino Police Department prior to turning him over to the S.B. Sheriff's. The San Bernardino Police did not find the large and heavy .45 caliber handgun in Cerna's front pant's pocket. In addition, the S.B. Sheriff's who took custody of Cerna nor the booking officers inside the jail found the gun that Cerna used in the crime on the suspect.

So how was Cerna able to magically produce the handgun from his front pocket to commit suicide inside the interrogation room? Witnesses in Muscovy, an unincorporated area of San Bernardino, believe that Cerna discarded the handgun as he attempted to hide and was recovered a few hours later by officers. This explains why neither the San Bernardino Police nor the booking officers were able to find the gun inside Cerna's pocket. The gun was actually taken into the Sheriff's headquarters by investigating officers.

So how did the gun end up in Cerna's possession inside the interrogation room? Independent investigators close to the case believe that the Sheriff's in charge of the interrogation actually handed the gun to Cerna and convinced him that it would be better for him to ended all, right there and then. According to the theory, the interrogators may have lied to Cerna that the deputy he shot died and that he was facing a bleak torturous future in prison and eventually death through capital punishment. In this situation, it is not difficult to understand why Ricardo Alfonso Cerna may have shot himself.
