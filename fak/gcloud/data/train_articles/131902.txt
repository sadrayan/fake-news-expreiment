So much success in the Trump White House, they can't even spell the w…
No matter who is in the White House, it is a big deal to win the Presidential Academic Award. But for Kendra Frautnick, the award itself had a few problems.

From her Facebook post:

That time your 8th grade daughter earned the presidential award but sadly it's from the Trump administration and they spelled success wrong. And sent it to all of the graduating 8th graders across the country who earned this award. I wish this was fake news :(

That’s right. The president sent out a letter to award winners with an obvious misspelling. Success, a word many people in politics spell daily, is not a spelling bee level word. But for the Trump administration, it is apparently enough of a stranger than a spell check was in order.

Who needs editors, right?

Don’t worry kids. Education really does matter. We promise.
