Kentucky Consular Center Information
The annual Diversity Visa (DV) program run by the Department of State makes available up to 55,000 diversity immigrant visas each year to randomly selected entrants from eligible countries. The DV lottery is run once a year, usually in October, and selectees are randomly chosen by computer, who then may apply for a diversity immigrant visa.



The program is administered by the U.S. Department of State, Kentucky Consular Center (KCC) in Williamsburg, Kentucky.

Important Notice: The Department of State has only one Kentucky Consular Center. Other organizations using similar names have no connection to the Department of State or KCC. There is no fee charged by the Department or KCC for submitting an online entry for the DV lottery program. The Kentucky Consular Center does NOT notify successful DV applicants by letter or email. Entrants must check the status of their entries by returning to the website at http://www.dvlottery.state.gov to find out if their entry was or was not selected. No other organization or company is authorized by the Department of State to notify Diversity Visa lottery applicants of their winning entry. See our Fraud Warning.

A Diversity processing fee is only charged when a winning lottery entrant applies for the Diversity visa. At the time of visa application at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, each applicant (the DV entrant and any accompanying family members) will be charged a DV processing fee and immigrant visa fee. Both of these fees are non-refundable if the visa is refused.
