Does Elizabeth Warren have blackface statues in her home!?? : The_Donâ€¦
level 2

How in the world does that look like a teddy bear? It's definitely supposed to be a black child.

Spend any time in flea markets down south and you'll see stuff like this all the time. It's not considered racist by normal people, just folk art and antiques. I know black families that have old collections of stuff like this that was passed down to them by their grandparents. It's just history.
