Neglected Parasitic Infections (NPIs) in the United States
Parasitic infections are typically associated with poor and often marginalized communities in low-income countries. However, these infections are also present in the United States.

The neglected parasitic infections (NPIs) are a group of five parasitic diseases that have been targeted by the CDC as priorities for public health action based on the

• Number of people infected

• Severity of the illnesses

• Ability to prevent and treat them

These infections are considered neglected because relatively little attention has been devoted to their surveillance, prevention, and/or treatment.

Anyone, regardless of race or economic status, can become infected although minorities, immigrants, and people living in poor or disadvantaged communities appear to be most at risk.

CDC is working to protect people from these health threats by

• Increasing awareness among physicians and the public

• Synthesizing the existing data to help better understand these infections

• Improving diagnostic testing

• Advising on treatment, including distributing otherwise unavailable drugs for certain infections (Chagas disease)
