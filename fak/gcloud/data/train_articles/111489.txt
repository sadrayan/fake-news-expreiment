In Practice, Chimp Memory Study Flawed
In the News Focus story “Did working memory spark creative culture?” (9 April, p. 160), M. Balter reports that “[c]himpanzees are better than humans at some memory tasks,” based on work with the chimpanzee Ayumu (1). In fact, that study contained a fundamental flaw.

Ayumu received extensive practice on the task; the humans to whom he was compared received none. At least one subsequent study (2) shows that, with even very moderate practice, humans can match Ayumu's performance.

In spite of this basic methodological error, the claim of superior spatial working memory in chimpanzees has been widely and uncritically repeated in the popular and scientific media. Propagation of this incorrect idea distracts from more fruitful explorations of chimpanzee memory and undermines ongoing research into human and primate evolution.
