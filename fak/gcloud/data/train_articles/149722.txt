About Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex
Delaware North Operates the Visitor Complex as a NASA Contractor

As a NASA contractor, we take great pride in operating the visitor complex providing hospitality services for Kennedy Space Center. From operating the Kennedy Space Center Bus Tour to serving lunch at the Moon Rock Cafe, our goal is to provide stewardship and hospitality in special places dedicated to creating memorable guest experiences as unique as the destination. The visitor complex is completely funded by visitor-generated revenue and no U.S. tax dollars are used to provide visitor access to the historic birthplace of American spaceflight. As a Smithsonian Affiliate, we offer the chance to view artifacts of NASA’s Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle Programs in the context of exhibits and attractions that tell the NASA story.

The places Delaware North operates, including hotels, resorts, cultural attractions and parks, make countless memories for millions of guests each and every year. We strive to bring rare attention to detail at every property in our care, and for each and every individual we serve.
