ESPN Graphic Shows Little Leaguer Listed Adult Film Star as His Favorite Actor
The Little League World Series is all about seeing potential MLB stars in the making as some of the best kids in the sport go out there and try to make an early name for themselves and punch that ticket to Williamsport.





The athletes also get a chance to come up with custom introductions for ESPN. They're asked to share with television viewers some of their favorite things, including professional ballplayers, teams, hobbies, etc. One 13-year-old little leaguer, however, will definitely be getting the child-lock setting put back on his electronic devices after one recent admission:

Honestly, at 13-years-old, I was still thinking about playing video games and sports with friends and would never have known of an "actor" like Johnny Sins who stars in, *ahem*, pornographic films.





Call me a late bloomer, perhaps?





The internet has certainly grown since my childhood years, and Jack Buening is perhaps a little too informed. He has even drawn the attention of Sins himself, who was tickled pink over the whole thing.

 Love this kid! No fact checking on the LLWS?!? Haha hop he watches my vlogs and not porn!  https://t.co/uL50ByV7Ri — Johnny Sins (@JohnnySins) August 11, 2018

Yea, that's a major swing and a miss on ESPN's part for not looking into precisely what ol' Johnny does for a living-- and letting a 13-year-old boy get away with such a thing on a network that's owned by Disney.





We expect that graphic to be changed next time Beuning is up to bat. But at this point, the message has already been sent loud and clear.
