Support Accountability Journalism

At OpenSecrets.org we offer in-depth, money-in-politics stories in the public interest. Unlike many media outlets, we keep our content paywall-free and accessible to all. And whether you’re reading about 2020 presidential fundraising, conflicts of interest or “dark money” influence, we produce this content with a small, but dedicated team.

OpenSecrets is independent and non-partisan, allowing us to write about what is most important to our readers, free of commercial and political bias. We give it to you straight, with fact-based stories that do not favor any one party or viewpoint. This allows us to expose powerful interests and promote transparency without being beholden — to anyone.

Every donation we receive from users like you goes directly into promoting high-quality data analysis and investigative journalism that you can trust. Your help is essential to maintain OpenSecrets as not just a news source that cuts through the noise, but as a force multiplier that provides the public and reporters with data to defend democracy. Please support our work and keep this resource free. Thank you.
