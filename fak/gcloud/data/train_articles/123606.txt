Pokémon GO Safety Tips

We hope that everyone is having a lot of fun playing Pokémon GO! To help you stay safe on your journey to become the very best, we’ve listed a few important safety tips below.

* When you’re out and about playing Pokémon GO, stay aware of your surroundings at all times—especially when traveling alone or in areas you’re not familiar with. Whenever you start the app, you’ll see a reminder to help you keep this precaution in mind.

* To make sure you and those around you are safe, do not play Pokémon GO while riding a bike, driving a vehicle, operating heavy machinery, or doing anything else that requires your full attention.

* If a Pokémon appears in an inaccessible location, or in a place where it might not be safe to approach it (for example, on a construction site or on private property), do not try to catch it. There will always be other chances to catch that Pokémon! The same goes for PokéStops and Gyms. Also, if you see a PokéStop or Gym that you believe isn’t in a safe location, fill out the form on this page to notify Niantic: https://support.pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=341148

* When using the camera function in Pokémon GO, make sure everyone in the photo is OK with having their picture taken and that there isn’t anything personal in the photo that you wouldn’t want to share.

* Schedule regular breaks while you’re out exploring. This will help you remain alert and energized during your Pokémon GO adventures.

* If you’re a parent, make use of the smartphone’s parental controls, which may provide features to limit playtime or in-app purchases.

We hope these guidelines will help make sure you have an exciting experience when playing Pokémon GO while keeping safety in mind. So what are you waiting for? Get up and GO!
