Rep. Taylor Co-Sponsors Bill to Make Health Care Pricing Transparent
Washington, D.C. – Congressman Scott Taylor today announced his co-sponsorship of H.R. 4808, the Transparent Health Care Pricing Act of 2018, introduced by Representative Ed Perlmutter (CO-07) on January 16, 2018. This legislation requires entities that offer or furnish health care related products or services to the public to disclose the price for those products and services at the point of purchase and on the internet. Health care-providing entities must specifically disclose all prices, including wholesale, retail, and discounted prices, that are accepted as payment in full for products and services provided to individual consumers. The legislation also provides for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to investigate and impose civil penalties on entities that fail to comply with this requirement.

“Each year, Americans are forced to navigate a complex and costly health care system that leaves them with more questions than answers. By making health care prices publicly available, we can empower consumers and spur competition which will ultimately bring down health care costs for everyone and increase accountability. My office will also be working on legislation to expand consumer access to health care costs so that they can make the best decision for themselves and their families,” said Congressman Scott Taylor.
