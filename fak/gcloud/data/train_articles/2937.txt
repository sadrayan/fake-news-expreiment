Cassidy Praises Grimm-Cassidy Flood Insurance Reform Becoming Law
BATON ROUGE – Congressman Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) praised the signing of the Grimm-Cassidy amended version of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (H.R. 3370) into law. This legislation, which Dr. Cassidy co-wrote in the House with Rep. Michael Grimm of New York, will provide long-term flood insurance relief for Louisiana families. Dr. Cassidy offered the following statement:

“Today is a great day for Louisiana. The Grimm-Cassidy flood insurance reforms will reinstate grandfathered rates, cap premium increases, reform the FEMA flood mapping process and help stabilize our housing market. Today’s signing was made possible due to the broad coalition we built to push the House, Senate and President to back the legislation.”

A broad bi-partisan coalition of Members of Congress, realtors, homebuilders, credit unions, bankers and over 200 stakeholder groups around this country supported the passage of the Grimm-Cassidy Substitute Amendment to H.R. 3370. Below are major milestones that led to enactment of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014:
