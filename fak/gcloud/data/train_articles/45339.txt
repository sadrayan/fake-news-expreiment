Digital Ad: Bill Nelson & Elizabeth Warren’s $32 Trillion Health Care Plan
– The NRSC released new paid Facebook petition ads this week which detail the close ties between Bill Nelson and #resistance leader Elizabeth Warren, who is back in the news after calling for a single-payer health care plan. Warren called socialized medicine “the next step” last week and encouraged fellow Democrats, like Nelson, to run on her plan in 2018.

Obamacare has been a disaster, with costs soaring and choices dwindling across the country. But Warren’s solution is to go even further, with a single-payer health care system that would be absolutely devastating for Florida families and businesses. Recent estimates place a $32 trillion price tag on Warren’s radical government-run health care idea. Bill Nelson has followed Warren in near-lockstep in the Senate, voting with his good friend 90% of the time. Will he also support Warren’s socialized health care plan?

The auto-play ads urge voters to tell Bill Nelson to oppose Warren’s single-payer plan. The ads will run statewide while Nelson is home for the July 4th recess and throughout the month.

“Bill Nelson and Elizabeth Warren are two peas in a pod, but Florida families can’t afford a $32 trillion health care boondoggle,” said NRSC Communications Director Katie Martin. “Floridians deserve to know if Bill is going to sacrifice their well-being to support Elizabeth Warren and her extreme government-run health care plan.”
