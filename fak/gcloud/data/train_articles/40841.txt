Affordable coverage - HealthCare.gov Glossary
A job-based health plan covering only the employee that costs 9.56% or less of the employee’s household income. If a job-based plan is “affordable,” and meets the “minimum value” standard, you're not eligible for a premium tax credit if you buy a Marketplace insurance plan instead.

The plan used to define affordability is the lowest priced “self-only” plan the employer offers — meaning a plan covering only the employee, not dependents. This is true even if you’re enrolled in a plan that costs more or covers dependents.

the employee, not dependents. This is true even if you’re enrolled in a plan that costs more or covers dependents. The cost is the amount the employee would pay for the insurance, not the plan’s total premium.

for the insurance, not the plan’s total premium. The employee’s total household income is used. Total household income includes income from everybody in the household who’s required to file a tax return.

Example 1

Employee’s monthly household income = $4,083 (about $49,000 per year)

income = $4,083 (about $49,000 per year) 9.56% of the employee’s monthly household income = $390

Monthly cost to the employee of the lowest-priced plan the employer offers for self-only coverage = $300

Is the plan affordable? YES. The employee’s share of the lowest cost self-only plan ($300) is less than 9.56% of the employee’s household income ($390).

Example 2

Employee’s monthly household income = $2,333 (about $28,000 per year)

income = $2,333 (about $28,000 per year) 9.56% of the employee’s monthly household income = $223

Monthly cost to the employee of the lowest-priced plan the employer offers for self-only coverage = $275

Is the plan affordable? NO. The employee’s share of the lowest-cost self-only plan ($275) is more than 9.56% of the employee’s household income ($223).

To find out if your employer’s plan meets the affordability standard, ask your employer. You can also ask them to fill out the Employer Coverage Tool (PDF).
