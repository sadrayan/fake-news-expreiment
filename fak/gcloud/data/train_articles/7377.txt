Migration Data
To see a graph of migration over time between any two states, simply click on any of the figures below.

Pick a state, a start date and an end date, and this tool will tell you how many people and how much income moved to and from that state, from and to every other state, in the time period you've chosen. We show only state to state migration, and exclude foreign immigration and emigration. See our list of Frequently Asked Questions for more information.
