BREAKING: Trump Ally Robert Kraft Fires Kneeling Players: ‘Get the H*ll Off My Field!’
Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, walked onto his field this afternoon and fired two players who refused to stand for the national anthem. According to the team’s PR department, the players were given the choice to remain inside the locker room in protest, rather than on camera making people uncomfortable

Right on live television, Kraft walked up to the players and uttered two obvious words, “you’re fired,” before he yelled, “No get the hell off my field!” Kraft has been very vocal about his support for President Trump on this issue, though he’s left the decision making to his coaching team. Until now.

“There comes a point when an owner has to take responsibility and makle things happen. I did this because it was the right thing to do. God Bless President Trump.”

Robert Kraft is a good man running a great organization. The New Patriots are hereby off the boycott list. If you’ve burned your Brady gear, it’s time to go get some more. This team is a class act that won’t put up with any disrespect for the flag.
