Statement from Planned Parenthood Federation of America Senior Director of Medical Services Dr. Deborah Nucatola on Breast Health Services For Immediate Release: Jan. 30, 2014 Share This Twitter Facebook Tumblr Pinterest Google Plus

“In short, Planned Parenthood helps women nationwide get access to mammograms, as part of the range of health care Planned Parenthood health centers provide to nearly three million people a year. Planned Parenthood doctors and nurses do this like any other primary care provider or ob-gyn does.

“Planned Parenthood health centers play a critical role in providing breast health care to the millions of women who rely on them — clinical breast exams are provided at Planned Parenthood health centers as a part of well-woman care. Each year, Planned Parenthood doctors and nurses provide nearly 750,000 clinical breast exams.

“Women rely on Planned Parenthood for referrals for and financial help with mammograms and specialized diagnostic follow-up tests (like ultrasounds and biopsies) when indicated by age, history and/or clinical breast exam.

“Like the vast majority of primary care physicians and ob-gyns, Planned Parenthood doctors and nurses refer patients to other facilities for mammograms based on breast exams, age, or family history. For many women, Planned Parenthood is the only health care provider they will see all year, and thus the only way they will get a referral for a mammogram.

“Planned Parenthood medical professionals have established relationships with local breast imaging centers and specialists. In some instances case management is done by the Planned Parenthood health center and in others the management is coordinated by the specialist.”
