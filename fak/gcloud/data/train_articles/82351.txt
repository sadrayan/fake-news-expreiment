Such a contract may provide for a fixed annual charge to be paid at the times agreed upon and stipulated in the contract; or for compensation based on a stipulated price for each run, call, or emergency or based on the elapsed time of service required for each run, call, or emergency, or based on any combination of these.

Expenditures of a district for ambulance service or emergency medical service, whether pursuant to contract or otherwise, are lawful expenditures, regardless of whether the district or the party with which it contracts charges an additional fee to users of the service.

(C) The board of trustees may enter into a contract with any person, municipal corporation, township, or other political subdivision, and any political subdivision may contract with the board, for the operation and maintenance of emergency medical services facilities regardless of whether the facilities used are owned or leased by the district, by another political subdivision, or by the contractor.
