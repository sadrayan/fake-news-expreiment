McConnell: TARP worked
It’s not popular with his party, but Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell is saying that the Wall Street bailout was a success – one year after the historic $700 billion vote.

The Troubled Asset Relief Program has “succeeded in stabilizing the banking system,” McConnell told reporters Friday.

The bailout has been a bane of conservatives who detest such deep government intervention into the private sector.

McConnell conceded, however, that he was “disquieted” that the bill led to widespread government intervention into the insurance, student loan and auto industries. He said he didn’t expect the bill would be used as a “permission slip” to invest in banks.

“Most people believe it did stabilize the financial system,” McConnell said Friday. “In my view it did not justify all of these other big government expenses that’s gone on this year.”

As financial regulation reform looms in the Senate, McConnell said the last year’s experience illustrates that lawmakers need to be “very, very careful” when re-writing rules for the sector.

“We need to make sure we don’t end up incentivizing companies to get too big to fail,” McConnell said.
