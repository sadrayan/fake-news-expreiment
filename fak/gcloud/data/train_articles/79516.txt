FIRST REGULAR SESSION

HOUSE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR

House Concurrent Resolution No. 16

95TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY

INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE TRACY.

1411L.02C

Whereas, President of the United States Barack H. Obama has, by executive order, ordered the Pentagon to close the Guantanamo Bay prison within one year; and

Whereas, many of the detainees currently imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay are suspected terrorists and have committed or are accused of committing egregious crimes against the United States of America, including but not limited to orchestrating attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and another target in the nation's Capitol on September 11, 2001; and

Whereas, the safety and security of Missouri citizens is an issue of utmost importance to the Missouri General Assembly; and

Whereas, the manner and route of relocation and the ultimate destination of these terror suspects when transferred from the Guantanamo Bay prison remains unclear; and

Whereas, the transportation of these terror suspects through Missouri as they are routed to another military or federal detention center could pose an unnecessary risk to the safety, security, and lives of our citizens; and

Whereas, the temporary internment of these terror suspects in Missouri as they are transported to another military or federal detention center could pose an unnecessary risk to the safety, security, and lives of our citizens; and

Whereas, Missouri seeks the support of the state governments of Missouri's eight contiguous states - Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Tennessee - in notifying our public safety officials of any attempt to transport terror suspects across our borders:

Now, therefore, be it resolved that the members of the House of Representatives of the Ninety-fifth General Assembly, First Regular Session, the Senate concurring therein, hereby strongly urge the United States Congress to reject any act of asylum, containment, transport, imprisonment, or medical care in regard to suspected terrorists from any United States operated foreign prison present within the State of Missouri; and

Be it further resolved that the Missouri General Assembly also encourages all of Missouri's contiguous states to adopt similar resolutions; and

Be it further resolved that the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of Representatives be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this resolution for Barack H. Obama, President of the United States; the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the United States Senate; the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives; each member of the Missouri Congressional delegation; and the Governor of each of Missouri's eight contiguous states, and the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives of each of the legislatures of Missouri's eight contiguous states.
