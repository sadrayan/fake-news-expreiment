"SOME PEOPLE

Some people come into our lives and quickly go.

Some people move our souls to dance.

They awaken us to understanding with the passing whisper of their wisdom.

Some people make the sky more beautiful to gaze upon.

They stay in our lives for a while, leave footprints on our hearts,

and we are never ever the same."



Sending love and caring thoughts during this time of loss. Your daughter was a beautiful and gifted young soul whose time and place on earth will never be forgotten. Sincerely, PM

Amanda Wilson I didn't know Carmen or your family but after looking at all your beautiful photos I feel like I do. I shed many tears while watching that incredible memorial tribute. Carmen was a bright light in the world and though she may be gone that bright light lives on. I lost a child myself 16 years ago and can say that only time and faith will bring you comfort and some measure of peace. Many people will talk about closure. I don't believe there is closure when you lose a child. Closure for me is when I'm reunited with my son in heaven. I don't want closure on earth because that would mean he is no longer in my life when I know he's around me all the time and always in my heart. I can't imagine the immeasurable pain you are in losing your beautiful girl the way you did. I can only hope she went home immediately with no suffering or pain. God bless all of you, her extended family and friends as you mourn the passing of such a special young lady. Just know she's never truly gone. May God bless you all.

Julie D I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine losing a child, nor the pain that you must feel. At times like this, many people ask why? The Bible gives us all the answers. It says at 1 John 5:19 that the whole world is in the power of Satan, who influences people to do bad things. Soon Satan will be destroyed forever, and because he knows this, he has been intensifying his actions to cause harm. That's why things like this happen. The good news is that the pain that you are feeling because of losing your daughter will be gone soon, because death, pain and mourning will be gone forever, and the Bible says this at Revelation 21:4. The Bible says at Psalms 37:9-11, 29, and Acts 24:1, that God will bring people back to life when all the wicked people are gone forever. Until then, your daughter is sleeping, waiting for her time to come back with you again. I hope this comforted you and gave you peace. Please talk with any of Jehovah's Witnesses for more help in coping and understanding the Bible.

Pat Seaney For the last 2 weeks, I have been replaying in my head, the words of Carmen's classmate who spoke of her at the Never Again Tallahassee rally, who described how she gave him emotional support when he was having a hard time fitting in at the middle school. Knowing how difficult this age can be for kids, she was obviously exceptionally compassionate, and pure of heart, to see his struggle and risk her standing to be supportive of him. I am far from a biblical scholar, but I can't help but think of the Sermon on the Mount, when thinking of her in the context of his anecdote:



"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.....Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven".



I have faith that this will be her reward. I can't imagine your heartbreak, but I hope that this thought might bring you some measure of solace.

Marylou Arias I don't remember much of Carmen or when/where I met her. But she is in my heart because I remember her smile it would light up the whole place. When I was really depressed her smile would light it all up. I hadn't seen Carmen or Talked to her in a long time and I really don't remember where we met. But she was incredible... I'm so sorry for not being there and staying as a friend till she passed but she will always be in my heart and memories.

Sorry for you loss..

Sorry I wasn't there to be her friend for the long run...

John Robinson I'm not related to the family nor friends but I was looking at the family pictures very Beautiful Family I can not imagine the depth your family loss I am praying for your family will feel the presence of God my deepest condolences to your family and friends also close friends praying that the faith of God comfort your family

Silvia Pipiras Dear Schentrup family, My heart goes out to you for the loss of your precious daughter. Our children are a gift from God, and from the photos it can be seen how much you love Carmen and what a happy life you provided for her. How well you took care of that precious gift! God understands and feels your pain also - His own Son died a violent undeserved death so that we may all have the hope of everlasting life when His Kingdom comes and His will is done on earth, as it is in heaven. I pray that you hold on to His beautiful promises and that they may comfort you. I also want to let you know that your family is precious to me and my family.

I'm so sorry for your loss, such a beautiful family. Judie Volpe With a very heavy heart please except my condolences. May the memories of this beautiful ANGEL help you heal.
