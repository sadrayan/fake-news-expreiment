Romneycare Was Model for Obamacare
The liberal health care plan Mitt Romney engineered in Massachusetts was the model for Obamacare. The plans are nearly identical. Both plans rely on mandates requiring individuals to purchase health insurance to avoid being fined by the government.

Romney “forcefully insisted” upon including the individual mandate and has been adamant in supporting the idea, saying, “I like mandates,” and touting the individual mandate as “a terrific idea. … I think you’re going to find, when it’s all said and done … we’ll end up with a nation that’s taken a mandate approach.” [1] [2] [3]

One of Romney’s top advisors on health care attended five meetings at the White House, including a meeting with President Obama, to help the Obama administration copy Romney’s plan. He called Romney “the father of health-care reform.” [1]

In addition to being the blueprint for Obamacare, Romneycare killed more than 18,000 jobs in Massachusetts in 2010 and cost $8 billion. [4] [5]
