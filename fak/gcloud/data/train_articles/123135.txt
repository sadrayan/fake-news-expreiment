2012 Vice Presidential Debate
Vice Presidential debate, Oct. 11, 2012: Held in Danville, Kentucky, at Centre College

Moderated by Martha Raddatz of ABC News

Sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates (a private bipartisan group which excludes third party candidates from debates)





Commentary:

Biden sure smiles a lot. And laughs a lot. And interrupts a lot.

And Ryan sure succeeded at looking vice-presidential by NOT smiling too much and NOT laughing too much and NOT interrupting too much.

Biden did fine on the issues -- he responded well to all of Ryan's points, and embarrassed Ryan by forcing him to admit that there was no Romney-Ryan plan to balance the budget (Romney & Ryan say they will cut spending without raising taxes, by closing loopholes, but Obama & Biden say there are not enough loopholes to do that, and choosing any loopholes is politically challenging. Ryan's response was to claim, as Romney did, that a Reagan-Tip-O'Neill-like discussion will take place to determine which loophooles to close).

Perhaps if one reads the transcript one would accept Biden's argument. But watching the vice president of the United States show off his dental whitening and chuckle repeatedly at a subordinate politician turned off most viewers to listening to Biden's content at all.

The mainstream media calls this one a "draw." We call a "draw" against an incumbent vice president a victory for his challenger.
