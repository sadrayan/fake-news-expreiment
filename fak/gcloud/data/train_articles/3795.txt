Here's how universities are offering support to students after Trump's election
Following a tragedy, universities often pacify student fears by hosting forums, self-care events and support groups.

Following the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States, many universities have followed that same formula.

And some colleges are getting creative to pacify student concerns.

Here’s a look at some of the varied approaches to student support on campus in the wake of a stunning end to a tumultuous, intense election cycle.

Self-care at Boston University

Boston University released a self-care guide for Terriers who feel emotionally impacted by recent events.

“If you feel distressed by what is in the media, for the moment, limit your consumption of Facebook, Twitter and other social media sources that are likely to be full of distressing material,” reads one tip, curated by Boston University’s Dean of Students. “This also includes watching and reading the news. There are apps and websites such as LeechBlock, or SelfControl that can help you by temporarily blocking access to social media or certain websites.”

Other tips include writing down what you’re thankful for, joining more student groups and meditating.

Boston University’s Center of Gender, Sexuality and Activism also hosted a “Post Election Recovery” meeting.

“We had the overhead lights off and Christmas lights on, so it was really relaxing. People just sat around and chilled and drank egg nog and hot chocolate and ranted and stuff,” said Isabel Stevenson, a Boston University sophomore and a co-liaison for BU CGSA. “It was very comforting.”

The CGSA also hosted a “Self-Care Sunday: Stress Cleaning” event.

“We can’t control much in the world right now, but we can at least try to keep the space as clean as possible! Join us in our effort to clean out our back storage room so we can finally use it again (for fun? for comfort? for… storage?),” reads the event description on Facebook.

Artistic action at Maryland Institute College of Art

The Maryland Institute College of Art called students to artistic action on Thursday. The Chair of the Sculpture department sent out an email urging those affected to put the swell of emotion to good use.

“And to my follow artists, just one word. The time for the symbolic has ended. Art is now a tool — not to make the system work better, but to change the system. The need for creativity and for tools to help with political imagination are greater than ever,” the email read, quoting Tania Bruguera, a famous Cuban artist.

#NotMyPresident at Lafayette College

At Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, a school-sponsored discussion about the election inspired senior Ryan Cerbone to create a private Facebook group titled “#NotMyPresidentLafayette.”

The movement was meant not to reject Trump’s candidacy, Cerbone explained, but instead explain that the election results don’t ideologically represent all people.

“As a gay man, I don’t feel that he is a president that will represent me and my minority group. I know a lot of other minority groups echo this sentiment,” Cerbone said.

He channeled this sentiment into a poster project sponsored by StandUp, a social justice student organization.

During an admissions event, about 300 posters spanned the campus in protest of Trump’s election, reported the Lafayette, the school’s student-run newspaper. The posters featured a variety of anti-Trump sayings, such as “Wants to appoint a Supreme Court Justice who will overturn marriage equality? Not my president,” or “Thinks Global Warming is a hoax started by China? Not my president.”

“I figured that this is a way we can show prospective students that we’re a politically active campus that doesn’t tolerate the hate speech and intolerance that President-Elect Trump engages in,” Cerbone said.

Civic conversation at Pace University

The Women’s Political Caucus at Pace University is hosting a New York City council member, Helen Rosenthal, to talk about the importance of civic involvement following the results.

“I think students everywhere are really afraid and need inspiration from current stakeholders,” said Larissa Szilagyi, the founder of the Women’s Political Caucus at Pace. “A lot of colleges are doing programming to help alleviate this anxiety — not because of their allegiance toward a conservative or liberal agenda, but because communities need to inhabit safe spaces. These programs help show students that we can overcome and we shall overcome oppression.”

She added that Pace isn’t necessarily a liberal or conservative college, and houses many diverse groups.

Counseling at University of Kansas

University of Kansas’s Office of Multicultural Affairs makes an active effort to help students grieve over events “that affect the whole campus,” said Sarah Ingham, a junior at University of Kansas.

She said she was grateful to the Office of Multicultural Affairs for being an outlet for students to grieve over troublesome events in the past, such as the Orlando shooting.

“Because of the climate of this campus after the election and the number of students who would rather stay at home than go to class, I think keeping the campus active and loving and supportive is the best way to help students feel safer on campus,” she said.

Statehouse outreach at Tufts University

Tufts University, outside of Boston, held arts and crafts sessions, reported the Wall Street Journal.

But that’s not all. “We will also be meeting with our representatives at the Massachusetts Statehouse this week to see how we can help them advance the progressive agenda in the Commonwealth,” senior Benjamin Kaplan, president of Tufts Democrats, said. “In the coming months, we will organize for a $15 minimum wage, equal protection for transgender identifying individuals and other progressive causes in Massachusetts.”

“Speed advising” at Michigan State

At Michigan State University, the College of Communication Arts and Sciences hosted “Speed Advising,” where students could debrief any emotional responses and concerns about the president-elect.

“Students and the community here at MSU need to feel secure, and through these advising and community events, they can be assured that they’re not alone and we will accept everyone no matter their circumstances,” said Justin Mondal, a junior at MSU.

MSU had a series of peaceful protests during the week, featuring student-made signs.

“After the rally, I realized that the only way that we can move forward as a nation is to set aside our common idiosyncrasies, look at the the big picture, and spread as much love as possible,” Mondal said.
