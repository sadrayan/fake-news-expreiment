The 23% reduction in ozone levels in Texas compared to the national average 12% reduction was calculated using the data in the attached excel spreadsheet. The source of this data is EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS) data base.

Statewide NOx emissions from large stationary sources decreased by 62.5% from 2000 to 2012.

2012: 298,243 tpy

2000: 796,251 tpy

62.5% decrease

(note: emissions from routine operations that were reported to the TCEQ per the reporting of 30 TAC Section 101.10)

Below are some examples of legislative actions and TCEQ rules that have resulted in NOx reductions from stationary sources during this time period.

In 1999, the Texas Legislature enacted Senate Bill 7, which required significant reductions from power plants in Texas.

The Texas Legislature has enacted a number of bills for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs in the state, which also helps reduce emissions from power plant. In 2001, the installed wind capacity in ERCOT was approximately 1,000 megawatts. Currently, ERCOT has more than 11,000 megawatts of wind capacity and Texas leads the country in wind generation.

TCEQ has adopted a number of regulations that required NOx reductions from stationary sources since 2000. Some examples of these regulations include:

Mass Emission Cap and Trade program in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria ozone nonattainment area (adopted in 2000);

Regional NOx rules for Portland cement kilns (adopted in 2000);

NOx rules for the Dallas-Fort Worth 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area (adopted in 2007).

Please find anthropogenic source (non-point sources and point source) NOx emissions data below for 1999 and 2011.

Non-point source (area and mobile sources) statewide NOx emissions in tons per year

1999: 1,569,854

2011: 910,551

Reduction 42%

Point source (large stationary sources) statewide NOx emissions in tons per year

1999: 848,513

2011: 323,067

Reduction 62%

(note: emissions from routine operations that were reported to the TCEQ per the reporting of 30 TAC Section 101.10)

1999 – 2011 inventories were used for the above calculations because the statewide area and mobile (non-point) source inventories are developed on a triennial (periodic) basis for submission to the EPA per federal reporting requirements.
