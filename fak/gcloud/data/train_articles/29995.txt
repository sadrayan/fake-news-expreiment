Brown Statement on CBO Analysis of Republican Healthcare Plan
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) today issued the following statement after the Congressional Budget Office analysis found that the House Republican healthcare replacement bill will result in 14 million more uninsured people by 2018 and 24 million more uninsured by 2026. In total, the CBO estimated that 52 million Americans would remain uninsured in 2026 – nearly double today’s number of uninsured.

“This report affirms the fears I’ve heard from Ohioans that this plan will kick millions off their insurance and drive up costs for others, especially older Americans,” said Brown. “More than 200,000 Ohioans have received treatment for opioid addiction through the Affordable Care Act and we can’t leave them, working Ohioans, and people with disabilities with nowhere to turn. It’s shameful Washington politicians who get taxpayer-funded healthcare are continuing to force this bill on the American people even after learning it will take away coverage from 14 million Americans by next year.”
