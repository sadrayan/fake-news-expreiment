The Next Terror Attack Might Just Happen On July 22nd 2017 According To A Dark & Scary Theory
The next terror attack might just take place on July 22nd 2017. That's not me saying it. That's a theory that has emerged on the internet after having observed a host of previous terror attacks.

Why July 22nd 2017 you ask?

For some reason, the number 22 holds a lot of significance and seems to have a rather sinister link to the events of previous attacks—the attack in Munich on July, 22 2016, the attack in Brussels on March, 22 2016, the Lee Rigby murder on May 22, 2013 and the terror attack in Norway on July 22, 2011. If the pattern is anything to go by, then 22nd July 2017 could spell doom. Each attack has come after a gap of one month.

Even Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, announced in a statement that another terror attack was imminent and raised the threat level in England to critical.

The suicide bomber responsible for the Manchester terror attack, Salman Abedi, was all of 22-years-old and was supposed to be a friend of an ISIS recruiter who is said to have persuaded hundreds to go to Syria. The bomb caused 22 deaths in Manchester.

Social media users even took to their respective platforms to talk about the ominous threat that surrounded the sinister theory. Some said, “I think it's more than a coincidence. It's shocking and scary. So 22 March, May and July every year will be a scary time of each year.” While another added “This is more than concerning.”

Twitter users, too expressed concern and fear around the theory.

Isis attacks in Manchester, Westminster, Brussels, failed attempt in Exeter and Lee Rigby's murder ...all happened on 22nd, coincidence? — Bexy Boo (@BexSum) May 23, 2017

There, are of course others, too who seem to think that there is no such pattern. Some reminded, “The Tunisia beach attack was on 26/06/2015 and Paris was 13/11/2015.” Another stated, “The lorry attack 14/07/2015 plus all the others 7/7 and 9/11.” And yet others opined, “This will be a theory if people miss the other dates out. You can make theories from most things if things are missed out.” And they are right, too.

At this point, anything can and cannot be believed. One thing is certain from it all. An attack is imminent. It's just a matter of time. And when it hits, humanity needs to unite. This is not an attack on mere lives. It's an attack on the spirit of humanity in the world.
