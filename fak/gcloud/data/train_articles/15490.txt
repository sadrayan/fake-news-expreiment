Does ATPE see Patrick as leading the charge? Why or why not?:

“We absolutely do not see Patrick as the leading charge. Along with other members of the education community, the Association of Texas Professional Educators (ATPE) was at the forefront of the fight to fully fund public education. We were in negotiations with several key senators including Sen. Patrick. While there were various senators who were receptive and even supportive of our idea, Sen. Patrick was not one of them. He may have eventually gotten on board, however he did not lead the charge.”
