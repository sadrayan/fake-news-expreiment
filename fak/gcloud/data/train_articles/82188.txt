Do you think getting a government-issued photo ID is easy? Think again!

State voter photo ID laws and other suppressive legislation have swept the nation recently, threatening to roll back the hard-won right of every American citizen to participate freely in our Nation's democratic processes. These newly enacted laws disenfranchise many voters including minorities, low-income persons, senior citizens, voters with disabilities and students.

Restrictive voter ID laws are truly a "solution in search of a problem," since the issue they purport to address - impersonation of voters at the polls - is practically nonexistent, and states already have numerous protections in place to ensure that this type of fraud does not occur and penalties in the rare event that it does. Therefore, these newly enacted voter photo ID requirements serve only to remove eligible voters from our democracy and are NOT needed to stop potential impersonation voter fraud. So why are these laws being enacted?

Our fundamental right to vote is too important for us to allow these assaults to continue.

Add your name to the growing number of Americans who are saying, "Enough is enough! Stop these harmful laws and focus on real reforms that will expand access to our democracy for all Americans."
