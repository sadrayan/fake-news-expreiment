Is Tim Kaine married?
These days, the woman most publicly standing by Senator Tim Kaine's side is Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But Clinton's newly-minted running mate has a woman by his side in his private life, too.

Kaine married Anne Holton in 1984, after the pair met during their respective studies at Harvard Law School. Ironically, Holton's father -- A. Linwood Holton Jr. -- had served as Virginia's governor just a few years before.

Holton worked as both a legal aid attorney and a juvenile and domestic relations District Court judge. Then, when her husband was elected Virginia governor in 2006 (like father, like son-in-law) -- Holton dedicated her efforts as first lady to reforming the state's foster care system. Specifically, she focused on older children who often remain in the system for the longest periods of time.

After Kaine's term ended, current Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe appointed her as the state's secretary of education in 2014. She stepped down from that position this week.

So, like Bill and Hillary Clinton, Kaine and his wife are twoJuris Doctors who met in law school and went into politics.
