Senators Sue, Say Bush Veto Illegal

At issue is $16 million Bush cut out of $39.5 million lawmakers set aside to help more than 200 public schools plan for and begin implementing an extended school year - going from 180 to 210 days of classes.

TALLAHASSEE - The Florida Senate went to court on Wednesday in its battle with Gov. Jeb Bush over just how far the chief executive can go in tinkering with a state budget bill passed by the Legislature.

The Senate, which is seeking a ruling from the state Supreme Court, contends the state Constitution and prior court rulings prevent a governor from selectively slicing and dicing specific line-item appropriations.

``The Florida Constitution is greater than any governor or legislative body - it is the underlying document that maintains the integrity of this great state,'' said Senate President Toni Jennings, R-Orlando. ``Therefore, it is up to us to ensure that the Constitution remains strong.''

Bush killed off part of the extended year funding when he vetoed more than $313 million out of the $49 billion state budget plan. He left in the budget an amount he considered appropriate for schools to begin planning for a longer school year but cut out the money needed to put it into action.

``The governor has total authority to wipe out a fund, but he must do 100 percent,'' said Steve Kahn, the Senate's general counsel. ``He cannot change the definition by reducing an item. He must take all of it or none of it.''

The legality of Bush's action was first questioned by House Speaker John Thrasher, R-Orange Park. But Thrasher, Bush's staunchest legislative ally, declined to join in the Senate's legal challenge.

An aide to Jennings insisted the legal action is not a personal attack on the governor, even though many senators were angered by the extent of Bush's vetoes and the number of special legislative projects that fell to the veto pen.
