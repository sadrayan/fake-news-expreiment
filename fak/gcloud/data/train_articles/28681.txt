Facing veto-proof majorities, Trump signs Russia sanctions bill
President Trump has signed a bill that sanctions Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and limits the executive branch's ability to alter sanctions regarding Russia.

Trump also issued a signing statement along with the bill — legal written commentary from the president on how he views the legislation — which mostly attacks the bill's constitutionality. But Trump also issued a written statement beside his signing statement, which decries the bill because of "the many ways it improperly encroaches on Executive power, disadvantages American companies, and hurts the interests of our European allies."

From Trump's statement: "[D]espite its problems, I am signing this bill for the sake of national unity. It represents the will of the American people to see Russia take steps to improve relations with the United States."
