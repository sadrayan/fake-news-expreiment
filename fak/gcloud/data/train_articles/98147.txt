(2) This is why i never get one ðŸ‘Ž
I got one last year because our Dr who delivered our twins, whom was world class and delivers multiples several times a every year, whom is sought after and respected, and, oh yeah, is a real DOCTOR and not just a Facebook Physician, suggested we both

get them and we were fine. btw there are different strains of flu that these might not stop. But if you have even a 30% chance of staying safe, would you take it? I think everyone's body reacts different. I remember not getting the shot and getting the flu and it was terrible. Get one or don't. You can get trace amounts some of that stuff listed in food too.
