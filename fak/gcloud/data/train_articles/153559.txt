FACT CHECK: Aaron Rodgers Pictured Holding 'Stand For the Flag, Kneel for the Cross' T-Shirt?
An image purportedly showing Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers holding a “Stand for the flag, kneel for the cross” shirt circulated online in September 2017 amidst the controversy over players kneeling during the national anthem in protest of inequality and police brutality:

This is not a genuine photograph of Aaron Rodgers. Both the pictured person’s face and the t-shirt design have been altered.

Before the Packers game on 24 September 2017, Rodgers linked arms with his teammates to show solidarity during the national anthem. He also posted a photograph of himself and other players kneeling along with the hashtag #unity:
