Obama endorses Charlie Crist in congressional race
President Barack Obama today endorsed Charlie Crist for the 13th Congressional District.

"Governor Charlie Crist has always put people above politics – and we need more of that in Washington," Obama said in a statement. "As governor, in the face of partisan attacks, he had the courage to save jobs and lead his state into economic recovery. He had the wisdom to recognize that climate change is real and act to fight it. And he had the decency to expand, not restrict, our right to vote. I know he'll bring the people's voice to Congress, and I've got his back."

Crist said: "I'm humbled and honored that President Obama, one of the greatest leaders in our nation's history, has my back. Outside of the voters of Pinellas County, no endorsement means more to me. He's done so much for our beautiful Florida – guiding us out of the recession, and working for greater equality, opportunity, and prosperity. He's a great friend."

The endorsement comes after Republican Rep. David Jolly announced Friday he would run for the seat again, withdrawing from the U.S. Senate race.
