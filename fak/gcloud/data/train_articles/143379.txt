Who Murdered Vince Foster? And Why the Biggest Political Scandal in History is also the Biggest Financial Story of Our Lifetimes: James Dale Davidson: Amazon.com: Books
This book is a shill for an investment theory, and should never have been submitted to a sale on AMAZON.COM.

The author Thought that people would get upset at the Murder of Vince Foster and institute some "Watergate" type hearings, which would drive down the Stock Market. Obviously that never happened. So people did not need the investment theories "shilled" for in this book.

The Book is only about 125 pages long, and the minority of the book focuses on the "Strange Death of Vince Foster".

My suggestion for the reader is to find another book on the Vince Foster "Murder" where the idea is NOT to subscribe to some whacko Investment theories.
