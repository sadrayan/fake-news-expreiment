Criticized by Obama, Senate Candidate Defends Fair-Pay Stance
Criticized by President Barack Obama this week for her stance on equal-pay policy, Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land of Michigan said she supports the principle of equal pay for women but would have voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act debated in the Senate this week.

The bill, which was blocked by Senate Republicans, would have allowed employees to discuss their pay without potential retaliation and required employers to show that salary differences arenâ€™t based on gender bias.
