Christopher Cantwell, White Nationalist in Vice Video, Braces for Charges
Ms. Gorcenski said she recognized Mr. Cantwell from his YouTube videos, and she had seen him earlier organizing his group at a Walmart parking lot. She said she believed her complaint was the cause of one, but not all, the charges against him.

Mr. Cantwell, who lives in New Hampshire and hosts a podcast, said he had read The Globe report but had not spoken with the authorities in Virginia. He said he would turn himself in immediately if necessary.

“I don’t think I did anything wrong, and I’m looking forward to my day in court,” he said on Friday.

On Monday, he said in an email he was contacting his lawyer.

The violence erupted in Charlottesville ostensibly over the planned removal of a statue of a Confederate general there.

The Charlottesville police arrested at least two people in connection with the rally and unrest. The Virginia State Police said it made at least three arrests, and the University of Virginia said its Police Department arrested at least one person at an Aug. 11 demonstration.

Mr. Cantwell rose to prominence days later when Vice News aired its report recapping what happened. The reporter, Elle Reeve, was embedded with white nationalists, and the documentary allowed viewers to see things from their perspectives.

Mr. Cantwell was featured prominently in the report.

In it, he cites Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice — whose shooting deaths spurred a nationwide debate about criminal justice and racial profiling — as examples of a black person “behaving like a savage.” He also reprimanded President Trump for “giving his daughter to a Jew.”
