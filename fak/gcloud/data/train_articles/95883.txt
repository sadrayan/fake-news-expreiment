Sen. Bennet to Feinstein: Keep Gitmo Detainees Out of Colorado Supermax Prison

Earlier today, California Senator Dianne Feinstein said that the supermax federal prison in Florence, Colorado, would be a good location to hold Gitmo detainees. In an emailed statement to THE WEEKLY STANDARD, Colorado's newest senator, Democrat Michael Bennet, disagrees: I strongly support the Senate's decision to withhold funding for the transfer of the detainees until the Administration comes up with a plan for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Because the detainees are being tried by military tribunals, they should be held in military facilities. Military detainees should not be transported to and held at Supermax because it is not a military facility. - Michael Bennet, U.S. Senator for Colorado
