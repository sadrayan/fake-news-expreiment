I PROMISE School
FALL 2018

Committees of local leaders, educators, parents and experts are currently forming in Akron that will determine many of the logistics of the new school. These committees will help guide every step of the schoolâ€™s creation over the next several months, and bring a master plan to the APS Board of Education for approval in October.



The I PROMISE School would open its doors in the fall of 2018 with newly identified third and fourth grade classes while adding first and second grades the following year. By 2022, the school will be complete with first through eighth grades.
