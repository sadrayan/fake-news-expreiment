Technical notes:

The main data sources for housing statistics are national population and housing censuses. Internationally recommended concepts and definitions for collecting these statistics are published in the Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.80.XVII.8) and given below. It should be noted that countries sometimes deviate significantly from these recommended concepts and definitions. Departures from these definitions, when furnished by the reporting country, are footnoted in the table. The average number of persons per room was obtained by dividing the total population in occupied housing units by the total number of rooms as reported by countries. If the total number of occupants, i.e., total population occupying housing units, was not available, the total population figure was used in the numerator. A room is defined as a space in a housing unit or other living quarters enclosed by walls reaching from the floor to the ceiling or roof covering, or at least to a height of 2 meters, of a size large enough to hold a bed for an adult, that is, at least 4 square meters. Rooms, therefore, may include bedrooms, dining rooms, living rooms, studies, habitable attics, servants' rooms, kitchens, rooms used for professional or business purposes and other separate spaces used or intended for dwelling purposes, so long as they meet the criteria of walls and floor space. Passageways, verandas, lobbies, bathrooms and toilet rooms are not expected to be counted as rooms, even if they meet the criteria. Return to Top
