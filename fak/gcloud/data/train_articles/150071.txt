Anthony Bourdain’s death confirmed as suicide: report
The death of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain has been confirmed as suicide by French authorities, who found no evidence of foul play, according to a media report.

Bourdain, who rocketed to fame after the publication of his book “Kitchen Confidential,” was found dead Friday in Strasbourg, where he was filming an upcoming episode of his CNN television series. “Parts Unknown.”

The 61-year-old hanged himself in the bathroom of the hotel where he was staying, the prosecutor of Colmar, in the Alsace region of France, told the Associated Press on Saturday.

“There is no element that makes us suspect that someone came into the room at any moment,” said prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny, according to the AP report.

The French authorities are conducting toxicology tests to discover whether Bourdain was on medication, to discover clues to his state of mind, the report said.

Globe-trotting gourmand Bourdain, once described by the Smithsonian as “the Elvis of bad-boy chefs,” is credited with encouraging Americans to think differently about food and travel through his award-winning media work.

“His love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller,” CNN said in a statement Friday announcing the chef’s death.
