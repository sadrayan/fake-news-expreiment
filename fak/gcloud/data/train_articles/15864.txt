This is an incorrect rumor. A UTPD officer took the suspect down and arrested him. We have no knowledge of a CHL person intervening in any way.

Hope this helps.

Thanks,

...a UTPD officer took the suspect down and arrested him â€“ no civilians with guns were involved. Police have interviewed over 40 witnesses thus far, as well as reviewed video footage to support this.
