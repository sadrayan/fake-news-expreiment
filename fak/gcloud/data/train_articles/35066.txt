Ted Cruz calls Beto O'Rourke 'partisan extremist' for backing Trump impeachment after Putin summit
Updated at 5:30 with Cruz calling O'Rourke unfit to serve in the Senate.

WASHINGTON — Texas Democrat Beto O'Rourke, who is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's performance at a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin merits impeachment.



And he blasted Cruz for failing to denounce Trump, who shocked U.S. intelligence and law enforcement by taking the former KGB spy chief's word that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election.

Last week, the Justice Department issued indictments against a dozen Russian military intelligence officers for doing just that.

The Cruz campaign shot back by asserting that O'Rourke's stance on impeachment makes him "so radical and reckless that he is unfit to serve in the U.S. Senate."

"Standing on stage in another country with the leader of another country who wants to and has sought to undermine this country, and to side with him over the United States — if I were asked to vote on this I would vote to impeach the president," O'Rourke, a three-term congressman from El Paso, said in response to a question from The Dallas Morning News. "Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed."

(The two times O'Rourke had an opportunity to vote on impeachment of Trump, he voted against moving forward with that process: On Dec. 6, when the House voted 364-58 to kill a resolution from Rep. Al Green, a Houston Democrat, calling for impeachment, and again on Jan. 19, when the House voted 355-66 to kill another try from Green.)

Trump's stance at the Helsinki summit on Monday left Democrats and many Republicans appalled. Presidents always hang over midterm elections but the eruption of dismay over the summit took that to a new level.
