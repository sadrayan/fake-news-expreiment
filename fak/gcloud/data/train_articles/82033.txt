Less than a day after starting his first stint as California's acting governor, state Supt. of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson declared states of emergency on Tuesday in two counties dealt a huge blow by devastating wildfires.

The proclamations in response to the Sand fire in Los Angeles County and the Soberanes fire in Monterey County enable quicker response by state and local officials to the residents affected by the blazes.

Torlakson is the sole statewide elected official in California this week. His fellow Democrats are in Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention. It is the first time in state history that the job of chief executive has fallen to the schools chief.
