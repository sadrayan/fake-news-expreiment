Mayor Andrew J. Ginther and City Council President Zach Klein Announce Response to Trump Administration Executive Order Mayor Andrew J. Ginther and Columbus City Council President Zach Klein announced the city’s commitment to accepting refugees regardless of immigration status at a press conference at City Hall.



“Our immigrant population is part of the fabric of what makes Columbus so vibrant,” said Mayor Ginther. “They are our neighbors. We must not turn our backs on them, now or ever.”



Mayor Ginther said he will issue an executive order this week that will support the resettlement of refugees to Columbus and prohibit the detention of anyone unless a warrant exists or a criminal violation was observed. In addition, the executive order will not allow city money, equipment or personnel to be used for detecting or apprehending someone or denying them city services based on immigration status.



Mayor Ginther also stressed that the city supports constructive immigration reform on a national level “that keeps families together, upholds our values as Americans, promotes economic growth, and provides a long term solution to the immigration system.”



President Klein said he will explore what the New American population in Columbus needs from its local government and what the term “sanctuary city” means. “Columbus policies should always continue to support a community where all residents and visitors feel safe and welcome,” said President Klein.



Foreign-born residents are 9.3% of the entire population of Columbus and contribute $258 million in local and state income, property and sales taxes. The local refugee community supports an estimated 21,000 jobs in Columbus.
