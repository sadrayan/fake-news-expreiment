Houck, Eric Associate Professor of Educational Leadership and Policy

"Whatever it is that money may be thought to contribute to the education of children, that commodity is something highly prized by those who enjoy the greatest measure of it. If money is inadequate to improve education, the residents of poor districts should at least have an equal opportunity to be disappointed by its failure."

- Private Wealth and Public Education

Coons, Clune, & Sugarman, 1970
