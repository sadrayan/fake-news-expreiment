Dolly Parton Is Proud of Her Gay Fans and Hillary Clinton
[Laughs] I thought it was a good time to write an album of just love songs. Most of them are positive. There’s a couple of cheatin’ type things, but you know, that’s a type of love, too. If you’re in love, you’re in love. It doesn’t matter. Love is love is love is love. Your heart can’t help what it does.

Have you had a cheatin’ heart?

Well, we’ve all got a cheatin’ heart, it just depends on how we deal with it. Are you trying to put me in a corner? I said I was married; I didn’t say I was dead!

Has your songwriting process changed?

I still use my little tape recorder, and I still write longhand. I can’t think unless I’ve got a pen or a pencil in my hand, with a big old yellow legal pad. I think my writing is as good as it ever was. In some ways, I think it’s better because I’ve lived longer and I’ve experienced more stuff. But when I write, I don’t try to be commercial. I just write what I feel, and hope that it might turn out to be a “Jolene” or an “I Will Always Love You.” You can’t really purposefully try to do that. If they’re good, they’re good, and if they’re mediocre, they’re mediocre. I got a lot of them, too.

Did you follow the Tomato-gate scandal, when a country radio consultant said that female artists should be played less, that men like Keith Urban were the staple and women were just the decoration?

[Lets out a long laugh-hoot] Oh, I didn’t see that, but I don’t agree, of course. Some of our greatest writers ever [are women], like Cindy Walker, Cynthia Weil — you can just reel them off one after another — Carole King. We’re beautiful, too, but I think women are very smart, very talented and should have every right to express what talent God has given them. They should get their just dues.
