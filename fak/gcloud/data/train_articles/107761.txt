Danish society and the business environment
How Danish values benefit the business environment

Trust, openness and an almost total lack of corruption make Denmark a great place to do business. Government agencies are easy to get in touch with and taxes - while high - are straightforward and transparent.

The Danish "flexicurity" model means it is easy to hire workers and not too hard to let them go if business conditions change. And a tax-financed educational system that is free for the student ensures a steady supply of well-trained labour.

Utilities like power, water, and broadband are reliable and accessible throughout the country.
