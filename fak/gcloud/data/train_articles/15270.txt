There are no data on unintended pregnancy rates available for TX (or any other state or nationally) for 2013, the year in question. So that claim is unsubstantiated.

The latest data we have for TX is for 2010, when the state had an unintended pregnancy rate of 56 per 1,000 women of reproductive age. See Table 1 here:

Also, we know that the TX unintended pregnancy rate declined by 7.6% between 2002 and 2010 (see Table 2, same source as above).

The TX abortion rate declined in 2013, but there is no published evidence that we’re aware of to link it to defunding Planned Parenthood. We know that the TX abortion rate fell by 17% between 2008 and 2011, well before PP was defunded in the state. See Table 2 here:
