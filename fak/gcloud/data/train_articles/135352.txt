Common sense gun reforms to enable responsible use and protect Georgia children and families

Every Georgian deserves to feel safe—at home, at work, and in the classroom. It is beyond time for sensible gun policies that enable responsible ownership but also keep firearms away from people who would use them to harm us or themselves. Stacey Abrams is committed to working collaboratively with law enforcement, community partners, the legislature, and every level of our criminal justice system to protect our communities.

As Governor, Stacey will:

Fight for common-sense gun reforms including universal background checks, repeal of campus carry, and extreme-risk protection orders Support protections and services for victims of domestic violence Invest in mental health services Support community and hospital programs to stop the cycle of gun violence
