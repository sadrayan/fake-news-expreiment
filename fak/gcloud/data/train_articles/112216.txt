Chuck Todd fooled by Giuliani parody account
This debate was not @realDonaldTrump's best, but there are still two more. #debatenight — Rudolph Giuliani (@rudygiulianiGOP) September 27, 2016

NBC News’s Chuck Todd confronted former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) over a tweet he allegedly wrote critiquing's debate performance. One problem: It came from a parody account.

The error occurred on Todd’s Sunday program, “Meet the Press,” during a segment reviewing the first presidential debate between Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonHouse Intel Republican: 'Foolish' not to take info on opponent from foreign ally House Intel Republican: 'Foolish' not to take info on opponent from foreign ally It's about the delegates, stupid MORE.

Giuliani, a Trump surrogate, explained to Todd after the host read the tweet that it didn't belong to him.

“I didn't tweet that. That's not my tweet. I never said that. That’s somebody pretending to be me. There are about four of them out there that pretend to be me,” explained Giuliani.

Todd didn’t apologize for the gaffe and instead continued to stick with the same line of questioning regardless.

“So you think everything went hunky-dory on Monday night?” Todd pressed. “You thought that was the best [Trump] can do?”

“No, I think he can do better. I think he can do a lot better,” Giuliani said.

After a commercial break, Todd offered a correction for the mistake.

“Little correction here: Rudy Giuliani was right; that was a parody account that we got that,” he said.

“Meet the Press” recently finished the 2015-2016 season at No. 1 in the Sunday morning political race in the key 25- to 54-year-old demographic most important to advertisers, according to Nielsen data.

Todd's program finished third in the same category in 2014-2015.
