Lt. Governor Unveils Faith-Based Initiative on Foster Care Children
AUSTIN – Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick announced a major initiative today calling on Texas’ many faith-based communities to help identify homes for children in need of foster care. The initiative is being launched in conjunction with National Adoption Month in November.

“Thousands of children in Texas’ foster care system need your help. They need safe and loving homes, and many are looking for a forever home. Several elected state officials have opened their homes to children in need of loving families and are working with me to inspire a statewide movement to answer this calling. I hope you and your family will consider doing the same.

“I’m also appealing to Texas’ faith-based community for help. I’m asking faith-based leaders across Texas to reach out to their congregations and communities to open their hearts and homes to the foster children of Texas.”

On November 2, faith leaders from across the state will gather at the Texas Capitol to discuss the importance of the faith-based community in child protection, including ways to help recruit and retain foster and adoptive families.

The Lt. Governor’s Office has created a special website dedicated to this faith-based collaboration to guide potential foster and adoptive parents to information about how they can help. The website also includes information about foster care and adoptions in Texas. To visit the website, go to https://www.ltgov.state.tx.us/adoptions/

National Adoption Month was established to raise awareness of the need for many more foster and adoptive families and to recognize those who have already opened their hearts and homes to children in need.
