Philando Castile had permit to carry gun
Philando Castile had a valid permit to carry a gun when he was shot and killed by a St. Anthony police officer, a source confirmed to the Star Tribune Friday.

Castile, a 32-year-old school cook from St. Paul, was killed by a St. Anthony police officer during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights Wednesday night. His final minutes were live-streamed by his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was a passenger in the car.

In the video, Reynolds said Castile told the officer, Jeronimo Yanez, that he had a permit and was carrying a gun. Yanez shot Castile multiple times.

“He’s licensed to carry, he was trying to get his ID, his wallet out of his pocket and he let the officer know he had a firearm and was reaching for his wallet,” Reynolds said in the video as a bloodied Castile lay in the driver’s seat dying.

Although the names of gun permit holders are not public under state law, a source confirmed Castile was issued the permit when he lived in Robbinsdale.

Yanez and his partner that night, Joseph Kauser, are on paid administrative leave. On Friday the Falcon Heights City Council, which contracts with the St. Anthony police department, hired a public relations consultant in the wake of the shooting.

Yanez has been with the St. Anthony police department since 2011. Gov. Mark Dayton has asked the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and federal authorities to investigate Castile’s death.
