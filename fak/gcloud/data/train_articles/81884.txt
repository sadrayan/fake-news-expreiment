Judge rules against NCAA in Ed O'Bannon antitrust lawsuit
Wilken's ruling does not order revenue sharing but lifts the restriction that has barred Division I schools from doing so, and permits them to hand over to athletes the full cost of education and at least $5,000 annually held in trust while they are playing. If students stay four years, the latter amount would total in excess of $300 million, said William Isaacson, the co-lead attorney for the plaintiffs



"This is a big win for college athletes because now schools would be permitted to provide fair and reasonable sharing of revenues," he said. "What her decision points out is that amateurism ended some time ago. This decision doesn't end amateurism, it just points out the facts."



Isaacson said the ruling permits them to share in a piece of the burgeoning pie of industry profits, though the amounts may seem modest.



"The clients will never notice this themselves financially. For them this is about change for the future and they've accomplished that."



USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said the ruling was expected.



"This will still play out for some time and while it does, USC will remain committed to doing as much as we possibly can for our student-athletes within the NCAA rules," Haden said in a statement.
