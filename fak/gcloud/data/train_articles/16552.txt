We found 2016 crime data posted by the FBI this January (that link brings you a ZIP file). I am attaching two of our own spreadsheets with one showing our calculation of violent crime rates for 35 Texas cities and the other breaking out how the cities stack up by that rate. Upshot: Austin was 21st in the state behind cities including El Paso and Midland.

I hope to wrap up our review of the claim this week.

I think I figured out the disconnect. You’re comparing Austin to anything that can be called a city. We only compare ourselves to the largest cities. Austin is, by far, the safest of Texas’ big cities.
