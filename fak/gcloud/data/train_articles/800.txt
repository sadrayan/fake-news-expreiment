BREAKING: Obamacare Death Panels Have Arrived, First Patient Executed Today
According to recent reports, a group of death panels organized under Obamacare ordered their first execution.

Following a hearing by the president’s Patient Resource Efficiency Board (PREB), 86-year-old Dorothy Zborknak has been ordered to death. The reason? According to the administration, she is no longer useful.

Zborknak worked at Fleur de Lis Florist in Chicago for nearly forty years, before she made the decision to retire in 1998. Since that time, she has struggled with a host of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney failure.

“Unfortunately, the cost of her care just became too expensive,�? claims Peter Johnston, a member of the Chicago PREB. “Under the Affordable Care Act, we have the power to make choices about end of life care and I stand by our ruling. I know it will be hard for the family to accept what’s going to happen…But from a financial standpoint, this was a very easy decision.�?

What do you think? Is this just wrong?
