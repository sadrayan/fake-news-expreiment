Habitat and Fishing Tips:

Hogfish are a reef species that inhabit rocky bottoms, ledges and reefs throughout Floridaâ€™s off-shore waters. They are easily identified by their long, hog-like snout, which allows them to feed on bottom-dwelling mollusks and crustaceans. Because they tend to root in the sediment in search of small prey, they are not commonly caught on hook and line. Hogfish are primarily harvested by spearfishing, and they are considered to be of excellent food quality.
