Sterling, who was armed with a gun in a state that allows open carry, was pinned to the ground by police before being shot.

The owner of the Triple S store where the shooting took place told The Advocate that Sterling didn't appear to be reaching for a gun.

Both officers have been placed on administrative leave.

In April 2015, Lake was given a certificate of commendation by the department. Salamoni was given a "life saving" award, according to the department's Facebook page.

James Durdin, the father-in-law of Salamoni, defended the officer's actions and blamed "the black people" for "making an agenda out of this," according to the New York Daily News.
