Philly: Soda tax revenue to fall short
Soda Tax Collections

Are Coming Up Flat

City officials expect collections for its tax on sugar-sweetened beverages will fall short of the goal for fiscal 2017, which ends in June. To reach its target, the city would need to collect an average of $10.3 million for May and June (including accruals), a figure well above its average monthly goal of $7.7 million, which has not yet been met.

*The monthly goal was set at $7.7 million, beginning in March. Goals for the first two months of the year were lower: $2.3 million in January and $5.4 million in February. The cityâ€™s fiscal 2017 goal of $46.2 million includes a $7.7 million accrual.
