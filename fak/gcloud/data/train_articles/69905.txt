Jeff's foray into radio is a relatively new career choice. He stepped up to the mic in 1995 as a fill-in host for another local radio station. Before he joined the ranks at WTMJ, most people recognized Jeff from his long and successful law career. He is a former federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office for eleven and a half years where he was Head of the Organized Crime Task Force. In 1993, Jeff went into private practice and was also on the 1994 Republican candidate for State Attorney General.
