Starbucks refugee hiring event to be held in El Cajon
EL CAJON, Calif. (KGTV)--Store managers from throughout San Diego will gather tomorrow at a Starbucks hiring event for refugees who want to train to be baristas.

The U.S. company announced in January it would hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years. The announcement by CEO Howard Schultz came two days after President Donald Trump issued his first executive order putting a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the U.S.

The world's largest coffee chain said it would focus initial efforts on markets where refugee need is greatest and there's a store base to meet the need.

According to state and federal data, San Diego fits the bill.

No other California county has received more refugees during the past decade than San Diego county.

In 2016, San Diego settled 3,100 refugees, along with 520 military interpreters on special immigrant visas.

About 30 Starbucks managers will conduct on-the-spot interviews at the International Rescue Committee's office located at 131 E. Main Street in El Cajon from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 8. Applicants are encouraged to visit Starbucks online career center prior to the event and bring resumes along with them.

The store managers will talk to the refugee applicants about what it's like to work for Starbucks and review qualifications for the barista position.

In March, Starbucks also expanded its pledge to hire more veterans and military spouses from 10,000 to 25,000 by 2025.
