A bear cub saved by Russian rescuers in Chukotka was transported to its new home on Wednesday. Footage released by the Ministry of Defense shows the bear being loaded by servicemen onto a cargo aircraft, from where it was escorted by staff from Moscow Zoo. The cub had reportedly lost its mother and was trying to find its way through one of the local villages when it was noticed by citizens, who then called the servicemen. After receiving care and treatment in an animal sanctuary in Moscow Region it will be released back into the wild.
