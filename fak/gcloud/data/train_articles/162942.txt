NYC CERT





New York City Community Emergency Response Teams (NYC CERT) are groups of dedicated volunteers who help to prepare their neighbors and communities for different types of disasters.

NYC CERT members undergo a training program that provides basic response skills needed for fire safety, light search and rescue, community disaster support, disaster medical operations, and traffic control.

Members are affiliated with a community team by their legal residence. The volunteer commitment is for at least one year of service following graduation.
