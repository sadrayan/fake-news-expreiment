Prospect Hall, The University of Texas at El Paso, Jan. 18, 2018

The fencing had a HUGE impact on the illegal activity it El Paso just like in San Diego, Nogales, Douglas, etc. but it was one tool of three. The three tools have been and will continue to be: personnel, technology, and border infrastructure (walls, lights, roads, etc.). Although the pedestrian wall had a huge impact, so did the increase in Border Patrol agents. I would disagree that the wall was the sole reason for the decline in criminal activity, but was a MAJOR factor in improving the quality of life.
