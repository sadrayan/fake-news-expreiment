UNHCR underscores humanitarian imperative for refugees as new U.S. rules announced
In light of today’s Executive Order regarding U.S. refugee resettlement, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, underscores that refugees are ordinary people forced to flee war, violence and persecution in their home countries and who remain in urgent need of life-saving assistance and protection.

Commenting on the Executive Order the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said: “The imperative remains to provide protection for people fleeing deadly violence, and we are concerned that this decision, though temporary, may compound the anguish for those it affects,” adding that "UNHCR has long been a partner for the United States in finding solutions to refugee problems, and we look forward to continuing this partnership.”

UNHCR reiterates its readiness to engage constructively with the U.S. Administration to ensure all refugee programs meet the highest standards for safety and security.

Americans have long played a crucial role in promoting global stability while simultaneously exemplifying the highest humanitarian ideals, from support for refugee emergencies overseas, to welcoming some of the most vulnerable refugee families in the United States to rebuild their lives in safety, freedom and dignity. This is the gold standard in refugee protection and a powerful model for all countries. At a time of record-high levels of forced human displacement, this kind of humane leadership is needed more than ever.
