Brett Smiley Unveils “Safest City Plan”
At the Silver Lake Community Center this morning, Brett Smiley unveiled his “Safest City Plan,” a detailed, 8-page proposal to fight violence and crime on our streets. Brett noted that Providence is currently the 183rd safest city in America with 100,000 people or more, and he challenged the city to take aggressive, proactive steps toward becoming the safest city of its size. Brett said:

“Of all cities in the United States with more than 100,000 people, Providence is the 183rd safest. Last year, major cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Dallas all had lower crime rates than Providence. This is unacceptable, and it has to change. With the policies outlined in this comprehensive plan, I challenge Providence to become the safest city of its size in America.”

Brett’s “Safest City Plan” contains a number of different policy proposals focusing on three areas: (1) a smarter, stronger policing model, (2) ending the cycle of violence and disorder, and (3) creating a public safety system that works for both residents and businesses:

“We need more cops on the streets, a stronger commitment to community policing, smarter technology, targeted strategies for fighting gang violence and domestic violence, civilian oversight in the process and more. There is no one solution to the problems that face our city.”

Brett believes that the only way to become the safest city of its size in the United States is a comprehensive plan like the one he proposed today, and he looks forward to putting these proposals into action from City Hall. Brett also commented:

“We can’t forget that one of the most important crime-fighting tools is a strong and thriving economy, and I will work to create jobs and provide economic opportunity that can be shared by everyone.”

Brett Smiley is running in the September 2014 Democratic primary for Mayor of Providence.
