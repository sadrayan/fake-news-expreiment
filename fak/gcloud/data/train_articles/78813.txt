ObamaCare: $13 Billion Tax Increase on Families With Special Needs - Blog
An estimated 30 million families use pre-tax dollars in Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) to pay for routine medical care and other vital child care services.



Parents with special needs children use their pre-tax FSA dollars to pay for fees at special needs schools, transportation costs associated with their child's education, Braille books, and guide dogs for the visually impaired.



ObamaCare burdens these families with a huge tax increase - the Joint Committee on Taxation says $13 billion worth - by capping the amount of money in a Flexible Spending Account at $2,500 per year. The FSA cap also strips away more of the control these families have over their own health care decisions.
