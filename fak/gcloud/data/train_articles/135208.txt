Potential Reasons For Selling Shares

The Manitowoc Company provides engineered lifting equipment for the construction industry worldwide. Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Terex (NYSE: TEX), Allison Transmission (NYSE: ALSN), Oshkosh (NYSE: OSK) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT). Analyzing Manitowoc's growth metrics and valuation ratios provides further insight into why Mr. Icahn reduced his holdings.

A 5-year revenue CAGR is the average annual growth rate of revenue over a five year period. It's calculated as follows:

5yr CAGR = [ Revenue FY / Revenue FY-5 ] ^ (1/5 years) - 1.

The chart below plots the five-year revenue compounded annual growth for Manitowoc and its peers.

The company's 5-year revenue CAGR of -14.8% is well below all of its selected comparable public companies. In addition, the company's future growth as projected by Wall Street analysts is only mediocre relative to this same peer group.

Return on Assets (ROA) represents the dollars in earnings or Net Income a company generates per dollar of assets. ROA is typically used to gauge the efficiency of the company and its management at deploying capital to generate income for shareholders. It is calculated as follows:

ROA = Adjusted Net Income / Average Total Assets.

In general, a higher return on assets suggests management is utilizing the asset base efficiently. Manitowoc's ROA of -3.7% is below all of its selected comparable public companies: TEX (-2.4%), ALSN (8.2%), OSK (6.8%) and CAT (1.1%).

It appears the company's growth and investor returns have generally underperformed its peers. What make's the stock even less attractive are its pricey valuation multiples.

The company's LTM EBITDA multiple of 105.9x is much higher than all of its selected comparable public companies. On a projected basis, Manitowoc's forward EBITDA multiple of 12.9x also trades above the majority of its peers.

In addition, a number of future cash flow models imply that the stock's overvalued. The average fair value estimate of $22.79 implies -28.5% downside and is calculated from 4 separate analyses as shown in the table above.

Even though Manitowoc shares have traded lower over the last month, the stock still appears to be trading at a premium to its intrinsic value. This could be a reason why Carl Icahn's reducing his stake in the company.
