The energy ministers discussed the possibility of extending oil production cuts to the end of March next year in an attempt to stabilize the global crude market and reduce global oil inventories to their five-year average level.

Consequently, WTI crude prices gained by $1.01, or 2.1%, to $48.85 a barrel. The broader Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) advanced 0.8%, emerging as one of the best performing sectors of S&P 500.

Cyber Security Stocks Gain

Software security stocks moved higher following a cyber attack on Friday that affected at least 200,000 computers across the world, as per EU law enforcement agency Europol estimates. Cybersecurity stocks gained on expectations that attacks were likely to continue into the current week.

According to Europol, Friday's "WannaCry" ransomware attack took place across a minimum of 150 countries. Ransomware is named as such because it takes computers or even entire networks hostage until a specific ransom is paid up. The "WannaCry" cyberattack worm raised global concerns about computers being affected with the virus on a very wide scale.

Shares of FireEye Inc FEYE , Symantec Corporation SYMC and Palo Alto Networks Inc PANW gained 7.5%, 3.2% and 2.7% respectively. The gain in the cyber security stocks had a positive impact on the overall technology sector.
