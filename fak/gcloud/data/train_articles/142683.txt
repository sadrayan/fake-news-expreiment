Catholic Archbishop: 'I'd Rather Go to Prison Than Report Child Abuse to Police'

'There are some matters which are of a higher order, things to do with God'

One of the highest-ranking officials in the Catholic Church has stated that he would "rather go to prison" than report pedophilia to police.

Australia's most powerful clergy, Archbishop of Melbourne Denis Hart, says he's prepared to be jailed for failing to report child sex abuse by pedophile priests.

He made the shocking statement in response to the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse saying there should be "no excuse, protection nor privilege" for clergy who failed to alert police of abuse.

Hart insisted that sexual abuse was "a spiritual encounter with God through the priest" and was "of a higher order" than criminal law.

A new report by the commission proposed 85 sweeping changes to the criminal justice system and recommended that priests face criminal charges for failing to report serious crimes such as sexual abuse to the police.

As the law currently stands, clergy are not legally obliged to report crimes to the police and disciplinary proceedings for criminal activity by members of the Catholic Church are handled internally by Canon law, which operates independently of the regular legal procedure.

Following an investigation by the commission, officials believe that the Catholic Church is using "confessional confidentiality" as a cover for not reporting child sex abuse to the authorities.
