FACT CHECK: Pence Recaptured After Fleeing Trump Campaign Bus
On 26 August 2016, satirist Andy Borowitz published an article at The New Yorker reporting that Mike Pence had been “recaptured” after he tried to escape Donald Trump’s campaign bus:

Calling it a “scary moment” and a “close call,” Donald Trump’s campaign officials confirmed that they had recaptured Mike Pence after the Indiana governor attempted to flee the campaign bus in the early hours of Friday morning.
