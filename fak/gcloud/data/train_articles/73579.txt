CitizenTube: Year One Review: The U.S. Government on YouTube
It's been one year since the U.S. government came to YouTube with the launch of the official White House YouTube channel and President Obama's inaugural address. Soon after, we launched our Senate and House Hubs with the U.S. Congress, and then we brought the entire federal government to the site on YouTube.com/usgovernment. On the heels of a presidential election in which YouTube became a key tool for most political campaigns, politicians took their lessons from 2008 and started applying them to governing. The results were interesting and, at times, quite surprising.









The White House:



The White House ended it's first year on YouTube with 21 million video views and close to 100,000 subscribers.

President Obama's first YouTube Weekly Address brought FDR's fireside chats into the 21st Century.

The White House's July health care townhall, brought in 300 citizen-submitted video questions for the President to answer in a live townhall.

Some of the most talked-about videos from the President focused on international diplomacy, including his Nowruz message directed Iranian citizens and government, his speech to the Muslim world in Cairo, his video addressing Turkish Parliament, and his Ramadan and Diwali holiday greetings.

The U.S. Congress

A total of 430 Members of Congress have started YouTube channels to inform and engage with their constituents.

Capitol Hill caught up with YouTube trends, learning the power of the viral hit, the mash-up, and even cat videos.

Though the Democrats captured the majority of the seats in Congress, 89% of Republicans have channels, compared to just 74% of Democrats. In yesterday's big win for the GOP in Massachusetts, Scott Brown's campaign had an undoubtedly superior YouTube channel to his opponent Martha Coakley.



Eight of the top 10 most-viewed and most-subscribed YouTube channels in Congress are from the GOP.

The House seems to be using YouTube more effectively than the Senate - only one Senator makes the list of most-viewed and most-subscribed channels.

The Federal Government



Here are some of the highlights, statistics, and milestones of year one of the U.S. government on YouTube:

Over 150 federal agencies have started YouTube channels since our agreement went into place on May 22.

The State Department continues to use YouTube in innovative ways, such as the Democracy Video Challenge, the Alliance of Youth Movements, and videos like this one from Secretary Clinton about 21st Secretary Statecraft.



In summer 2009, HHS launched an H1N1 Flu PSA c ontest on YouTube - the first-ever effort by the government to get citizens to create PSAs. The winning video as voted by the YouTube community was from a doctor whose H1N1 rap made him an Internet celebrity for a few months.
