Robert Gehl reports in what might be one of the biggest political “fails” in some time,” Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London told his citizens that there was “no reason to be alarmed” right after terrorist attacks killed seven citizens and injured dozens more.

“I’m reassured that we are one of the safest global cities in the world – if not the safest global city in the world,” Khan said following the London Bridge attack.

This came while it was still unclear if the suspects in the terrorist attack had even been captured yet.

And while Khan is busy denying the real threat of terrorism, President Donald Trump focused like a laser beam on the threat of terrorism. Instead, Khan is focused on what he sees as the “real threat:” Climate change.

Just two days before the deadly attacks, the mayor railed against Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate agreement. He called global warming “one of the biggest threats to humanity” and said he would work with other cities to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The last time I checked, “global warming” didn’t go on a stabbing rampage in London, or try to blow up a bomb, or kill innocent civilians.

This is the threat of terrorism, something European leaders are going to have to learn to even admit to before they can fight it.
