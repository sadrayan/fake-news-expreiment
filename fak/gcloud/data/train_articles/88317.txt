McCain's Katrina claim gets rapidly fact-checked
At a press conference today in Louisiana, McCain was asked why he had voted against launching a commission to investigate the government response to Katrina.

His response: “I have supported every investigation and ways of finding out what caused the tragedy.”

But, as both the DNC and Obama campaign are quick to point out, he opposed proposals in 2005 and 2006 to create a congressional commission. (The Obama campaign notes that Senator Clinton co-sponsored both Senate amendments.)

The McCain campaign says that he didn't know about the specific votes, but was talking about his support for the investigation already underway by the Senate Homeland Security Committee when the proposals were floated in the Senate.

Basically, he supported a Senate investigation but had voted against the creation of an independent commission.

"Whether he simply wasn't aware of his voting record again or he was intentionally misleading the people of Louisiana, John McCain certainly isn't offering us 'leadership you can believe in,'" said Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.

"By refusing to admit that he voted against the creation of a Katrina Commission today in Baton Rouge, John McCain once again demonstrated a willingness to mislead Americans," said DNC Communications Director Karen Finney.

The McCain campaign's response: “It doesn’t bode well for Senator Obama’s pledges to run a campaign of hope and change when on the first day of the general election he’s launching the same tired negative attacks that the American people are so sick and tired of. As Sen. McCain said, he wasn’t familiar with the specific votes the questioner was asking about. Instead he was speaking to his strong support for the Homeland Security Committee’s comprehensive, bipartisan investigation of Hurricane Katrina, which was already fully underway when these other proposals were suggested.”
