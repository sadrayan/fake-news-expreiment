American People to the President on His Sequester: Cut More, Not Less
When congressional leaders meet with President Obama on Friday to discuss his sequester, Republicans will have a simple message, one backed up by the American people: we need to find more spending to cut, not reduce the amount we already have.

A brand new poll from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal reveals Americans understand – though it continues to escape the President – that spending is the problem.

While Americans know that the president’s sequester is bad policy, a majority believes its level of spending cuts should be a floor, not a ceiling. As Mark Murray, NBC News’ Senior Political Editor, wrote , “a combined 53 percent prefer that Congress move ahead with the current sequester cuts or a plan that contains even more cuts .”

By contrast, only about one third of Americans believe we should follow the president’s preferred course and cut less than the sequester requires.
