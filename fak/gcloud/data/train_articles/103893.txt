Boycott The Home Depot
When AFA called for a boycott of Home Depot three years ago because of its support of homosexual activist groups, I knew we were taking on a huge task. After all, Home Depot is a huge company. But I knew we had a lot of friends who would stand with us.

Now, I'm glad to report to you that we are suspending the boycott of Home Depot. After monitoring the company for several months, AFA is satisfied the company has withdrawn its major financial contributions to gay activist groups and events.

I truly believe this is a direct result of your willingness to become involved. In fact, more than 750,000 people signed the Boycott Home Depot Pledge.

Although Home Depot has made changes, we will continue to monitor their behavior. We suspect Home Depot will publicly deny having made changes, but their actions speak louder than words.

Your AFA will continue to challenge major U.S. companies to remain neutral in the culture wars rather than to use their resources to promote anti-family issues.
