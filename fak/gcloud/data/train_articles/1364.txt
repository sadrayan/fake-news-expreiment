Flag Pins Spark Debate In Tv News Names & Faces

Many Americans have drawn strength from a display of flags and other patriotic symbols. But what about news anchors and reporters? Should traditionally detached, questioning journalists wear American-flag pins and ribbons on the air?

NEW YORK -- ABC's Barbara Walters said she won't wear one. ABC's White House correspondent Terry Moran did sport one, but won't any more.

"Why would it ever be inappropriate?" wondered Brit Hume, Fox News Channel's managing editor in Washington. "It doesn't stand for the Bush administration or for a certain party or even the government. It stands for the country. Why is wearing a symbol of the country of which you're a citizen a problem?"

Hume has worn flag pins on the air. CBS, NBC and CNN have no set policy.

But ABC has become the first major news network to ask its journalists not to wear American-flag pins in their lapels, or even red, white and blue ribbons, in an effort to protect their credibility as objective sources.

"What if Peter's wearing one, but Ted's not? Does that mean one journalist is more patriotic than the other? It's best not to place such an unfair burden on the reporters," said ABC spokesman Jeffrey Schneider, referring to Peter Jennings and Ted Koppel.

"We cannot signal through outward symbols how we feel, even if the cause is justified. Overseas, it could be perceived that we're just mouthpieces for the U.S. government, and that can place our journalists in danger," Schneider said.

Some say the events of the past few weeks have been so extraordinary that journalists should be allowed to deviate, at least for now, from traditional rules.

When interviewing Vice President Dick Cheney on Meet the Press, NBC's Tim Russert wore a red, white and blue ribbon. An NBC spokesperson said he wore it in memory of those who were killed, some of whom he knew.

The spokesperson said that Katie Couric, Matt Lauer and others at NBC have not worn pins or ribbons on the air.
