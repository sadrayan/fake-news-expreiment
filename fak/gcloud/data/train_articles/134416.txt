Reports have it that authorities in Ghana are planning to remove pockets from police uniforms as part of President Akufo Addoâ€™s fight against corruption in the West African nation.

It was gathered that the new set of police uniforms which would be issued from August 2017 will have no pockets.

It is believed that the proposal, if implemented, would make it difficult for Ghanaian police officers who take bribes on the roads, to keep the cash they collect.

However, sources within the Police Command say the officers will resist any attempt to make their uniforms pocketless, because the pockets also beautifies the total appearance of a police officer.
