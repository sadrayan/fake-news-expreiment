Emails, David Wysong, senior adviser, Beto O’Rourke U.S. Senate campaign, July 26-27, 2017

Subject: URGENT inquiry for a PAC contribution fact-check

Date: July 25, 2017 at 4:42:21 PM MDT

I am helping to complete a fact-check we started a while back on Beto O’Rourke’s statement that he and one other member of Congress were alone in not accepting PAC donations.

Today I noticed that the Center for Responsive Politics says that since 2011, O’Rourke has fielded about $297,000 in PAC contributions, which account for about 5 percent of his total contributions. We’ve already noticed separately that some PAC contributions are conduit PAC contributions. Would O’Rourke have an itemization of the conduit PAC contributions he’s gotten over the years running for his House seat and now the Senate seat? Any other information on point?

We hope to finish this fact-check Wednesday.

Open Secrets appears to have loaded someone else's information under the Congressman's name.

At first glance it appears to be Senator Cruz's information but I have not verified that.

I have attached a screen shot of their incorrect page as well as the Beto for Texas FEC summary that shows $0 contributions from PACs.

Hope this is helpful, please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Looks like the screen shot didn't go through. I will send via text as well.
