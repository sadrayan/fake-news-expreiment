Defend Arizona
We’re fighting for hardworking, patriotic Arizonans. We stand for lower taxes, limited government, a strong military and secure borders.

Arizona deserves principled, conservative leaders who will fight for our veterans, defend our Second Amendment rights, and keep our hard-earned money from being wasted on poorly-run government programs. We support leaders who have fought for our country—not just career politicians.

There can be no compromise in defending our nation and its citizens from terrorism—and that requires new leaders who have real experience in serving our nation and confronting America’s enemies.

Please join our fight to Defend Arizona and keep our country and families secure!
