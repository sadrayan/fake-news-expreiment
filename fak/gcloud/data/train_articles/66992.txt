“You know, there’s something in the Iran deal that people I don’t think really understand or know about, and nobody’s able to explain it, that if somebody attacks Iran, we have to come to their defense,” Trump said on “CNN Tonight” on Tuesday.

“And I’m saying, does that include Israel?” the business mogul continued. “And most people say yes, they don’t have an exclusion for Israel.

“So if Israel attacks Iran, according to that deal, I believe the way it reads … that we have to fight with Iran against Israel,” he continued.

The GOP presidential front-runner called the deal “unsignable” and said he would have been a tougher negotiator.

“I like the idea of a deal, but they should have doubled up the sanctions for another couple of months, and they would have come to the table and they would have been begging to make a good deal,” Trump said.

The deal, negotiated between Iran and six world powers, puts restrictions on Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions.

Republicans are bringing a resolution of disapproval when Congress returns. The deal, though, is expected to survive. President Obama has vowed to veto any legislation that blocks the deal and has enough votes in the Senate to sustain his veto.
