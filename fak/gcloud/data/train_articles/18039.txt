Gun Violence by the Numbers
An analysis of gun homicide rates in developed countries— those considered “high-income” by the World Bank — found that the United States accounted for 46 percent of the population but 82 percent of the gun deaths.Erin Grinshteyn and David Hemenway, "Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010," American Journal of Medicine, 2015. The World Bank defines a high-income country as one with a gross national income per capita greater than $12,736. The study analyzed data from populous (>1 million inhabitants), high-income countries that were members of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) in 2010. Additionally, the study excluded Iceland and Luxembourg from the broader OECD for having very small populations, and also excluded Greece and Switzerland for not using detailed ICD-10 codes.
