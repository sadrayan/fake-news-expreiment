Todd Akin accepts 'Bill Nye the Science guy's' challenge
While the supposed quote from Bill Nye reported in August from the Daily Currant turned out to be a fake, it made quite an impression from those that disagree with Todd Akin's crazy claim of illegitimate rape. It made such a huge wave on the Internet and Facebook, that Todd Akin actually responded to the challenge issued by Bill Nye in the fake quote! August 1, Todd Akin had this to say about the challenge;

“I accept Bill ‘Lies’ the Science Guy and his challenge for a debate. He’ll quickly learn that the word of god will always win over the word of some guy.”

This acceptance was made at the Museum of Creation in Kentucky. Recently, Bill Nye went on YouTube and made a video claiming that creationism hurts kids when looking at it from a science standpoint. Akin went on to say;

“This name calling by Bill just shows his true colors.That’s how all these atheists are. They anger god with their gays in the military, lesbians on the Supreme Court, all this promiscuity in Hollywood and in music and on the streets. Then we have this guy Bill Nye going around saying we can’t teach the word of god to our children! Of course this angers god and that is what is causing these hurricanes. Bill Nye said any place, any time. Well I’m naming the Creation Museum in Kentucky, September 15th at noon sharp. I’ll be there to debate real, legitimate science. We’ll see if Bill has the guts to show up."

Paul Horner, the executive producer of NBC has agreed to televise the debate if Nye agrees to the terms, which he has yet to respond. One Portlander had this to say about seeing such an interesting debate televised;

"This will be a beautiful disaster. I can't wait to see Nye wipe the floor with Akin. Akin has no ground to stand on as Nye's terms were to debate science-- not god."

What do you think Portland? Would you watch a televised debate of Akin and Nye?
