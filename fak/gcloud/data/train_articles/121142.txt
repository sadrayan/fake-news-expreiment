McDonald’s all-day breakfast may be cheaper than the ‘Dollar Menu & More’
You may not be able to get a McDonald’s cheeseburger for $1, or even $2, at lunch, but now you could have a Sausage McMuffin for about $1.50.

McDonald’s MCD, +1.50% on Tuesday launched an all-day breakfast menu to the majority of its locations, and people mourning the loss of the old Dollar Menu, which offered certain items for just $1, may find solace in swapping a burger patty for a sausage patty.

The fast food chain has been moving away from its value-focused Dollar Menu since it rebranded the offerings in 2013 as “Dollar Menu & More,” adding more items and raising prices. Since the transition, staples that used to sell for $1, like the Cheeseburger and McDouble sandwiches, sell for $2.48 and $1.82, respectively, according to current estimates of prices at New York locations by data collection company Fast Food Menu Prices.

“We are moving to a strategy of more flexibility for the local markets to price the Dollar Menu & More,” McDonald’s U.S. President Mike Andres said in a transcript of the company’s earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2014. He added that this flexibility would allow franchises to price items in-line with the market and above the previous dollar standard.

The average price of the all-day breakfast menu, which includes six breakfast sandwiches, a sausage burrito, two versions of hot cakes, a parfait, oatmeal and hash browns, is $2.71. The average price of all of McDonald’s sandwich and wrap offerings, including those on the Dollar Menu & More, plus four-piece chicken McNuggets and small fries, is $3.77—a 28% difference.

While McDonald’s price hikes on its regular menu are an effort to keep up with rising commodity and labor costs, according to a Bloomberg report, and its pricier additions to the sandwich menu are meant to contend with increasingly competitive fast casual restaurants like Chipotle, it has recognized customers’ dissatisfaction. In a transcript of the company’s 2015 second quarter earnings call, McDonald’s chief executive Steve Easterbrook said that customers had been “bothered” by the additional fees that had come with the revamped Dollar Menu.

McDonald’s didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
