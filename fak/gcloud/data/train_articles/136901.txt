Queen of Reggae Marcia Griffiths Says 'Electric Slide' Not About Vibrators
The singer of the famed “Electric Slide” is furious people would cheapen her “pure and happy” song by suggesting it’s inspired by a sex toy.

The Blast spoke with Marcia Griffiths, who said she was beyond shocked and offended when she heard her “clean, pure and happy” song had been turned into “something so wicked.”

Earlier this week, news went viral claiming Griffiths’ “Electric Slide” was actually about a vibrator. The reports claimed the original singer/songwriter, reggae legend Bunny Wailer was behind the revelation. When Wailer first released the song in 1983 it was called “Electric Boogie,” Griffiths then remixed it to the famous dance version, and tells us “I don’t sing about vibrators … I sing to teach, educate and uplift.”

She says the 80’s hit is about “positive vibrations, not vibrators,” and that when she called Wailer to find out what was going on, he had no clue about the rumor.

The 68-year-old, who once sang backup vocals for Bob Marley, explains the actual story behind the OG “Electric Boogie.” She purchased a music box with a meager amount of money she made while performing in Toronto, and then brought the trinket home to Jamaica to show Bunny Wailer.

Griffiths says he wrote the song in less than 24 hours, and that “I bought that little box and out of it came a beautiful hit song that inspired Jamaicans,” and that “If it was about a vibrator, that would’ve never happened.”

Plus, she says “We didn’t even know what a vibrator was.”

Now we don’t have to feel weird about doing the “Electric Slide” with our aunt at the next family function.
