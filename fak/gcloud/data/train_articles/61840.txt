Bone Spurs: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, & Prevention
Bone spurs (also called osteophytes) are smooth, hard bumps of extra bone that form on the ends of bones. They often pop up in the joints -- the places where two bones meet. Bone spurs can form on many parts of your body, including your: Hands

Shoulders

Neck

Spine

Hips

Knees

Feet (heels) Most bone spurs don't cause problems. But if they rub against other bones or press on nerves, you might experience pain and stiffness.

What Causes Bone Spurs? The most common cause of bone spurs is joint damage from osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. The cushioning between your joints and the bones of your spine can wear down with age. Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and gout can also damage your joints. Bone spurs also often form after an injury to a joint or tendon. When your body thinks your bone is damaged, it tries to fix it by adding bone to the injured area. Other causes of bone spurs include: Injuries

Overuse â€“ for example, if you run or dance a lot over a long period of time

Genes

Diet

Obesity

Bone problems that you were born with

Narrowing of the spine (spinal stenosis)
