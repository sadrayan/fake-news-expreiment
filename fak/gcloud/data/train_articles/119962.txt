DIMETHYLPOLYSILOXANE Explanation This compound has been evaluated for acceptable daily intake by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (see Annex 1, Ref. No. 20) in 1969. Since the previous evaluation additional data have become available and are summarized and discussed in the following monograph. The previously published monograph has been expanded and is reproduced in its entirety below. BIOLOGICAL DATA BIOCHEMICAL ASPECTS Some silicone fluids may contain 5% silica. Data on methylphenyl or other mixed polysiloxanes are not applicable to dimethyl polysiloxane. Mouse Groups each of 12 male Buckberg mice which had been fasted four hours received a single dose of 0.5 ml/kg bw sesame oil containing 0 or 6 mg/kg (SiO 2 )x, or 0.5 ml/kg bw of Anti foam A or 1.67 ml/kg emulsion of Antiform A, (Antiform A is a mixture of polydimethylsiloxanes containing trimethylsilyl and blocks and 18% low molecular weight species as well as dispersed silica) or Antifoam B (polydimethylsiloxane plus dispersed silica) or other polydimethylsiloxanes with or without emulsifiers. Urine was removed direct from the bladder and bile direct from the gall bladder 4, 12 and 24 hours after treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in urinary or biliary silicon concentrations, with the exception of the A in oil and A emulsion groups, which were higher than controls. However, the amount present only represented a very small percentage of that available for absorption from the gut (Dow Corning Corp., 1974). Monkey Three rhesus monkeys maintained in metabolic chambers were administered a single dose of 14C-labelled polydimethylsiloxane (prepared from randomly labelled dimethyl cyclic siloxanes), at dose levels equivalent to 1.15, 13.7 and 18.0 mg/kg bw. Approximately 0.5 to 0.9% of the dose was found in expired air. The half-life for pulmonary elimination was 4-6 hours. Less than 0.1% of the dose was lost as volatiles from urine, flatus and faecal material. Approximately 2.0 to 2.5% of the dose was present in urine, with a half-life of 24 hours. The bile contained 0.1 to 0.3% of the dose in the first 24 hours post dosing. Faecal material collected over a 92 hour period contained 80-90% of the dose. Blood levels were below detection limit (1 Âµg/ml). In another study in which the C14-labelled polydimethylsiloxane was essentially free of low molecular weight species, oral dosing at 21.8, 41.8 mg/kg bw resulted in 0.01 to 0.02% recovery of the dose in expired air, 0.001-0.22% in urine and 93-97% in faeces. Analyses of the silicone fraction in the faeces indicated that no chemical change had occurred. Analyses of 40 tissues from an animal 72 hours post dosing showed that the total cumulative radiolabel in the tissues was less than 0.01% of the administered dose (Dow Corning Corp., 1974). TOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES Special studies on neurotoxicity Rat, rabbit, monkey Male rats, New Zealand white rabbits and female cynomolgus monkeys were injected spinally with dimethylpolysiloxane fluid (Dow Corning MF 360). The test animals were sacrificed 30 or 90 days after injection. There was no evidence of neurological effect. At autopsy, none of the test rabbits or monkeys showed any significant pathological change in any of the nervous tissues. Changes observed in the nervous tissue of rabbits were as frequent in controls (treated with saline) as in test animals (Hine et al., 1969). Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 14-C labelled dimethyl-polysiloxane. Twenty-five days after dosing, 96.52% of the dose was in the tissues. None was found in accumulated urine and faeces samples. Most of the activity was distributed in the fat (51.0%). The liver contained 13.5-16.1% of the activity, presumably in the fat. None was present in heart or blood. C14-labelled silicone was administered to rats by intracisternal injection, and tissue distribution studied 45 days after dosing. Approximately 92% of the administered activity was recovered in the tissues. The largest fraction was present in the brain, vertebral column and spinal cord, 41.1, 31.4 and 9.9% respectively, 10% or less was present in the fat, and traces of the C14 label were present in the spleen, liver and lungs. There was no evidence of demethylation (Hine et al., 1969). Acute toxicity LD 100 Animal Route mg/kg bw Reference Rat s.c. >5 000 Frazer, 1959 " i.m. >5 000 " " i.p. >5 000 " Rabbit s.c. >5 000 " " i.m. >5 000 " " i.p. >5 000 " Parenteral administration produced no significant gross or histopathological abnormalities nor was any silicate found in the urine of rats or rabbits (Frazer, 1959). Transient conjunctival irritation has been noted both in rabbits and man for 24-48 hours after contact (Child et al., 1951). The data on acute toxicity vary with the viscosity and are generally i.p. rat > 10 ml/kg bw (Rowe et al., 1948). Only hexamethyldisiloxane and dodecamethylpentasiloxane appeared to be toxic in acute tests and irritant on intradermal or subcutaneous application to rabbits. For all the silicones on test 20 percutaneous applications for one month produced no adverse effects (Rowe et al., 1948). Short-term studies Rat Four groups of five female rats each were fed diet containing 0% and 0.1% silicone for three months. No adverse effects were noted on general condition, body weight, growth rate, blood urea levels and organ weights. The histopathology of major organs was normal (Child et al., 1951). Groups of five female adult rats received 20 doses of 0, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 g/kg bw of silicone fluid (350 cSt) over 28 days without deleterious effects on growth, haematology, organ weights and histopathology (Rowe et al., 1948). Silicone fluids of viscosity 50, 350, 1000, 10 000, 60 000 cSt were fed for 90 days to five groups of 10 male and 10 female rats at a level of 1% in their diet. Twenty males and 20 females were controls. No significant adverse effects were noted on mortality and food consumption, body weight, haematological indices, organ weights and histopathology (MacDonald et al., 1960). Two groups of 15 rats received dimethylpolysiloxane (DC151) at 0.3 and 1.0% of their diet with 10 rats acting as controls. Food consumption, haematology and mortality experience were similar for test and control groups. There was slight depression of body weight in the group receiving the highest dietary level (Pollard, 1960). Groups of five male and five female rats were fed a diet containing 1% silicone fluids of viscosity 50 and 350 cSt for one year. Controls consisted of 10 male and 10 female rats. No adverse effects were noted upon body weight, haematology, blood urea, nitrogen, SGPT, cholesterol, serum alkaline phosphates, urinalysis, organ weights. Histological findings in major organs were normal (Carson et al., 1966). A group of 10 rats (five male and five female) was fed a mixture (96% liquid dimethylpolysiloxane and 4% silica aerogel) in the diet at a level of 1% for one year. Ten male and 10 female rats served as control. No significant differences were found between the test and the control animals in growth, body weight, haematology, blood urea, urine analysis, serum pyruvic transaminase activity, organ weight (10 organs) and histopathology (13 organs) (Carson et al., 1966). Three groups of five male and five female rats were maintained for approximately 260 days on diets containing 0.0%, 0.5% and 2% of a silicone emulsion consisting of 50% Antifoam A (silicon eith silica) with 2% pentaerythritol distearate as the emulsifying agent. No adverse effects were noted on body weight and organ weights. Blood remained normal and no abnormal amounts of protein were seen on reproduction as measured by mating to produce and wean single sets of offspring in each group (Frodsham, 1956). Rabbit In a similar experiment the same mixture was fed to a group of six rabbits (three male and three female) at a level of 1% in the diet for eight months. Six male and six female rabbits served as control. No significant differences were found between the test and the control animals in any of the parameters listed in the rat study (Carson, 1966). Groups of three male and three female rabbits were fed diets containing 1% silicone fluids of viscosity 50 and 350 cSt for eight months. Controls consisted of six male and six female rabbits. No adverse effects were noted upon body weight, haematology, blood urea, nitrogen, SGPT, cholesterol, serum alkaline phosphatase, urinalysis, organ weights. Histological findings on major organs were normal (Carson et al., 1966). Dog Groups of two adult dogs were each fed doses of 0, 300, 1000 or 3000 mg/kg bw silicone fluid five days each week for six months. Apart from moist and frequent loose stools in test dogs no abnormal effect on body weight was noted. Small amounts of silicone could be recovered from the faeces of the group fed 3000 mg/kg bw. Haematology and urinalysis gave no abnormal findings. Gross and histopathology revealed nothing abnormal. The liver of all dogs fed silicone fluid but not of controls presented brown/black deposits of iron-free bile in the Kupffer cells and parenchyma, the quantities being directly related to the silicone dose administered. Similar deposits were also found in the interlobular bile ducts of dogs fed the highest dose. The significance of these observations remains unexplained (Child et al., 1951). Two adult male dogs received daily 1.0 and 313 g/kg bw dimethylpolysiloxane (DC151) in divided doses for eight months. No abnormalities were detected regarding behaviour, body weight, haematology and urinalysis. Monthly biopsies of liver, spleen, kidney and bone marrow were normal in all respects (Pollard, 1960). Monkey Two groups of two monkeys were fed dimethylpolysiloxane (DC151) five days a week for eight months either 100 or 300 g/day. One monkey was used as control. All monkeys exhibited occasional diarrhoea. No other abnormalities were observed (Pollard, 1960). Long-term studies Rat Groups of 25 male and 25 female rats were kept on a diet containing 0% or 0.3% silicone fluid for two years. There was no difference between tests and controls regarding appearance, growth, survival or morbidity, haematology, blood urea, liver lipids, organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic pathology (Rowe et al., 1950). In another study three groups of 30 female and 10 male rats were fed a diet containing 0%, 0.01% and 0.1% silicone fluid and observed for two years. Two further generations were reared and fed the same diets. The F 1 generation was autopsied at 28 weeks, the F 2 generation at 25 weeks. There were no consistent adverse effects as regards body weights, gross and histopathology. The consistent slight weight increase of the small gut was not statistically significant. No silica was found in the gut wall or any undue rise in other organs. Tumoric incidence was not abnormal. Liver function tests, urinalysis, fat absorption, renal function tests and haematology were not remarkable for F 1 and F 2 tests and controls (Frazer, 1959). Two groups of 10 weanling rats were kept on a diet containing 0% and 0.1% silicone fluid for two years. There was no consistent adverse effect as regards body weight, behaviour and histopathology (Gloxhuber & Hecht, 1955). OBSERVATIONS IN MAN Preparations containing dimethylpolysiloxane have been used therapeutically in man to reduce foaming during gastroscopy and as anti-flatulence treatment at doses of up to 200 mg/day (Dailly & Rider, 1954; Garry, 1956; Oswald, 1961; Hock, 1962; Entine, 1962; Reinhardt, 1961). Twenty-seven patients received 48 ml dimethylpolysiloxane (DC151) in divided doses for 3-13 months without significant toxic effects except occasional nausea (Pollard, 1960). Polydimethylsiloxanes A and M compounds either in sesame oil or emulsified were administered orally in single doses (100 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg solids for emulsions) to humans under conditions of controlled dietary and fluid intake. Administration of the test compound M did not result in a statistically significant increase in total or organosoluble urinary silicon eliminated in the 72 hours following administration of the test compound. This compound does not contain low M.W. polymers. Administration of compound A, which contains low M.W. polymers, resulted in increased urinary output of silicon and organosoluble urinary silicon during the 72 hour post dosing period. 1.8-3.3% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine. About 25% of this was in the form of a soluble organosilicon compound that has not been identified. Examination of expired air indicated no organosilicon compounds were exhaled by individuals receiving compound M. In the case of compound A, approximately 0.35% of the dose was exhaled in the eight- hour post dosing period. The exhaled material contained principally octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and a small amount of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (Anonymous, 1974). Comments: Studies have been carried out on silicone fluids with and without the addition of silica. The presence of silica did not raise any toxicological problems nor did it affect the results of the experiment in a significant way. Short-term studies have been carried out in several species, including one study on an emulsion of dimethylpolysiloxane. An adequate long-term study with dimethylpolysiloxane has been carried out in the rat. None of these studies has revealed any significant toxicity. The metabolic studies, including those in man, indicate that the orally administered dimethylsiloxanes are mainly excreted unchanged in the faeces. The provision of this data meets the requirements of the committee for metabolic studies.
