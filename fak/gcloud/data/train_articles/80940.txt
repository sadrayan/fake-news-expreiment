Walker would lower salary givebacks
By of the

Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker said Tuesday he'll scale back the amount of his paycheck he returns to the county, if he's re-elected to another term April 1.

Walker will cut the sum he gives back from $60,000 annually to $10,000. He said he's already returned a great deal - some $360,000 by the end of the month - and will have upped that to a total of $400,000 by the end of the next term.

The job pays $129,611 a year, a sum that won't change in the next term.

Walker volunteered to give back $60,000 of that per year when he was first elected in 2002 on a reform platform that included criticism of the pay level for county executive and other county jobs. At that time, the Milwaukee County executive was paid more than the governor, which seemed out of whack, Walker said.

He has also said returning a portion of his paycheck gives him some moral authority in attempting county budget cuts.

He joked today that his decision to continue giving back nearly 47% of his salary every year has been unpopular with his wife. He said he felt it was important to still return a portion annually and that he had settled on the $10,000 figure.

Walker said he hadn't made any decision about whether he wants to run for governor in 2010. That would be the midpoint of the next county executive term.

"My only focus is on running for county executive right now," he said.

His opponent, state Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee), has charged that Walker is planning another run for governor in 2010. Walker ran for the Republican nomination for governor in 2005 and early 2006, then dropped out of the race.

Taylor said that if elected she would accept the full salary. She said she plans to serve the full term.
