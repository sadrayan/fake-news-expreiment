'He Was More of a Liberal Type': CNN Guest Identifies Aaron Alexis as Having 'Liked' Obama Admin
On Tuesday, a guest on CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper who knew the alleged Washington Navy Yard shooter, Aaron Alexis, identified that he had a number of political conversations with the late mass shooter. The guest said that he found Alexis to be “more of a liberal type” and a supporter of President Barack Obama.



Tapper quizzed Michael Ritrovato, described as a close acquaintance and co-worker of Alexis’, about what could make the mass shooter perform such a violent action. Ritrovato replied that he was not clear as to Alexis’ motives, but he did note that Alexis was an avid player of violent videogames.

“Aaron wasn’t conservative, like I am,” Ritrovato added. “He was more of a liberal type.”

“He wasn’t happy with the former administration,” he continued. “He was more happy with this administration, as far as presidential administrations.”

He said that, in spite of their political differences of opinion, Alexis had respect for him and they had a friendly relationship.
