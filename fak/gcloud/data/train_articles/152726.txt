Trump says wants U.S. to leave Syria soon
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he wants to withdraw American troops from Syria “relatively soon” but not before their mission is completed, adding that negotiations over the crisis there should be part of a larger deal regarding Iran.

“We want to come home. We’ll be coming home. But we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint, and that was a very big part of our discussion,” Trump said at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House.
