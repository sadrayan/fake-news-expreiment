Television spending in Sink-Jolly race at $8.2 million
Spending in the Alex Sink-David Jolly TV ad war has reached an eye-popping $8.2 million, according to the latest figures. Of that, $6.3 million comes from outside groups.

Democrats are outspending Republicans thanks to the significant advantage by Sink, who has spent $1.5 million to Jolly's $352,000. Sink did not face a primary and saw her coffers swell with money from outside the district.

Here is the breakdown, as provided to the Buzz from a source with knowledge of the buys. The total does not include direct mail, which is flooding mailboxes across the Pinellas County district. By one estimate, $635,000 has been spend so far on mailers. That puts overall spending at $8.8 million.
