New National Levee Database Published

Welcome to the National Levee Database (NLD). The NLD is a congressionally authorized database that documents levees in the United States. The NLD is maintained and published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). It recently underwent a refresh making more tools available to data managers to keep information updated and provides an improved dashboard that makes finding and understanding levee information easier than ever. NLD information includes the location, general condition, and risks associated with the levees. The NLD contains information about the condition and risk information for approximately 2,000 levee systems (approximately 15,000 miles/mostly levees affiliated with USACE programs. An additional 6,000 levee systems--approximately 15,000 miles--have location information, but little to no information about condition and risk. One of the goals for the NLD is to include data about levees owned and operated by all other federal agencies, tribes, states, municipalities, levee boards, and private entities. This information will be added as it becomes available. The database includes attributes of levees and floodwalls relevant to flood fighting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, repair and inspection. Because the location and characteristics of levee systems can be viewed on a map with real-time data from other sources, such as stream gauges and weather radar, it is a useful tool for a variety of public agencies and individuals including flood plain managers, emergency management agencies, levee system sponsors and citizens who live or work behind a levee. The NLD information is presented in a convenient dashboard and includes the ability to search on specific areas of interest or geographically.
