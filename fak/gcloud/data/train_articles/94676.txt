Trump Winery
Our History



Planted in 1999 and nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains,

Trump Winery is situated on a 1,300-acre estate just a few miles from Thomas

Jefferson’s Monticello, the birthplace of American viticulture, and James Monroe’s Ash Lawn-Highland

in Charlottesville, VA. Planted with nearly 200 acres of French vinifera varieties, Trump Winery is Virginia’s largest vineyard and the largest vinifera vineyard on the East Coast.



Opening in 2011, the winery features over 50,000 square feet of state of the art winemaking facilities, 100,000 gallon tank capacity, and 750 barrel cave producing sparkling, white, and red wines. Trump Winery is privileged to continue Virginia’s rich legacy of winemaking dating back to the Jamestown settlement in 1607. Today we are proud to be one of the more than 260 wineries in Virginia, which ranks 5th in total wine production in the United States.
