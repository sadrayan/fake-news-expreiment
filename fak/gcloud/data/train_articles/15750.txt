Here’s the source for student loans: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/05/08/map-where-the-average-student-loan-burden-is-largest/

On the truck:

We pulled the average pick truck price from Cars Direct, which is research portal for buying cars. According to Cars Direct, an average 2010 Ford F-150 costs $22,355 and a 2010 Dodge RAM 1500 costs $21,510.

Please let me know if you have any further questions on this.

Thanks!

Also, I’m curious about this claim:

students aren’t allowed to refinance their loans at lower rates--unlike car owners.

Warren remarked that borrowers could refinance home loans and car loans, but not student loans. In a way she’s right. Plus, student loan debt is a burden hanging over many recent graduates (and some not-so-recent graduates). And the concern is that this burden on individuals could become a burden on the economy as a whole.”
