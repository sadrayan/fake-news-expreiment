The National Strategic Plan for HIV, TB and STIs 2017â€“2022 aims to accelerate progress towards meeting the Fast-Track Targets by: reducing new HIV infections; improving treatment, care and support; reaching key and vulnerable populations; and addressing the social and structural drivers of HIV, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections. The plan will be implemented through nine provincial implementation plans. To address the high number of new HIV infections among young women and adolescent girls, a national prevention campaign called She Conquers has been launched.
