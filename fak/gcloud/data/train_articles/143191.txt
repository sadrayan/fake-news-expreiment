ACOG Denounces False Claims About Ob-Gyns
Washington, D.C. -- Lisa Hollier, M.D., M.P.H., president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, issued the following statement in response to false claims made regarding the delivery of abortion care:

“The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) strongly denounces the grossly inaccurate description of ob-gyns and the women they care for.

“The rhetoric used to describe the delivery of abortion care was offensive, wrong, and dangerous. Claims of this sort undermine the public’s trust in ob-gyns and stigmatize necessary health care for women.

“Politicians must never use inflammatory language that can contribute to or encourage hostility or violence toward doctors, other medical professionals or individuals seeking or receiving health care.

“As the largest organization of women’s health care providers, ACOG proudly stands behind our members who provide comprehensive health care for women, delivered with quality, safety, integrity, and compassion."
