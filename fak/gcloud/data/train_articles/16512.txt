Good afternoon. I write on behalf of the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project to seek your basis for your quoted statement in what looks like a League of Women Voters guide that

60% of Austin's "waterways are found to be contaminated by fecal matter and deemed unsafe to swim.‚Äù

I see otherwise that the American-Statesman wrote a news story on tests of waterways in 2017, here. That story includes a web link to a study.

Is there any other information you relied on?

You also are quoted attributing the described condition of waterways to dogs and to dog owners letting the dogs poop near waterways. How did you reach that conclusion?

We start every fact-check by asking the person or group making a claim to share its factual backup. In every instance, we rely on attributable on-the-record information.

Thanks,

Thank you for getting back to me on this issue. The article in the Statesman clearly stated my claim that over 60% of our waterways are contaminated with fecal matter. Furthermore, information on AustinTexas.gov states that over 250,000 dogs live in Austin and generate over 150,000 pounds of waste throughout the city every day. If this waste isn't properly disposed of, it can cause a serious problem with our health and water quality, increasing the risk of salmonella and other viruses as well as making our waterways unsafe to fish and swim in. Our City even has signs along Bull Creek specifically addressing this issue. While this is not the sole cause of our water pollution, it absolutely plays a significant role and it is an issue we can have direct control over if our police did a better job of ticketing individuals who refuse to clean up after their pets. I hope this answered your question. Thank you once again for reaching out and I hope you have a great night.
