Luke Thomas Hoyer Obituary
Memories Luke Thomas Hoyer

Bridgette Beinecke Dearest Family, Friends and Classmates of Luke Hoyer.

This Saturday I will be holding a poster with a picture of Luke as I march with all those who are coming together in Austin, Texas to seek the end of gun violence.

I am joining a group of my friends who are part of Buddist Action Now. I will be walking in silence in order for people to see Luke rather than me. I will be holding this poster with the greatest respect for Luke and for each of you.



I do not want to do anything that would increase your pain. If you would prefer that I not use his photo, please feel free to post your preference on this site and I will check back before Saturday morning. The photo is the one used by the press to identify him.



As a parent of two adult sons, I can only imagine the depth of your grieving. Please know that I am holding you compassionately in my heart and mind.

Luke's spirit inspires my resolve to do my part in preventing such a deep loss and expressing the need for a change in the gun laws.



After the June 2015 shooting at the Emmanuel AME Church, I sent a Haiku poem to dear friends and the citizens of Charleston S.C. I am writing a new one to put beneath Luke's photo. Here is the one for Charleston.



prayer vigil

hearts swarming

seeking infinite peace



With a bouquet of MENTAL HUGS,

Bridgette B.







Amber DeFord I knew Luke. There was a time where I talked to him every single day but more recently it was only every once in a while. No one who knows him personally knows who I am because I met him online about 2 years ago. When I saw his face and heard his name on that list I cried for days without stopping. I have started to be involved in the efforts for gun control in my state. I miss talking to him, I wish I could have said more. I hope that no one ever has to go through the loss of a friend or a loved one due to a shooting ever again.

Camille Marro My heart hurts everyday. I wish I could reverse this for your family. I pray everyday for you and keep Luke in my thoughts. I know he is around you still shining his light and beauty. My prayers are with your family.

Christian Touhey We will never forget you Luke.

May God bless you and your family in this time of sorrow. R.I.P. Luke

Josie Little My deepest condolences to your family and your son, Luke. I am a freshman myself, and share the same birthday as Luke. I can‚Äôt imagine what this pain is like, to lose a child. I am deeply sorry for your loss. You are in my thoughts and prayers, and now every single year of my birthday, which is on October 25, Luke will forever be in my heart. I remember when I talked to Luke on instagram, and he was being so sweet. He will forever live on and so will all the other 16 victims of the Florida shooting. RIP Luke Thomas Hoyer. I will never forget the day we started talking and became friends. You will be missed by not only by hundreds, but by thousands, and millions. Rest In Peace, Luke. Your legacy will live on forever. You will be missed.üòûüòûüò¢üò¢‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
