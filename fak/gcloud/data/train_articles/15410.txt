The 77% number came from the sentencing commission, which is published on their website: http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/annual-reports-and-sourcebooks/2015/Table09.pdf.

Again, as we clarified earlier, the Congressman was not talking about “drug offenders”. He was talking about a very specific subset, those in jail for simple possession. He chose his words very carefully. The data you received from the Federal Bureau of Prisons has nothing to do with the Congressman’s point. Insinuating otherwise would be completely mischaracterizing the Congressman’s remarks.

Furthermore, as you stated that data is only from 2015, as that was the most recent data the Congressman had. However, if you want to go deeper, you will find that the data from 2014, 2013, and 2012 are 85%, 80%, and 72%, respectively. If you would like more recent information, according to the Sentencing Commission (info attached), as of March 27, 2016, there were 514 people incarcerated in federal prison for simple drug possession. The sentencing commission says 94.2% of these individuals were sentenced in 2016 and 95.5% of those are non-citizens. So, looks like Congressman Gohmert may have actually understated the number of non-citizen simple possession inmates in federal prison.
