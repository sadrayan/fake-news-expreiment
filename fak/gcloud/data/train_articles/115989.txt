Cerberus and its affiliates manage over $35 billion for many of the world’s most respected investors, including government and private sector pension and retirement funds, charitable foundations and university endowments, insurance companies, family offices, sovereign wealth funds and high net worth individuals.

Cerberus directs its global investment strategies from its headquarters in New York City, and draws on the expertise of a network of advisory offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.

Former Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle, chairman of Cerberus Global Investments, and former United States Secretary of the Treasury John W.

Their economic, public policy and international experience is invaluable to the Firm, its portfolio and its investors.

Our senior leadership team has worked together for nearly two decades, and many of our investment professionals have been with us for more than a decade. In partnership with former C-suite executives and operations specialists at our affiliate Cerberus Operations and Advisory Company, LLC (COAC), the team offers expertise across every investment strategy and allows us to move decisively in assessing, acting upon, managing and optimizing opportunities.
