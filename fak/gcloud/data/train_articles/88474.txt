Obama: SSN checks in jeopardy
Add one more terrifying item to the what-happens-if-we-default list: No Social Security checks.



That’s precisely what President Obama predicted Tuesday when new CBS Evening News anchor Scott Pelley asked him if he could guarantee that retirees and the disabled would get a huge batch of Social Security checks due to go out Aug. 3 – the day after the country’s debt limit is reached.



"I cannot guarantee that those checks go out on August 3rd if we haven't resolved this issue. Because there may simply not be the money in the coffers to do it," Obama said in an interview at the White House due to be aired later today.



Obama and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner have forecast dire consequences if the nation defaults on its debts – but some Republicans have accused the administration of using scare tactics and claim that Obama can prioritize payments, and could put Social Security at the top of his payee list if he wanted to.



The debt limit was the first topic addressed by White House press secretary Jay Carney at Tuesday’s daily briefing. "If we were to default on our obligations, who suffers? Democrats, Republicans or Americans? Americans suffer," he said.



Obama has refused to negotiate a short-term deal and is still holding out for his “grand bargain,” a massive multi-year package containing $4 trillion in spending cuts and tax revenue increases.



"This the United States of America and, you know, we don't manage our affairs in three-month increments. You know, we don't risk U.S. default on our obligations because we can't put politics aside," Obama told reporters yesterday.
