Join us for the 2016 Texas Faith Leader Summit on Wednesday, November 2, at the State Capitol Building in Austin, Texas. This is a unique opportunity to explore ways that the faith community can work with the State of Texas and Child Protective Services to benefit foster children. If your congregation has a child welfare ministry - or if you're thinking of starting one - meet us at the Summit!
