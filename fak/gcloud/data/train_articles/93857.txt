Chairman Tom Mechler’s Statement on the Texas GOP Primary

“I am thrilled to announce that on March 1, 2016, the Republican Party of Texas made history with record shattering voter turnout. The 2.8M Republican voters is double that of turnout in 2008 or 2012, and for the second time in party history there was a GOP primary in all 254 counties across the state of Texas (the last time was in 2000). We are proud of Senator Ted Cruz for not only winning his home state, but also for being the first Latino candidate from either party to win a Texas Presidential primary. The delegates awarded from the Texas GOP Presidential Primary have been awarding in the following manner; Texas Senator Ted Cruz received 104 delegates, Donald Trump received 48 delegates, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio received 3 delegates. The record shattering turnout is proof that the momentum is clearly on our side and a bad sign for any Democrat who thinks they will be able to win an election in Texas come November.”
