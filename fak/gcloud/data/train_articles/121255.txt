It’s been reported that Lady Gaga has been asked not to get political or talk about President Donald Trump during her Super Bowl halftime show, but that’s not going to stop her from trying to send her message.

This morning at a press conference, she was asked, “I know you spoke about kind of taking this moment to unify America a little bit. Are you going to do that at all? Are you going to make any kind of statements during the performance?”

She answered, “Well, I don’t know if I will succeed in unifying America. You’ll have to ask America when it’s over. But the only statements that I’ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I’ve been consistently making throughout my career.”

As far as what those statements are, she said, “I believe in a passion for inclusion. I believe in the spirit of equality, and the spirit of this country as one of love and compassion and kindness. So my performance will have both those philosophies.”
