When made: 2014

Where made: Party manifesto

Nigeria’s power generation has in recent years remained approximately 4,000 MW, not significantly different from 2015.

A daily briefing portal run by the vice president’s office put the electricity generation figure for 28 April at 4,111 MW. That was generated by 21 out of 29 power plants.

There are a number of power projects going on across the country, including the Zungeru hydroelectric power project (700 MW), which is expected to be completed in December 2019. The contract for the 3,050 MW Mambilla hydroelectric power project was signed in November 2017, while there are a number of solar power projects targeting hundreds of megawatts.

Ramp up output six times

Azura power plant came on board in April 2018, adding 459 MW to the national grid while Geometric power project (1,140 MW) has been completed but is not yet operational.

The current administration has expanded the country’s transmission network to 197 substations, up from 159 in 2015. And according to the Transmission Company of Nigeria actual transmission capacity stood at 7,124 MW at the end of February 2018.

The administration’s work is cut out for it to deliver on nearly six times its current generation. -Africa Check, May 2018
