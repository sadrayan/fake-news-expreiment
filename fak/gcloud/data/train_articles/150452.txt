The Fried criteria were among the earliest multi-domain definitions to index frailty, including shrinking (weight loss), muscle weakness (handgrip strength), poor endurance (self-reported exhaustion), slowness (gait speed) and low physical activity (kcal expended per week), estimated in community-dwelling people over 65 years, and this definition of frailty is now widely used in large epidemiological and clinical studies and formed the basis for the development of novel indexes to predict elderly people who have a higher risk of incidences of disease, hospitalization, falls, disability and mortality.
