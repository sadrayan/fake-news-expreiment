The statement is based on research conducted by Travis H. Brown for his book How Money Walks. As noted by the author, the data was obtained from the IRS Division of Statistics and the National Archives, and is presented here. Click on the state of Missouri to see how money is moving to and from the state. As you will see, it reports that between 1992 and 2010, over $791 million was lost to the state of Texas. That equates to more than $40 million each year.
