This is the raw number, prior to any reductions being applied.

You told us the term refers to counts of all daily trips without adjusting for trips that might be internal to the development itself, say, or for trips taken by a city bus.

Make sense?

Yes, that’s true. Adjusted = taking reductions into account. The “raw” number (unadjusted) is the projected trip generation count, in addition to the background traffic growth. This “unadjusted” trip number is generated by the ITE Calculator, an industry standard, which calculates trip generation based on the size and use of the development.
