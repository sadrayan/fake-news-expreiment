Vice President Joe Biden gropes White House reporter
Sure, he likely didn’t mean anything overtly sexual by it. But Vice President Joe Biden is a folksy kind of guy who has officially entered dirty old man territory and done something sure to elicit laughs within the White House Press Corps. Look how he’s manhandling The Hill‘s White House Correspondent Amie Parnes for this photograph taken at a recent holiday party that she posted on her Facebook page. For most people’s tastes he’s grazing way too close to the vicinity of her abdomen. And watch her reaction. Is it shock, awe, utter disbelief? Whatever the expression, she appeared to roll with it with her hands firmly in control of his at least until the shot was over. If we were to guess her words we’d wager, “OH F–K SO THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.”
