Abstract

Ear is a very prominent part of the face after nose and eyes especially in Indian subcontinent where in both the males and females it adorns a variety of ornaments to beautify the face. However, because of limited functional importance of external ear the burns of the ear are often neglected. More often, isolated burns of the ear are very rare. They are usually involved with facial burns and therefore inhalational injuries. Overall management of burns to improve survival takes precedence over the management of just the burned ear. Therefore, neglected ear burns can lead to cosmetic deformity which can vary from minor to very severe. Giving due importance to this small structure can prevent a lot of morbidity during the acute phase and deformities later on as a sequel of burns. Correction of those deformities and giving a normal shape to the ear can be a very daunting task because of the intricacies involved in framing the cartilage and inadequate soft tissue availability in the surrounding area. This article emphasizes on the steps which can be taken from the first postburn day to avoid complications like chondritis, chondral abscess, and various other deformities because in a patient surviving burn injury, the quality of his or her life will be determined by the degree of these deformities.

Keywords: Ear burn, chondritis, deformity, cover

Established Ear Deformities

Mild - loss of helix and upper part of pinna without extensive scarring

Moderate - concha is normal, upper half of ear has sloughed out with loss of antihelix with its anterior and posterior crura.

Severe - only a remnant of concha, marked scarring of local soft tissue, external meatus normal or stenosed.

Group I: In this group the postauricular skin is normal and is used to provide cover to the cartilage framework.

Group II: In these patients the postauricular skin is either scarred or grafted but is soft and supple and can be therefore used for cover.

Group III: In these patients local skin is not available for draping the cartilage so temporoparietal fascia is used for covering cartilage as an axial or random flap.

Group IV: In these patients local and regional skin as well as fascia is not available for cover. A free temporoparietal fascial flap from contralateral side or free radial forearm fascial flap is indicated for them.

Group V: These are the patients in whom reconstruction is not possible because of non availability of local and regional skin and anaesthesia problems. They are therefore advised to use an external prosthesis.
