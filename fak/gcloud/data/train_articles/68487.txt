205 MILLION FANS TUNED IN

34 of 35 MOST-WATCHED SHOWS THIS FALL

SECOND CONSECUTIVE YEAR: NFL GAME TV’S MOST WATCHED SHOW ALL 17 WEEKS

NFL GAME VIEWERSHIP NEARLY TRIPLES BROADCAST PRIMETIME

RECORD SEASON FOR NFL NETWORK

Football fans tuned into the 2013 NFL season in BIG numbers. According to The Nielsen Company, the 2013 regular season reached 205 million unique viewers, representing 81 percent of all television homes and 70 percent of potential viewers in the U.S.

The 2013 NFL Regular Season averaged 17.6 million viewers per game telecast, the second most-watched season ever behind the 2010 season (17.9 million).

NFL games accounted for 34 of the 35 most-watched TV shows among all programming last fall (chart below).

Twenty-two NFL game telecasts this season were watched by at least 25 million viewers – nearly triple the total for the full 2012 season (eight).

For the second consecutive year, an NFL game was the week’s most-watched TV show in all 17 weeks of the season.

NFL games nearly tripled broadcast primetime viewership. NFL games on CBS, FOX and NBC averaged 20.3 million viewers – 190 percent higher than the average primetime viewership among the four major over-the-air networks (7.0 million average on ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC). That NFL advantage is more than triple the 56 percent edge of a decade ago (chart below).

Over the past decade, average viewership of NFL games on broadcast television has increased 31% from 15.5 million in 2003 to 20.3 million in 2013.
