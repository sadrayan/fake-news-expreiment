Gov Scott Honors Vets In Pensacola
Governor Rick Scott was in town Thursday morning to award 227 local veterans a special medal...and talk just a little politics.

Saying the Supreme Court "upheld our freedom of religion again this week", Scott made it clear how he stood on the recent Supreme Court decision on the Hobby Lobby case.

The Governor was at the national Guard Armory handing out the Governorâ€™s Veterans Service Award, which honors Floridians who have served in the U.S. Military. Well over 100 vets of all ages were awarded the medal. Don Gilford, an Air Force Veteran who served in Viet Nam appreciated the recognition, saying they didn't "get much fanfare" when they returned from Viet Nam.

Along with Governor Scott, Congressman Jeff Miller met each veteran receiving a medal at the ceremony. He spoke about the recent troubles at the V-A and added that just that morning they had uncovered yet another problem at the V.A. Miller did not elaborate on what that problem was, but said they would be talking about it in the coming weeks.

But for the most part politics took a back seat to honoring veterans at the event. The Governor is traveling all around the state giving out the Veterans Service Award. Any honorably discharged vet is eligible to receive the medal.

One other note, after the remarks, while the governor was handing out the medals...a woman became agitated and started shouting. She was forcibly removed from the hall. There have been no information released on her identity and why she was upset.
