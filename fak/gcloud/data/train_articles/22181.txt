Can you please advise whether or not Sir Win­ston Churchill said: “A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.” Many thanks.—A.S., Bermuda

It was Cordell Hull, not Churchill. I have a slight vari­a­tion of it in the “Red Her­rings” appen­dix of Churchill by Him­self, page 576:

“A lie will gal­lop halfway round the world before the truth has time to pull its breech­es on.” —Although com­mon­ly ascribed to Churchill (who would have said trousers, not breech­es), this was actu­al­ly writ­ten by Franklin Roosevelt’s Sec­re­tary of State, Cordell Hull.
