Here is the info. ...

The pdf files are the annual ads that you indicated you would like to have for your back-up. (These ads are listed in the Sources with the Truth-O-Meter article--PolitiFact Texas.)

The excel file is a summary of the annualized salaries by fiscal year. Our fiscal year runs from Oct 1 through Sep 30. When salaries are adjusted, the change takes place on Oct 1.

Commissioners, after being elected, take office on Jan 1. So, for example, Commissioner Eckhardt left office in late May/early June of 2013. She received approximately 8 months of the $88,812 annualized salary listed in the table. Commissioner Todd, when he took office shortly thereafter, indicated he wished to serve for a salary of $1. So, he received $1 in FY 2013 for the approximately 4 remaining months of FY 2013.

Also, note in Diana’s email below that there were no salary increases in FY 2010 and FY 2012.

...

Regards,

Leslie

Here’s the info that was requested. It’s the Excel spreadsheet. (See the chart here--PolitiFact Texas.)

I’ve also attached pdf’s of the official salary ads from the Chronicle from the FY 2008 budget process through FY 2014. There are no ads for FY 2010 and FY 2012 because there was no salary increase those years.

Let me know if you need anything else.

The ads list the not-to-exceed amount for the position. If a Commissioner wishes to accept a lower amount of pay and have that footnoted in the ad, they may do so. Or, they have the option of requesting a lower amount than advertised before the salary is entered into the payroll system for processing. In 2012, Commissioner Eckhardt requested that her salary remain at $88,812 rather than receiving the amount that had been advertised, which is the $95,595.

Based on the ads and your email below, it looks like her pay went from $83,716 in f 07 and f 08 to $86,646 in f 09 and f 10 to $88,812 from f 11 until she resigned in May 2013. That seem accurate? Yes.

From another vantage point, it looks to me like she declined a raise in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2013 while accepting the commission-approved percentage increases in f ’09 and f ’11, though from a lower previous pay amount than other commissioners. Make sense? Yes.

Anything else seem relevant?
