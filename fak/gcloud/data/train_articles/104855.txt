WKTV Scrolling Message Alert
CENTRAL NEW YORK - If you were watching our newscast around 6:17PM or at 10:38PM, you may have seen a "Hazardous Materials Warning" crawl across your screen.

There is no such warning. The message was an automated test which was not intended for public display.

This message originated from FEMA as a test and had the National Location Code in it. Tests should not have that code as it is automatically re-transmitted.

We have contacted New York State Broadcasters Association who administers the Emergency Alert System in New York. We are working with FEMA to resolve this.

Our apologies for the confusion this may have caused.
