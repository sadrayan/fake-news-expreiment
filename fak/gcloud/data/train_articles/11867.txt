Quorum Report: SOME CONSERVATIVES BLAST DEWHURST FOR LEAVING SENATE DURING ABORTION DEBATE
SOME CONSERVATIVES BLAST DEWHURST FOR LEAVING SENATE DURING ABORTION DEBATE “What’s up with that?” After raising some eyebrows by suggesting the point of SB 5 is indeed to shut down abortion facilities clinics around Texas, Lt. Gov. Dewhurst today doubled down on that message. He’s also starting to take some heat from his right for being at a steakhouse during some of this week’s Senate debate on the abortion restrictions that he asked Gov. Perry to place on the call. "If abortion facility owners won't spend some of their ill-gotten profits to protect women's health, they SHOULD be shut down," Dewhurst said on Twitter today. That’s after GOP senators on Tuesday night went out of their way to try to make it clear that the new facilities standards included in SB 5 are meant to “raise the standard of care” for women, not to shut down facilities.
