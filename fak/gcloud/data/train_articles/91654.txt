United States Speedtest Market Report
Top-end tiers get faster

During the first half of 2016, U.S. broadband top 10% download performance increased from 99.03 Mbps to 117.91 Mbps. The largest contributions to this increase came in the month of June from XFINITY and Cox Communications with average download speeds of 132.08 Mbps and 162.14 Mbps, respectively. The newly-created Spectrum was also a top-three contributor, ending the same period with a combined 131.97 Mbps.

Verizon, AT&T U-verse and CenturyLink all remained below 100 Mbps download. However, they have all shown modest improvement since the start of 2016. Despite the lower download speed, Verizon continues to shadow other top providers with its fast upload speeds, ending June at 97.71 Mbps. For comparison, Spectrum achieved the second fastest upload speed at the end of June with 23.37 Mbps.

XFINITY is fastest, again

XFINITY took fastest ISP in the U.S. with a top-tier download speed of 125.53 Mbps. XFINITY’s top download speeds have been consistently higher than those of other ISPs over the last year, though in the last couple months that gap has been closing. Despite the fastest download speeds, XFINITY claimed fourth place in upload speed with 15.26 Mbps.

Don’t count out Cox

Cox Communications came in second place in both download (117.85 Mbps) and upload (22.61 Mbps) speeds. Despite planned network improvements, we’ve seen relatively minor speed improvements from Cox since July 2015 until download speeds exploded in May and June of 2016. Cox increased download speeds 35% from 119.98 Mbps in April 2016 to 162.14 Mbps by the end of June. With Cox’s launch of their new G1GABLAST gigabit service in select areas, this pattern of increasing speed will likely continue and presumably place them in prime position to rise to the number one spot in U.S. download speed by the end of this year.

Spectrum, a new contender

Spectrum, the newly formed merger of Charter, TWC and Bright House, has the potential to greatly impact consumer speeds across the nation due to some promising pre-merger trends from TWC and Bright House. Charter was relatively flat between January and April of 2016 with an improvement of only 1.24 Mbps in top-tier speeds. TWC, however, improved its top-tier download speed by 34.54 Mbps from January 2016 to 152.70 Mbps in May 2016 when the merger took place. Bright House’s top download speed also increased to 152.16 Mbps, a gain of 21.02 Mbps from January, prior to the merger. Both TWC and Bright House’s network improvements helped Spectrum show an initial top download speed of 131.97 Mbps at the end of June 2016. We hope that Spectrum’s top-tier download speed continues to improve over the remainder of the year.

Verizon has the fastest upload

As mentioned earlier, Verizon’s fiber optic services achieved far higher upload speeds than other popular service providers. In 2012, Verizon launched its now retired FiOS Quantum product, which offered speeds of up to 300 Mbps down and 65 Mbps up. They now offer symmetrical internet services with speeds of up to 500 Mbps. Verizon’s download speed hovered around 83.91 Mbps at the start of January 2016 and ended June 2016 at 94.98 Mbps. Despite this slight increase, Verizon still falls squarely in the middle of the major U.S. providers for top download speeds.
