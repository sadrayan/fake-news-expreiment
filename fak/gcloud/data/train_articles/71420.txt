Our site is under heavy reconstruction. Most links will take you to our ancient site.

Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, Inc. (BHI), has been the leader in paleontological excavations and preparation since 1974, helping supply museums and collectors the finest in professionally prepared fossils and cast replicas. From dinosaurs to mammals, reptiles to pteranodons, ammonites to fish, and crinoids to trilobites, we do it all, and we do it well.
