STILL PENDING! FINAL ELECTION 2016 NUMBERS: TRUMP WON BOTH POPULAR ( 62.9 M -62.2 M ) AND ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES ( 306-232)…UPDATE: TRUMP SAYS SUBTRACT 3 MILLION ILLEGAL VOTES FROM HILLARY!
Final # Election2016 numbers

# PopularVote: # Trump: 62,972,226 # Clinton: 62,277,750

# ElectoralCollege vote # Trump 306 # Clinton 232

Update: Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump – finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago – Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media – which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already.

UPDATE 11/14/16: THREE MILLION ILLEGALS VOTED THIS 2016 ELECTION. THAT’S NOT VALID! REMOVE 3 MILLION VOTES FROM HILLARY CLINTON. PLUS THE OTHER VOTE FRAUD. TRUMP BY DEFAULT IS THE WINNER IN THE POPULAR VOTE!

It has been widely reported that there were more than 3 million votes cast by illegals and I bet 100% were cast for Hillary Clinton. Do the legal math, subtract the 3 million from Hillary’s fake popular vote and you got Trump beat Clinton by more than 1 million in the popular vote.

Alex Jones of Infowars also noted that on five Democrat states where Trump and Hillary were neck and neck, the last votes all went to Hillary Clinton – an impossible thing he said. Americans know there was a massive vote fraud – machines, dead people voting, illegals voting, Democrats calling for vote early and vote OFTEN. We are not blind. We know Democrat Party is a DIRTY PARTY and have even become shameless flaunting their dirt to the American people knowing they can get away with it. Vote fraud is treason. CROOKED HILLARY EQUALS CROOKED DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THEIR CROOKED MEDIA.

We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens. We are joining .@TrueTheVote to initiate legal action. #unrigged — Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 13, 2016

AS FOR ABSENTEE BALLOTS? From 100 Percent Fed Up:

‘States don’t count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn’t influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren’t counted.’

MY SOURCE:

As of 11/13/16, CNN and Wikipedia are still showing different numbers.

Example below: As of 11/13/16 CNN and Wikipedia quote same electoral vote number for Hillary Clinton but not with Trump – CNN still using the 290, Wikipedia 306 EV. They also differ when it comes to popular votes – CNN has more for Clinton, Wikipedia has less.

Remember, CNN projected a Trump popular vote victory when all ballots are counted. Then CNN claim “design flaw” for the projection.

CNN NUMBERS AS OF 11/13/16: http://edition.cnn.com/election/results

Projected electoral vote Trump 306 [1] [2] [3] Clinton 232

From 100 Percent Fed Up:

First of all, she’s probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. States don’t count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn’t influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren’t counted. Who votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore “won” the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California’s uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore’s 500,000 popular vote “victory.” (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You’re kidding.) Getting back to the “win the popular vote/lose the Electoral College” scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. Shortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country’s entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states.

Why HILLARY Did Not Win The Popular Vote? pic.twitter.com/2wedTgLhwF — Michael (@Koxinga8) November 13, 2016

To all the liberal loonies still rioting because you claim Trump did not get the popular vote, get your meds now and prepare to be shocked because the final results are in. Trump got 306 Electoral College vote while Hillary Clinton got 232. For # PopularVote: # Trump: 62,972,226 # Clinton: 62,277,750

Go see your therapists now – or maybe do a 24/7 yoga until you recover from this shock.

Tonight Michigan was finally called for Donald Trump moving his Electoral College (EC) count up to 306 total to Hillary Clinton’s 232. (Although Google will still not report it like other media institutions.) …media is also hiding from you that Trump CRUSHED Hillary in the Electoral College (EC). As of today, most if not all media outlets show that Trump won the election with only 279 EC votes. But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes. Hillary only won 228 EC votes but it looks like she barely won New Hampshire which should put her at 232 EC votes. As a result, Trump won 57% of all EC votes. Gateway Pundit

Hey Change.org! Scrap that petition of yours too. Your basis for this petition on how Hillary should be president because she got popular vote is baseless. Trump got popular vote and electoral vote. Period!

“On December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win,” it reads. “However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine — which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay!” “We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why?” it continues. “Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic.” “(T)he Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result?”
