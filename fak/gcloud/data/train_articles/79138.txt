Following a sell-out show in the West End last year, the world's first Afrobeats musical is back for a limited time and officially open for bookings.

Oliva Tweest consists of clever renditions of popular Afrobeats songs by artists such as Fuse ODG, Wizkid, Davido and many more. The show boasts dynamic vocal arrangements, exciting choreography, hilarious 'African family' scenes and great music performed by a live band.

Oliva Tweest is a celebration of Afrobeats music. The vibrant colours, sounds and imagery are used to engage the audience for a journey through culture. The story, written by young Hackney resident, Nana Duncan, is based on the 2011 UK hit song by D'banj Oliver Twist. A cocky and promiscuous young man, Tobi, tries everything he can to get the attention of a female singer. In his attempts he discovers a world of lies, ambitions and parental pressure.
