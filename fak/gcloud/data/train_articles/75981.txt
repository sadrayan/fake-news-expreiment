Minnesota. Effective August 1, 2014, a large employer means an enterprise whose gross revenue is not less than $500,000. A small employer means an enterprise whose gross revenue is less than $500,000.

In New Jersey, in specific situations where the employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development that the tips actually received exceed the creditable amount, a higher tip credit may be taken.

North Carolina. Tip credit is not permitted unless the employer obtains from each employee, either monthly or each pay period, a signed certification of the amount of tips received.

Ohio. For employees of employers with gross annual sales of less than $305,000, the state minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. For these employees, the state wage is tied to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour which requires an act of Congress and the President's signature to change.

Oklahoma. For employers with fewer than 10 full-time employees at any one location who have gross annual sales of $100,000 or less, the basic minimum rate is $2.00 per hour.

West Virginia. The state minimum wage law applies only to employers with six or more employees and to state agencies.

Wisconsin. $2.13 per hour may be paid to employees who are not yet 20 years old and who have been in employment status with a particular employer for 90 or fewer consecutive calendar days from the date of initial employment.

The following states do not have state minimum wage laws: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Georgia has a state minimum wage law, but it does not apply to tipped employees.

Nevada. The state minimum wage rates may be increased annually based upon changes in the cost of living index, which would in turn increase the minimum cash wage for tipped employees.

US Virgin Islands. After December 31, 2018, and each year thereafter, the Virgin Islands Wage Board may increase the territoryâ€™s minimum wage to a rate equal to not more than 50 percent of the average private, nonsupervisory, nonagricultural hourly wage; after 2020, the Wage Board may increase the minimum cash wage for tipped tourist service and restaurant employees to 45% of the minimum wage.
