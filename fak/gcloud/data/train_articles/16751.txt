I just wanted to inform you that the 1033/LESO program does not provide body armor to law enforcement agencies. We used to but stopped providing body armor in 2008. When DLA Disposition Services receives excess body armor from the military services it is destroyed.

What we do provide are tactical vests but without the body armor inserted in them. Law enforcement can purchase body armor with their own funds or with federal grant money.

I hope that clarifies things. Let me know if you have further questions.

Thank you, Michelle
