Tucker Carlson: More Kids Die 'In Their Bathtubs' Than From Gun Accidents (VIDEO)
Fox News’ Tucker Carlson on Saturday sharply criticized the network’s report on securing firearms away from children, arguing that more kids die “drowning in their bathtubs” than from gun accidents.

Carlson was reacting to a “Fox & Friends Weekend” segment about a bill in New York state that would require firearms be safely stored with a locking device, which would prevent children from using them.

“The point of that package was guns are scary, gun owners are a threat to you and your children,” he said. “The truth is, well, obviously a child’s death is the worst tragedy imaginable. Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns.”

“So, I would like to see a package on, do you have a bathtub at home? Because I need to know that before I send my child over to your house,” he added. “A little perspective might be helpful.”
