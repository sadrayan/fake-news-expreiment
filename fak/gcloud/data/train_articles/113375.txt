President Commemorates Eid al-Adha



I am pleased to send warm greetings to Muslims across the United States as you celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday.

As you join in spirit with those gathered in Mecca to observe the traditions of one of your most sacred feasts, may you share joyful and reverent fellowship with family and friends.

During this special time, our Nation is reminded of the remarkable contributions of American Muslims to our history, culture, and way of life. Our spiritual foundation and common heritage will continue to guide us as we strive to strengthen our country and advance peace and goodness in our world.

Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a joyous observance.

GEORGE W. BUSH
