2 "Needlin', a new form of racial terrorism has struck New York City streets on the tony Upper West Side. At least 39 white women have been struck with used hypodermic needles — perhaps infected with AIDS — by gangs of black girls between the ages of 12 and 14." The Ron Paul Political Report December 1989 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/December1989.pdf p1, p2, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8

3 "Who can doubt that if the situation had been reversed, if white girls had done this to black women, we would have been subjected to months-long nationwide propaganda campaign on the evils of white America?" The Ron Paul Political Report December 1989 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/December1989.pdf p1, p2, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8

4 "I'll be the first to admit that Dan (Quayle) (is) no genius, but if anything makes him look good, it's being compared to the anti-white-huckster-hustler Rev. Jackson." The Ron Paul Political Report December 1989 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/December1989.pdf p1, p2, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8

5 On Massachusetts law to protect gays from discrimination: "Over the protests of the gay community, the law excludes from protection anyone 'whose sexual orientation involves minor children as the sex object.' Now we know the next frontier for 'anti-discrimination' laws in Ted Kennedy's home state." The Ron Paul Political Report December 1989 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/December1989.pdf p1, p2, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8

6 Segment on Congressman Bill Dannemyer labeled "Congressional Courage" attributes quotes to him including, "A whole political movement has been created and sustained on a single notion: homosexual sodomy"; "The average homosexual has 1,000 or more partners in a lifetime, and the average homosexual has only one sexual encounter per partner and never sees the person again after that encounter"; "The pathology of homosexuality will not settle for personal privacy. It must seek approbation"; "It is extremely hard not to be cynical about a government that would sponsor such anti-social proposals" ... We are "not talking about a political philosophy. We are talking about sodomy." The Ron Paul Political Report December 1989 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/December1989.pdf p1, p2, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8

The Ron Paul Political Report December 1989 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/December1989.pdf p1, p2, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8

8 Segment titled "Washington, D.C.: A Black Thing?": "What a relief it is to walk, shop, or eat in the small Ethiopian community in Washington: successful, confident black people whose self-image is not defined in anti-whiteness, and who are therefore invisible in the liberal media." The Ron Paul Political Report December 1989 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/December1989.pdf p1, p2, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8

9 Segment titled "Washington, D.C.: A Black Thing?" describes "anti-white" environment: "Of course, there are racist whites. But outside of a minuscule band of KKK members, there are few whose racism is a defining fact of their lives. Too many D.C. blacks, on the other hand, are charter members of what we might call the BBB." The Ron Paul Political Report December 1989 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/December1989.pdf p1, p2, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8

10 "A well-known Libertarian editor just back from New York told me: "The ACT-UP slogan, on stickers plastered all over Manhattan, is 'Silence = Death.' But shouldn't it be 'Sodomy = Death'?" The Ron Paul Political Report January 1990 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/January1990.pdf p4

11 “Boy, it sure burns me to have a national holiday for that pro-communist philanderer, Martin Luther King. I voted against this outrage time and time again as a Congressmen (sic). What an infamy that Ronald Reagan approved it! We can thank him for our annual Hate Whitey Day.” The Ron Paul Political Report February 1990 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/February1990.pdf p6, p7

12 "It was all over for Michael Dukakis when Jesse Jackson gave his awful prime-time speech at the last Democratic convention, and the cameras focused on masses of teary-eyed, left-wing blacks." The Ron Paul Political Report February 1990 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/February1990.pdf p6, p7

13 "On the holiday honoring (Martin Luther) King, the films shown in the government schools depict whites as evil. From watching them, kids can think that 25 years ago, whites held blacks in cages until MLK came to unlock the cells." The Ron Paul Political Report February 1990 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/February1990.pdf p6, p7

14 "As children, (black males) are trained to hate whites, to believe that white oppression is responsible for all black ills, to 'fight the power,' to steal and loot as much money from the white enemy as possible." The Ron Paul Political Report: "A Special Issue on Racial Terrorism" June 1992 http://web.archive.org/web/20090305060631/http://www.tnr.com/downloads/sponraceterrorism.pdf p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, (back page?)

15 "The case of the [1992 Los Angeles] riots is plain: barbarism. If the barbarians cannot loot sufficiently through legal channels (i.e., the riots being the welfare-state minus the middle-man), they resort to illegal ones, to terrorism." The Ron Paul Political Report: "A Special Issue on Racial Terrorism" June 1992 http://web.archive.org/web/20090305060631/http://www.tnr.com/downloads/sponraceterrorism.pdf p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, (back page?)

16 "Perhaps the most scandalous aspect of the Los Angeles riots was the response by the mayors, the media, and the Washington politicians. They all came together as one to excuse the violence and to tell white America that it is guilty, although the guilt can be assuaged by handing over more cash. It would be reactionary, racist, and fascist, said the media, to have less welfare or tougher law enforcement. America's number one need is an unlimited white checking account for underclass blacks." The Ron Paul Political Report: "A Special Issue on Racial Terrorism" June 1992 http://web.archive.org/web/20090305060631/http://www.tnr.com/downloads/sponraceterrorism.pdf p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, (back page?)

17 "Order was only restored in L.A. when it was time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks three days after rioting began. ... What if the checks had never arrived? No doubt the blacks would have fully privatized the welfare state through continued looting. But they were paid off and the violence subsided." The Ron Paul Political Report: "A Special Issue on Racial Terrorism" June 1992 http://web.archive.org/web/20090305060631/http://www.tnr.com/downloads/sponraceterrorism.pdf p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, (back page?)

18 "Indeed, it is shocking to consider the uniformity of opinion among blacks in this country. Opinion polls consistently show that only about 5% of blacks have sensible political opinions, i.e. support the free market, individual liberty, and the end of welfare and affirmative action." The Ron Paul Political Report: "A Special Issue on Racial Terrorism" June 1992 http://web.archive.org/web/20090305060631/http://www.tnr.com/downloads/sponraceterrorism.pdf p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, (back page?)

19 "Of black males in Washington, D.C., between the ages of 18 and 35, 42% are charged with a crime or are serving a sentence, reports the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives. The Center also reports that 70% of all black men in Washington are arrested before they reach the age of 35, and 85% are arrested at some point in their lives. Given the inefficiencies of what D.C. laughingly calls the 'criminal justice system,' I think we can safely assume that 95% of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal." The Ron Paul Political Report: "A Special Issue on Racial Terrorism" June 1992 http://web.archive.org/web/20090305060631/http://www.tnr.com/downloads/sponraceterrorism.pdf p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, (back page?)

20 "The elite have sent one message to black America for 30 years: you are entitled to something for nothing. That's what blacks got on the streets of L.A. for three days in April. Only they didn't ask their Congressmen to arrange the transfer." The Ron Paul Political Report: "A Special Issue on Racial Terrorism" June 1992 http://web.archive.org/web/20090305060631/http://www.tnr.com/downloads/sponraceterrorism.pdf p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, (back page?)

21 "Just after a basketball game ended on June 14, blacks poured into the streets of Chicago in celebration. How else to celebrate? How else? They broke the windows of stores to loot, even breaking through protective steel shutters with crowbars to steal everything in sight." The Ron Paul Political Report July 1992 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/July1992.pdf p2, p4, p7

22 Blacks in Chicago "flattened two taxicabs by turning them over and jumping up and down on them en masse, then diving headfirst into the crowd. (Is this why Hollywood tells us 'White Men Can't Jump?'" The Ron Paul Political Report July 1992 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/July1992.pdf p2, p4, p7

23 “The liberals want to keep America from taking action against black crime and welfare.” The Ron Paul Political Report July 1992 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/July1992.pdf p2, p4, p7

24 “Jury verdicts, basketball games and even music are enough to set off black rage, it seems.” The Ron Paul Political Report July 1992 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/July1992.pdf p2, p4, p7

25 On study released by ACORN that says "banks take deposits from blacks and then don't grant them loans": "ACORN called for a summit meeting with bankers to 'work out the differences' — meaning the blacks rant until the banks fork over the cash." The Ron Paul Political Report July 1992 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/July1992.pdf p2, p4, p7

26 Carjacking "is the hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos." The Ron Paul Political Report October 1992 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/PoliticalReportOctober1992.pdf p2

27 "Even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, I've urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. For the animals are coming." The Ron Paul Political Report October 1992 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/PoliticalReportOctober1992.pdf p2

28 "Press attention nearly disappeared" when chess player Bobby Fischer began beating his opponent. "It turns out Fischer, who has all the makings of an American hero, is very politically incorrect on Jewish questions, for which he will never be forgiven, even though he is a Jew. Thus we are not supposed to herald him as the world's greatest chess player." The Ron Paul Political Report November 1992 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/November1992.pdf p2, p3

29 On the 1993 World Trade Center bombing: "Whether it was a setup by the Israeli Mossad, as a Jewish friend of mine suspects, or was truly a retaliation by the Islamic fundamentalists, matters little." Survival Report April 1993 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/April1993_0.pdf p3

30 “Those who don’t commit sodomy, who don’t get a blood transfusion, and who don’t swap needles, are virtually assured of not getting AIDS unless they are deliberately infected by a malicious gay, as was Kimberly Bergalis.” Survival Report September 1994 http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/September1994.pdf p2
