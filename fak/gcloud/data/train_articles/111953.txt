Russia’s Almaz-Antey for first time joins ranks of top ten global defense companies
MOSCOW, August 13. /TASS/. The Russian defense equipment producer Almaz-Antey for the first time ranks eighth in the Defense News’ Top 100 rating of the best performing global defense companies, according to results of operations in 2017. Five other Russian companies are also present in the rating.

The top three companies in the rating are US-based Lockheed Martin ($47.9 bln) and Raytheon Company ($23.5 bln) and the UK BAE Systems ($22.3 bln), which continue taking the lead among global defense corporations.

Almaz-Antey dealing with development and production of air defense and missile defense equipment climbed from the eleventh to the eighth position over the last year. Revenues of the company surged 39% year-on-year to $9.1 bln, according to the Defense News.

Operating performance of the holding "confirms the recently developed trend of maintained high demand for defense produce in the company’s range of products," Chief Executive Officer of Almaz-Antey Yan Novikov said, cited by the company’s press service. "The first place among Russian companies in the Defense News rating, captured again by the corporation, clearly evidences the tremendous value of our corporate products for support of defense capability of Russia," the top manager said.

The second important point is that export promotion of Almaz-Antey’s defense products is implemented in conditions of international sanctions effective against the company, Novikov added.

Almaz-Antey joined the Defense News Top 100 rating in 2006 for the first time and started from the 50th position.
