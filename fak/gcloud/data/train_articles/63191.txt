Madison…Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) released the following statement on the Foxconn commitment to Wisconsin.

“In a short time, Foxconn has made a positive impact across Wisconsin with more than 1,000 new jobs, an investment of $200 million, three innovation centers and one of the largest gifts ever of $100 million to the UW-Madison. We don’t blame Foxconn for altering plans in an ever-changing technology business. It’s also not surprising Foxconn would rethink building a manufacturing plant in Wisconsin under the Evers Administration. The company is reacting to the wave of economic uncertainty that the new governor has brought with his administration. Governor Evers has an anti-jobs agenda and pledged to do away with a successful business incentive for manufacturing and agriculture.

“It’s disappointing to see Democrats rooting for the failure of Foxconn and trying to undermine this historic opportunity for our state. Democrats don’t want thousands of family-supporting careers; they want a political talking point.

“From the very beginning, we looked out for the best interest of the taxpayers of the state. Not a dollar would be paid out until jobs in the Foxconn development area were created. The incentive package is based on fulfilling the contract. We will continue to work with Foxconn to help the company meet its repeated goal of creating 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin. Again, the company has reiterated that this goal hasn’t changed.

“Republicans will do all that we can to keep Wisconsin open for business and the Manufacturing and Agriculture Tax Credit in place. This news only strengthens our commitment to Wisconsin: we aren’t going to let our state move backward.”
