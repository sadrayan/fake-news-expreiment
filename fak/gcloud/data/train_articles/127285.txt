Text message warning of alleged slashing and robbery cases targeted at car drivers a hoax
The police have checked and confirmed that no reports have been lodged on cases of slashing and robbery targeted at car drivers. It comes in response to a text message being circulated among members of the public alleging that several cases have occurred.

The text message warned drivers not to open their car window if someone, holding on to a name card, knocked and asked for directions. Once the window is wound down, the attacker would use a cutter placed under the name card to slash the victim's face before robbing them, claimed the text. It also said that six car owners have already made police reports.

A post on the Singapore Police Force's Facebook page on Wednesday afternoon said that while it is "natural to warn friends and loved ones from becoming a victim of crime, the public is advised to first check on the truth of the information before sharing it".

The post added: "We would like to advise the public against spreading unsubstantiated information which may generate unnecessary public alarm, causing fear and panic in the community."
