Baker:

Thanks for visiting this morning.

We are going to proceed with a PolitiFact Texas fact check of your claim to the Texas Tribune that 70 percent of all Texans are overweight or obese.

On the phone, you told me this figure reflected the 2009 survey results posted by the Texas Department of State Health Services based on survey questions to adult respondents about their respective heights and weights, enabling researchers to calculate BMIs. I get this right?

Anything else to consider?

Thanks again.

Again and to confirm, what I was attempting to communicate to the Tribune is that, according to the source you referenced (and more current data referenced below), Texas is approaching a 70% adult overweight and obesity rate, as calculated and estimated using the BMI measure. I just checked the 2014 CDC data for Texas which shows a total estimated adult overweight and obesity rate of 66.2%, again supporting my claim of nearly/approaching 70%. You can access that source here: https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/state-local-programs/profiles/pdfs/texas-state-profile.pdf.

While this method produces an estimate and while there are limitations in using BMI as a measure, it is, nonetheless, a validated method of assessing prevalence of overweight and obesity among a population.

An additional update since our last call, we confirmed with the Tribune reporter, Madeline Conway, that I misspoke. The mistake was totally mine.

Have a good evening.
