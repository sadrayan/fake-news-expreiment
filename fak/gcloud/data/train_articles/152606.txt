reddit Secret Santa
Hi, everyone!

Hope you’re all enjoying the holiday season and picking out some wonderful gifts for your matches!

If you’re an elf, you may have noticed a new banner on our site! A few of us at Reddit have been hard at work on a redesign of the RedditGifts desktop site, and we’re excited to start letting elves try out the beta. If you’re an elf that wants to help us test it, you can opt in using the banner at the top of the RedditGifts site. Also, we started a new community called r/giftsredesign so that you can report bugs, leave feedback, and learn more about the upcoming changes.

If you aren’t an elf, you’ll have to be patient and keep a look out over the next couple of months for more updates. The current plan is to start letting all users try it out early next year. Or if you want to try it out now, sign up to become an elf!

Why are you doing a redesign?

As you all probably know, RedditGifts has been around since 2009, and not much has changed with the look of our site since. As a result, it’s become a bit difficult to fix up and improve our design without breaking things. We understand how important this platform is in spreading good vibes across the internet, and we think it deserves a bit more love. So, we’ve decided to invest some time in making the site a bit easier to navigate (and a bit more up-to-date with the rest of the internet). We’re setting the foundation to make it easier to build more features later without breaking things.

If you’re an elf, please go check out r/giftsredesign to report bugs, leave feedback, and learn more about what we’re doing and why. Hope you all are as excited as we are for a fresh coat of paint!
