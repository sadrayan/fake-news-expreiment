Wyden, Heinrich and Hirono Ask for Straight Answers About Unauthorized CIA Search of Senate Files

Report by White House Alleging Proof of Syria as the Perpetrator of the Nerve Agent Attack in Khan Shaykhun on April4,2017_(April11,2017)_Standard

For the first time, the public can now read the hastily drafted CIA document [pdf below] that led Congress to pass a joint resolution authorizing the use of military force in Iraq, a costly war launched March 20, 2003 that was predicated on "disarming" Iraq of its (non-existent) WMD, overthrowing Saddam Hussein, and "freeing" the Iraqi people.

Key Judgments

~

Iraq's Continuing Programs for

Weapons of" Mass Destruction

-ffli~IEl.. We judge tha~ Iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction (WMD)

programs in defiance of UN resolutions and restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and

biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of UN restrictions; if leftunchecked, it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade. (See INRalternative view at the end of these Key Judgments.)We judge that we are seeing only a portion of Iraq's WMD efforts, owing toBaghdad's vigorous denial and deception efforts. Revelations after the Gulf war starklydemonstrate the extensive efforts undertaken by Iraq to deny information. We lack specificinfonnation on many key aspects of Iraq's WMD programs.

Since inspections ended in 1998, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort,

energized its missile p~ogram, and invested more heavily in biological weapons; in the view

of most agencies, Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.

Iraq's growing ability to sell oil illicitly increases Baghdad's capabilities to finance WMD

programs; annual earnings in cash and goods have more than quadrupled, from $580 million

in 1998 to about $3 billion this year.

Iraq has largely rebuilt missile and biological weapons facilities damaged during Operation

Desert Fox and has expanded its chemical and biological infrastructure under the cover of

civilian production.

Baghdad has exceeded UN range limits of 150 km with its ballistic missiles and is working

with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which allow for a more lethal means to deliver

biological and, less likely, chemical warfare agents.

Although we assess .that Saddam does not yet have nuclear weapons or sufficient material to

make any, he remains intent on acquiring them. Most agencies assess that Baghdad started

reconstituting its nuclear program about the time that UNSCOM inspectors departedDecember 1998.

~ ,How quickly Iraq will obtain its first nuclear weapon depends on

(b)(3)

~vhe~urfl~ient weapons-grade fissile material.

If Baghdad acquires sufficient fissile material from abroad it could make a nuclear weapon

within several months to a year.

Without such material from abroad, Iraq probably would not be able to make a weapon until

2007 to 2009, owing to inexperience in building and operating centrifuge facilities to produce

highly enriched uranium and challenges in procuring the necessary equipment and expertise.

Most agencies believe that Saddam's personal interest in and Iraq's aggressive attempts

to obtain high-strength aluminum tubes for centrifuge rotors-as well as Iraq's attempts

to acquire magnets, high-speed balancing machines, and machine tools-provide

compelling evidence that Saddam is reconstituting a uranium enrichment effort for

Baghdad's nuclear weapons program. (DOE agrees that reconstitution of the nuclear

program is underway but assesses that the tubes probably are not part of the program.)

Iraq's efforts to re-establish and enhance its cadre of weapons personnel as well as

activities at several suspect nuclear sites further indicate that reconstitution is underway.

All agencies agree that about 25,000 centrifuges based on tubes of the size Iraq is trying

to acquire would be capable of producing approximately two weapons' worth of highly

enriched uranium per year.

In a much less likely scenario, Baghdad could make enough fissile material for a nuclear

weapon by 2005 to 2007 if it obtains suitable centrifuge tubes this year and has all the other

materials and technological expertise necessary to build production-scale uranium

enrichment facilities.

~ We assess that Baghdad has begun renewed production of mustard, sarin, GF

(cyclosarin), and V:X; its capability probably is more limited now than it was at the time of the

Gulf war, although VX production and agent storage life probably have been improved.

An array of clandestine reporting reveals that Baghdad has procured covertly the types and

quantities of chemicals and equipment sufficient to allow limited CW agent production

hidden within Iraq's legitimate chemical industry.

Although we have little specific infonnation on Iraq's CW stockpile, Saddam probably has

stocked at least 100 metric tons (MT) and possibly as much as 500 MT of CW agents-much

of it added in the last year.

The Iraqis have experience in manufacturing CW bombs, artillery rockets, and projectiles.

We assess that that they possess CW bulk fills for SRBM warheads, including for a limited

number of covertly stored Scuds, possibly a few with extended ranges.

~ We judge that all key aspects-R&D, production, and weaponization~f Ir~iv;BW program are active and that most elements are larger and more

advanced than they were before the Gulf war.

We judge Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating BW agents and is capable of quickly

producing and weaponizing a variety of such agents, including anthrax, for delivery by

bombs, missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives.

Chances are even that smallpox is part of Iraq's offensive BW program.

Baghdad probably bas developed genetically engineered BW agents.

Baghdad has established a large-scale, redundant, and concealed BW agent production

capability.

Baghdad has mobile facilities for producing bacterial and toxin BW agents; these

facilities can evade detection and are highly survivable. Within several days these units

probably could produce an amount of agent equal to the total that Iraq produced in the

years prior to the Gulf war.

~ Iraq maintains a small missile force and several development

(b)(3)

programs, including for a UAV probably intended to deliver biological warfare agents.

Gaps in Iraqi accounting to UNSCOM suggest that Saddam retains a covert force of up to a

few dozen Scud-variant SRBMs with ranges of 650 to 900 km.

Iraq is deploying its new al-Samoud and Ababil-1 00 SRBMs, which are capable of flying

beyond the UN-authorized 150-km range limit; Iraq has tested an al-Samoud variant beyond

150 km-perhaps as far as 300 km.

Baghdad's UAVs could threaten Iraq's neighbors, US forces in the Persian Gulf, and if

brought close to, or into, the United States, the US Homeland.

An Iraqi UA V procurement network attempted to procure commercially available route

planning software and an associated topographic database that would be able to support

targeting of the United States, according to analysis of special intelligence.

-

The Director, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, US Air Force, does not

agree that Iraq is developing UAVs primarily intended to be delivery platforms for

chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents. The small size of Iraq's new UAV

strongly suggests a primary role of reconnaissance, although CBW delivery is an inherent

capability.

Iraq is developing medium-range ballistic missile capabiJities, largely through foreign

assistance in building specialized facilities, including a test stand for engines more powerfulthan those in its current missile force.

~We have low confidence in our ability to assess when Saddam would use Wl\'ID.

Saddam could decide to use chemical and biological warfare (CBW) preemptively against

US forces, friends, and allies in the region in an attempt to disrupt US war preparations and

undermine the political will of the Coalition.

Saddam might use CBW after an initial advance into Iraqi territory, but early use of WMD

could foreclose diplomatic options for stalling the US advance.

He probably would use CBW when he perceived he irretrievably had lost control of the

military and security situation, but we are unlikely to know when Saddam reaches that point.

We judge that Saddam would be more likely to use chemical weapons than biological

weapons on the battlefield.

Saddam historically has maintained tight control over the use of WMD; however, he

probably has provided contingency instructions to his commanders to use CBW in specific

circumstances.

~aghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks

with conventional or CBW against the United States, fearing that exposure of Iraqi

Involvement would provide Washington a stronger cause for making war.

probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the US Homeland if

Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent orunavoidable, or possibly for revenge. Such attacks-more likely with biological thanchemical agents-probably would be carried out by special forces or intelligenceoperatives.

~Iraq

The Iraqi Intelligence Service (ITS) probably has been directed to conduct clandestine attacks

against US and Allied interests in the Middle East in the event the United States takes action

against Iraq. The ITS probably would be the primary means by which Iraq would attempt to

conduct any CBW attacks on the US Homeland, although we have no specific intelligence

information that Saddam's regime has directed attacks against US territory.

~Saddam, If sufticlently desperate, might decide that only an organization such as

al-Qa'ida-with worldwide reach and extensive terrorist infrastructure, and alreadyengaged in a life-or-death struggle against the United States-could perpetrate the type ofterrorist attack that he would hope to conduct.

In such circumstances, he might decide that the extreme step of assisting the Islamist

terrorists in conducting a CBW attack against the United States would be his last chance to

exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him.

~tate/INR

Alternative View oflraq's Nuclear Program

~The Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research (INR) believes that

Saddam continues to want nuclear weapons and that available evidence indicates that Baghdad is

pursuing at least a limited effort to maintain and acquire nuclear weapon-related capabilities.

The activities we have detected do not, however, add up to a compelling case that Iraq is

currently pursuing what INR would consider to be an integrated and comprehensive approach to

acquire nuclear weapons. Iraq may be doing so, but INR considers the available evidence

inadequate to support such a judgment. Lacking persuasive evidence that Baghdad has launched

a coherent effort to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program, INR is unwilling to speculate that

such an effort began soon after the departure of UN inspectors or to project a timeline for the

completion of activities it does not now see happening. As a result, INR is unable to predict

when Iraq could acquire a nuclear device or weapon.

~In

INR's view Iraq's efforts to acquire aluminum tubes is central to the argument that

Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program, but INR is not persuaded that the tubes

in question are intended for use as centrifuge rotors. INR accepts the judgment of technical

experts at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) who have concluded that the tubes Iraq seeks to

acquire are poorly suited for use in gas centrifuges to be used for uranium enrichment and finds

unpersuasive the arguments advanced by others to make the case that they are intended for that

purpose. INR considers it far more likely that the tubes are intended for another purpose, most

likely the production of artillery rockets. The very large quantities being sought, the way the

tubes were tested by the Iraqis, and the atypical lack of attention to operational security in the

procurement efforts are among the factors, in addition to the DOE assessment, that lead INR to

conclude that the tubes are not intended for use in Iraq's nuclear weapon program.

CU) Confidence Levels for Selected Key Judgments in This Estimate

~

High Confidence:

Iraq is continuing. and in some areas expanding, its chemical, biological, nuclear and missile

programs contrary to UN resolutions.

We are not detecting portions of these weapons programs.

Iraq possesses proscribed chemical and biological weapons and missiles.

Iraq could make a nuclear weapon in months to a year once it acquires sufficient weaponsgrade tissile material.

Moderate Confidence:

Iraq does not yet have a nuclear weapon or sufficient material to make one but is likely to

have a weapon by 2007 to 2009. (See INR alternative view, page 84).

lSttN1

Low Confidence:

When Saddam would use weapons of mass destruction.

Whether Saddam would engage in clandestine attacks against the US Homeland.

Whether in desperation Saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with ai-Qa'ida.

Continuing Programs

for Weapons of Mass

Destruction

~Introduction

(S//NF) Intelligence information over the

past ten years makes clear that Saddam has

never abandoned his pursuit of weapons of

mass destruction (WMD). He has used

chemical weapons against Iran and his own

people, demonstrating that he produces WMD

to be able to use, not just to deter.

Even before the Gulf war, Iraq concealed

its WMD programs and lied about itscapabilities. Despite inspections after thewar. Iraq never fully disclosed itscapabilities and was able to retainchemical precursors, biological media,thousands of munitions suitable forchemical and biological agent. andprobably a small force of Scud-variantmissiles.

\SI~l~Since

the inspections ended in

December 1998, Saddam has maintainedelements of his chemical weapons effort. andis reconstituting and expanding it; energizedhis missile program; increased investment inbiological weapons; and is reconstituting hisnuclear weapons program (See INRalternative view on Iraq's Nuclear Programon page 14). Iraq's concerted effort toenhance its chemical, biological, nuclear, andmissile infrastructure has resulted in a numberof gains that increase the threat posed by

~We judge

that we are only seeing a

portion of Iraq's WMD efforts owing toBaghdad's vigorous denial and deception(D&D) efforts. We lack specific informationon many key aspects of Iraq's WMDprograms. Revelations after the Gulf warstarkly demonstrate the extensive effortsundertaken by Iraq to deny information. Therevelations also underscore the extent towhich limited information fosteredunderestimates by the IntelligenceCommunity of Saddam's capabilities at thattime.

~We estimate Iraq will earn about

~ Baghdad had an extensive

sanctions have inhibited

Baghdad's ability to procure essential itemsfor programs prohibited under UNresolutions. Despite Iraqi oil smuggling,Baghdad still uses the Oil-for-Food Programfor most of its oil exports, and the UN stillcontrols 80 percent of Iraq's revenue. Mostcountries adhere to the ban on conventionalweapons sales to Iraq, and most of Iraq'sillicit military purchases have been limited tospare parts, ammunition, and most recently alimited number of combat support systems.That said, Saddam continues to pursue WMDcomponents through a variety of creative anddeceptive means, attempting to procureillicitly those items unavailable to himlegitimately.

~ Baghdad's goal of becoming the

predominant regional power and its hostilerelations with many of its neighbors,especially Iran and Israel, are key driversbehind Iraq's WMD programs. Baghdad alsois concerned about weapons proliferation inthe region and believes WMD providedeterrent value.

disconcerting are the repeated attempts to

acquire tens of thousands of specialized

aluminum tubes, machine tools, and

magnet technology-dual-use items that

C()Uld be used for gas centrifuge uranium

enrichment.

Our projections about when Iraq will

obtain its first nuclear weapon depend onnumerous factors:

If Baghdad acquires sufficient

weapons-grade fissile material fromabroad, it could make a nuclearweapon within several months to ayear. Although we have seen only afew Iraqi attempts to acquire materialfrom abroad, those efforts do not seemto be part of a systematic effort toacquire foreign fissile materials fromRussia and other sources. Iraqapparently has not instituted such aprogram because of fears of stingoperations and scams and because theamount of material so obtainedprobably would be sufficient for onlyone or two weapons-not the arsenalSaddam intends to build.Nevertheless, the Key Judgments fromour unclassified Annual Report toCongress on the Safety and Security ofRussian Nuclear Facilities andMilitary Forces in February 2002included our concern about "the totalamount of material that could havebeen diverted [from Russia] in the last10 years," noting that "weapons-gradeand weapons-usable nuclear materialshave been stolen from some Russianinstitutes" and that "we assess thatundetected smuggling has occurred,although we do not know the extent ormagnitude of such thefts."

Without fissile material from abroad,

Iraq probably would not be able tomake a weapon unti12007 t~ 2009,owing to inexperience in building andoperating centrifuge facilities toproduce highly enriched uranium andchallenges in procuring the necessarymaterials, equipment, and expertise.

In a much less likely, but faster-paced

scenario, Baghdad could make enoughfissile material for a nuclear weaponby 2005 to 2007 if it obtains suitablecentrifuge tubes this year and had allthe other materials and technologicalexpertise necessary to buildproduction-scale uranium enrichmentfacilities. This period probably is theminimum amount of time to establisha centrifuge facility and would requiredirect and continuing foreignassistance with materials andexpertise.

.._,....~ INR's Alternative View: Iraq's Nuclear Reconstitution

~ Saddam Hussein wants nuclear weapons and will exploit any viable opportunity toacquire the capability to produce a nuclear device or weapon. The long absence of UNinspectors makes it more difficult than it was prior to 1999 to reach confident judgments aboutthe status of Iraq's efforts to acquire this capability, and INR has taken note of intelligenceinformation obtained during the past two years indicating increased Iraqi attempts to acquiredual-use goods with potential nuclear uses. But the detected procurement efforts are limited andrarely involve highly specialized goods. INR believes the indicators we have to be at bestambiguous and sees no compelling evidence-of the sort it would expect to detect-that Iraq hascommenced what INR would consider to be an integrated and comprehensive approach toacquire nuclear weapons. The evidence indicates that Saddam wants to maintain and, asfeasible, expand his nuclear capabilities but does not add up to a compelling case forreconstitution.The information we have on Iraqi nuclear personnel does not appear consistentwith a coherent effort to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program. Many key scientists evidentlyhave been assigned to critical positions in the non-nuclear defense sector, casting doubt on theirability concurrently to perform nuclear-weapon-related research-unless one assumes a moreelaborate denial and deception effort than INR is willing to posit.

(b)(3)

(b )(3)

~-.--...._ Based on INR's analysis of all available intelligence information, it sees no compelling

reason to judge that Iraq has entered the timeframe of "at least five to seven years" assessed in

the October 1999 JAEIC estimate to be required for Baghdad to produce sufficient weaponsgrade fissile material for a weapon. Moreover, INR sees no compelling evidence to shorten that

timeline to three to five years under any condition short of Iraq acquiring black-market fissile

material.

~ :post-Gulf war revelations starkly

demonstrate the extent and effectiveness ofIraq's D&D campaign. In late May 1991,following the first post-war inspection ofIraq's nuclear program, the IAEA inspectorsconcluded that they found no evidence ofactivities with direct relationship to nuclearexplosives development or noncompliancewith Baghdad's Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)obli tions accordin to Embass re ortin .

~History

of the Nuclear Weapons

Program

~/;'NJii~-lraq' s

nuclear weapons program

probably began in the early 1970s. Initially,Iraq concentrated on efforts to recoverplutonium from its French-supplied Osirakreactor. After Israel destroyed this reactor inJune 1981, however, Baghdad de-emphasizedthe plutonium pathway and switched to ahighly enriched uranium route.

~During the mid- to late-1980s, Iraq

researched several different uraniumenrichment techniques, such as EMIS,gaseous diffusion, chemical exchangeprocesses, and gas centrifuge. After setbacksin the gaseous diffusion program, Iraqemphasized EMIS and gas centrifuge methodsand established facilities for these types ofenrichment.\

State/INR and DOE believe that although

If Iraq wanted to pursue EMIS again,

we assess that it could reconstruct many of itscapabilities, perhaps without our detection,especially if the facilities were built insmaller, discrete parts instead of one largefacility. EMIS is an inherently lowtechnology approach to uranium enrichment.Reviews of pre-war intelligence holdingsreveal very few indicators that suggestedEMIS could have been underway in Iraq. IfBaghdad restarted an EMIS effort in 1998when inspections ended, it probably wouldhave had to immediately try to solve researchand development problems that plagued theearlier EMIS work. Iraq needed two to threeyears to complete its pre-war EMIS effort;completing such an effort today could takefour to six years, as Baghdad would still haveto reconstitute facilities and feed materialproduction capabilities.

it- Chemical Warfare (CW)

Program-Rebuilt and Expanding

~We judge that, prior to the Gulf war,Iraq possessed the largest and mostsophisticated CW program in the developingworld. We assess that Iraq has rebuilt keyportions of its CW infrastructure and thatBaghdad already has begun renewedproduction of mustard, sarin, GF (cyclosarin),and VX. Although we have little specificinformation on Iraq's CW stockpile, Saddamprobably has stocked at least 100 metric tons(MT), and possibly as much as 500 MT, ofCW agents-much of it added in the lastyear. 3~/It~

The Iraqis have experience in

manufacturing CW bombs, artillery rockets,and projectiles. We assess that the Iraqispossess CW bulk fills for SRBM warheads,including for potential covertly stored Scudvariants.

Baghdad did not adequately account for

pre-war chemical precursors and largenumbers of munitions. This materialcould be combined with renewedprecursor production and imports tosynthesize CW agents (See box onfollowing page on problems with Iraqiaccounting).

~ Iraq's CW capability probably is

{\Q Problems with Iraqi Accounting

(b)( 1)

~ UNSCOM has accounted for some of

(b)(3)

Iraq's filled munitions but not for thousands

of empty munitions that Iraq could fill quicklywith agent. Iraq also retains the capability toproduce many types of weapons that it couldfill with chemical agents.

Iraq admitted to possessing CW-filled

mortar rounds, artillery shells, rockets, A1Husayn missile warheads, and aerialbombs. In addition, Iraq admitted toresearching a chemical fill for a rocketpropelled grenade, RPG-7, and producingand testing an air-delivered CW clusterbomb.

Iraq provided little verifiable evidence

that it unilaterally destroyed 15,000artillery rockets after the Gulf war.

(b)( 1)

Baghdad denies that it loaded VX into its

650-km-range al-Husayn ballistic missilewarheads, despite strong forensicevidence to the contrary. An independentUS laboratory detected degraded productsfrom VX on metal fragments collectedfrom al-Husayn warheads in 1998.Despite destruction of CW-relatedfacilities by Coalition forces andUNSCOM post-war dismantlementoperations, Saddam also retained someelements of his CW infrastructure,including R&D, production andweaponization. He probably also retainedsome CW-weaponized deliverycapabilities, including ballistic missiles,spray tanks, bombs, artillery and rockets.

~ CW

(b )(3)

An Iraqi Air Force document discovered

by UNSCOM inspectors in July 1998suggests that Baghdad overstated by atleast 6,000 the number of chemicalmunitions it used during the Iran-Iraq war.Iraq has refused to hand over thedocument and has not accounted for thesemunitions. In addition, UNSCOM couldnot verify the disposal of 308 R-400bombs. that Iraq claims it unilaterallydestroyed.

Baghdad in the I 980s approacheda British laboratory to obtain the Ames strainbut the request was denied, according to aUnited Nations inspector quoted in the press.

The spores found in the Daschle and

Leahy letters are highly purified, probablyrequiring a high level of skill and expertise inworking with bacterial spores. Iraqi scientistscould have such expertise, although samplesof Iraqi B. thuringiensis-which Iraq used asan anthrax simulant-were not as pure as theanthrax spores in the letters.

Aerial spraying of a

BW agent is the most efficient method of BW

dispersal. Many manned aircraft currently in

the Iraqi inventory could be fitted with the

spray tanks necessary to deliver biological

weapons. Prior to the Gulf war, Iraq pursued

R&D of UAVs, as well as light aircraft and

helicopters used in agricultural spraying for

~Our understanding

of

Iraq's current BW delivery systems is limited,

based primarily on pre-Gulf War capabilities

and Iraqi claims to the UN. Iraq possesses a

variety of overt, military means to deliver

biological agents. Iraq's pre-Gulf war BW

arsenal consisted of aerial bombs, Al-Husayn

missile warheads, and aircraft-fitted drop

tanks modified for aerial spray delivery. Iraq

probably still has such weapons and also may

have developed cluster bombs, tube artillery

shells, battlefield rockets, and other portable

spray devices for the delivery of BW agents.

In addition, Iraq could revert to more covert

means of delivering biological agents by Iraqi

intelligence operatives, special forces, or

proxies, although we have limited information

suggesting this option.

Explosive-type weapon systems decrease

the dissemination efficiency of the BWagent fill. The heat and blast associatedwith these systems decrease the viabilityof the agent contained in the weapon, aswell as dispersing the agent in a relativelysmall area.

Saddam would use BW against Kuwait

for two reasons: a realization that Kuwaitis a crucial staging base for US and alliedmilitary operations against Iraq, especiallya ground invasion; and a desire forvengeance against the Sabah-regime thathe despises and blames for the years ofongoing UN sanctions and US/UKmilitary attacks.

SMUs are more likely to be used for

surreptitious attacks, including thosepossibly involving BW weapons. Manyreports put the SMU training facility atSalman Pak, southeast of Baghdad, thesame area where there is a known specialoperations training facility and formerBW facility. The only information wehave linking SMUs to CBW use is anIraqi defector's claim in a recentnewspaper interview that terrorists weretrained in CBW use at Camp 999, theSalman Pak facility.

We have no information supporting the

role of the Fedayeen Saddam-a small,lightly armed internal security force-in aBW attack, although this group could beused to conduct a BW attack. Such anattack probably would be unsophisticatedand limited to countries bordering Iraq.

~ Baghdad's planned BW employment

strategy outside Iraq probably emphasizes

countervalue targeting; i.e., attacking enemypopulation centers, which include ports andmany airfields. The regime probably also hascontingencies against purely military targetssuch as naval forces afloat, isolated militarybases and airfields, and unit assembly areas orlogistics depots.

We judge that Baghdad would lack

confidence in its ability to attacksuccessfully well-defended military pointtargets outside Iraq with biologicalweapons, except via its missile forces.The limited numbers of dependabledelivery systems-to include missilesprobably would cause Iraq to emphasizeattacks against population centers andless-well defended civilian facilities. Theregime also would be seeking maximumdestructive and psychological impact,suggesting civilian populations would bethe focus of its BW plans. Iraq also maywant to hit selected military targets ifenough missiles were available, however.

Saddam's regime may resort to

methods of BW attack that result in moreindiscriminate and widespread contaminationthroughout the Gulf region-not just Kuwaitor selected point targets-using an aerialdelivery system in Iraqi airspace withprevailing winds carrying the agent across itsborders.

We believe that Israel almost certainly is a

target for an Iraqi BW attack, with the cityof Tel Aviv topping Saddam's list. Iraq'smost reliable means of delivering BWagainst Israel is its covert Scud-variantmissile force-the most sure means ofpenetrating Israel's defenses and Coalitionattempts to block Iraqi attacks. Iraq's AirForce and covert operators, however,remain alternate BW deliverymechanisms.

~ossible constraints on Saddam's use

ofBW in this manner may be concerns aboutcontaminating Iraq and his desired legacy as agreat pan-Arab leader. Saddam probablythinks that if he contaminates Arab countriesindiscriminately, his popular, historic imagecould be undermined. Saddam, however, alsois vengeful and he may conclude that any"defensive" actions would be fully justifiedinasmuch as US-led "aggression" against Iraq

Iraq. We judge that Saddam

may be hesitant to employ BW against anyenemy targets in the Arab heartlands of Iraq,especially the Sunni areas-preferring CW orconventional means of resistance. Inextremis, we cannot rule out such BW attacks,however. If the regime attempts to use BWinside the Arab-inhabited areas of Iraq, theemphasis will be against enemy militarytargets rather than Iraqi population centers.

Saddam's regime probably realizes it has

little or no means to control the effects ofBW once unleashed among its ownpopulation and, as long as Saddambelieves he or members of his familymight survive to carry-on, he probablywould be reluctant to use BW inside Iraq.
