EMERGENCY OVERVIEW: PHYSICAL FORM: liquid ODOR: pine odor MAJOR HEALTH HAZARDS: respiratory tract irritation, skin irritation, eye irritation PHYSICAL HAZARDS: Flammable liquid and vapor. Vapor may cause flash fire. POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS: INHALATION: SHORT TERM EXPOSURE: irritation, ringing in the ears, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, chest pain, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, headache, symptoms of drunkenness, convulsions, coma LONG TERM EXPOSURE: brain damage SKIN CONTACT: SHORT TERM EXPOSURE: same as effects reported in short term inhalation, irritation (possibly severe), itching LONG TERM EXPOSURE: same as effects reported in short term exposure EYE CONTACT: SHORT TERM EXPOSURE: irritation (possibly severe) LONG TERM EXPOSURE: same as effects reported in short term exposure INGESTION: SHORT TERM EXPOSURE: same as effects reported in other routes of exposure, digestive disorders, difficulty breathing, bluish skin color, lung congestion LONG TERM EXPOSURE: same as effects reported in long term inhalation CARCINOGEN STATUS: OSHA: No NTP: No IARC: No

INHALATION: If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area. Give artificial respiration if not breathing. Get immediate medical attention. SKIN CONTACT: Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical attention, if needed. Thoroughly clean and dry contaminated clothing and shoes before reuse. EYE CONTACT: Flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Then get immediate medical attention. INGESTION: Never make an unconscious person vomit or drink fluids. Give milk. If vomiting occurs, keep head lower than hips to help prevent aspiration. If person is unconscious, turn head to side. Get medical attention immediately. NOTE TO PHYSICIAN: For ingestion, consider gastric lavage.

FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS: Severe fire hazard. The vapor is heavier than air. Vapors or gases may ignite at distant ignition sources and flash back. Vapor/air mixtures are explosive above flash point. EXTINGUISHING MEDIA: regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water, regular foam Large fires: Use regular foam or flood with fine water spray. FIRE FIGHTING: Move container from fire area if it can be done without risk. Cool containers with water spray until well after the fire is out. Stay away from the ends of tanks. For fires in cargo or storage area: Cool containers with water from unmanned hose holder or monitor nozzles until well after fire is out. If this is impossible then take the following precautions: Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. Let the fire burn. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety device or any discoloration of tanks due to fire. For tank, rail car or tank truck: Evacuation radius: 800 meters (1/2 mile). Water may be ineffective. FLASH POINT: 91 F (33 C) FLAMMABILITY CLASS (OSHA): IC

OCCUPATIONAL RELEASE: Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition. Stop leak if possible without personal risk. Reduce vapors with water spray. Small spills: Absorb with sand or other non-combustible material. Collect spilled material in appropriate container for disposal. Large spills: Dike for later disposal. Remove sources of ignition. Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry.

STORAGE: Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards. Subject to storage regulations: U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.106. Grounding and bonding required. Store below 46 C. Store in a tightly closed container. Secure to prevent tipping. Keep separated from incompatible substances.

GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: LOCAL EFFECTS: Irritant: inhalation, skin, eye MEDICAL CONDITIONS AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE: immune system disorders or allergies ADDITIONAL DATA: Alcohol may enhance the toxic effects. May cross react with similar compounds. HEALTH EFFECTS: INHALATION: ACUTE EXPOSURE: GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: Turpentine exposures of 75-175 ppm have caused irritation of the nose and throat; 750-1000 ppm for several hours produced headache, dizziness, nausea, and tachycardia. Heavy overexposure may cause coughing, choking, dyspnea, bronchitis, chest pain, burning sensation in the mouth, throat, esophogus, and stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, painful urination with a violet-like odor of the urine, and rarely bladder and kidney irritation with hematuria, albuminuria, and glycosuria. Central nervous system depression may occur with initial excitement, followed by ataxia, confusion, anorexia, stupor, tinnitus, hallucinations, distorted perceptions, antipyschotic changes, delayed convulsions, coma and death due to respiratory failure. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: Repeated or prolonged exposure to turpentine may cause cerebral atrophy, behavioral changes, anemia and bone marrow damage, and glomerulonephritis. SKIN CONTACT: ACUTE EXPOSURE: GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: Turpentine may cause irritation, erythema, eczema, itching, possibly burns and allergic sensitization. May also be absorbed through the skin and cause effects as detailed in acute inhalation. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: Repeated or prolonged contact to turpentine may cause sensitization dermatitis. If sufficient amounts are absorbed through the skin, systemic effects as detailed in chronic inhalation may occur. EYE CONTACT: ACUTE EXPOSURE: GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: Turpentine may cause irritation at 175 ppm. Direct liquid contact may cause severe blepharospasm, conjunctival hyperemia, slight injury to the corneal epithelium, corneal burns, and temporary erosion of the epithelium. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: Repeated or prolonged contact to turpentine may cause conjunctivitis. INGESTION: ACUTE EXPOSURE: GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: Turpentine may cause effects as detailed in acute inhalation. Aspiration may occur leading to pulmonary edema and pneumonitis with dyspnea, cyanosis, and fever. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: GUM SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE: Repeated or prolonged turpentine ingestion may cause systemic effects as detailed in chronic inhalation.
