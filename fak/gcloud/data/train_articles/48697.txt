The Serious Case for Oprah 2020
Bill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show “The DMZ.”

Eleven years ago, the animated TV show “The Boondocks” envisioned the election of Oprah Winfrey to the presidency in 2020. Now there’s a chance fiction could hit reality on the nose.

Asked on Bloomberg Television’s “The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations” whether she might run, Winfrey teased that the election of Trump stirred her interest: “I [had] thought, �?Oh, gee, I don’t have the experience. I don’t know enough. Now, I’m thinking, �?Oh.’”

Before we all get the vapors, note that her next words were left off of the clip zooming through the Internet: “That won't be happening.” The flat denial is in line with her past responses, like when she told Stephen Colbert in January, “NEVER!”

But past denials can be rendered inoperative, and cracked doors can be flung wide open with enough public pressure. So her tease, deliberate or not, does raise a legitimate question for Democrats: Is Oprah the celebrity kryptonite they need to best Donald Trump at his own game?

Trump’s victory already makes any wild speculation of an outsider presidential bid impossible to dismiss out of hand, especially those from celebrity business figures like Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Disney CEO Bob Iger.

But Oprah is in a class by herself. Cuban and Zuckerberg, like many famously sharp-elbowed corporate executives, are both loved and hated, while Iger lacks a household name. But Winfrey, the rags-to-riches media mogul, is one of the most famous, successful and influential people in the world, and has reached those heights while attracting relatively few harsh critics along the way. Even after she dipped her toe into politics by endorsing Barack Obama in 2008, she retained high favorability among people of all partisan stripes, even though her numbers with Republicans dipped.

She outshines Trump’s private-sector career on several fronts. Trump leveraged his daddy’s inheritance to become a billionaire, despite a sloppy management style and several high-profile business disasters along the way. Winfrey, meanwhile, survived poverty, childhood sexual abuse and workplace sexual harassment to become the world’s first black female billionaire.

The Oprah Winfrey Foundation runs circles around the Trump Foundation, and has given her some actual experience in education and housing policy. Winfrey has built 60 schools in 13 countries, including her signature educational endeavor, The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, a boarding school for impoverished South Africans. (The first group of her students graduated from American colleges last year.) After Hurricane Katrina, she invested $10 million of her own money and partnered with Habitat for Humanity to build a planned community in Houston, “Angel Lane,” housing 65 families displaced by the storm. And she has donated to more than 80 charitable organizations in her adopted hometown of Chicago, whereas evidence of Trump’s charitable donations is infamously thin.

Even if you deride Winfrey’s philanthropy as self-promotional, it still compares favorably Trump’s, which managed to be self-promotional and uncharitable. It was funded largely with other people’s money and once used to buy a portrait of himself, for himself. Trump may tweet about Chicago, but he has never done anything to improve the lives of its inhabitants.

Oprah’s media achievements even trump Trump’s. She has earned a Tony Award, a Peabody, a slew of Daytime Emmys, two Academy Award nominations, a Presidential Medal of Freedom and an actual Oscar for her humanitarian work. Trump, meanwhile, has a history of complaining that the Emmy Awards are rigged, seeing as The Apprentice has never won one.

Winfrey has one other thing that the president still doesn’t: a signature piece of legislation. The “Oprah Bill,” otherwise known as the National Child Protection Act, created a national database of convicted child abusers. It was signed into law by Bill Clinton in 1993 after two years of lobbying by Winfrey.

Most importantly, Winfrey’s career is built upon an enormous, and diverse, fan base which has followed her exploration of social issues and the challenges of everyday life for decades. Few people know better than Winfrey how to connect with everyday Americans, including the white working-class voters who have been slipping away from Democrats. (Her audience may be predominantly female, but that’s no problem: Trump’s support among white women without college degrees gave him the edge over Hillary Clinton with white women overall, which cost Clinton the presidency.)

If Trump’s election has taught us anything, it’s that voters do treat celebrity and wealth as proof of accomplishment and credibility. If Donald Trump can be elected president, so can Oprah Winfrey.

But it doesn’t sufficiently answer the question: Is 2020—regardless of Huey Freeman’s cartoon dreams in “The Boondocks”—the right moment for a Winfrey campaign?

Presidential pendulums tend to swing. When voters tire of the current occupant, they tend to seek the opposite. The piously dour Jimmy Carter was followed by the relentlessly sunny Ronald Reagan. The consummate patrician insider George H. W. Bush was booted out by man nicknamed “Bubba” and “Elvis.” After suffering “Clinton fatigue,” many working-class white voters turned to another Bush, one who promised to restore dignity to the Oval Office. After the younger Bush become synonymous with dim-witted bluster, the stage was set for the cool-yet-cerebral “No Drama” Obama.

And following eight years of Obama, bluster came back. Big league.

The stage of the 2020 presidential campaign will be set against the backdrop of Trump’s four years in office. For many voters, “Trump fatigue” began on Day One, and they are already craving a 180-degree turn.

And therein lay the problem for Winfrey. She would be a superior version of the celebrity CEO candidate—but she would still be another celebrity CEO. And while that’s an appealing profile when voters tire of professional politicians, it may not have that same gleam after four years of Trump. If 2016 was destined to be the year of a populist outsider, perhaps 2020 will be the year of the experienced technocrat.

Democratic politicians—who have a strong interest in re-establishing a society in which it is safe to be labeled a politician—will be eager to argue that Trump proved you can’t run the government like a business, that you can’t negotiate legislation or international agreements like you negotiate a real-estate deal, and you can’t create jobs with your Twitter account. If the next 44 months produce a steady stream of chaos and incompetence from the White House, those arguments will likely resonate. The voters of 2020 may resemble the voters of 1920, who embraced Warren Harding’s “Back to Normalcy” credo. That would not create a political climate in which an Oprah would easily find her footing.

Democrats are understandably eager to recruit a charismatic figure—nearly every presidential race since the dawn of television has been won by the candidate with the strongest personality. And they have learned the hard way that the depth of one’s experience in government does not determine who sits in the Oval Office. In fact, the candidate with the shorter résumé has won the last three races without an incumbent president on the ballot.

But Democrats should be wary of trying to replicate the Trump fluke and thinking that the right celebrity is a shortcut to solving all that ails the party. In 2020, Democrats will need a candidate that symbolizes their belief in active, effective government. And that means someone who has actually been in government.

Now, if the next Democratic president puts Oprah in the cabinet, we can talk 2028.
