Sen. Baldwin Prioritized Stopping ‘Offensive’ Mascots Over Keeping Communities and Schools Safe from Sex Offenders

Oshkosh, Wis. – The Republican Party of Wisconsin’s endorsed candidate for U.S. Senate, Leah Vukmir, sarcastically “thanked” liberal Sen. Tammy Baldwin for her absurdly radical record Friday ahead of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin convention.

“Sen. Baldwin’s embarrassing record, in which she has supported some of the most ludicrous policy initiatives I’ve frankly ever come across, indicates that at her core, she just doesn’t get it,” Leah said. “Should we really prioritize protecting Wisconsinites from certain school mascots more than protecting them from sex offenders in their communities? I will not sit quietly while Baldwin attempts to hide her seriously misguided positions.”

Leah exposed Baldwin’s record by sarcastically “thanking” her for her record, including:

❌ Boldly opposing displaying the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance or singing the National Anthem in our classrooms.

It’s clear Sen. Baldwin lacks pride in her country.

❌ Working to put sex offenders into our communities instead of mental institutions.

You’ve gotta be kidding me. Our kids deserve better.

❌ Opposing harsher punishments for criminals who commit violent crimes near schools.

Unbelievable.

❌ Watching out to make sure we don’t have “offensive” mascots for schools.

Oh, the horror!

❌ Highlighting the dire need to make our state Constitution gender-neutral.

A priority, really?
