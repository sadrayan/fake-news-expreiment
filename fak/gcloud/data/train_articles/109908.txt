A man who saw his wife without make-up for the first time after she went swimming in the sea divorced her immediately, according to local media in the United Arab Emirates.

The newspaper Aletihad reported that the couple went swimming at the Al Mamzar beach in Sharjah – and he saw her ‘features change’ after her make-up washed off.

He realised that not only did she wear a lot of make-up, she’d had cosmetic surgery and wore false eyelashes and coloured contacts, according to Gulf News.

The 30-year-old Arab man divorced his 24-year-old bride because he felt ‘tricked by her artificial beauty’.

Dr Abdul Aziz Asaf, a psychologist who talked to the bride after the split said ‘The groom immediately divorced his bride and refused any attempt to reunite them again.’

Dr Aziz did not name his client due to confidentiality.
