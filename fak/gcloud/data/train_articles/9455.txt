Minnick votes against limiting health choices for women
Washington, D.C. – Idaho Congressman Walt Minnick released the following statement regarding his vote against an amendment to the Affordable Health Care for America Act:



“One of my daughters was born an orphan in China, and she had a chance at life because her parents defied a government order. I also have two sons, both of whom had a difficult time with their health as newborns. Helping all of them grow to be healthy and strong gave me a deep faith in the value of life.



“One of the many things I learned from my children is that nothing can come between the bonds forged by a family, by the difficult decisions we all make day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.



“The issue of an unplanned pregnancy is just such a decision. It is painful, difficult and complicated for women and for their families. Doctors and pastors take great care to think deeply about advice offered to people who are dealing with that situation.



“Like most of them and like most of my constituents, I believe abortion should be safe, legal and rare, and that a decision on the issue can be made only by a woman, her family, her doctor and her pastor.



“I do not want a federal judge overruling that decision. I do not want a government bureaucrat denying a medical procedure ordered by a woman’s physician. I do not want this Congress to give an anonymous insurance executive an excuse to gut coverage for women’s health.



“One of the reasons I oppose the House health care bill is that I do not believe the federal government should be making health care decisions for Americans. It is also why I oppose this amendment.”
