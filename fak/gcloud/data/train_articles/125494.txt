FACT CHECK: NYPD Looking to Press Charges Against Bill Clinton for Underage Sex Ring
On 2 November 2016, the Christian Times Newspaper web site published an item reporting that sources in the New York Police Department (NYPD) were “looking to press charges” relating to sexual relations with underage girls against former President Bill Clinton:

Sources within the New York Police Department are confirming that the NYPD is currently investigating allegations that Bill Clinton performed sexual acts on underage girls ranging from 5 to 14 years old in recent years. These reports have been confirmed my multiple others, and it appears that the NYPD is closing in on the former President. According to senior sources within the department, investigators are making plans to bring charges against Clinton and his accomplices after finding new information in Anthony Wiener’s emails this weekend. Now, sources within the NYPD are saying their investigation has evolved to focus on Clinton exclusively after several of the emails found on disgraced former Congressman Anthony Wiener’s laptop implicate Clinton in an international child sex ring.

The report was entirely fabricated, however, as the Christian Times Newspaper (not to be confused with the legitimate Christian Times newspaper) is a fake news site whose (since-removed) disclaimer identified it a source of “satire” and/or “speculation”:
