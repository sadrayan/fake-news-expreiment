Disney Developing Witch Pic With Tina Fey — But It’s Not ‘Hocus Pocus 2’
EXCLUSIVE: Hocus shmocus: Disney is in early development with Tina Fey on a supernatural-themed feature, but a knowledgeable source tells me it’s not the Hocus Pocus sequel that’s being wrongly buzzed about all over town. The film, currently known as Untitled Witch Project, will be produced by Fey and Cinderella producer Allison Shearmur in what’s described as falling in the vein of Ghostbusters, with 30 Rock Golden Globe winner Fey also attached to star. Sorry to break it to fans of the 1993 Bette Midler horror-comedy: No Hocus Pocus 2 project is currently in the works at the Mouse House – yet. Stay tuned to see if the nostalgic wave of online buzz conjures a return for the Sanderson Sisters.

Fey is in production on her Universal comedy The Nest, opposite her former Saturday Night Live co-star Amy Poehler. Shearmur is producing Disney’s 2015 live-action Cinderella pic directed by Kenneth Branagh.
