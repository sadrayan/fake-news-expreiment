We never saw a specific proposal or bill on how this would be accomplished. For the 2016-2017 school year, districts spent $47,336,144,703 on operating expenditures. 5% of this would be 2,366,807,235. Dividing this by 352,809 teachers would result in a $6708 average pay raise per teacher.* Theoretically, it would be possible to increase teacher salaries by requiring districts to reallocate existing funding, but we have never seen a mechanism that would accomplish this. Our preferred approach is for increased state funding with a requirement for a commensurate increase in teacher salaries. This has been accomplished several times in the past by pass-through teacher salary increases included in school funding bills. The only teacher salary proposal that actually passed the Senate during the special session was a one-time bonus of $600 for teachers with six to eleven years of experience and $1,000 for teachers with more than eleven years of experience.
