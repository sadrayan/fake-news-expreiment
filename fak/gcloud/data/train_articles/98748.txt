Within hours of the incident, police arrested the accused and said he was tasked by terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen to carry out the attack.

Inspector general of police, Jammu, M.K. Sinha said Yasir Javed Bhat, a resident of Khanpora-Dassein village in Kulgam, was tasked by HM district commander, Kulgam, Farooq Ahmad Bhat alias “Umar” to carry out the attack.

Bhat, who reached Jammu along with the grenade on Thursday morning after he left Kulgam the previous night, was fleeing after the attack when he was arrested by policemen at Nagrota in the outskirts of the city, he had said.

The third grenade attack by terrorists on Jammu bus stand since May last comes just three weeks after the Pulwama terror strike on February 14 that killed 40 CRPF jawans, bringing India and Pakistan on brink of war.
