Subject: Inquiry for a PolitiFact Texas fact check

Dr. Potter:

Hello again. I write because we’re trying to check this claim by Evan Smith as quoted in a recent article in The New Yorker: "The last majority-Anglo high school class in Texas graduated in 2014."

Does this hold up? If so, according to what best data?

We imagine there may still be some high schools with majority-Anglo graduating classes. Is there a smart way to quantify which ones?

Other aspects to consider?

Thank you for any help.

I think there are a few different ways to potentially examine this statement. It appears that “majority-Anglo” refers to there being more Anglos than any other race/ethnic group alone (when you combine all minority groups into one group and compare to Anglos, Anglos have been a numeric minority in Texas for some time). In looking at this I assume that term Anglo is the equivalent of non-Hispanic White.

One way to approach this is to look at the number of Anglos and minority groups aged 18 (assuming that’s a proxy for the graduating class) in each year.

The U.S. Census Bureau does not break out single years of age by race/ethnicity in their population estimates. However, looking at their estimates for 14-19 year old persons in Texas on July 1, 2014, about 35% were non-Hispanic white, 13% non-Hispanic African American, and 47% Hispanic. ( https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2016/PEPASR6H/0400000US48?slice=hisp~nhisp!year~est72014 ).

Population estimates from the Texas Demographic Center are produced in single years of age. In 2014, we estimated that 34% of 18 year old persons in the State were non-Hispanic white, 12% non-Hispanic African American, and 47% Hispanic. ( http://demographics.texas.gov/Data/TPEPP/Estimates/ ).

Another approach, given that graduation rates are not equal across race/ethnic groups, would be to look at the numbers graduating each year by race and ethnicity from TEA data ( http://tea.texas.gov/acctres/dropcomp_index.html – table numbers vary each year but usually table 25 or 26). There are reports on this page (Secondary School Completion and Dropouts in Texas Public Schools) for different years . A quick look at the 2012-13 report suggests that there were more Hispanics that graduated compared to Anglos.

I think you can get TEA data on graduation numbers by year and race and ethnicity for school districts. I would expect there are districts where the majority of students graduating are still Anglo. However the statement seems to be focused on Texas as a whole.

Overall, looking at population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Texas Demographic Center and data from TEA on race/ethnicity of graduates, it appears there was not a majority-Anglo high school class in 2014.

It might take a little digging to find when was the last year was that Texas had a majority-Anglo high school graduating class, but it does not appear to have been in 2014.

If you look at historical enrollment statistics from TEA (http://tea.texas.gov/acctres/enroll_index.html) it appears the last year there were more than 50% white students enrolled in 12th grade was 2000-01 and in 2001-02 it was 50%.

Thanks again.

One more question: Smith also said that in 2004, the Anglo population in Texas became a minority. That right? If not, what would be right? Best citation?

Yes, that is correct, in 2004 the Anglo population in Texas was an estimated 49.5% of the population and was 50.2% in 2003.

Data from the Census Bureau relevant to this can be found in this table: Intercensal Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin for States and the United States: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2010 available at https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-2000-2010-state.html.
