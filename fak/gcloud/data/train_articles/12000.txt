Boehner Statement on White House “Stimulus” Announcement

Washington, Jun 8, 2009 - House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) today issued the following statement on President Obama and Vice President Biden’s announcement on increased government “stimulus” spending:

“Today’s announcement is an acknowledgement that the Democrats’ trillion-dollar stimulus is not working, and the American people know it. When they passed this spending plan, Democrats said it would immediately create jobs, yet nearly four months later unemployment has continued to climb and none of their rosy predictions have come true. These policies are harming middle-class families when they can least afford it, and adding to the massive debt we’re passing on to future generations.

“The American people know that we can’t borrow and spend our way back to prosperity, and that’s why House Republicans offered a better solution. Our plan to let the American people keep more of what they earn would have created twice the jobs at half the cost of the Democrats’ bloated government spending scheme. But instead of shifting course, Democrats are doubling down on their plan to spend taxpayer dollars as fast as possible, even as their own Vice President admits that the American people are being scammed. Wasting more money that the government doesn’t have – money that is borrowed from China and the Middle East, and will have to be paid back by our kids and grandkids – is the wrong choice. I believe our economy will improve, and Republicans support policies to make that happen faster. But it will not recover because of more wasteful government spending.”
