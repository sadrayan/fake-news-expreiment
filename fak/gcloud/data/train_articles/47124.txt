Fact Check: Democrats’ Critiques of the Republican Health Bill
Ms. Pelosi’s description of “people kicked off of heath insurance” could reasonably apply to those who would lose coverage from the bill’s changes to Medicaid, or those whose employers would no longer have to offer group plans.

But the 24 million figure also includes people who would choose not to have insurance, such as those who would forgo coverage absent the individual mandate to buy it, as well as those who would elect to not pay high premiums.

Ms. Pelosi also asserted the bill would be a job killer.

“Not only would Republicans’ Trumpcare bill destroy the health coverage of 24 million Americans, it will destroy nearly two million jobs across America.”

This needs context. After Ms. Pelosi issued a news release citing a report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, many congressional Democrats adopted this talking point. But the report’s findings come with a few caveats.

The center based its report on a more comprehensive study by George Washington University and the Commonwealth Fund conducted before details of the Republican bill were known. That study estimated that repealing federal funding for the Medicaid expansion and subsidies for health insurance would lead to almost three million fewer jobs by 2021 compared with “the baseline model.”

After the Republicans released their bill, the center adjusted the study’s findings to take into account the bill’s changes to tax credits and Medicaid, and concluded that it would lead to 1.8 million fewer jobs by 2022. Leighton Ku, a health policy professor at George Washington University and the lead author of the initial study, said he could not confirm the center’s analysis but agreed that the bill was likely to lead to substantially fewer jobs than under current law.
