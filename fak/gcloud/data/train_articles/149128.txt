Slideshow - Women's entrepreneurship development: Promotes gender equality, reduces poverty and empowers women

The ILO, in partnership with Irish Aid, promotes women's entrepreneurship development and enhances employment opportunities for women, including women with disabilities or living with HIV/AIDS, through business knowledge and training; promoting and facilitating access to micro-finance institutions; facilitating access to markets through trade fairs and exhibitions; and, voice and representation through the strengthening of women entrepreneurs' networks and groups. In 2007 alone, over 3,000 women in Eastern Africa benefited from the ILO-Irish Aid Partnership Programme. Their personal stories are highlighted in the narratives accompanying the following photographs.
