Bernard Schoenburg: Blagojevich’s real’ stories sure do make you wonder
Few people at the Statehouse trust Gov. ROD BLAGOJEVICH, which is a problem as the General Assembly works toward what could be a multibillion-dollar public construction program. If the person in charge of releasing money can’t be believed, how can you justify giving that person the power to spend massive amounts of cash?

Few people at the Statehouse trust Gov. ROD BLAGOJEVICH, which is a problem as the General Assembly works toward what could be a multibillion-dollar public construction program. If the person in charge of releasing money can’t be believed, how can you justify giving that person the power to spend massive amounts of cash?

I’ve watched governors for more than three decades, and never have I seen one whose utterances are treated with as much suspicion as those of Blagojevich.

Sad to say, I share that suspicion because when I’ve checked, I’ve often found his comments to be inaccurate.

That is why, back on Governor’s Day at the Illinois State Fair, I asked the governor if a story he told during a speech that day was real.

At the Democratic County Chairmen’s Association breakfast at the Crowne Plaza that morning, Blagojevich had told of handing out candy at his Chicago home last Halloween. He said he posed for pictures with people including “a young Hispanic family, a pretty young mother with three kids — a boy, 8, a daughter who was 6 and then her youngest child, a 3-year-old boy.”

The boy was in a Winnie-the-Pooh outfit, Blagojevich said, but his hood was off, revealing a long scar on his head.

The governor said he asked about the scar, and the mother told him her son had had a brain tumor removed and was undergoing chemotherapy. Blagojevich said he asked about her insurance.

“And she said, ‘We have All Kids. … and if all goes well, he’s gonna do fine. That’s what the doctors tell us.’

“That is an example of how government can help people,” said Blagojevich, who pushed the insurance program through the General Assembly.

“And that is why I’m a Democrat,” he added later in the speech.

“Ours is the party that sees that child and wants to help that child.”

When he arrived at the state fair director’s lawn for a rally later that day, Blagojevich was questioned by a Rochester High student about why, after Blagojevich appeared at a rally at the school more than two years ago, state money promised years ago for school construction in Rochester has never materialized.

“I want to work with you,” the governor said. “We got to call those legislators and free up that money. I’m dying to do it.”

I then asked if the story the governor told about the Hispanic family was real.

“I didn’t get her name,” he said, but he added, “They’re all real.”

I pointed out that in the past, the governor has told audiences about a girl who mistook him for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, and his spokeswoman said it was a joke.

“Well, no,” he said. “I tell it like a joke, but of course, that’s real. Of course that happened. They’re all real.”

“This is a cynical place,” he added, apparently referring to Springfield.

Blagojevich has told the “Mayor Daley” story at various times as if it happened in different settings, so I asked if it had happened more than once.

“As a matter of fact, it just happened again recently on the west side” of Chicago, Blagojevich said.

The governor said that took place on Easter, when he went with his family to a South Side church — later identified by his staff as the Apostolic Church of God — and then to a West Side restaurant.

“We were leaving there and there was an African-American guy (on) a corner … I looked at him, I had my window down, it was a nice Sunday, Easter Sunday … and he looked at me and he said, ‘Wow, it’s Mayor Daley.’ So it’s happened more than once.

“What’s the matter — does everybody lie to you guys down here, so you just assume everything’s a lie?”

For the record, I wrote a column published Feb. 9, 2006, that noted that Blagojevich had told an audience in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 26 that on his way to the airport in Chicago for that trip, “a young girl, 12 years old, African-American” saw him from another car and gasped, “Oh, my God, it’s Mayor Daley.”

My column also noted that the previous August, again at the state fair, Blagojevich said that as he was leaving a Chicago memorial service for JOHN JOHNSON of Johnson Publishing, when “a young, African-American girl, maybe 12 or 13 years old,” recognized former President BILL CLINTON and U.S. Sen. BARACK OBAMA, but upon seeing Blagojevich, said, “Wow, Mayor Daley!”

I asked Blagojevich’s office about the stories for that column.

The e-mailed response from then-spokeswoman REBECCA RAUSCH was: “Of course it was a joke.”

And in July 2006, The Peoria Journal-Star reported that at a recent speech in that city, Blagojevich recounted how “just a few days earlier in Chicago, the car he was in stopped at a light and a 14-year-old pointed at him and said, ‘Oh, my God, it’s Mayor Daley.”

My 2006 column used the apparent jokes as a way to highlight misstatements the governor had made on more serious issues.

I also pointed out that lawmakers, in an unprecedented move, had been asking the Blagojevich administration for written “memorandums of understanding” to back up his budget-related promises.

After the Democratic rally at the state fair a few weeks back, I asked Blagojevich if the Mayor Daley “joke” has been true every time he told it. He seemed to hear the question, but gave no answer as he made his exit.

Good luck to McCrady

I find myself in agreement with Sangamon County Board Chairman ANDY VAN METER, who said that the departure of County administrator RYAN McCRADY to a job as Decatur city manager represents “a significant loss” for the county.

Like Van Meter, I wish McCrady well. At 38, the Divernon native is taking on a new challenge because he doesn’t want to regret not doing so. He and his wife and three children are moving to Decatur for the job.

McCrady was in banking when a lifelong friend, County Board member ANDY GOLEMAN, R-District 4, asked if he would be interested in working in the sheriff’s office to free up a deputy for duty on the street. McCrady became comptroller there a dozen years ago and became county administrator five years ago.

The county is like state government in a way, McCrady said. Departments report to the county board, but the countywide elected officials run their own offices.

“The skills of diplomacy are beneficial,” McCrady said.

McCrady seems to have exhibited the right kind of diplomacy, and he’s always been good about answering questions for the public through people like me as well.

He says he’ll miss Sangamon County and its people dearly. Decatur, you’re getting a good one.

McCrady will make $135,000 in his city manager job, up from $97,100.

New job for Chambers

AARON CHAMBERS, who was Statehouse correspondent for The Rockford Register Star for five years, has joined the communications management firm of Serafin & Associates Inc. as a senior account executive.

Chambers, 34, has nearly a decade of Statehouse experience, running bureaus there for the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin and Illinois Issues magazine before taking the Rockford job. The Rockford newspaper — which, like The State Journal-Register, is owned by Gatehouse Media — recently decided to close its Statehouse bureau.

THOM SERAFIN, CEO and president of Chicago-based Serafin & Associates, is a former Statehouse reporter himself and said he knows Chambers will bring “energy and success” to his new job.

The Statehouse newsroom has lost a good investigator, writer and columnist. Chambers has been a strong — and sometimes loud, in crowded news conferences — voice in seeking the real story.

Chambers and his wife, JENNINE, will remain in Springfield.

He said he’ll be working in public relations, public affairs, and “new media,” including “helping clients understand the influence and potential of the Internet.” Among clients will be the Illinois Council on Developmental Disabilities and AmeriCash, an installment loan company he said faces challenges, including “distinguishing itself from the payday loan community.”

Best of luck.
