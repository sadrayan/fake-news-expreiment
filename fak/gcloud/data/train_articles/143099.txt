The official Website of the US Contingent (BSA) to the 24th World Scout Jamboree in 2019
The World Scout Jamboree is Friendship.

If you like to make friends, meet new people, and be social, this is the place for you!

Imagine making a friend from India on the way to get water, learning to tie your neckerchief the Swiss way while in line for your next activity, and stumbling into a Welsh party before going to bed.

With 50,000 Scouts from 160 countries living side-by-side, you are sure to meet amazing guys and girls faster than you can find them on Facebook.

Donâ€™t miss what will surely be the largest party in the world!
