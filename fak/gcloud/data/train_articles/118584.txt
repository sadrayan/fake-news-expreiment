- In June 2014, a judge ordered Jay and Kendall Nygard to take down a wind turbine because it was violating neighbor nuisance laws. This year in February the couple was ordered to take down the wind turbine or they both would be facing jail time.



"I'm ready to go to jail for everybody in Minnesota's rights." Jay said.

On Friday a Hennepin county judge sentenced Jay to 6 months in jail.

"I am in the short term jail right now in Hennepin County." Jay said.



The Nygard's say their turbine is down for good, but by court order they're also supposed to remove the foundation.



"I'm trying to do the right thing for the country, for my community and the future. And what happens? I end up in jail." Jay said.

Until the foundation is removed, Jay has to stay in jail. His wife hopes to have it removed by early next week.
