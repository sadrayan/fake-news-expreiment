Alex Jones Conspiracy Theory On Immigration Makes Its Way To CNN
CNN repeated a fringe right-wing conspiracy theory that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is paying to escort child migrants "across the border" into the U.S.

On June 24 CNN's John Berman spoke with Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) about the recent influx of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to escape violence in Central America. Berman referenced a government contractor procurement advertisement DHS had posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website on January 29, describing it as a solicitation for "escort services to help children across the border."

The notion that DHS solicited companies to help undocumented children cross into the U.S. actually started on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' website InfoWars.com, which cited the January 29 ad to claim that DHS was set to pay for "illegal minors up to the age of 17 to be escorted into the United States."

The Drudge Report later highlighted the InfoWars story with the headline "Claim: 'Homeland' Paying For Illegals to be Escorted Into USA," while the Washington Examiner asked, "Does this Jan. 29, 2014, contract bid request 'prove' Obama planned migrant child flood at the border?"

But the January 29 procurement contract did not seek help transporting child migrants into the U.S.
