REPUBLICAN GETS $2,000 `GIFT' FROM PRINCE
Prince has a political streak. Documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission show the rock star wrote a $2,000 check to the re-election campaign of his home state senator, Republican Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota. Boschwitz camapign director Tom Mason says he's not certain how the donation came about. "It's safe to assume that Rudy is not familiar with Prince's work," Mason said.
