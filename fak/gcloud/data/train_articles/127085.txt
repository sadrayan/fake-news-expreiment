Bedeutung der Sexualanamnese in der Sterilit√§tsdiagnostik
Abstract

The interview to take patients' history for sterility treatment involves specific elements. Great importance is accorded the couple's sexual history. We report on two cases for which precise inquiry uncovered further relevant aspects concerning the couple's sterility in addition to somatic factors. In one couple, besides oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, psychogenic erectile dysfunction was also present so that sexual intercourse had never even been performed. In the second case, a couple requested sterility treatment due to secondary idiopathic sterility. However, because of an existing conflict in the partnership, treatment was denied for the time being.
