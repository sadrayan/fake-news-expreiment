See whether your local Kohl's is shutting down
AP Kohl's is closing 18 stores and laying off more than 1,500 employees.

The department store chain announced the closings last month after reporting a 20% drop in fourth quarter profit.

The company just released a list of which stores would close, and said all of them except one in Lithonia, Georgia, will shut down by June 19.

Kohl's said it would try to rehire laid off employees at nearby stores.

Workers who aren't rehired will get a "competitive severance package," according to Kohl's.

The stores represent less than 1% of total sales, and closing them is expected to cut costs by roughly $45 million, the company said.
