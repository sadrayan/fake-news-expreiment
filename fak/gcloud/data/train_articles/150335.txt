See the force of gravity acting powerfully on the South West States, and competing with the education less developed states at the base of the table.



Thanks to the APC governors. Shame on the "constituted authority" and "opon oron"



Imagine Lagos State in 6th.



Ondo State and Ekiti states are the leading states in the south west apart from Lagos on this list. Arguably, this may be due to the PDP touches they had/have in the recent past and present respectively. 68 Likes 5 Shares
