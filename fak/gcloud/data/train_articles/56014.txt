I can’t wait to see what Kamala, Elizabeth, or Kirsten have to say about poor old Gropin’ Joe Biden should he have the temerity to run against the #MeToo’s in 2020. If you thought the Kavanaugh hearing was ugly, just try getting between a Democrat woman and the chance to be the first female President of the United States. Sorry Hillary. I didn’t mean to leave you out of the pack. Third times the charm, right?
