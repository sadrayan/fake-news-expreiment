Griffith Votes to Repeal Death Tax
Congressman Morgan Griffith (R-VA) today issued the following statement after voting in favor of the Death Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 1105):

“Enacted nearly 100 years ago, the federal estate tax, commonly known as the ‘death tax’ is imposed ‘on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States’ (26 U.S.C. § 2001a). This is a significant burden on Americans seeking to pass down their small business or family farm to the next generation.”

“I have long opposed the death tax, and supported legislation while serving in the General Assembly that repeals the Virginia estate tax for the estates of those who pass on or after July 1, 2007. This was the right thing to do. I am proud today to have voted to repeal the federal death tax policy, and will continue fighting to grow our economy and protect American families, farms, and small businesses.”
