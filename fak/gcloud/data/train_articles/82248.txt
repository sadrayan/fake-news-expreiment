Thank you, Wisconsin.
Over the course of our campaign to bring the Wisconsin Way to Washington, I had the great fortune to travel to every corner of Wisconsin, meeting and learning from its incredible families, workers, and leaders. It became apparent very quickly that the Wisconsin Way is something worth protecting at every turn. As we move forward, we must continue looking for ways to improve our great state, ways to safeguard the values we all hold true, and ways to ensure Washington respects the Wisconsin Way. Thank you for the kindness you showed me during my campaign, and for your ongoing support of the state we all love.
