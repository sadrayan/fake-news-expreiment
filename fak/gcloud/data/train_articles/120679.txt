LaLa Surfboards Hawaii
Bio

Jon Lalanne, a thirty year Malibu resident, pro-surfer, and shaper, witnessed the start of the short board revolution. From single fins to twins, tris and quads, Jon has owned and operated hundreds of boards. Frustrated with mass produced boards Jon started designing and shaping hsi own boards.

A man on a mission, Jon seeks to save the world from Chinese imports and celebrity shapers who pimp to magazine superstars -- those poor planksters who have forgotten how to shape for the common man -- yet still charge astronomical prices.

Proven and tested on the local waves by local riders, LaLanne's Boards deliver high performance for surfers of all abilities.
