Steve Landes for Clerk
Friends:

For more than 20 years, I have had the honor of representing the residents of the 25th House District in the Virginia House of Delegates including many citizens of Augusta County. I have always remained faithful to the United States and Virginia Constitutions and the principals detailed in our Republican Party Creed. In addition, I have over 20 years of business experience, including a background in banking and financial services. With your help, I hope to bring my experience to be able to serve all of Augusta County as its Clerk of Circuit Court.



As your representative in the House of Delegates and candidate for the Augusta County Clerk of Circuit Court, I'm here to serve you. If there's anything that you'd like to talk about, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm here to listen.



Sincerely,

Steve Landes

Proven Experience and Trusted Service for Augusta County.
