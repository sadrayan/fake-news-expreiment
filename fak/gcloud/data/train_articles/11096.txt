MURPHY SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO PROTECT AMERICANS FROM GUN VIOLENCE
Today, U.S. Representative Patrick E. Murphy (FL-18) released the following statement in response to the President’s announcement of executive action to reduce gun violence by improving mental health care and expanding background checks, a bipartisan policy supported by 9 out of 10 Americans and 75 percent of NRA members.

“With our nation facing an average of 31 gun-related deaths each day, the need for action to curb gun violence could not be more clear or urgent. What the President announced today will not infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens but will help save lives and improve public safety,” said Murphy. “These common-sense measures have the support of a bipartisan majority of Americans and while this is a much-needed first step, it is disappointing that executive action was needed in the first place. Obstructionists in Congress have continually blocked gun violence prevention legislation despite broad support on both sides of the aisle and American families and communities deserve better.”

Murphy is a co-sponsor of the King-Thompson Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act, a common-sense, bipartisan measure to strengthen background checks and close several gun sale loopholes. This bill would expand the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including sales at gun shows, over the internet, or via classified ads. It also closes existing loopholes by requiring an enforceable background check for all firearm sales while at the same time supporting the Second Amendment rights of lawful gun owners. The bill includes reasonable exceptions for transfers between family and friends. Additionally, Murphy is a member of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and supports efforts to lift the ban on gun violence research as a co-sponsor of the Gun Violence Research Act.

Background on the President’s Executive Action to Reduce Gun Violence:

· Strengthening background checks nationwide. Provides new guidance on existing federal laws, clarifying that any individual in the business of selling firearms must obtain a license through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and therefore conduct background checks on prospective gun purchasers. These actions also include new measures and resources to make the background check system more efficient and effective.

· Protecting communities with bolstered enforcement. Takes new steps to promote smart and effective enforcement of our gun laws – including a proposed increase in funding for more ATF agents, greater resources for tracking illegal online firearms trafficking and strengthened domestic violence outreach efforts.

· Improving mental health services. Proposes increased investment to expand access to mental health care. Further, the executive actions remove barriers that prevent the reporting of relevant mental health information to the background check system.

· Driving new research into gun safety. Directs the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into new technology to make firearms safer.
