Senator Cruz is technically correct that only parties before the Court are bound by its judgment and orders. But, as he also noted, all other courts are bound by "stare decisis" to follow the Supreme Court so it is futile for states who are not parties to resist. More importantly, when a ruling is clear, ignoring the Supreme Court's decisions until a court directly orders them to obey undermines the rule of law. Bad people say "we won't obey the law until you make us." Unless they are engaged in justified civil disobedience--in which case they are liable to be punished--good people follow the law before they are directly commanded.

Sorry this is longer than you might wish, but the answer is complicated.

Nonparties are not literally bound by the order of the court, but if they do not go along they are postponing the inevitable and flouting the rule of law that was announced by the Court.
