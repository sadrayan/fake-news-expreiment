It wasn’t random.

Police say a “drug nexus” was behind the abduction and stabbing of three men early Wednesday. All three were dumped into the Schuylkill River; one survived even though he had multiple stab wounds. An “Asian gang” is thought to be behind the attack.

ABC News reports:



Three people who were abducted, stabbed, bound with tape and tossed in a Philadelphia river may have been victims of an Asian street gang and the cause of the “barbaric murders” was likely drugs, police said today.

The victims were taken off the street by five or six men who are possibly members of an Asian street gang early this morning and thrown into the back of a van, police said. Their hands were tied behind their backs with duct tape and their ankles were bound as well. Duct tape was also placed over their mouths and “their eyes were covered,” police said.

All three were taken to the Schuylkill River in Fairmount Park, where they were thrown into the water. Two were tethered to some kind of weight and drowned in five to ten feet of water. Police said a bucket was apparently used as one makeshift anchor.
