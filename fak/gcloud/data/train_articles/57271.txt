When Tom Ford left Gucci in 2004 after 10 years as creative director, the Italian label was valued at over $10 billion. The designer’s hyper-sensual take on glamour and luxury – shimmering blouses with plunging necklines, seductive tailoring and skin-baring dresses – had turned around a house on the verge of bankruptcy, transforming it into the trend-defining brand of the next decade.



Officially sanctioned by Madonna’s appearance at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards – when she wore a bra-revealing blue satin shirt and low-waisted trousers that came straight off the designer’s debut autumn/winter '95/'96 collection – Gucci became the celebrity brand of choice for red carpets and awards. Recall Gwyneth Paltrow’s red velvet suit at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards; the powder blue satin gown worn by Helen Hunt to collect her Best Actress Academy Award in 1998; Nicole Kidman’s dazzling dress for the Met Costume Institute Benefit Gala of 2003 (above).

A brief two-year hiatus from fashion only hyped Ford’s popularity and when he came back with his eponymous brand in 2006 – focusing on menswear and cosmetics – many of his famous female friends demanded his suits be tailored for them. Since the addition of a womenswear line in 2010, Tom Ford’s signature glamorous elegance has become once again a firm protagonist on the red carpet, donned by everyone from Rihanna to Zhang Ziyi. Even former first lady Michelle Obama showed her appreciation for the designer, opting for a Tom Ford draped ivory dress in silk-georgette for her UK state visit in 2011 (above).



To celebrate the designer’s birthday on 27 August, Vogue looks back on Tom Ford’s best show-stopping moments on the red carpet.
