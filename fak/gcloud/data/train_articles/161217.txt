Donald Trump’s budget 2019: read it in full now
At 11:30 am on Monday, the Trump administration’s Office of Management and Budget released their proposal for the fiscal year 2019 budget. Fiscal years are different from calendar years, so the proposal covers October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019.

The budget proposes nearly $700 billion in 10-year savings by “repealing and replacing” Obamacare, more than $200 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps), and $266 billion in cost reduction in Medicare, among many other program cuts.
