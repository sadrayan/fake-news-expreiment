Sweyn I | king of Denmark and England
Sweyn I, byname Sweyn Forkbeard, Danish Svend Tveskaeg, Norwegian Svein Tjugeskjegg, or Tviskjegg, (died February 3, 1014, Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England), king of Denmark (c. 987–1014), a leading Viking warrior and the father of Canute I the Great, king of Denmark and England. Sweyn formed an imposing Danish North Sea empire, establishing control in Norway in 1000 and conquering England in 1013, shortly before his death.

The son of the Danish king Harald Bluetooth (Blåtand), Sweyn rebelled in 987 against his father, who fled to Wendland (in Germany). Sweyn began feuding with Olaf I after the latter’s accession to the Norwegian throne in 995, and he allied with the Swedish king Olaf Skötkonung and with the Norwegian Erik, the earl of Lade. The three allies defeated Olaf I in the Battle of Svolder about 1000, with Sweyn becoming virtual ruler of Norway, although nominally sharing sovereignty with his allies. Sweyn then turned again to England, leading apparently punitive expeditions in 1003 and 1004 in retaliation for the St. Brice’s Day massacre of Danes in England on November 13, 1002.

Sweyn did not again return to England until 1013, when he led a highly successful campaign and was accepted as king throughout the country, forcing Ethelred II into exile; but he died less than a year later. Although Norway returned (1014–16) to Norwegian rule under the leadership of Olaf II Haraldsson, Sweyn’s Anglo-Danish empire continued under his son and grandson until 1042.
