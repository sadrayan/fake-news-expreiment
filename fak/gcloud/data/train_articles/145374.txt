25 People Got Tattoos in Exchange for Free Pizza for Life
Would you be willing to trade having a branded pizza tattoo on your body forever to be able to get free pizza for life? Well, plenty of people in Houston would. The Pi Pizza Truck celebrated its second anniversary this past weekend with its second-ever #FreePizzaForLife tattoo promotion. Houston Press explains the gist: Customers who get a $60 - $200 Pi Pizza Truck-themed tattoo from artist Gabe Massey will receive one free slice of pizza or $8 off a whole pizza every day as long as the truck (and its future brick and mortar location) is open for business. Based on last year's experience, owner Anthony Calleo isn't too concerned for the promotion's effects on the bottom line. He says he only comps about two sliced of pizza per week. And if someone did want to come eat his pizza every day, it would be "a hell of a compliment."

Calleo tells Eater that this year a total of 25 people got tattooed, up from last year's 22. This year customers had about 15 custom-designed tattoos to choose from including a pizza cutter with the truck's initials on it and a slice of pizza with a banner that reads "This Pizza Kills Fascists." Over on Imgur, one pizza fan posted an album of his experience getting tattooed in exchange for pizza, while over on Reddit another customer shares his final pizza design.
