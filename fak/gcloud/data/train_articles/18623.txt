Public Notice of Pollution
Protecting Florida's pristine environment is the Department of Environmental Protection's top priority. Pursuant to Section 403.077, F.S., the Department is establishing a method for regulated entities to submit Public Notices of Pollution for reportable releases. Additionally, the Department is making available to the public all Notices received to date as well as offering an e-mail subscription service for interested parties to be informed of Notices submitted for their area of interest.

Reporting entities should be aware that, while submission of a Notice through this website complies with the requirements of Section 403.077, F.S., it does not relieve them of any obligation to report to the State Watch Office.

Submit or Update Notice

While the preferred method for reporting is to use the link above, you may also report via e-mail using the Pollution Notice Form and e-mailing it to pollution.notice@dep.state.fl.us.

If you wish to receive notifications whenever a Notice is submitted to the Department, you may sign up for our notification list below.
