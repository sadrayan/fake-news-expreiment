On Obamacare, Congress didn’t really get an exemption

Can you believe Congress exempted itself from Obamacare? Shows how lawmakers know the law is terrible and want to protect themselves from its consequences!

That’s the general reaction to news that the Office of Personnel Management will allow the government to make contributions to the health insurance of lawmakers and their aides, as first reported by Politico.

What’s not well understood is the origin of this ruling. Uniquely, lawmakers and their aides had to get insurance “created” by the Affordable Care Act or “offered through an exchange.” This provision — stuck into the Affordable Care Act by Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, basically as an intended poison pill — only applied to Congress and to no one else.

(The poison pill didn’t really work, clearly, as the Affordable Care Act still was voted into law.)

So, does that mean the current plans — in effect right now — are no good? They weren’t “created” by the act, after all.

That is still the case. The current plans go away. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement Thursday night saying lawmakers and their staffs must enroll in an exchange by Oct. 1.

The ruling by the OPM means that the government will contribute to those plans — just as it does now, and just as most private-sector employees have their health insurance paid for, in part or in whole, by their employers.
