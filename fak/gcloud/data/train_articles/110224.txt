9-year-old banned from wearing Donald Trump hat to Fresno, California school
FRESNO, CA (KSEE) — A Fresno, California student’s Donald Trump hat is causing problems at his school.

“It’s my favorite hat,” says third grader Logan Autry. “The First Amendment says I can wear my hat.”

But his red hat, reading “Make America Great Again”, has caused problems for Logan.

“They told me to take my hat off because it brings negative emotions to the other children who don’t like him,” he says.

Logan said Thursday school officials at Powers-Ginsburg Elementary School told him to take his Donald Trump hat off due to safety concerns after other students confronted him.

“They were saying they didn’t like Trump, they were saying he was stupid,” says Logan. “I had to explain to them what Donald Trump was actually doing.”

According to district code, hats are permitted outside of the classroom but if they become a distraction, they can ask students to not wear them.

The district released the following statement:

“Our job as educators is to facilitate a safe learning environment where we encourage robust conversations of diverse and thoughts. We are proud that in this case, our school achieved that goal by allowing the student to wear his hat for several days. However, it is also our responsibility to take precautions when the discourse begins to impact our school climate and interrupt school operations.”

Despite the controversy, Logan said he plans to keep wearing his hat.
