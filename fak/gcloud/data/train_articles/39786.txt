FTC Providing Full Refunds to Mercola Brand Tanning System Purchasers
The Federal Trade Commission is mailing refunds that total $2.59 million to more than 1,300 people who bought Mercola indoor tanning systems. These refunds are the result of a 2016 settlement between the FTC and Dr. Joseph Mercola and his companies.

According to the FTC’s complaint, the defendants claimed that their Mercola brand D-Lite, SunSplash, and Vitality indoor tanning systems are safe, that research proves indoor tanning does not increase the risk of melanoma skin cancer, and that its systems can reverse the appearance of aging. The FTC’s complaint alleged that these claims are false and not supported by science.

As part of the settlement, the defendants are banned from selling indoor tanning systems and agreed to provide refunds to people who bought tanning systems after January 1, 2012, and submitted a completed a claim form by October 31, 2016. Customers will receive an average refund of $1,897. Recipients should deposit or cash checks within 60 days.

The FTC never requires people to pay money or provide account information to cash refund checks. If you have questions about the case, contact the FTC’s refund administrator, Rust Consulting, Inc., at 1-877-418-8082.
