“Bernie 2020” Stamp Issued

WASHINGTON- In a stunning and controversial departure from standard practice dating back over two hundred years, the United States Postal Service has issued a Forever Stamp endorsing the 2020 presidential candidacy of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.

Adorned with the words “BERNIE 2020” the jumbo-sized stamp depicts the senator delivering a campaign speech amidst a colorful backdrop of American flags.

Or so is the illusion being created courtesy of a mischievously designed envelope that’s been showing up in thousands of mailboxes nationwide since its release just a few days ago, both fooling and delighting its recipients. (View Bernie Sanders Envelope)

The deception is accomplished by means of incorporating a USPS Forever Stamp (a flag) into the design printed in the upper-right corner of the envelope. When the Forever Stamp is affixed in its designated place, the Bernie Sanders ‘stamp’ image has been completed.

The ready-for-mailing envelope comes with a “Red, White, and Blue” Forever Stamp and requires no additional postage to be mailed first class anywhere in the U.S. (up to one ounce, like all Forever Stamps).

A six-pack of the envelopes and stamps sells for $12.
