FLASHBACK: Obama 2012: 'The Future Must Not Belong To Those Who Slander The Prophet of Islam '
In the aftermath of the Islamic terrorist killing of 12 people at the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, in vengeance for the magazine’s mockery of the Prophet Mohammed, it is worthwhile noting the cowardice of the American administration on issues of free speech related to Mohammed in the past.

After the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans at the Benghazi, Libya consulate on September 11, 2012, President Obama and the rest of the Obama administration blamed a YouTube filmmaker for a video called “The Innocence of Muslims.” At the United Nations on September 25, 2012, Obama spoke out, not in defense of free speech, but in offense at the YouTube video:

The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.

And, of course, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton allegedly told the father of one of the murdered Americans that she would achieve the arrest of the YouTube filmmaker. The Obama administration asked YouTube to pull the video altogether.

Hillary Clinton recently explained that the use of foreign policy “smart power” should focus on “leaving no one on the sidelines, showing respect even for one’s enemies, trying to understand and insofar as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view.”
