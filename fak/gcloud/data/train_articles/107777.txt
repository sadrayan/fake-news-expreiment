The Detox Project is a research and certification platform that encourages transparency in the food and supplement industries on the subject of toxic chemicals.

We also promote unique new testing technologies that enable you to find out what levels of toxic chemicals are in your body and in your food.

The Detox Project has been involved in a number of groundbreaking studies over the last few years, including research on the worldâ€™s most used herbicide, glyphosate.

We continue to work at government and investor level to support new technology alternatives to chemical herbicides.
