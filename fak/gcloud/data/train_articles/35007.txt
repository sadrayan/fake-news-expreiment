New York Congressional Rally [with photos]
The three disrticts border each other and collectively represent the entirety of New York State's Hudson River Valley.

John Hall: John spoke about the Hudson River, and how it has inspired him over the years. He spoke of the enormous potential of the river as a source of alternative energy for the region, in addition to the benefits of wind & solar energy in NY. He described the benefits of a universal single-payer healthcare system, touched on the Republican culture of corruption, and accountability among other issues. Please help out and volunteer or contribute to the Hall campaign.







Kirsten Gillibrand: Kirsten told a touching story about how her grandmother inspired her entry to politics. Medicare for everybody was one of the main points of her platform. Her progressive position on the war in Iraq was exciting to hear about, and Gillibrand had a few choice words to say about the Bush administration's handling of veterans affairs.

Congressman Maurice Hinchey Hinchey is running unopposed in the 22nd district. He came out today to get everybody fired up. Hinchey said that in dealing with the Republicans, it's time to drop the kid gloves, drop the boxing gloves, and pick up the brass knuckles!
