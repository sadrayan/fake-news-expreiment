Snow Jam 82: Atlanta's 1982 snow storm that stranded thousands across Atlanta, Georgia and the Southeast U.S.!
Snow Jam ’82

Atlanta, Georgia

Tuesday, January 12, 1982

Around ten years ago, after telling my story of what happened during Atlanta’s Snow Jam ’82 a ‘million’ times, I decided I’d dig around on the internet and find tons of information and—of course—lots of pictures. At the time, and to my surprise, there was very little online about this unique day. So I created snowjam82.com as a way to gather photos, tell the stories and have some fun remembering Snow Jam ’82!

Crazy Weather, Great Stories!

The thousands who were part of this wacky weather event will never forget the day. Were you stuck at the office for two days? Did you slide off I-85? Or were you trapped in the ‘parking lot’ on I-285 and forced to walk home? Relive your memories and share them here.

Many were stranded by Snow Jam ’82. At least one person was married in the midst of the storm, and another was actually born during the chaos! Check out all the reader-submitted memories of this weird Winter event from 1982.

More Information

Though I didn’t find a ton of information on the interwebs, there was some. Here’s some of what I found for Snow Jam ’82 information and pictures of the storm. (Some folks get here by searching for ‘Snow Jam 83’ and lots of folks search for ‘Snow Jam 1981’ or ‘Snow Jam 81,’ but the ‘official’ Atlanta Snow Jam was in 1982. Not too sure what happened weather-wise in 1981 or 1983...)
