Ohio (OH) Poll * March 21, 2007 * Ohio Gov's Approval Up As Vote
March 21, 2007 - Ohio Gov's Approval Up As Voters Get To Know Him, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Voters Oppose Eminent Domain For Economy 6-1

By a 53 - 12 percent margin, Ohio voters approve of the job their new Governor, Ted Strickland, is doing according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Another 34 percent of voters are undecided.





This compares to a 45 - 12 percent approval for Gov. Strickland in a February 1 poll by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University just one month into the new Governor's term.





In this latest survey, Republicans approve of the Democrat 39 - 15 percent, while Democrats approve 64 - 13 percent and independent voters approve 56 - 10 percent.





In an open-ended question, where respondents can give any answer, 43 percent of Ohio voters list the economy/unemployment as the most important issue facing the state today, followed by 21 percent who list education and 6 percent each for taxes and healthcare.





In a separate question, 32 percent of Ohio voters say the state economy is "excellent" or "good," while 67 percent say it is "not so good" or "poor." "Gov. Strickland has generated public confidence in his ability to make the lives of Ohioans better," said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "They are realists, however, about just how much he will do."





The Ohio economy will improve in the next year, 29 percent of voters say, while 15 percent expect it to get worse and 53 percent expect it to remain the same. More than four out of five voters - 82 percent - think a governor can do "a lot" or "some" to improve the economy, but only 66 percent think Strickland will do "a lot" or "some" in that direction. "Although Ohio voters like Gov. Strickland, they don't necessarily see him as their economic savior, and even Democrats say he is less likely to make a difference than a governor theoretically could," said Brown.





Despite their feelings on the economy, 54 percent of Ohio voters are "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied" with the way things are going in the state today, a sizable jump from the 37 percent who felt satisfied when Quinnipiac University asked that question, in December of 2006. Today, 44 percent are "somewhat dissatisfied" or "very dissatisfied."





Eminent Domain Ohio voters support 78 - 17 percent setting limits on government use of eminent domain. In other questions on this issue:

Voters oppose 65 - 32 percent using government's eminent domain power to take private property for public projects such as roads;

Voters oppose 82 - 14 percent using eminent domain to take property for economic development;

Voters say 50 - 30 percent that government has abused eminent domain in the past.

"Despite their concerns about the economy, Ohio voters don't see the value of eminent domain as an economic development tool," Brown said.





Voters want the estate tax changed: 40 percent, including 55 percent of Republicans, 30 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of independent voters, want the estate tax eliminated, while 24 percent want it lowered.





And voters remain evenly divided, 48 - 47 percent, on whether they want an increase in state taxes to provide additional school funding in the Ohio's poorer districts.





From March 13 - 19, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,122 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points.

INTRO QUES 42-45. As you may know, the government has the power of eminent domain. Under eminent domain, if the government needs a person's property for what it considers important public projects, it pays what's determined to be fair market value and the person must sell.
