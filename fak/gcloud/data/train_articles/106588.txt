Residents of Colonial Beach found zip-locked bags containing Ku Klux Klan recruitment flyers and DVDs on their front lawns on April 14.

“The flyers are disgusting, and if people in America, Virginia, or Colonial Beach think there is not hateful racism that exists they are wrong and this proves it,” Colonial Beach Police Chief Danny Plott said.

The material, which includes racist and anti-Semitic messages, appears to have been randomly dispersed to homes in Colonial Beach. Plott said it is the first time in his three years as police chief that this type of activity has occurred.

W. W. Hynson, vice chairman of the Westmoreland County Board of Supervisors, said that there is a deep-rooted problem in the U.S. that is promoting hateful speech.

“It’s a greater problem than just the flyers,” Hynson said. “There is something wrong with the country.”

When asked how residents of Westmoreland County can help combat the message that the hate-based organization has spread, Hynson said, “Be a good neighbor. America needs to wake up.”

Darryl Fisher, chairman of the supervisors, said that it is crucial for residents to stay informed of the issues arising within the community and the country.

Education and communication are necessary to defend neighbors and ensure that the KKK has no place in Colonial Beach or surrounding counties.

The police department is investigating the matter. The chief said that recruiting members to the organization is not a crime, but those who were involved could be charged with misdemeanor littering.
