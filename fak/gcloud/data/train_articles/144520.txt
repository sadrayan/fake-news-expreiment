Kenya’s Priorities for Inclusive Growth: Towards Domestic Development and Regional Peace
Over the last decade, Kenya has been one of the fastest growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa, and President Kenyatta’s first term saw major gains in access to electricity and significant infrastructure investment. However, inequality and poverty remain rampant: 8,300 Kenyans own more wealth than the rest of the population (around 48 million people) and two years of drought have left more than 3 million in need of food aid.

Conflicts in neighbouring South Sudan and Somalia have strongly affected Kenya, and achieving lasting peace and stability in both countries is vital to ensuring domestic and regional efforts to transform economies and improve socio-economic prospects for all.

At this event, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya will outline his plans for his second and final term in office for regional peace and domestic development to ensure all Kenyans enjoy the benefits of headline national growth.

The event will be livestreamed on the Chatham House website.
