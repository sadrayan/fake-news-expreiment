There are two types of Mexican-domiciled trucking operations that enter the U.S.:

1. The first type of trucking operations – and the large majority – are those that service and are restricted to the Commercial Zones along the U.S.– Mexico border. Commercial Zone-restricted trucks are randomly selected for SAFETY inspections. (You will need to contact the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, perhaps other federal entities, for their particular inspection protocols.)

2. The second type of trucking operations are those that possess USDOT/Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration long-haul, interstate operating authority. The long-haul, interstate trucks are likewise randomly selected for SAFETY inspections. (As above, you will need to contact the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, perhaps other federal entities, for their particular inspection protocols.) IMPORTANT NOTE: Mexican-domiciled trucking companies with long-haul, interstate authority MUST HAVE a current Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance http://www.cvsa.org (CVSA) safety inspection decal displayed on their trucks to operate in the U.S. These CVSA safety inspection decals expire every 90 days. Therefore, a Mexican-domiciled long-haul, interstate truck must undergo a thorough safety inspections every 90 days to operate in the U.S. [NOTE: Mexican-domiciled Commercial Zone-restricted trucks are not subject to the same CVSA decal requirement.]

Very best – Duane
