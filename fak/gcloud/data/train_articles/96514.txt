Biden Sexually Molests Reporter
WASHINGTON (WNB) - White House Correspondent Aime Parnes posted a photo on her Facebook page showing Joe Biden lustily pawing her.

The photo was reportedly taken at a recent Christmas party, and seems to show Parnes attempting to move Bidens hands. What appears to be a half empty bottle of Wild Turkey can be seen in the Vice President's suit coat pocket.

Biden later denied any impropriety, claiming he was merely "checking her sources."
