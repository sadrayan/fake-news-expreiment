Fix Health System, President Urges
Stepping up his push to reform the nation's health-care system, President Obama yesterday warned of the impact of spiraling costs to the nation's finances.

"The status quo is broken," Obama declared in his weekly radio and Internet address. "If we do nothing, everyone's health care will be put in jeopardy."

He called on Congress to enact legislation to reform the system, saying it is "no longer a luxury we hope to achieve; it's a necessity we cannot postpone any longer."

The cost of health care is placing an unsustainable burden on personal budgets, small businesses and the federal government, Obama said.

"All across America, our families are making hard choices when it comes to health care," he said. "Now it's time for Washington to make the right ones. It's time to deliver."
