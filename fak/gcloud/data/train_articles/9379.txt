Trump on 'the Zika': Rick Scott has it 'under control'
@PatriciaMazzei

Donald Trump seemed ill-prepared Wednesday to answer questions from a West Palm Beach CBS affiliate on the Zika virus outbreak plaguing Florida.

The Republican presidential nominee opined that Gov. Rick Scott, a Trump backer, is "doing a fantastic job" fighting the mosquito-borne virus.

"First of all, you have a great governor who's doing a fantastic job, Rick Scott, on the Zika. And it's a problem, it's a big problem," Trump told CBS 12. "But I watch and I see and I see what they're doing with the spraying and everything else. And I think he's doing a fantastic job. And he's letting everyone know exactly what the problem is and how to get rid of it. He's going to have it under control. He probably already does."

There are currently 351 confirmed Zika cases in the state.

Asked if Congress should convene an emergency session to approve Zika funding, Trump seemed to consider the matter a state -- rather than federal -- issue.

"I would say that it's up to Rick Scott," he said. "It depends on what he's looking to do, because really seems to have it under control in Florida."
