Sharifa Alkhateeb Talks About Using Public Schools to Convert America to Islam
Sharifa is (was) a True Believer in the the ethos of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hasan al-Banna (1928)

"It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet.”

Islam was well understood in the 17th century, yet here we are in the 21st, still reinventing the wheel.

“It is a misfortune to human nature when religion is given by a conqueror. The Mahometan religion, which speaks only by the sword, acts still upon men with that destructive spirit with which it was founded."

~ Montesquieu
