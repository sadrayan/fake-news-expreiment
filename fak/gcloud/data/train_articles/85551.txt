The Dillon takes shape in downtown Raleigh

After more than a year of construction, one of the pioneering developments on downtownâ€™s west side has begun to take shape. A single element worth emphasizing about the design of The Dillon would be its view: expansive to the south from an outside terrace on the ninth floor, and a full 360 degrees from offices above. The plan remains for The Dillon to open in summer or fall of 2018.
