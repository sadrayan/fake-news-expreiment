Burlington Electric Department Statement: No Indication that Electric Grid or Customer Information Compromised
Cybersecurity is an issue that the Burlington Electric Department and all U.S. utilities take very seriously and on which we focus every day to protect the integrity of the electric grid and the personal information of our valued customers.

Federal officials have indicated that the specific type of Internet traffic, related to recent malicious cyber activity that was reported by us yesterday, also has been observed elsewhere in the country and is not unique to Burlington Electric. Itâ€™s unfortunate that an official or officials improperly shared inaccurate information with one media outlet, leading to multiple inaccurate reports around the country.

At Burlington Electric, where we take great pride in conveying timely and accurate information, we want our community to know that there is no indication that either our electric grid or customer information has been compromised. Media reports stating that Burlington Electric was hacked or that the electric grid was breached are false.

We want to thank our customers for their continued confidence and trust in Burlington Electric.
