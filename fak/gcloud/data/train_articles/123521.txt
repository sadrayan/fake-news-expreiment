Guns and religion mix as Pa. church blesses couples toting AR-15s
The ceremony's official name was the Cosmic True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humanity Cheon Il Guk Book of Life Registration Blessing. It was part of the church's weeklong "Festival of Grace," which included a "President Trump Thank You Dinner" on Saturday. Wednesday's church ceremony garnered international attention because of the call for couples to bring AR-15s, a popular semi-automatic rifle that has been used in many of the nation's worst mass shootings, including the Valentine's Day massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.
