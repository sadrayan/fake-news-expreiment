NOTHING tops off a holiday in Bali like discovering there is a spider burrowing under your skin.

Bunbury local Dylan Thomas’ first trip to Bali last weekend was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach.

21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his navel and heading upwards.

“It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,” he said.

Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher.

When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors early on Sunday morning, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line.

Later that morning he awoke to blisters.

“That’s when it became painful, it was a searing burn,” he said.

He finally saw a dermatologist on Monday, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary.

Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan’s recent appendix removal.

“It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,” he said.

He has now earnt himself the nickname Spider-man.

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days,” Dylan said.

The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing.

Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days.
