Gardner,

Attached is the article you requested. I checked with our director of domestic research, and he said that this is the article they cited in their domestic study as well, and as far as he knows, is the only study out there on this topic.

Best,

Rebecca

Thanks.

This article combines the US and Canada under North America, indicating an unintended pregnancy rate of 48 percent in 2008.

Per the article, several other regions had estimated rates equal to or greater than that: Eastern Europe and Southeastern Asia (48 percent each); Southern Asia (59 pct); the Caribbean (63 pct); and South America (64 pct).

Am I reading this right?

Are there any western industrialized countries in those other regions?

I just double checked with Gilda, and she said that there are no western industrialized countries in most of those regions you identified; the one exception is Eastern Europe. If you separate out the US from the North America region, which we did in this article http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/ajph.2013.301416.pdf, the U.S. rate of unintended pregnancy in 2008 was 54 per 1,000, which is well above the 48 per 1,000 in Eastern Europe.

Also, just to clarify, the unintended pregnancy rate is not a percent. The rate is a calculation of number per population. In other words, an unintended pregnancy rate of 48 per 1,000 women of reproductive age means that 4.8% of women that age experienced an unintended pregnancy. Does that make sense?

Best,

Rebecca

...

Guttmacher's December 2013 "fact sheet" says 51 percent of U.S. pregnancies in 2008--or 3.4 million of 6.6 million--were unintended, which the sheet defines as mistimed (31 percent) or unwanted (20 percent). Also, a Dec. 19, 2013, Guttmacher press release said the declared percentages were devised for a research article by institute researchers Lawrence Finer and Mia Zolna based on U.S. government data and the institute's Abortion Patient Survey. "Although many unintended" U.S. "pregnancies are accepted or even welcomed," the release said, "40% end in abortion."

Also, the fact sheet says: "The U.S. unintended pregnancy rate is significantly higher than the rate in many other developed countries."

That statement is not accompanied by a precise comparison of unintended pregnancies in the U.S. and specific other western industrialized countries--nor did I spot one in the study you kindly shared--or did I overlook such detail? If that level of country-to-country information is available, anywhere, it's what I seek to reach a conclusion on the accuracy of the claim that we are checking. If the information does not exist, then how did Guttmacher's experts reach their conclusion about the U.S. rate versus rates in other specific developed countries?

...As I mentioned yesterday, percentages and rates are not the same thing. The first paragraph you cite below has nothing to do with rates of unintended pregnancy. The same article that found that 51% of pregnancies are unintended also found that the rate of unintended pregnancies in the U.S. was 54 per 1,000 women in 2008. As Gilda mentioned in her original email to you, developed country unintended pregnancy rates are not systematically collected. Those data are reported as regional data rather than individual country data. In her article she provided data by region, and showed that every developed region had substantially lower rates of unintended pregnancy than the U.S. in 2008.

Therefore, the U.S. unintended pregnancy rate (of 54 per 1,000) is significantly higher than the rate in many other developed countries (48 per 1,000 in Eastern Europe; 41 per 1,000 in Northern Europe; 42 per 1,000 in Western Europe; 39 per 1,000 in Southern Europe; and 37 per 1,000 in Oceana).

OK. Basically I read this as saying that to Guttmacher's knowledge, no one has country-specific data that would directly relate to the claim we're checking.

Gardner, that statement is not accurate. It's not that to our knowledge no one has country-specific data. Some developed countries publish unplanned birth data, some publish abortion data, and some publish both. Because not all countries publish those data, we do our analysis at the regional level. What is true is that there are no published country-specific data that directly address that claim. However, based on our research, we are confident that the US unintended pregnancy rate is higher than that of most other developed countries.
