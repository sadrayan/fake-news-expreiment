Allison Moorer â€“ Cold Cold Earth Lyrics
The night was hot and steamy

And crickets played their tune

Everyone was sleeping

Under an August moon



Except one man that sat awake

Slowly going mad

Regretting that he'd thrown away

The only love he had



A slave to the bottle

He'd driven his family to leave

A wife and two daughters

He treated so terribly



Drunk with grief and loneliness

He wasn't thinking straight

He knew he couldn't live

Unless they pardoned his mistakes



He went into the city

To try to make amends

Asked his love for pity

But she would not give in



Overwhelmed with sadness

He reached for his gun

And took her life along with his

Before the morning sun



Now they are lying

In the cold, cold earth

Such a sad, sad story

Such a sad, sad world
