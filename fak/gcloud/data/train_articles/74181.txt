“Long Bill” Crosses the Finish Line
Lawmakers completed their single most important piece of annual business today, when Gov. John Hickenlooper signed a balanced and on-time budget bill that manages to give Coloradans the tax refunds Republicans promised them while adequately funding core government services like education, healthcare and infrastructure.

Republican leaders gave much of the credit for achieving that balancing act to lawmakers serving on the bipartisan Joint Budget Committee, which was masterfully led by Chairman Kent Lambert (R-Colorado Springs). Writing a budget requires countless hours spent in numerous hearings held throughout the year. JBC members won praise not just for their hard work, but also for their ability to put partisanship aside in the interest of reasonableness and efficiency.



"The priorities for Senate Republicans were to adequately fund core government services, use the budget process to improve oversight and accountability, and to get taxpayers the refunds they’re owed under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights," said Senate President Bill Cadman after the signing. "I count it as a tremendous success that we were able to accomplish all three while controlling just one chamber of the Statehouse."



JBC Chairman Senator Lambert was quick to share credit for the budget’s success with other members of the committee. “Writing a budget like this one requires a willingness to cooperate and keep an open mind that one doesn’t always find in partisan politics,” said Lambert. “I think the example of cooperation set by committee members helped reduce unnecessary conflict as we worked toward a budget that’s reasonable, responsible, and delivered on time.”
