Advance Wisconsin
Wisconsin’s technical colleges are advancing Wisconsin and advancing individuals’ careers.

Advance Wisconsin unites Wisconsin technical colleges who received awards under the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) Grants. Funds from the U.S. Department of Labor help colleges transform their training. The skills gap will close and industry needs will be met.

Wisconsin’s technical colleges received multiple TAACCCT grant awards. Each award has a unique focus. Most importantly, individuals, particularly Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) workers, veterans, the unemployed, under-employed, and low-skilled workers, will have access to educational systems that help meet their learning needs. The colleges will establish credit for prior learning, provide clear career pathways, and help the workers earn credentials as quickly as possible so they can return to work.
