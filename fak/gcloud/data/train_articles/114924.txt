The Israeli health ministry has ruled that Heinz tomato ketchup must now be sold as "tomato seasoning" there.

Rival ketchup maker Osem, the top selling brand in Israel, had said the Heinz product did not have sufficient tomato content to be called ketchup.

In January Osem said it had Heinz ketchup tested and found it contained 21% tomato concentrate. Israel requires ketchup to have 41% tomato concentrate.

Heinz's Israeli distributor is reported to be seeking a change in regulations.

'Local requirements'

Commenting on its product for sale in Israel, a Heinz Europe spokesman said: "The word ketchup is indicated in English on the front of the bottle while recognising that the Israeli standard for ketchup has yet to be brought in line with US and European accepted international standards, the back label of our ketchup sold in Israel reflects current local requirements for ingredient labelling and the Hebrew name for the product."

They added: "The original, quality recipe for Heinz Tomato Ketchup sold in Israel and the standard for ketchup around the world remains unchanged."

Heinz ketchup was first created in 1876.
