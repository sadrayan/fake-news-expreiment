Palin: “Slavery Wasn’t Our Fault, Because The Negroes Liked It” – Cor…
France’s minister for women’s rights has compared Muslim women who wear the veil to American “Negroes” who accepted slavery, in an interview with French media. Laurence Rossignol made the comments to RMC radio and BFM TV, igniting accusations of racism on Wednesday across social media as a petition was launched calling on the minister to resign. In just a few hours, the petition gathered more than 10,000 signatures.

On the other hand, Sarah Palin, former half-term governor of Alaska and reality TV star, agreed with the French minister’s statement. She even used the remark herself while commenting on the incident during an interview with a local Alaska newspaper. “I’m telling you, I’ve been saying it for years, but nobody’s listening – slavery wasn’t forced onto African-Americans, they accepted it willingly,” she said. “But, all of a sudden, they realized that it represented a very powerful bargaining chip that could help them milk more money out of the national budget. And now they’re even complaining white people are racist. That is just horrendous.”
