Pakistan raises death toll in Peshawar school attack to 148
Sorrow mingled with anger as some Pakistanis accused the military of failing to protect the army-run school, which is in a cantonment area and most of its students are the children of army personnel. The attackers apparently encountered little security as they stormed the school's back entrance Tuesday morning and methodically gunned down students and staff members, shooting most of them in the head.
