Bill Clinton Talks About Donald Trump and His Presidential Bid...So, Is He Voting for Wife Hillary Clinton?
President Bill Clinton is probably voting for wife Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election (or at least, we should hope so...), should she win the Democratic primaries, but what does he think about Donald Trump?

The Republican real estate mogul and The Celebrity Apprentice host announced his own bid earlier this week. Trump had fuelled speculation he would run before many previous elections.

"My first question is an obvious oneâ€”I know you've been a Hillary Clinton supporter for president for quite some time," Jon Stewart joked to Bill on The Daily Show on Wednesday. "Does Donald Trump's entry into the race in any way complicate that or change the way that you're viewing your vote? Take your time."

"You know that's a hard question but I want to just remind you that, as you pointed out with that unbelievable opening, you got five weeks to go and I'm still the spouse of a presidential candidate," Bill replied, drawing laughs.

Stewart is set to leave The Daily Show after 16 years on Aug. 6. South African comic Trevor Noah will take over as host on Sept. 28.
