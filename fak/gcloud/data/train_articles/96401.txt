Governor signs statewide higher education bond package
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine officially signed the statewide higher education bond package Thursday that includes $38.1 million to fully fund construction of the new School of Education at the College of William and Mary. Interim William and Mary President W. Taylor Reveley III joined other university presidents, college administrators and state officials in Richmond to participate in the signing ceremony at the State Capitol.

Members of the Virginia General Assembly passed the bond bill last month that will bring nearly $1.5 billion for critical construction projects at colleges and universities across the state. In addition to the School of Education, the measure includes funding and planning dollars for three other construction projects at William and Mary, including $8 million toward a project to upgrade the College's heating and cooling systems, $250,000 in pre-planning dollars for the third phase of the Integrated Science Center and more than $500,000 for detailed planning of the renovation of Tucker Hall.
