Patrick did propose directing more of the education budget to teacher salaries, but his plan didn’t pass because most educators and legislators saw through the con game he was trying to impose on public schools. His plan would have forced already underfunded school districts to cut back even more on important education programs so Patrick could try to make political points with teachers. It wasn’t a real pay raise proposal. If Patrick really wanted to raise teacher pay, he would have proposed an additional allocation of state funds to pay for it. I don’t remember how big a fake pay raise he proposed, but $10,000 would have taken a big chunk out of school district budgets and/or increased the local property taxes that Patrick professes to want to reduce.
