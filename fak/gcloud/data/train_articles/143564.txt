Household Cavalry
Our Role

For more than 300 years, the soldiers of Household Cavalry have acted as the monarch’s trusted guardians, as well as being the public face of the British Army both at home and abroad.

The Household Cavalry has also earned a formidable reputation on the battlefield, having served in iconic conflicts from Waterloo to Afghanistan. At home, its duties have ranged from providing security for the 2012 Olympic Games in London to assisting flood victims.

Whether they’re riding a horse or driving an armoured vehicle, all Household Cavalry soldiers have one thing in common: excellence.
