Warriors Reportedly "Unanimously" Decline White House Invite
UPDATE:

According to Sports Illustrated, the Golden State Warriors say they have not yet been invited to the White House for the visit that honors sports champions. “Today is about celebrating our championship. We have not received an invitation to the White House but will make those decisions, when and if necessary,” the team announced in a statement, which contradicts previous rumors that said the team unanimously declined the invite.

Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was reportedly asked about President Trump many times throughout this season, during which Kerr once called him a “blowhard,” describing POTUS as “ill-suited” for the job.

Last month, Michele Roberts, Executive Director of the NBA Players Association, stated that if the Cleveland Cavaliers or Golden State Warriors won the NBA championship, neither team would accept an offer to visit the White House. Roberts, a former D.C. public defender, and litigation attorney, according to The Federalist, suggested both the Cavs and Warriors were against Trump and the new administration.
