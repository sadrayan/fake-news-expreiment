United States Senate Committee on Appropriations
Appropriations Vice Chair Leahy: Summary Of The Department Of Homeland Security FY19 Appropriations Bill

Washington, D.C. –

The fiscal year 2019 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Bill provides a discretionary total of $55.151 billion, of which $6.652 billion is provided for Disaster Relief, as defined by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, and $165 million is provided for Coast Guard Overseas Contingency Operations funds. After excluding these two amounts, the net discretionary appropriation for DHS is $48.334 billion, $611 million more than the fiscal year 2018 enacted amount.

The DHS bill invests in a diverse set of programs that protect the American public from threats by land, sea, air, and cyber. The bill also makes significant investments to ensure that State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial governments are prepared for all risks.

U.S. Senator Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Ranking Member of the Department of Homeland Security Subcommittee, said: “This national security bill makes critical investments at our northern and southern borders, provides the Coast Guard with new assets to protect our ports and waterways, bolsters security at our airports, increases support for local law enforcement, and helps stop the flow of dangerous drugs, like opioids, fentanyl, and methamphetamines. By making these responsible investments we will keep our nation safe and tackle some of our country’s most pressing security challenges.”

U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said: “This bill is the product of hard work and bipartisan cooperation between Chairwoman Capito and Ranking Member Tester. It makes valuable investments in the fight against the opioid epidemic and in our law enforcement, and provides much needed resources for the Federal Emergency Management Agency I remain deeply concerned about the extreme, divisive immigration policies of the Trump administration and I am glad that this bill instead reflects bipartisan compromise on these tough issues so this Committee can continue to do the vital work of the American people.
