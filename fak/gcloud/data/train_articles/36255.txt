Watch live: Beto O'Rourke's El Paso rally set against President Trump's speech
Hundreds of supporters and protesters gathered Monday ahead of President Donald Trump's campaign rally in El Paso.

The rally comes nearly a week after the president mentioned the border city in his State of the Union address. It will be at 7 p.m. at the El Paso County Coliseum.

A counter-rally led by former U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke will be held nearby at the same time. O'Rourke said in an America’s Voice Texas conference call with reporters that he is not using the March for Truth as a dress rehearsal for a presidential run.
