Said a shook up Fernando Hutchins about his encounter with Gay Atlanta gang set the Sweet Bloods.

Police responded to the W hotel in downtown Atlanta where reports of a carjacking took place. Once they arrived they found a distraught Fernando Hutchins laying on his stomach because he had been assaulted. He required 24 stitches to his anal cavity.
