Hi there,

The numbers come from the Current Population Survey, which is sponsored jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The numbers are in this report accessible here:http://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/FedUp%20Report%2003022015%20web.pdf. The Texas numbers start on page 69 of the PDF (67 of the Report).

If you'd like to talk directly with an economist about these figures, I'd be glad to get you in contact with someone from the Economic Policy Institute.

Thanks and I hope this info helps!
