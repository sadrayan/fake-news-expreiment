Mr. McFeely Visit
Mr. McFeely, the Speedy Delivery man from the popular children’s television series Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, will make a special appearance here at the Museum on Sunday, January 27 from 1:00–3:00 p.m. (Museum admission or membership required). Mr. McFeely’s appearance will kick off a winter sweater drive benefiting local charitable organizations. The event also marks the culmination of How People Make Things, a traveling exhibit inspired by the factory tour segments from Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.

A special members-only presentation with Mr. McFeely and some of the original Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood puppets will be held from 11:00 a.m. to Noon at Washington Jr. High School, right next to the Museum! Members will have the chance to personally meet Mr. McFeely, take a picture with him and receive an autograph.
