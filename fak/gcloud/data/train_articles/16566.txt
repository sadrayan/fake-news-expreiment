Sociopaths is a term that has been largely replaced by the term psychopathy in the work of people who work with folks with that label.

While prevalence figures of this disorder are estimates at best, the consensus falls at around 1 percent or slightly lower for psychopathy. Here are a couple of links:

First, the abstract to the first study of this in the general population in Great Britain:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19243821

Second, a summary sentence from a long article on the topic comparing psychopathy with antisocial personality disorder (full article linked below the quote):

Estimates based on psychopathic traits, as reported by Neumann and Hare have indicated that 1.2% of the general population scored in the range indicative of potential psychopathy; a more recent report corroborated this estimate, finding 1% of individuals in a community setting meeting clinical levels of psychopathic traits.

You can find the full article here if you'd like:

Happy to talk about this some more if you'd like.

John
