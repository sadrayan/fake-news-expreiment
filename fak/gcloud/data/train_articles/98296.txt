Iglesia Ni Cristo
About Us

The Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church Of Christ) is a Christian religion whose primary purpose is to serve and worship the Almighty God based on His teachings recorded in the Bible. It is not a denomination or sect. It is neither affiliated to any federation or religious bodies nor itself an assembly of smaller churches or religious organizations.



This Church is for every one who heeds the call of God and embraces its faith—regardless of one’s race, nationality, cultural background, social standing, economic status, and educational attainment.
