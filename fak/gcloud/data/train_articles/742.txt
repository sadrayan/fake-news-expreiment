Rapper Macklemore gets “Stupid Award” at AMA
It seems each time there are one of these entertainment awards shows, we have to be prepared for the bizarre and the stupid — well, except for the country music awards (gotta love that “Obamacare in the Morning” duet).

Anyway, last night’s American Music Awards did not disappoint. Once again Miley Cyrus took the award for the bizarre and rapper Macklemore, in my estimation, gets the recognition for the stupid.

Macklemore made this statement via his video acceptance speech, “Due to the fact that we are in Florida tonight accepting this award I want to acknowledge Trayvon Martin and the hundreds and hundreds of kids each year that are dying due to racial profiling and the violence that follows it. This is really happening. These are our friends, our neighbors, our peers and our fans, and it’s time that we look out for the youth and fight against racism and the laws that protect it.”

This is a walking example of the low information voter. Is he unaware of the “knockout game?” Maybe he doesn’t know, as Kevin Jackson points out, that black people kill more black people every six months than the KKK did in 86 years. I hope this “entertainer” becomes familiar with the stories of 13-month-old Antonio West or 88-year-old Delbert Belton.

If Mr. Macklemore is so concerned about his “fans” perhaps he should sing more about ending violence, being responsible citizens, getting a better education, and stronger families in the black community. I might recommend he take a civics class and learn there are no laws protecting or institutionalizing racism in America.

It just never ceases to amaze me that some of these entertainers are so full of themselves as to believe they are competent political and social commentators. Mr. Macklemore, just shut up and sing, er, whatever it is that you do. Please leave serious intellectual analysis to those of us who live in the real world.
