Mass Voter Fraud Just Discovered, to the Amount That Could VOID Hillary’s Victory In…
Hillary Clinton blew an election she should’ve won with ease.

In fact, the former secretary of state lost a rigged election in her favor to a man with zero experience holding political office.

That’s how awful a candidate she was.

Now, new reports of voter fraud are popping up. The numbers are so egregious, in fact, that Hillary’s New Hampshire victory might not even count anymore.

The Granite State carried four electoral votes. Trump “lost” by 0.4%.

From Washington Times:

More than 6,500 people registered to vote in New Hampshire on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver’s licenses, and since then the vast majority have neither obtained an in-state license nor registered a motor vehicle. … New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper, a Republican, issued the numbers Thursday based on inquiries he made to the Department of State, which oversees elections, and the Department of Safety.

Here are some numbers…

-6,540 people registered and voted on Nov. 8, based on presenting out-of-state licenses.

-As of Aug. 30, about 15 percent (1,014 of the voters) had been issued New Hampshire driver’s licenses.

-Οf the remaining 5,526, barely more than 200 (3.3 percent) had registered a motor vehicle in New Hampshire. New Hampshire law gives drivers 60 days upon establishing residence to obtain a state license. But more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver’s licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later.

It’s not the best time to be a Democrat, you know, with all the cheating and having a sitting U.S. senator facing trial for corruption charges and all.
