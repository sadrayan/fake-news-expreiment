N.Korea can produce missile engines, not reliant on imports -U.S. officials
WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - North Korea has the ability to produce missile engines and intelligence suggests the country does not need to rely on imports of engines, U.S. intelligence officials said on Tuesday.

"We have intelligence to suggest that North Korea is not reliant on imports of engines. Instead, we judge they have the ability to produce the engines themselves," one of the officials told Reuters.

A new study by a London-based think tank and an article in the New York Times that cited the study said rocket engines probably from a Ukrainian factory were obtained by North Korea from illicit networks. (Reporting by Jonathan Landay; Writing by Yara Bayoumy; Editing by James Dalgleish)
