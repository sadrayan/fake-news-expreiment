Subject: Inquiry for a fact check

Here is what we’re checking: None of $400 million the City of Austin proposes to spend on road projects “will be used to add new lanes to congested roadways.”

The statement below is not true.

Proposition 1, in total, includes roughly 15 miles of new or extended lane miles and provides substantial operational and safety benefits to segments and intersections of very congested roadways.

For example, all of the I-35 projects are part of a larger program (the CAIP where we’ll be adding a future transportation corridor down the middle of I-35), but in addition to that, the I-35 projects listed will be extending mainlanes or ramps, adding operational lanes at intersections, cross-street structures and U-Turn structures, and constructing multiple collector-distributor lanes (which are lanes that carry traffic between the mainlanes and frontage roads and allow motorists to bypass traffic signals). These intersections are often where the bottlenecks occur that backs up traffic on the mainlanes. For the SH 71 project, it would include the addition of about 2-3 new lanes for an eastbound direct connector into ABIA, and for FM 1826, it would add at least one new lane, if not more.

Hope that helps! If you have questions or need additional information, please let me know. Take care.

As previously stated, in total, Proposition 1 includes roughly 15 miles of new or extended lane miles and provides substantial operational and safety benefits to segments and intersections of very congested roadways. Here is the back-up for that statement.

Additional lane mileage for I-35:

- Intersection at Riverside: 2.46 lane miles

- Intersection at Oltorf: 3.48 lane miles

- Intersection at William Cannon: 4.62 lane miles

- Total: approximately 10.50 lane miles (see details below)

For I-35 projects:

- William Cannon to Stassney project SB extends the 4th mainlane from the current transition where the DC ties in to the exit ramp for Slaughter Lane

- William Cannon to Stassney project SB extends 3rd frontage road lane from north of Williamson Creek to the entrance ramp from Ben White

- William Cannon to Stassney project adds operational lanes at intersections, adds lanes on cross street structures and adds U-Turn structures at both William Cannon and Stassney

- William Cannon to Stassney project NB adds a 4th lane between entrance ramp from William Cannon to exit ramp to Ben White

- Oltorf project SB adds 4th mainlane SB from Woodland to south of Woodward and 5th lane SB between entrance ramp from Woodward to exit ramp to Woodland

- Oltorf project NB extends 4th mainlane from near Woodward to Woodland and 5th lane between entrance from Woodward to exit ramp for Woodland

- Oltorf project adds operational lanes at intersections, adds lanes on cross street structure and adds U-Turn structures at Oltorf

- Riverside NB project adds 1 and 2 lane collector-distributor

- Riverside SB project adds 2 lane collector-distributor

- Riverside project adds operational lanes at intersection, adds lanes on cross street structure and adds SB to NB U-Turn structure at Riverside

Additional lane mileage for SH 71 EB DC-CD (into ABIA):

- Includes 2-3 added lanes which would increase capacity on EB SH 71

- Total: around 3.9 miles (see chart below)

Length (mi) Number of Lanes Total Length SH 71 DC 0.53 1 0.53 US 183 DC 0.42 1 0.42 Collector-distributor 0.66 3 1.99 Spirit of Texas (overpass) to Presidential 0.47 2 0.95 Total lane miles 3.88

Additional lane mileage for FM 1826:

- Would add at least one new lane, if not more

- Total: approximately 1 mile

I hope this helps. Thanks.
