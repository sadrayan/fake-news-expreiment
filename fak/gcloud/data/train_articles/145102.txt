Wendy Davis delivered famed Texas Senate filibuster to stop anti-abortion bill five years ago today
Five years ago Monday, former state Sen. Wendy Davis spent 12 hours on her feet trying to block the Texas Senate from passing a restrictive abortion bill.

Her filibuster succeeded in killing the bill as time expired on a special session in 2013. The effort attracted a crowd of thousands and national attention, and the shoe brand Mizuno even got a bounce from the pink sneakers she wore to stay comfortable.

"Tonight, people who have been in this Capitol for far longer than I have said they've never experienced anything like what we saw at the Capitol today and this evening," Davis said then. "There were thousands of people here throughout the day, and what they were asking that their voices would be heard.

"We did our best as a Democratic caucus to make sure that happened, and I think the results speak for themselves."
