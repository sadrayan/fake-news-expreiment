stooges. Alex Jones staring down some NWO

Alex Jones after taking his HairGrowerAlpha 3000 pills

Alexander Emerick Jones (1974–imminent FEMA takeover) is a nutritional supplement salesman who moonlights as a psychotic[3][4] radio shock-jock and a legally certified [5] self-proclaimed "performance artist".[6] His specialty is making up conspiracy theories to amuse his audience (either that or he's the world's best parodist), and is the world's most powerful conspiracy pusher, with his shows drawing millions of views daily.[7] Any time anything interesting happens anywhere on Earth, there's a 100% chance Jones has found "proof" it is either (1) a false flag operation by the New World Order or (2) a "massive coverup operation" run by the New World Order. No exceptions. You would think the white coats would have taken him away in a straightjacket by now New World Order would've eliminated this widely-known bearer of all their secrets, but nope. For some reason they see fit to let him continue. Like all good showmen, you must understand his early work to truly appreciate his art. Jones got his start in 1995 on Access TV in Austin, and first tasted the limelight with Y2K. And he was ready: grunting about the end of money, reporting on millions of deaths worldwide, and shilling for his survivalist shop called "The Hardware Store", with guns, ammo, MREs, and eight-stage water filtration systems.[8][9] And we all awoke on January 1, 2000 to… absolutely nothing.

Most Texans assumed he was done. Then 9/11 swooped in and bailed the charlatan out. Then Obama became the antichrist of choice. (Literally.[10]) Then Trump became Jones' best pal.[11]

In short: Jones has been predicting the end of the world for 24 years. And it gets worse from there. Goat help us all.

Influence [ edit ]

“ ” Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. —Donald Trump to Jones in a 2015 Infowars exclusive interview[12]

Jones is very popular. In March 2017, Jones' YouTube channel (which was an exquisitely entertaining way to kill time) had over 2 million subscribers and 1.21 billion views,[13][7][14] his daily four-hour show aired on more than 60 AM and FM radio stations and drew 2 million listeners per week,[7][14][15] and his two main websites Infowars and PrisonPlanet drew a collective 4 million unique users per month, more than Rush Limbaugh.[15] Jones has also had a cameo appearance in three films[16][17] and numerous talk shows.[7][14] In 2010, he took in revenues of about $1.5 million.[14]

Ironically, many of Jones' theories focus on about how celebrities and the powerful, wealthy elite are conspiring against society.

Conspiracy theories [ edit ]

“ ” I'm like﻿ a I'm like﻿ a chimpanzee , in a tree, jumping up and down, warning other chimpanzees when I see a big cat coming through the woods… I'm the weirdo? Because I'm sitting in﻿ a tree going OOH OOH OOH AAH AAH AAH —Alex Jones, describing his attempts to wake the sheeple[18]

Jones can't fart without blaming a conspiracy of bean producers.[citation NOT needed]

New World Order [ edit ]

See the main article on this topic: New World Order

“ ” worshiping Devil worshiping pedophiles basically run the New World Order. […] They love death and they love killing babies. —Alex Jones[2]

“ ” They've got operations so big, grabbin your kids, they CPS 'em right out, Child Protection Services, they're on a jet, to one of — two dozen countries. And they are roll, just massive, MASSIVE murder operations. They've got operations so big, grabbin your kids, they CPS 'em right out, Child Protection Services,, to one of — two dozen countries. And they are slaved out. And lotta times when they hit 25 years old, they — y'know, 10,000 men have had sex with 'em, they've had 30, 40 abortions , they've been used up in ways that are so hellish you can't even imagine, [slaps table] they just walk 'em right out, shoot 'em in the back of the head, and throw 'em in a vat of acid. That's how they, just, MASSIVE murder operations. —Alex Jones[19]

Jones is the most visible (and literally the LOUDEST) proponent of the grand Unified Conspiracy Theory, where just about every current event can be tied into the NWO's nefarious schemes.[20] According to Jones' broadcasts and various "documentaries", the NWO has its roots in Biblical times and is in part the work of Satan, and later branched out with the inclusion of The Bilderberg Group,[21] Skull and Bones,[22] Freemasons,[23] and Rothschild banking family, and the Illuminati came to power. Since then, things have snowballed into a complete worldwide conspiracy of every government and corporate entity. He adheres to the notion that the NWO will be ruled by the antichrist, who will eventually be defeated by Jesus after the events of the Book of Revelation have taken place.

Frankly, a real NWO transporting him from lunatic asylum to radio show in order to cast doubt on conspiracy theories doesn't seem so crazy. Indeed, some fellow conspiracists believe this to be the case.[24]

For comic relief, Jones' rants about the NWO are interspersed with rants against his ideological kindred, who, by their own account, have organized to fight the NWO: the Islamic jihadis.

List of conspiracist views held by one Mr. Jones [ edit ]

MC Alex Jones: Dropping the hottest conspiracy remix of 2017!

Inside jobs and false flags:

Are occultists: "Every time I've studied the groups that fund and run the atheist, [ sic ] they're not atheist, they're occultist. And I guess if they can't get people to be occultist, they will just get them to be atheist and then atheists almost always become supporters of eugenics and abortion and humans are just blobs and humans don't have any great destiny and humans are a parasite, [ sic ] and you just can't ignore the fruits of these people." [69]

"Every time I've studied the groups that fund and run the atheist, they're not atheist, they're occultist. And I guess if they can't get people to be occultist, they will just get them to be atheist and then atheists almost become supporters of eugenics and abortion and humans are just blobs and humans don't have any great destiny and humans are a parasite, and you just can't ignore the fruits of these people." Worship Satan: "This, this is their religion ! Y'see, you see, at the highest level, the atheists aren't really atheists at the higher levels, they write books, these people worship Lucifer !" [69] "The establishment is always saying you shouldn't have a religion and god isn't real, but then you find out the elites who're saying they're atheists, 9 times out of 10 in my research, they turn out to be a occultist, who are Luciferian or Satanist." [69]

"This, this is their ! Y'see, you see, at the highest level, the atheists aren't really atheists at the higher levels, they write books, these people worship !" "The establishment is always saying you shouldn't have a religion and god isn't real, but then you find out the elites who're saying they're atheists, 9 times out of 10 in my research, they turn out to be a occultist, who are Luciferian or Satanist." Love death: "And they do! They love death! And I'm just in love with life. And I — I'm sorry for those who've never experienced it, y'know, when they laugh at us, all these unhappy atheists and psychologists and psychiatrists that are all out there, talking about how horrible their lives are and their incredible rates of suicide."[69]

"Bezelbub, Baphomet, Leviathan, the devil. He is the devil . Barack Obama is the devil." [71]

. Barack Obama the devil." Apparently, Malia and Sasha are not really Obama's daughters. (He actually had the nerve to say this a few days before his child custody hearing.) [72]

Michelle Obama is apparently transgender. Jones' evidence for this? Simple! Her shoulders are wider than Barack's. Given that males generally have wider shoulders than females the only logical conclusion for one specific woman having broader shoulders than one specific man is that she must be biologically male. Any evidence of her true sex has been wiped off the internet by the New World Order (of course). Why are they so keen to hide this? Well, if people find out that the (now former) first lady is transgender they will do some digging (as if transgender-ism is not being studied by scientists already) and find out the truth! The truth that the government is putting chemicals in the water to feminize men! Luckily you can fight off the process by buying Info Wars Cave Man Formula for only $29.95![73][74]

"Liberal Lesbians": "Most of the so-called 'liberal lesbians' and all these groups, they just wanna have the guy with the ducks ass haircut, and the James Dean outfit. And, sure, James Dean wasn't slapping girls around, but they wanna be the ones slapping the girls around and statistically it shows it. I'm not blaming all lesbians, but it shows that most of these butch lesbians, they wanna be the guy smacking the hot chick around, they think that's manly.

Knock 'em upside their head. And they have 'Fifty Shades of Gray' about the sexy rich guy that's gonna chain you up.

ALEX JONES IS BILL HICKS! Wake up, sheeple!

Why isn't Jones dead? [ edit ]

See the main article on this topic: Shill

Conspirators in control of governments and slavers of entire nations could easily arrange convenient "accidents" for Jones (and others who brazenly expose their schemes).[17] Yet, the, um, "whistle-blowers" tend to remain free to continue hawking their wares. This could cause one to speculate that Jones himself is running a false flag operation in support of the Jewish lizard bankers!

Many of Alex Jones' sheeple fans have argued that if the government were to kill Jones, they would make him a martyr and "expose" themselves. This seems pretty damn odd, given how many people Jones thinks the NWO has already killed. They're already exposed. And considering how remorselessly child-eating these conspirators are, it seems unlikely they could not kill him and make it look like an accident. Unfortunately, this means that, ultimately, should Jones die from anything other than old age (and potentially even if that), his death will be turned into a conspiracy theory. Alternatively, assuming the NWO does exist, the only other plausible reason he is still alive is because he is actually on their payroll, because nothing discredits a conspiracy theory more profoundly than logic and evidence its promotion by a paranoid pantopragmatic.

Another alternative hypothesis is that he's just playing a character, thus being a "performance artist".[84] Of all people, it's his own lawyer, Randall Wilhite, who stated this, to the judge in his custody hearing.[84] Though to counteract his own lawyer's account he subsequently released a video claiming that he was "not a fake".[85]

Most logical of all, "he's not a stable person", according to his ex-wife Kelly, which is why she was demanding custody in the first place.[84] (She eventually did, due to Alex's parental alienation of her children.[86]

Political stance [ edit ]

“ ” I ain't no ho! I ain't no ho! I ain't no ho! I ain't no ho, I ain't no bitch![2][87] I ain't no ho! I ain't no ho! I ain't no ho! I ain't no ho, I ain't no bitch!

Notoriously hard to place ideologically (although clearly located to the right on most topics), Jones' views amount to some kind of high-powered mutant hybrid of libertarianism/​paleoconservatism/​evangelicalism/​neoreaction/​miscellaneous. Because many conspiracy theories he espouses are similar to those passed around on the radical right, he is often lumped in with the conservative talk radio milieu by mainstream sources. This is something of a mischaracterization, as Jones has no discernible political stance aside from all-consuming paranoid rage. He claims the Illuminati controls the world and the "elite" conspirators he says control the world believe they're "contacting interdimensional aliens" through use of the hallucinogenic drug DMT, and believe that "they are being directed by them". Jones says the entities the world-ruling conspirators worship are called "clockwork elves", and that their ultimate goal is to be granted "eternal life" after they "kill everybody".[88]

Jones identifies himself as libertarian, and occasionally, he says something in line with general libertarian principles. In practice, however, his brand usually leans towards paleolibertarianism, especially in his appeals to the traditional values he feels to be under attack by "globalists". According to the Anti-Defamation League, as of 2017, Jones "is not demonstrably anti-Semitic, but frequently expresses his distaste for "globalists", which some consider a dogwhistle term for "Jewish"."[89] However, Jones was subsequently sued by two former employees for violating the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for creating a "disgusting, hostile environment" in the workplace, which allowed anti-Semitic remarks to be directed at a Jewish employee in one suit.[90] In the other suit, Jones was accused of making unwanted sexual advances against another employee, who happens to be an African-American woman.[90]

Jones has far more in common, ideologically and stylistically, with the John Birch Society, the Constitution Party, and the sovereign citizen movement than with Fox News, railing against the neoconservatism and neoliberalism of the Reagan and Bush administrations (lesser and greater alike) just as much as the "commie-fascism" of Bill Clinton and Obama, and proclaiming the entire political mainstream to be in service to the NWO. According to Jones, both Hillary Clinton and Obama are actual demons smelling of sulfur.[10] Obama responded with an endorsement of the RationalWiki mission statement, stating, "We live in a country where flaming nutjobs have massive audiences. We need to laugh at them more."[91] To no one's surprise, Jones is also a fundamentalist Christian.[92]

Jones also has some (but certainly not a huge) amount of following on the far-left. This was especially true during the Bush Jr. administration, where he interviewed figures such as Noam Chomsky and Dennis Kucinich, in addition to the usual who's who of far-right ideologues. This following is likely because in addition to Federal Reserve, global warming, gay agenda,[93] end times prophecy, and United Nations conspiracies, he also covers a number of conspiracy theories more stereotypically associated with left-wingers (remember, everything is a conspiracy to this man), such as 9/11 trutherism, Big Pharma, vaccine denialism, and Monsanto/genetically modified food conspiracies (useless eaters!), all things that put him at odds with many on the right. Because of his belief that these corporations are part of the NWO as well, he promotes all sorts of alternative medicine and nature woo.[note 5] As an article in The New Republic put it, Jones "occup[ies] the shadowy territory where the far-right curves around and meets the far-left."[95] It may be that he appeals more to people who possess crank magnetism than to people of a particular political ideology.

Godfather of fake news [ edit ]

See the main article on this topic: Fake news

“ ” If you believe Alex Jones and his Infowars stuff, then you're being a dick to your brain. You're saying *screw you* to your own brain. —Christopher Rehage[96]

DVDs [ edit ]

Jones is also a prolific filmmaker of direct-to-DVD films on various conspiracy topics, all of which are done in much the same style as his radio program and were available on YouTube or Google Video. Most of these films involve copious amounts of pseudohistory, and go deeper "down the rabbit hole" of the machinations of the NWO, because he knows the truth. As well as his own productions, Jones has appeared as an interviewee in the The Fall of America and the Western World.

Infowars [ edit ]

“ ” The name's easy to remember. Just imagine information, and someone at war with it. —Stephen Colbert[99]

The fake news website Infowars is Jones' Internet home; even the advertisements link to more conspiracy theories.[100] The site is quite popular, with an Alexa ranking of 4200 as of July 2018.[101] Much like NaturalNews, citing Infowars in an argument usually means you are completely wrong, or you may be so off that your view is literally beyond wrong, yet everyone on YouTube does it.[102]

The site appears to push anti-science and apocalyptic views. For example, it once claimed the number of volcanoes erupting was massively over average, the planet was becoming less "stable", and much of the world had entered into a time of immense earthquakes and scientists don't know why.[103] (All this despite that no such increase occurred.[104])

Recently, the site seems to be trying to push its way into the manosphere and the Stormfront crowd, with contributor Paul Joseph Watson constantly posting anti-woman ravings[105] and race-baiting articles[106][107][108][109] (including typical asshattery about white genocide[110][111][112][113][114][115][116]). Gold buggery is also incredibly common, as to be expected.[117] In other economic concerns, they follow the policy of "predict a collapse every day and it'll happen eventually"[118] so much that their economic news section is not called the typical "money" section, but is instead titled "Economic Crisis".

One Infowars contributor argued that mandatory viewing in public schools of the acclaimed historical biopic 12 Years a Slave was a tactic to "control children in government internment camps — also known as public schools" and to promote "self-destructive tribalism".[119]

The only time something with any relative truth appears on Infowars is when they post articles from the mainstream media,[120] who is supposedly in on the whole conspiracy Jones pushes, so much that any episode of Infowars is not complete without a take-down of the "lamestream media".

The Infowars Shop[121] sells his DVDs for just $20 each! And if you want your friends to know just how much more aware you are than them, you can buy T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other knick-knacks.

On the bright side, it had an excellent parody website named TruthBang.net, though now defunct.

PrisonPlanet [ edit ]

PrisonPlanet consists of the purest, locally-grown, truth-free bullshit

Jones operates another fake news website named PrisonPlanet, which takes an almost overwhelmingly negative stance towards all recent presidents and regards all government and corporations with a suspicious and twitching eye. While the latter is not necessarily a bad thing in itself, PrisonPlanet goes beyond healthy skepticism to a mind-boggling extreme; you'll soon find that PrisonPlanet takes everything to mind-boggling extremes. The bulk of the site is made up of conspiracy-related stories and advertisements hawking the kinds of products valued by keen conspiracy theorists.

Jones relies on the paranoia of a dystopian future and promotes it through PrisonPlanet's blog, his radio show, and his online store. The blog features articles that instill fear of vaccination,[122] promote conspiracy theories (see list below), and support alternative medicine,[123][124] because the big bad drug companies want your money and to keep you addicted. Unlike before, the site does not push white genocide conspiracy theories (sans once[125]), but the forums are rife with it.[126] Very little of this is actually based in reality, and in most cases, small statements of truth are projected into full-blown paranoia.

Jones can't just give you his theories; he needs lots of money to impart his nuggets of wisdom to you. There are two ways to acquire his poorly-researched, unrealistic, and paranoid delusions: burned DVDs or streamed online. He also sells books which, in a normal bookstore, would be catalogued under fiction. The second option requires a subscription to prisonplanet.tv for $5.95 per month or $54.95 per year. What a deal!

The website had an Alexa ranking in the 5000s, meaning it was a reasonably popular site. (Now, it's tanked to about 30,000 to 40,000, circa 2016-2017).[127] Advertising tends to be targeted, in the sense that adverts attract more responses if they're relevant to the people reading them. For example, water purification systems and handguns are not typically advertised on websites aimed at young girls, but would be far more successful if aimed at paranoid survivalists huddling in caves waiting for FEMA to come and steal their precious bodily fluids.

Typical advertisements [ edit ]

“ ” If a website is touting the benefits of a certain supplement that they also happen to be conveniently selling, guess what, idiot? The article was written to sell you a product. You're reading an ad. Speaking of InfoWars is one of the worst offenders. They pretend to be the arbiters of some supposed truth, while Alex Jones bloviates every week about some supposed government takeover that he keeps promising will happen year after year. They're coming for your: guns, property, liberty. They're always coming, but never here.

On Thursday August 26, 2010, the following adverts appeared on the front page of Prison Planet:[129]

A Scanner Darkly [ edit ]

For some reason, the people behind A Scanner Darkly — that weird cartoon/real life science fiction flick from 2006 — decided to cast Alex Jones in one scene - this is due to the fact that at that time Jones was friends with the film's director/writer Richard Linklater. It's one of his only roles in a non-Alex Jones production, but he still just plays the same ol' lunatic. This is one case where the actor really does fit the character. Plus, he gets tazed in the butt by the Thought Police. What's not to love?

Other dubious achievements [ edit ]

Alex Jones on Russian TV with Aleksandr Dugin, a Russian white nationalist . The caption reads, "Alex Jones: Trump's secret weapon". This definitely isn't proof that Alex Jones is a Russian disinfo merchant or anything, no. We're just asking questions , like, is Alex Jones a Russian disinformation merchant?

Jones is a recipient of the James Randi Educational Foundation's 2013 Pigasus Award for his "accomplishments" in promoting political conspiracy theories and quack medical treatments.[133] He also attempted to initiate a public pissing contest argument with fellow loudmouth media figure Bill O'Reilly over a graphic on The O'Reilly Factor, which put the words "Hate Speech" next to a photo of Jones. Jones' apparent solution was to stage a pay-for-view boxing match between himself and O'Reilly, which, if it happens, might be the only time both contestants end up forfeiting because of cardiac issues before the match even begins.[134]

On June 9, 2013, Jones was interviewed by the normally calm BBC News correspondent Andrew Neil over his appearance at the Bilderberg conference protests. Jones took the opportunity to shout and scream numerous conspiracy theory bullet points, and repeatedly mentioned the address of his website. Towards the end of the interview, Neil sternly said, "You are the worst person I have ever interviewed." Afterwards, Jones shouted, "INFOWARSDOTCOM! Liberty is rising! Liberty is rising! Freedom will not stop! You will not stop freedom! You will not stop the republic! Humanity is awakening!" During Jones' rant, Neil turned to the camera and deadpanned, "We have an idiot on the program today."[135] [136]

Jones also appeared on Piers Morgan's program on CNN to rant, rave, and carry on on the topic of gun violence, drawing allusions to Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, because they thought a mass removal of guns would happen in America. He also plugged his petition to deport Piers because of his issues with the Second Amendment and called him "a hatchet man of the New World Order". He was unable to answer a simple question about gun related deaths in the US vs. the UK. As a form of admission to defeat in the ensuing "debate", Jones ended the interview by mocking Piers' distinctive speech patterns by speaking in a cheesy, phoney-baloney English accent.[137]

Jones was also responsible for the creation of a truly awful science fiction meme on his show by insisting the joint US-Russia plan to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control was, in fact, part of a cunning plan to kill off the human race and replace it with cyborgs.[138]

In December 2013, Alex Jones announced he would be boycotting the NFL because of its decision to ban a commercial submitted by a rifle manufacturer at the 2014 Super Bowl.[139]

Infowars has a German website which translates some English articles into German, and has an article archive tracing back until 2006. [140] Its most read article is "Das Geheimnis der Zitrone" ("The secret of the lemon"), an article that claims lemon is 10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy ("Es ist 10.000-mal stärker als Chemotherapie.").[141]

While director Richard Linklater considers the fellow Texan a friend (even giving Jones cameos in his films Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly, where he essentially plays himself[17]), Linklater has disavowed Jones' innumerable conspiracy theories[142], but Linklater also admits to distributing Infowars-produced 9/11 Truther material to actors like Bruce Willis.[143]

The pilot episode of the 2016 revival of The X-Files features an eerily familiar Alex-Jones-a-like attempting to blow the whistle on a government/alien conspiracy in conjunction with Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.[144] The show creator agrees with parts of Jones' conspiracist worldview.[145]

As of 2017, Infowars, as well as Breitbart and other right-wing news websites, are reportedly under FBI investigation for a possible role in colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[146] In response to the investigation, Jones said, "I'm not gonna sit here and say, 'I'm not a Russian stooge,' because it's a fucking lie."[146] Jones also admitted to being on RT News "probably 100 times or more."[146]

In late April 2017, Alex Jones seems to have pulled a Rush Limbaugh and lost custody of his children... notably for being severely unstable. According to his lawyer, Jones was just acting as a character on Infowars, but during the trial, Jones stated (unsolicited and apropos to nothing in the trail) that George Soros was personally behind making marijuana more potent. Jones was also repeatedly reprimanded by the judge for making obvious gestures and facial expressions directed toward the opposing council and jury.[147] During the trial, it was revealed that Jones was formally diagnosed with Narcissistic personality disorder (a clinical term for egomania), which is characterized by feelings of entitlement, grandiose sense of self, a deep need for admiration and a lack of empathy for other people. His pathological narcissism is such that he sabotaged his own legal team by openly undermining his own defense's claims that he is not as crazy in real life as he is on his show.[148]

In the more bizarre news, Alex Jones was hounded by a neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer, for allegedly having a Jewish wife and not being anti-semitic enough. Seriously.[149]

The Alex Avalanche [ edit ]

You may not like it, but this is what peak anti-globalist performance looks like.

The Alex Avalanche is a particular debating style common to Jones; in fact, it's the only rhetorical technique he ever employs. The Avalanche is similar to the Gish Gallop, wherein the interviewee completely dominates the discussion, not allowing the interviewer, or any other panel members, an opportunity to interject and add their own thoughts or opinions. The Alex Avalanche is the Gish Gallop on meth, as it involves screaming, wild gesticulations, crying, loud grunting, flop sweat and generally throwing a tantrum befitting Jones' overdeveloped-baby-like appearance.

The phrase was coined following Jones' antics during his appearance on the BBC's Sunday Politics, where he ranted non-stop about the Bilderberg Group and how they were behind the implementation of the Euro, which was somehow originally a Nazi plot.[150] Meanwhile, on Alex Jones' Facebook page, his supporters complained about his poor treatment on the show and that he wasn't given time to "explain himself", apparently blind to the fact that the man was given ample time because he didn't shut up for five minutes.[151] The tirade was a simple repeat of his performance against Piers Morgan on the subject of gun control.[152]

Crumbling empire [ edit ]

In response to the ongoing 2018 lawsuit against Jones by parents of the Sandy Hook massacre as well as accusations of Jones using hate speech, several media platforms barred or greatly restricted his presence, including Facebook, Apple, YouTube, and Spotify Stitcher.[153][154] Paypal later followed suit and banned Infowars and related sites, stating that Paypal "found instances that promoted hate or discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions, which run counter to our core value of inclusion."[155]

Fellow-Texan Ted Cruz bravely came to Jones' defense by grossly botching a paraphrase of the Martin Niemöller poem against persecution and anti-semitism; Cruz's rendition was, "As the poem goes, you know, first they came for Alex Jones. That does not end well".[154]

Although Jones claims that he's being censored,[156] he apparently ignored or forgot to read the terms of service that appear on his own Infowars website:

“ ” You will not post anything libelous, defamatory, harmful, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful,

…

Remember: you are a guest here. It is not censorship if you violate the rules and your post is deleted. You will not post anything libelous, defamatory, harmful, threatening, harassing, abusive, invasive of another's privacy racially or ethnically objectionable , or otherwise illegal.Remember: you are a guest here. It is not censorship if you violate the rules and your post is deleted. —Infowars[157]

In 2019, Facebook banned Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, and Infowars and four other individuals (Louis Farrakhan, Paul Nehlen, Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer) as "dangerous individuals and organizations".[158][159]

Guests [ edit ]

Surprisingly, Jones has managed to get a number of high-profile guests on his show (and, not so surprisingly, a lot of high-profile nutters), including:

In a nutshell [ edit ]

He's dumb

He's ridiculous

And he's selling you something
