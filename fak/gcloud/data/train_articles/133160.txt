Islamberg, New York
Hamlet in New York, United States

Islamberg (Arabic: إسلامبيرج‎) is a rural hamlet and religious community in the town of Tompkins, Delaware County, New York.[1]

History [ edit ]

Islamberg was settled by a group of mostly black Muslim families in the 1980s,[2] who sought to escape the troubles of New York City.[3] The group was inspired by Sufi Cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani and sought a more "peaceful and holy Muslim life".[4][5] Islamberg has a population of about 200,[2] along with its own grocery store, bookstore, and school.[3] The community serves as the headquarters of Muslims of America, which seeks to promote an understanding of Islam.[6]

Public safety [ edit ]

Although relations with neighboring communities are cooperative,[5] Islamberg has repeatedly faced threats and persecution – much of it originating from false right-wing conspiracy theories spread online.[7] Right-wing groups have claimed that Islamberg is a training center for terrorists, a claim which local law enforcement and state police investigators say is entirely untrue.[6]

In November 2015, Jon Ritzheimer, of Phoenix, Arizona, made news for threatening an attack on Islamberg.[8] In June 2017, a Tennessee man, Robert Doggart, was sentenced to almost 20 years in prison for plotting an attack on Islamberg.[9][10] In January 2019, three men and one male minor were arrested for plotting an attack on Islamberg with explosives.[11][12][13] Police found 23 firearms and three homemade bombs that investigators claim were going to be used to attack the hamlet.[14]
