What does BleachBit do?

BleachBit achieves two related goals. First, BleachBit removes junk files to make more room. Second, BleachBit removes private information like a virtual shredder.

BleachBit specializes in a "surgical" approach that deletes wanted information. While it does not delete software such as the operating system or web browsers, it deletes specific information produced by software. Contrasted with physical destruction of the storage device or whole-disk erasure, this method is more convenient because that other software can be used immediately without needing to be reinstalled.

BleachBit is neither a chemical nor a physical device. BleachBit is an anti-forensics software application.

The wiping process is permanent and not reversible.

BleachBit allows non-technical users to clean their systems, while it is also convenient and useful for technical users. See also the features page.

Who uses BleachBit?

BleachBit is a tool that different kinds of people use for different purposes. BleachBit has legitimate uses such as recovering disk space on a cluttered drive, system optimization, and personal privacy.
