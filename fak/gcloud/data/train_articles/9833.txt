NEVADA REPUBLICAN PARTY FILES ETHICS COMPLAINT AGAINST CONGRESSWOMAN JACKY ROSEN FOR USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO PRODUCE A CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL





LAS VEGAS - The Nevada Republican Party (NVGOP) filed an ethics complaint today against Jacky Rosen’s campaign for using tax dollars to pay for Rosen's most recent television commercial.





On June 25, Congresswoman Rosen traveled to the southern border in Texas. Pictures from her congressional office’s Twitter account and press release were then used for a campaign ad released on July 5 . This is a clear violation of the law, which prohibits tax dollars from being used for political campaigns.





The NVGOP hopes the ethics investigation will give voters answers to a number of important questions, including whether any of Rosen's campaign staff accompanied her on the trip, whose idea it was to use official resources for a political campaign commercial, and whether the campaign decided to do the commercial before or after her trip.





Jacky Rosen herself understands the problem with using taxpayer dollars for a campaign.





In a press release announcing her No Free Campaigns for Congress Act, Rosen said, “Members of Congress should be using their office budgets to fight for their constituents and serve the people they represent, not help themselves get re-elected.”





Too bad she doesn’t practice what she preaches.





“ Congresswoman Jacky Rosen needs to refund the taxpayer dollars spent shooting her campaign’s commercial,” said Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael J. McDonald. “We look forward to the results of this investigation because Nevadans deserve answers before they vote in November. ”
