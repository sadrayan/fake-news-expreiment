Hi Mr. Selby,

My name is Deke Arndt from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. I received a question through our public affairs professionals.

We base our reports and analysis on the NOAA dataset curated here in Asheville. According to the dataset, we've had 401 consecutive months that were, at least nominally, warmer than the 20th century average.

Thanks

Deke

How would you explain why other researchers – in England and at Berkeley Earth – landed up with fewer straight months of record-high temperatures? What’s the methodological contrast?

I believe they are referring to different datasets.

Thanks

Of course; how would you briefly describe the distinctions?

In the datasets or in how they define streaks? I'm not sure I'm following you here.

I don't know how they define streaks.

We use the NOAAGlobalTemp in our reports. Its basic construction is laid out here, and in the peer-reviewed articles referenced therein. I can't speak authoritatively to the other datasets, as we do not incorporate them in our monthly analyses.
