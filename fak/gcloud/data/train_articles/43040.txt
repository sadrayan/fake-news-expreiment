Transnational Legal Clinic

Students engage in the direct representation of clients and organizations in international human rights and immigration proceedings in the Transnational Legal Clinic, Penn Law’s international human rights and immigration clinic.

Since its founding in 2006, students have represented individuals seeking asylum and other forms of immigration relief from across the globe and have worked alongside and on behalf of international human rights and community-based organizations before regional and international human rights mechanisms on a range of rights-based issues, particularly as they relate to migrants and internally-displaced persons.

In recognition of International Migrants Day on December 18th, a day designated by the United Nations to celebrate the role of the migrant and to promote the protection of the rights of migrant workers and their families, the Transnational Legal Clinic released “Isolated by Force: Denying Migrant Farmworkers Access to Services.”
