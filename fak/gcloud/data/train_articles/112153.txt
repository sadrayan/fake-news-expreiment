"At best, he would be confused by Donald Trump and the way he's running the campaign. I don't think he'd be appreciative of the demeaning style of Donald Trump — the way he's treated the other candidates — because my father knew that at the end of the day he had to bring everyone together to win an election," Reagan said on "The Cats Roundtable" radio program Sunday.

"It should be the easiest slam dunk on the planet [to beat Clinton]. I think what hurts Trump is himself. He's got to rise above it. He's got to talk to people other than his base he's been speaking to all through the process. If he can do that, he can win," Reagan said.

He also criticized the Department of Justice's decision not to prosecute Clinton for her use of a personal email server while secretary of State.

"At some point people have to be responsible for even the non-intended consequences of what they're doing. It seems like the Clintons are never held to that kind of standard," Reagan said.
