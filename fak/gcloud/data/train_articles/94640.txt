How it Works

You may visit any authorized provider. >>Find a Doctor

Your provider files your claims with Medicare.

Medicare pays its portion and sends the claim to the TRICARE For Life claims processor. >>View what Medicare pays

TRICARE For Life then pays the provider directly for TRICARE-covered services.

You won't receive a TRICARE wallet card, all you need is your Medicare card and military ID as proof of coverage.

You can get care at military hospitals and clinics, but only if space is available. >>Find a Military Hospital or Clinic

What You Pay

You don't pay any enrollment fees, but you must pay Medicare Part B monthly premiums. Your Part B premium is based on your income.
