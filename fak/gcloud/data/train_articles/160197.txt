Karen Pence Works at School That Bans Gay Employees and Students
Second Lady Karen Pence has recently started a new job at Immanuel Christian School, a Northern Virginia private school that requires faculty to pledge not to engage in “homosexual” activity and refuses entry to students who even condone “homosexual” relations. For her new job teaching art twice a week, Pence would have also been required to pledge not to violate the “unique roles of male and female,” according to the school's employment application. The school also believes “marriage unites one man and one woman” and that the “wife is commanded to submit to her husband as the church submits to Christ.” Cohabitation before marriage, premarital sex, and transgender identity are reportedly considered “misconduct” by school authorities. The form also reportedly prompts applicants to explain their stance on the “creation/evolution debate.” Pence reportedly worked for the school for 12 years while her husband was in Congress.
