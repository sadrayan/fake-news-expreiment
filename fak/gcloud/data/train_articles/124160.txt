Medicare costs will likely see steep hike
Did you receive your Medicare Handbook for 2015? Please turn to page 12 and go down to the bottom of the page and read "Find out what you pay for Medicare (Part A and Part B). It states that the premium and deductible amounts were not available at the time of printing. It further states you may call 1-800-633-4227 to get the most up-to-date info.

I did just that and talked with a Medicare representative. She told me that they probably would not have those figures in until the end of the first week or possibly the second week of November. Now, let that sink in ...

As soon as she stated that to me I replied, "My, isn't that convenient for them to actually hold off on those figures until after the 2014 election results." There was dead silence on the other end of the line. I told her thank you and that I would call back.

I may be wrong, but I really think that I am right.

You see, on our Social Security increase for next year we are only receiving an increase of 1.7 percent. You can bet after the Nov. 4 election, the increases for Medicare A & B will be greater than 1.7 percent. That is why they are delaying what the increases will be.
