BREAKING: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Demands Welfare For 1,000,000 Illegals In Exchange For Wall
Democrats have proved since they moved into the House of Representatives that they are just a bunch of whiny children. The Leftists in Congress have come up with some wacky schemes to prevent President Trump from building his wall, but 2020 presidential candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “final offer for Donald Trump” is so off the wall that we need to talk about it.

“I have a final offer for Donald Trump if he wants his wall so bad,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We will give him $2.7 billion for his wall if he grants amnesty to 1,000,000 impoverished undocumented immigrants and gives them access to food stamps and other benefits they earn the right to use.”

“Illegal immigrants pay into social security and pay taxes and never can collect under the current system,” she added. “It’s time for that to change. It’s time for us to be better.”

“There is no threat to our south,” she concluded. “There are no rapists and drug dealers. The only threat is sitting in the Oval Office waiting for us to remove it by any means necessary.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s comments drew applause from Democrats, most notably Nancy Pelosi, who yelled: “you go girl!” Republicans were unimpressed, however.

Mitch McConnell spoke out against these remarks, pointing out that Ocasio-Cortez, whose parents illegally brought her across the border when she was a baby, “wasn’t even born in America” and “can’t even become President.”

“I don’t know why she is posturing for a White House run,” he said. “She can’t legally become President.”
