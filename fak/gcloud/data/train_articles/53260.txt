I am Buzz Aldrin, engineer, American astronaut, and the second person to walk on the moon during the Apollo 11 moon landing. AMA! : IAmA
I am hoping to be designated a lunar ambassador along with all the 24 living or deceased crews who have reached the moon. In the meantime, I like to be known as a global space statesman.

This July 20th is the 45th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Everywhere in the world that I visit, people tell me stories of where they were the day that Neil Armstrong and I walked on the moon.

Today, we are launching a social media campaign which includes a YouTube Channel, #Apollo45. This is a channel where you can share your story, your parents', your grandparents', or your friends' stories of that moment and how it inspires you, with me and everyone else who will be watching.

I do hope you consider joining in. Please follow along at youtube.com/Apollo45.

Victoria from reddit will be assisting me today. Ask me anything.

Edit: Be careful what you dream of, it just may happen to you. Anyone who dreams of something, has to be prepared. Thank you!
