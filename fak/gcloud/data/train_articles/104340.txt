>At the Canadian Nutrition Society’s annual conference in Halifax in May, a bright orange booth seemed out of place to nutritional biochemist Dylan MacKay. It was for a group calling itself the Canadian Juice Council. “I’d never seen or heard of them before,” Dr. MacKay said. “And I’ve been going to CNS conferences for years.”

>A few months later, in Southwestern Ontario, a letter to the editor in the Waterloo Region Record responded to an opinion column about proposed changes to Canada’s Food Guide, and in particular, signs that the guide would remove fruit juice as a substitute for whole fruits. The letter, signed by the Canadian Juice Council, defended juice as part of “a healthy, balanced diet.” A similar letter also began arriving in the inboxes of Canadian senators.

>Beyond those instances, there are few traces of the Canadian Juice Council, whose Twitter page has just one follower. Although its website was created in July, 2017, groups approached by The Globe and Mail, including the Stroke Foundation, said they’d never heard of the CJC.

>And no wonder. The Juice Council doesn’t exist in the way you might expect: as an institution disseminating impartial facts and information about juice.
