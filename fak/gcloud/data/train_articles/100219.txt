Give me a hand! Macabre human butchery shop established in Smithfield Market (but don't worry, it's just a stunt)



Rows of body parts on sale may look like a scene out of a horror film, but they were on offer this weekend at London's famous meat market Smithfield.



But cannibalism is not suddenly legal - the butchers was actually an elaborate publicity stunt, designed to promote the release of the new video game Resident Evil 6.

And although they may have looked eerily realistic, the feet and hands, thigh steaks and racks of ribs were actually fashioned from meat.

Impressive stunt: Meat created to look like a human arm

Grim service: The butcher stands behind the counter to serve the gory offerings

Realistic: The meat is eerily realistic in relation to human body parts
