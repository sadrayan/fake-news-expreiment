ILEARN helps you learn! The primary goal of education is to assist children in learning. ILEARN (Illinois Local Education Agency Retrieval Network) was created to provide information on how the business of education is conducted. By using ILEARN you can access information about a specific county, a certain school district, region or area within the state. ILEARN gives you one easy location to navigate rather than searching the web. With ILEARN you can compare your child’s school district to a similar district or region of the state. You can gain an understanding of the mystifying world of school finance by entering a few simple keystrokes. ILEARN’s purpose truly is to help you learn about the education system within Illinois as we work toward making Illinois education Second to None.
