These days Mr. Nye hosts a series on Netflix – Bill Nye Saves the World. The other day – he pondered this question – should people be penalized for having extra kids.

Travis Rieder, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University, told Mr. Nye it was a good idea.

“I do think that we should at least consider it,” he said.

“Well, ‘at least consider it’ is like ‘do it,’” Nye replied.

Their theory is that big American families are hurting the environment.

“One of the things that we could do that’s kind of (at) least policy-ish is we could encourage our culture and our norms to change, right?” Rieder said.

It’s one of the most repulsive things I’ve heard in a long time – downright despicable – evil scientist stuff.

Just who gets to decide how many children is too many? And who determines which child is the extra child?

I also wonder what Mr. Nye would consider to be an appropriate punishment? Additional taxes? Post-Birth abortions?

Is it possible that families like the Brady Bunch and the Walton's could one day be outlawed?

It’s frightening to imagine a nation where parents are punished for having what the left considers too many babies.

I thought liberals wanted the government out of our bedrooms – but now they want to deputize government agents to police American baby-making.

Perhaps Netflix should consider producing a new television program – Bill Nye the Eugenics Guy.
