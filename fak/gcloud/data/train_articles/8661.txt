The commissioner and the wage board in establishing a minimum fair wage, shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence or procedure, but may consider all relevant circumstances affecting the value of the service or class of service rendered; may consider the wages paid in the State for work of like or comparable character by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum fair wage standards; and may be guided by like considerations as would guide a court in a suit for the reasonable value of services rendered at the request of the employer without agreement as to amount of wages to be paid.

12:56-1.7 Discharge or discrimination against employee making complaint



(a) An employer is a disorderly person, if he or she discharges or in any other manner discriminates against any employee because such employee has made any complaint to his or her employer or to the Commissioner that he or she has not been paid wages in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or because such employee has caused to be instituted or is about to cause to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or because such employee has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding, or because such employee has served or is about to serve on a wage board, and shall be guilty of a disorderly persons offense and shall, upon conviction therefor, be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000. Such employer shall be required, as a condition of such judgment of conviction, to offer reinstatement in employment to any such discharged employee and to correct any such discriminatory action, and also to pay to any such employee in full, all wages lost as a result of such discharge or discriminatory action, under penalty of contempt proceedings for failure to comply with such requirement.



(b) As an alternative to, or in addition to, any sanctions imposed under (a) above, the Commissioner is authorized under N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a24 to assess and collect administrative penalties as provided for in N.J.A.C. 12:56-1.3.

(a) Many employees, particularly in offices, are on a fixed working schedule from which they seldom vary. In these instances, the employer may keep a record showing the exact schedule of daily and weekly work hours that the employee is expected to follow and merely indicate each workweek that the schedule was followed.

SUBCHAPTER 5. HOURS WORKED



12:56-5.1 Payment



Employees entitled to the benefits of the act shall be paid for all hours worked.



Back to top



12:56-5.2 Computation



(a) All the time the employee is required to be at his or her place of work or on duty shall be counted as hours worked.



(b) Nothing in this chapter requires an employer to pay an employee for hours the employee is not required to be at his or her place of work because of holidays, vacation, lunch hours, illness and similar reasons.



Back to top



12:56-5.3 Accounting for irregular hours of resident employees



Employees who reside on the employer's premises and whose hours worked are irregular and intermittent to the extent that it is not feasible to account for the hours actually on duty may be compensated for not less than eight hours for each day on duty in lieu of any other applicable provisions.



Back to top



12:56-5.4 Workweek construed



(a) A workweek shall be a regularly recurring period of 168 hours in the form of seven consecutive 24-hour periods.



(b) The workweek need not be the same as the calendar week and may begin any day of the week and any hour of the day.



(c) The workweek shall be designated to the employee in advance.



(d) Once the beginning time of an employee's workweek is established, it remains fixed regardless of the schedule of the hours worked.



(e) The beginning of the workweek may be changed if the change is intended to be permanent and is not intended to evade the overtime requirements of the act.



Back to top



12:56-5.5 Reporting for work



(a) An employee who by request of the employer reports for duty on any day shall be paid for at least one hour at the applicable wage rate, except as provided in (b) below.



(b) The provisions of (a) above shall not apply to an employer when he or she has made available to the employee the minimum number of hours of work agreed upon by the employer and the employed prior to the commencement of work on the day involved.



Back to top



12:56-5.6 On-call time



(a) When employees are not required to remain on the employer's premises and are free to engage in their own pursuits, subject only to the understanding that they leave word at their home or with the employer where they may be reached, the hours shall not be considered hours worked. When an employee does go out on an on-call assignment, only the time actually spent in making the call shall be counted as hours worked.



(b) If calls are so frequent or the "on-call" conditions so restrictive that the employees are not really free to use the intervening periods effectively for their own benefit, they may be considered as "engaged to wait" rather than "waiting to be engaged". In that event, the waiting time shall be counted as hours worked.



Back to top



12:56-5.7 On-call employees required to remain at home



"On-call" employees may be required by their employer to remain at their homes to receive telephone calls from customers when the company office is closed. If "on-call" employees have long periods of uninterrupted leisure during which they can engage in the normal activities of living, any reasonable agreement of the parties for determining the number of hours worked shall be accepted. The agreement shall take into account not only the actual time spent in answering the calls but also some allowance for the restriction on the employee's freedom to engage in personal activities resulting from the duty of answering the telephone.



Back to top



12:56-5.8 Use of time clocks



(a) Differences between clock records and actual hours worked. Time clocks are not required. In those cases where time clocks are used, employees who voluntarily come in before their regular starting time or remain after their closing time, do not have to be paid for such periods provided, of course, that they do not engage in any work. Their early or late clock punching may be disregarded. Minor differences between the clock records and actual hours worked cannot ordinarily be avoided, but major discrepancies should be discouraged since they raise a doubt as to the accuracy of the records of the hours actually worked.



(b) "Rounding" practices. It has been found that in some industries, particularly where time clocks are used, there has been the practice for many years of recording the employees' starting time and stopping time to the nearest 5 minutes, or to the nearest 1/10 or quarter of an hour. Presumably, this arrangement averages out, so that the employees are fully compensated for all the time they actually work. For enforcement purposes this practice of computing working time will be accepted, provided that it is used in such a manner that it will not result, over a period of time, in failure to compensate the employees properly for all the time they have actually worked.

SUBCHAPTER 6. OVERTIME



12:56-6.1 Rate of overtime payment



For each hour of working time in excess of 40 hours in any week, except for those exemptions set forth in N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a4 or as provided in N.J.A.C. 12:56-7.1, every employer shall pay to each of his or her employees, wages at a rate of not less than 1 1/2 times such employee's regular hourly wage.



Back to top



12:56-6.2 Computation



(a) Overtime and minimum wage pay shall be computed on the basis of each workweek standing alone.



(b) Hours shall not be averaged over two or more workweeks.



Back to top



12:56-6.3 Actual wage basis



Covered employees shall be entitled to overtime pay based upon their actual wages and not the specified minimum wages.



Back to top



12:56-6.4 Workweek hours



(a) Covered employees shall be paid 1 1/2 times the regular hourly wage for each hour of working time in excess of 40 hours in any workweek.



(b) There is no requirement that an employee be paid premium overtime compensation for hours in excess of eight hours per day, nor for work on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays or regular days of rest, other than the required overtime for over 40 hours per week; provided, however, nothing shall relieve an employer of any obligation he or she may have assumed by contract or of any obligation imposed by other State or Federal law limiting overtime hours of work or to pay premium rates for work which are in excess of the minimum required by this chapter.



Back to top



12:56-6.5 "Regular hourly wage" payment basis



(a) The "regular hourly wage" is a rate per hour.



(b) The act does not require employers to compensate employees on an hourly rate basis. Their earnings may be determined on a piece-rate, salary, bonus, commission or other basis, but the overtime compensation due to employees shall be paid on the basis of the hourly rate derived therefrom. Therefore, the regular hourly wage of an employee is determined by dividing his or her total remuneration for employment, exclusive of overtime premium pay, in any workweek, by the total number of hours worked in that workweek for which such compensation was paid.



(c) If an employee is remunerated solely on the basis of a single hourly rate, the hourly rate shall be his or her "regular hourly wage".



Back to top



12:56-6.6 Items excluded from "regular hourly wage"



(a) The "regular hourly wage" shall not be deemed to include:

Payments in the nature of gifts made on holidays or on other special occasions or as a reward for service, the amounts of which are not measured by or dependent on hours worked, production or efficiency; Payments made for occasional periods when no work is performed due to vacation, holiday or other similar cause; Reasonable payments for traveling or other expenses incurred by an employee in the furtherance of his or her employer's interests and properly reimbursable by the employer which are not made as compensation for employment; Sums paid in recognition of services performed during a given period if either:

i. Both the fact that payment is to be made and the amount of payment are determined at the sole discretion of the employer at or near the end of the period and not pursuant to any prior contract, agreement or promise causing the employee to expect such payments regularly; or



ii. The payments are made pursuant to a bona fide profit-sharing plan or trust, or thrift or savings plan to the extent to which the amounts paid to the employee are determined without regard to hours of work, production or efficiency; or



Contributions irrevocably made by an employer to a trustee or third person pursuant to a bona fide plan providing for old age, retirement, life, accident, or health insurance or similar benefits for employees; or Additional premium compensation for hours worked in excess of eight hours per day, or for work on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or regular days of rest; or Overtime premiums.

Back to top



12:56-6.7 Offsets; cash payments



(a) Overtime premium payments shall not be offset by allowances for the value of food, lodging or gratuities since such allowances are already considered in determining the straight time wages paid. Overtime premium payments shall be cash payments by the employer.



(b) Where the employee's pay includes the value of gratuities, food or lodging and it is not feasible to determine the exact regular hourly wage during a particular week, the employer shall be deemed to have fulfilled the overtime requirements of this chapter if the premium payment for the overtime hours is paid in cash on the basis of the agreed hourly wage, but in no event shall the premium payment be at a rate less than the applicable minimum rate.

(b) "Gratuity" means cash received by an employee for services rendered for an employer or customer of an employer.



Back to top

Back to top



12:56-8.3 Determining cash gratuities



(a) In determining the cash gratuities actually received by an employee, the following methods shall be evidentiary value:

Statements, including United States Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, "Employee's Report on Tips", that are furnished by an employee to an employer; Amounts indicated on customer billing, credit card invoices or other customer charge accounts wherein there is an indicated service charge or gratuity designated for the employee and payable to the employee.

Back to top



12:56-8.4 Administrative handling of gratuities



(a) Provided there is an agreement in advance with the employees, the employer, in order to facilitate the administrative handling of gratuity allowances, may establish an average value of gratuities received by an employee based upon a percentage of gross sales apportioned on basis of hours worked among the employees being tipped. This portion shall be:

Derived from a representative sampling of the sources indicated in N.J.A.C. 12:56-8.3; or Ten percent; or Such other method as may be agreed upon subject to the approval of the Commissioner.

(b) Gratuities shall be the property of the tipped employee. Gratuities shall be restored to the tipped employee except when gratuities are pooled, voluntarily by the employees or as a policy of management.



Back to top



12:56-8.5 Additional cash contribution claim



In no event shall N.J.A.C. 12:56-6.4 and 6.5 be interpreted to deny to an employee the right to make claim for additional cash compensation where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the actual amount of tips received was less than the amount determined by the employer.



Back to top



12:56-8.6 Fair value computed



(a) Except whenever any determination made by regulation is applicable, the fair value to the employer of furnishing the employee with food and lodging is the cost of operation and maintenance including adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance for interest on the depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer.



(b) The fair value so computed shall not exceed the rental value of comparable facilities in the State.



(c) The cost of operation and maintenance, the rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer shall be arrived at in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices.



(d) Generally accepted accounting practices shall not include those rejected by the New Jersey Division of Taxation or the Federal Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes, and the term "depreciation" includes obsolescence.



(e) Items found to be primarily for the benefit of the employer shall not be included in the cost.



(f) Lodging furnished which is in violation of any Federal, State, or local law, ordinance or prohibition shall be valued at nothing.



(g) When a fair market value does not exist for rental of the lodging in the competitive open market, the fair market value shall be zero.



Back to top



12:56-8.7 Inspection of fair value methods



Methods of determining fair value shall be subject to inspection and approval by the Commissioner.



Back to top



12:56-8.8 Method of determining "fair value"



The following is an example of a method of determining fair value:



Employer "A" has three employees who are furnished food and lodging in addition to gross cash wages of $2.50 per hour. The cost of food purchased for the employees is $72.00 total a week. The building housing the employees cost $36,000 in 1978 and subsequent improvements amounted to $4,000. Maintenance costs for the year were $2,480. The estimated life of the building when constructed was 50 years. The building can adequately house six persons.







The "fair value" of food for the week is determined as follows: Total cost $72.00 "Fair value" per employee ($72.00 divided by 3) $24.00 The "fair value" of lodging for year 1979 is determined as follows: Cost of building in 1978 $36,000.00 Add: Subsequent improvements $4,000.00 Total cost $40,000.00 Depreciation for year (1/50 times $40,000.00) $800.00 Maintenance costs for year $2,480.00 Interest on employer's net investment: Total investment $40,000.00 Depreciation to date $800.00 Net investment $39,200.00 Six percent of net investment $2,352.00 Total for year $5,632.00 Total for week ($5,632.00 divided by 52) $108.31 "Fair value" per employee ($108.31 divided by 6 persons) $18.05 Assume that employee B worked 40 hours in a particular week. His wages would be as follows: Gross cash wages (40 times $2.50) $100.00 Fair value of food $24.00 Fair value of lodging $18.00 Gross weekly wage $142.05 Hourly wage ($142.05 divided by 40) $3.55 Assume that employee B worked 48 hours in a particular week. His wage entitlement would be as follows: Total earnings exclusive of overtime premium pay: Gross cash wages (48 hrs. times $2.50) $120.00 Fair value of food $24.00 Fair value of lodging $18.05 Total straight time wages $162.05 Overtime wages: Regular hourly wage (162.05 divided by 48 hours

Overtime pay 8 x $3.38 divided by 2) $13.52 Employee B Wage entitlement for 48 hours $175.57
