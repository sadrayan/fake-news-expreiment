Kenneth Copeland: Christians Who Don’t Vote For Trump Are ‘Going To Be Guilty Of Murder’
Right-wing televangelist and prosperity gospel preacher Kenneth Copeland recently hosted a television program featuring right-wing psuedo-historian David Barton, Pastor George Pearsons and Bishop Keith Butler aimed at mobilizing conservative Christians to vote in the upcoming election.

Earlier this year, both Copeland and Pearsons prayed over Rafael Cruz, father of one-time GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz, declaring that the younger Cruz had been “called and anointed to be the next president of the United States.” Obviously, that did not work out as Copeland has prophesied, so now he has taken to warning Christians that they will be “guilty of murder” if they don’t vote for Donald Trump.

Christians might not want to hear it, Copeland said, but they are “going to be held seriously to account by God” if they don’t vote.

“You’re going to be guilty of murder,” he said. “You’re going to be guilty of an abomination of God. You’re going to be guilty of every baby that’s aborted from this election forward.”

“This is God’s nation and nobody is going to take it away from Him,” Copeland shouted. “No man, no woman, no Democrat, no Republican, no socialist, no communist can take this nation away from God! I don’t know what it is about that you can’t understand, but I’m telling you right now God Almighty is head of this nation, not people! Jesus of Nazareth is lord over the United States.”
