On your highlighted question ... can you explain what you mean by being specific? Are you looking for names of the deceased?

If you like, simply confirm the individuals shot by a police officer (by last name, date): Mesch, Jan. 23; Flache, Feb. 7; Bolin, May 25; Holt, July 5; Munroe, July 5; Lepine, July 12. So far, is it correct that only the Mesch shooting has been concluded with a grand jury issuing no charges, meaning everything else remains uncertain in that way?

The below listed dates and names are correct. However the information about the Mesch shooting regarding the Grand Jury is incorrect. None of the below listed cases have been presented to a Grand Jury.
