SPRING HILL, FL—Today, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio announced his endorsement of Blaise Ingoglia for the Florida House, District 35.

Blaise is a principled fiscal conservative who has worked a long time to highlight the excess of government at all levels. In the Florida House, I know Blaise will make the people of Hernando County proud as he advocates for the best interests of taxpayers and for conservative solutions based on the principles of free enterprise and limited government.”

“I am honored to have the support and endorsement of my friend Senator Marco Rubio,” said Blaise Ingoglia. “Senator Rubio is a true public servant who is committed to restoring fiscal discipline in Washington by reining in wasteful government spending and holding government accountable. Senator Rubio is a proven leader for Florida and for our Country and I am humbled to have earned his trust in my candidacy to represent the people of House District 35.”
