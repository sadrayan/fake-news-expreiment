Advocates and experts:

Good afternoon.

We’re fact-checking this recent tweet by Rep. Donna Howard (my bolding and underline): “Here's the thing. In Tx, charters get 100% state $/pupil funding while district schools (95% students) get about 1/3 funding from state w/ rest coming from local prop taxes (which is why those taxes are so high). Districts getting less b/c scarce $ going to charters.”

From your vantage point(s), what information best speaks to the accuracy of the statement?

Other recommended resources?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our fact-checks.

Thanks,

g.

The primary source of charter funding is through the Foundation School Program (FSP), which is indeed state money. TEA has a breakdown of charter school funding here: https://tea.texas.gov/index2.aspx?id=25769817563.

I’ve attached a TEA presentation from the July 10 meeting of the Texas Commission on Public School Finance, on page three of which gives the breakdown of public school funding sources (also accessible here: https://tea.texas.gov/Finance_and_Grants/State_Funding/Additional_Finance_Resources/Texas_Commission_on_Public_School_Finance/). You’ll note that the state’s share according to TEA is 36 percent, which is close to 1/3.

Students who leave a school district for a charter are no longer counted in the district’s average daily attendance (ADA), but their absence does not alter the district’s property wealth. This causes the wealth per student to increase, which reduces the support provided by the state under the current school finance formulas. A large enough number of students leaving for charters could even push a district into having to pay money back to the state through recapture.

I hope this is helpful!
