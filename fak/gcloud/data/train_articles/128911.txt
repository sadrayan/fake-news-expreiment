True or false: Students can pray in public school any time they want
True or false? Students and anybody else in a public school have a right to quietly pray any time they want.

It’s true, but you wouldn’t know it if you listen to lawmakers in Virginia who, according to this Post story, are pushing legislation that would ”codify students’ right to pray before, during and after school; organize prayer groups, clubs and events; wear religious clothing or accessories; and express religious viewpoints at school forums.”

Critics oppose the legislation on several grounds; they say that students already have a right to pray quietly whenever they want and to express religious viewpoints in school, and that supporters are seeking to “enshrine” Christianity in public life.

Here’s what true about school prayer, from Charles Haynes, director of the Religious Freedom Education Project at the Newseum, a First Amendment scholar who writes and speaks extensively on religious liberty and religion in American public life.
