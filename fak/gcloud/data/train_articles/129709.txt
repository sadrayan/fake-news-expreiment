A Thankyou To All Starbucks Customers
Starbucks' Howard Schultz Dear Starbucks Customer,



First and foremost I want to thank you for making Starbucks the $6.4 billion global company it is today, with more than 90,000 employees, 9,700 stores, and 33 million weekly customers. Every latte and macchiato you drink at Starbucks is a contribution to the close alliance between the United States and Israel, in fact it is - as I was assured when being honored with the “Israel 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Tribute Award” - key to Israel’s long-term PR success. Your daily Chocolate Chips Frappucino helps paying for student projects in North America and Israel, presenting them with the badly needed Israeli perspective of the Intifada. Without you, my valued customer, I wouldn’t be able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars each year to protect Israeli citizens from terrorist attacks and keep reminding every Jew in America, to defend Israel at any cost. $5 billion per year from the US government are no way near enough to pay for all the weaponry, bulldozers and security fences needed to protect innocent Israeli citizens from anti-Semitic Muslim terrorism. Corporate sponsorships are essential. If it wasn't for you, I couldn't - through the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah, an international network of Jewish education centres - sponsor Israeli military arms fairs in an effort to strengthen the special connection between the American, European and Israeli defense industries and to showcase the newest Israeli innovations in defense. I couldn't fight against the global rise of anti-Semitism, the reason behind the current conflict in the Middle-East, by helping Aish HaTorah sponsor the website "honestreporting.com” and produce material informing of Israel’s side of the story. Without your coffee dollars, Starbucks couldn't have donated an entire store to the US army to help in the “War on Terror”. I cannot emphasize enough, how vital the “War on Terror” is for the continued viability and prospering of the Jewish State. So next time you feel like chilling out at a Starbucks store, please remember that with every cup you drink at Starbucks you are helping with a noble cause. Howard Schultz

Chairman & Chief Global Strategist

Starbucks Coffee Stores [Editor's note: The Howard Schultz spoof letter above has caused quite a bit of a stir. In the first month of its publication, it has been read by more than 100,000 visitors on the ZioPedia site alone, and republished on hundreds of blogs all over the world. Some readers were not quite sure whether the article was 'kosher' or not. Well, it is and it isn't. Howard Schultz never wrote that letter, I did. However, all the statements I made in that letter about donations, sponsorships, political views etc. - are based on factual Howard Schultz actions and quotes, as 1/2 hour of 'Googling' will easily confirm to anyone interested. One word to all those professionally lieing Starbucks public relations smart-arses desperately trying to 'debunk' this facts based spoof. The question whether the money came directly from Starbucks or indirectly via its chairman is a mere technicality. If Starbucks doesn't want to be seen to support the Israeli genocide on the Palestinians, it mustn't allow its most prominent figurehead support it, regardless where the money is coming from a Starbucks expense account, directors fees or Zionist fundraisers prominently endorsed by Howard Schultz. There is obviously a lot of emphasis right now on Israel's most recent brutal aggression against Lebanon and the Gaza strip. However it's important not to forget that the current events are part of a bigger picture, Israel's criminal social-Darwinist and 19th century style colonialist plans for the region, a Jewish 'Lebensraum' from the Euphrates to the Nile.

Halah, Registered Why cant we all just get along and live happily together without the wars, discrimination, name calling, and ignorance!! imagine how beautiful life would be :D 71. lana

Lana, Registered Adam you are so ignorant, you should open your eyes! 70. I like Starbucks but i hate the act of support

mansour, Registered I'm a Muslim Saudi man. I hope the administration of the company to use the benefit from customers in support of children and to render immediate assistance to poor and vulnerable households, as well as in support of the students and their education regardless of their religion and race. 69. hahaha

Mazen, Registered Hey Adam



i have been reading your bullshit for a while you are an interesting character

let me ask you one simple question.



does Red Indians have the right to take the USA again ?



Dude go get a life



68. just read it and dont reply on this

Mohannad, Registered Dears,



IÃ¢â¬â¢ve just seen this article the reply dates are all wrong so i donÃ¢â¬â¢t know if this conversation is still active or not, first of all you shouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t curse its wrong and regardless of what Howard Schultz did or didnÃ¢â¬â¢t say this has evolved to a very interesting debate and covered too many topics related to Israel presence in the middle east and the Zionist and anti Zionist but facts are facts, and to all if you donÃ¢â¬â¢t know this but Israel is the only occupying force today on the face of the planet and that is a FACT. As for Adam your cool and all but though not that knowing and probably not that smart.



Also I especially hate to judge any one by his religion or where about because most of us are born by it but please see this one clip on the you tube this is about what most of the famous men in the world said about the Jew try to learn something its three parts this is only part number one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhDUfzEOX-w&mode=related&search=



And also thereÃ¢â¬â¢s this other clip about the Palestinians terrorisms, remember that the camera doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t lie and please all see this one and guess who's the band: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzZj889BA4A



After seeing this IÃ¢â¬â¢m really convinced that the Palestinians, Iraqis and Lebanese are the terrorisms especially after seeing the babyÃ¢â¬â¢s bombing the place and attacking with Uzi's.



And for all IÃ¢â¬â¢m a Jordanian and I do fluently speak 3 languages as most around here our native is Arabic, English is a second language and also French so it doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t matter if my grammar is not perfect and id like to know since all of us are speaking to Adam in what to seems to be his native language can you Adam read any word in any of our languageÃ¢â¬â¢s if not please spare us the comment about the lingo we did pass the sixth grade!



And also I was very annoyed by you comment about how small of a portion Israel has taken and it doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t matter compared to the Arab world, well its so ridicules and off point that I wish a rat gets into one of your house wall and then lets see what you will do its only a hole in the wall or is it not?



And always remember the FACT: but Israel is the only occupying force today on the face of the planet and that is a FACT



Anti Semitism MY ASS ,, hahahahahah this is a good one



And to all of the other guys and girls out there my advise is stop replying to Adam and the other guy itÃ¢â¬â¢s a waste of time

67. Interesting!

Becca, Registered I am a Starbucks employee, and a Jew; however, I am NOT a Zionist, and the aforementioned descriptors DO NOT define me. I am a Starbucks employee by choice, and a Jew by blood. Over the years, I've been active in many humanitarian groups (such as Seeds for Peace), which focus on building friendship and alliance between Jews and Muslims in America. In the summer following my sophmore year in high school (2002), I spent six weeks in a mosque in Valdosta, GA, and quite honestly, I felt JUST at home and welcomed as I did in my own Jewish synagogue, of which I have been a member for over 21 years!



What I would really like to say is that, although Howard Schultz is Jewish, that does NOT mean that all Jews are Anti-Palestine and Pro-Israel. I have many Israeli friends who yearn in their hearts for things to be different. ALL of them have served in the IDF.



I cannot say that I am proud to be part of a belief and ethnicity that has caused so much death and pain; I am not proud! Still, I am a Jew. I believe in Judaism. But never, EVER would I wish harm on my Muslim brothers and sisters, nor do I wish to convert them.



My point is, we are all creatures of Earth and children of God. Starbucks may be a big part of corporate America, and the world, but as an environmental science major, I CARE that the good outweighs the bad. At Starbucks, we DO go out of our way. We give, not only to America, but to the world. We give to the African Wildlife Foundation. We give to our local communities through gardening projects, food drives, and fund raisers, not just during holidays, but EVERY DAY. We contribute to clean water. We give to the Red Crescent. We fund literacy projects in low-income communities. Our employees get health benefits whether they work part-time or full-time. We ensure that our coffee farms practice sustainable agriculture, and maintain ethical finance distribution.



So before you get upset that Starbucks has done so well, remember this:



Those who give, receive, and those who receive, ought to give back.



We are NOT Wal-Mart. We know that we have a responsibility to our global and local communities.



Wah-salaam'alaikum,

Shalom,

Peace.



However you say it, we love you! :)



66. Starbucks is......

john, Registered not opening enough stores....Gold Coast Rocks! 65. Untitled

Melvyn, Registered Some advice for Nathan (taken directly from Nathan's advice): ' remember that you are causing... the spread of ignorance around the USA.' Your post screamed ignorance from the beginning to the end. In the ZioPedia FAQ, you'll find that this site supposedly abhors 'trailor-trash racism'. Look through your post again and ask yourself whether others might read your post as more than a little racist. As is so often the case, racism is founded in ignorance: 'just what every kike needs, more cash'. Over 40% of residents of Jerusalem live below the poverty line. There are plenty of poor Jews in Israel and in the rest of the world. Your racist outlook can't accept facts that don't fit in with your stereotypes. 'corrupt murdurous company of starbucks'. Good thing you didn't post this on a site that matters, otherwise Starbucks could happily sue you for libel and win. There's nothing in the original article on this page that claims any corruption. The company supports a country you detest but they do so quite openly. They pay US taxes and provide employment to many thousands of Americans. The 'corruption' slander comes naturally when someone is Jewish because you Nathan are a racist. You also seem to have no idea how US Foreign Aid works. The money doesn't get delivered in large suitcases for distribution amongst foreign populations. US Aid comes with heavy conditions and the first and most important (from the perspective of the donor) of these is that the money be spent in America on American products. The $5bn that gets 'donated' to Israel gets ploughed straight back into the American economy. The same with over $50 billion given by the US to Egypt since 1975. Finally your figures are plain wrong. The US foreign aid budget for 2007 (USD 21.3 billion) includes $2.4bn aid for Israel and $1.7bn for Egypt. No '$5bn' in sight. Nathan, please don't let these facts stop you from continuing 'the spread of ignorance around the USA'. Your work is important and undervalued. Where others research and seek to understand, you just hate and then hate some more. A refreshing approach to a complex world. 64. Untitled

Untitled

Ahmad M M, Registered Well Adam I beleive that you are the one who has to go back to school not me!! Before 60 years there was nothing called 'State of Israel'. You wrote 'in fact the Jews settled that land long before any other peoples were present there, almost 4000 years ago'. All of a sudden they remembered to restore their land; only after the British Foreign Secretary Arthur J. Balfour issued the Balfour Declaration.Balfour encouraged immigrants from all over the world to come & steal Arab lands. Those immigrants established a monster that is always thirsty for blood. The Israeli massacres are countless.Stop being a devil?s advocate. 62. Untitled

Adam, Registered Why is it that you guys are unable to respond to what I actually write, instead continuing to make arguments that I have already disproved? With regard to to your comment, AHawarizmi, that Israelis kill too many Palestinians/Lebanese, did you not read my remarks as to the cause of this? Did you not notice that I explained very clearly that Hezbollah does this to turn international opinion to its twisted ends, using its own people as human shields? Why are you unable to respond to this? Furthermore, why are neither of you able to respond to my comments concerning Israel's size relative to the surrounding Arab world? If the Arabs truly wished for peace, as you suggest, then they would have no problem with a tiny, non-Arab state among them. Instead, leaders such as Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad constantly call for the total destruction of Israel. And that's right, it is important to note that Hezbollah is supported by Syria and Iran. A terrorist organization supported by two entire nations will have considerably more power than one supporting itself. Israel is supported by the U.S. and parts of Europe, that is true. However, it requires this support, being one tiny nation trying to survive surrounded by enemies, who are constantly striving for its destruction. Let's just picture a scenario here: Hezbollah stops firing rockets into Israel, returns the captured Israeli soldiers (whom they took for no good reason), and completely disbands. Imagine further that Iran and Syria renounce their desires for the destruction of Israel and the West, and instead pledge to work with their neighbors to ensure peace in the region. Imagine if these states stop being governed by religious fanaticism and instead adopt a peaceful, secular, democratic, and especially modern, mode of government as is present in the United States and Israel, a government that believes in individual rights and freedom, and equality for women. Imagine if the nations surrounding Israel opened their arms and borders to their Palestinian neighbors for whom they profess so much concern. What if the Palestinians were no longer governed by Hamas, a known terrorist organization? Essentially, imagine that all of the surrounding Arab states turned from absolute hatred to absolute approval of Israel and pledged to cease all hostilities in any form, destroying any terrorist or extremist organizations within themselves that may wish to compromise peace. If all of this could, hypothetically, occur today, Israel would no longer have any need for military action. If it knew that it existed among trusted friends and allies who share in its sense of purpose to improve the status of the Middle East, it would have no reason to live in fear. If such a miraculous transformation on the part of the Arab states were to happen and Israel still continued to fight (which it would have no reason to), then I might see your point. Since this is all merely wishful thinking, just think about it. And next time, try to respond directly to what I say so we can have a meaningful discussion 61. Untitled

Tara, Registered If Hitler had killed all jews , there wouldnt be any war in middle east...God bless him too bad he couldnt accomplish 60. Untitled

Adam, Registered Thank you Tara, you have just exposed your incredible stupidity and ignorance in two very poorly written 'sentences', if they can even be called that. What is too bad is that your mother didn't have you aborted. What a shame and a waste of oxygen. 59. Untitled

Adam, Registered If Hitler had killed all Jews, there would be no Israel in the Middle East. Instead, there would be a disgusting, backwards, barbaric wasteland governed by savages who would bow only to absurd Islamic fanaticism. It would essentially be the armpit of the world. Oh wait, that's already how it is all throughout the Middle East except for Israel, my bad. 58. Untitled

Ahmad M M, Registered Israel does not know the meaning of humanity. Every now & then zionists prove that they deserve hell. Atrocities in Lebanon & Palestine show this. Israel end is imminent. As for the fool who talks about the rules of grammar and spelling in his comment, he should know that many Arabs can use English better than the native themselves. I think it is better for him to use his dirty Hebrew instead of any other language. 57. Untitled

Adam, Registered Hey, Ahmad, first of all, I don't even speak Hebrew. I don't live in Israel and I'm not a Zionist. I simply have enough basic understanding of international interaction to see that Israel is not at fault here. If you had enough wit to read my entire comment, you would know why the Israelis are blamed for 'atrocities' in Lebanon. It is because the terrorist organization known as Hezbollah plans it this way, hiding their guerrillas among innocents and using them as shields. That way, they can point a finger at the Israelis and show the world how cruel Israel is when civilians are killed, when in fact it is Hezbollah that has no regard for its own people and will use as many of them as possible to win its misguided, radically-driven campaign. Also, if Iran and Syria and the others are so concerned about the welfare of the Palestinians, why don't they invite them to enter their lands and live among their people? You know why? It is because having the issue of the Palestinians just gives these fundamentalist Arabs one more thing to hate Israel about, when in fact the Jews settled that land long before any other peoples were present there, almost 4000 years ago. Yet, instead of opening their borders to the Palestinians, these other Arab nations want to steal more of Israel's already limited land. Oh, and it seems you forgot what happened when Israel finally ceded the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians - they elected a terrorist-run government (Hamas) and used Gaza as a launching pad for rockets to shoot at Israel. So please, don't go talking about those subjects on which you are clearly clueless. Your religiously impassioned rhetoric that lacks any substantial facts or arguments is unimpressive. Go back to school and learn what this conflict is about. 56. Untitled

AHawarizmi, Registered Ahaha, Adam's comment remind me with this rules: Rules of the Game for American Press Rule No. 1: In the Middle East, it's always the Arabs that attack first and Israel that defends itself. That's called retaliation. Rule No. 2: Arabs, whether Palestinian or Lebanese, have absolutely no right to kill Israeli civilians. That's called terrorism. Rule No. 3: Israel has every right to kill as many Arab civilians as it wants. That's called legitimate self-defense. Rule No. 4: When Israel kills too many civilians, the Western powers urge for restraint. That's called the reaction of the international community. Rule No. 5: Palestinians and Lebanese have no right to capture Israeli soldiers, even if their numbers are limited to three. Rule No. 6: Israelis have the right to capture as many Palestinians as they wish -- over 10,000 prisoners as of today, of which 300 are children. Uttering the magic word, 'terrorist,' is all that's needed to throw Arabs behind bars without charges. Rule No. 7: When you say 'Hizballah,' you should always add 'supported by Syria and Iran.' Rule No. 8: When you say 'Israel,' you should never add 'supported by the United States and Europe' lest the conflict appear imbalanced. Rule No. 9: Never mention 'occupied territories,' or 'UN resolutions,' or 'violations of international law,' or 'the Geneva conventions.' That might perturb television viewers and lead them to ask questions. Rule No. 10: Israelis speak English better than Arabs. That is why we always give them -- and their supporters -- more air time. That way, they can explain Rules 1 through 9 to us. That's called media objectivity. Rule No. 11: If you don't agree with any of these rules, or if you think they favor one party over another, that's because you're a dangerous anti-Semite. 55. Untitled

Adam, Registered I can't believe all of these comments i'm reading. Don't you people have any minds of your own, or do you believe all of the bullshit the foreign media spews at you? Israel is a blessing to the Middle East. It is the only stable, democratizing force in the region, without which the area would be engulfed in the chaos of radical fundamentalist Islam, perpetuated chiefly by Iran and Syria. The Israelis took a barren, inhospitable desert land and transformed it into one of the greatest nations on Earth. The products of Israeli agriculture are shipped worldwide, and its technology is an example for all. All its people want is peace and freedom from attack and incursion by the surrounding Arab states, yet nations such as Iran and Syria cannot seem to grasp this concept. They are led by savages who would love nothing more than the complete destruction of Israel, the United States, and most of Western Europe for that matter. They wish for the world to regress several hundred years and for everyone to be converted to Islam, forcefully if need be. Israel is the only rational, well-meaning, stabilizing force in the Middle East and we should all praise its diligence in combating this hideous radicalism. What you fools don't comprehend is that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization very apt at twisting the media to its devious ends. They hide their 'guerillas' (terrorists) in all parts of Lebanon, among innocent civilians, namely women and children, for the purpose of turning international opinion against Israel. When Israeli forces attempt to destroy Hezbollah installations or areas believed to contain guerrillas, their maneuvers inevitably end up resulting in civilian casualties, because that is exactly what Hezbollah wants. Then these monsters can declare to the world that Israel is overreacting or illegally hitting non-military targets. Israel cannot overreact in this situation - rather, it must do all it can to secure the safety of its borders and its people. With Iran and Syria supporting Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations fueled by fundamentalist Islamic hatred, Israel cannot be meek and sit back while its soldiers get kidnapped and its cities destroyed by Katyusha rockets every day. It was the Arabs that started this conflict, not the Israelis. It is unfortunate that Lebanese civilians are getting caught in the crossfire, for this was clearly not an engagement in which they wished to participate, but this is the result of actions by extremists that cannot accept the existence of a peaceful, non-Muslim state in their midst. If they had their way, the entire world would be governed by barbarians who would have people brutally stoned in the streets for adultery and women treated as second-class citizens completely subservient to the whims of their husbands. No, thank you. Israel, I salute you for your courage and action in the face of such massed savagery and hatred. 54. Untitled

Adam, Registered And also, you morons, it is not the Israelis who are 'animals' or 'evil', it is the Arabs. They are the ones who cannot stand to have a country less than half the size of Pennsylvania among them because the residents of that country have different beliefs than they do. It is states like Iran and Syria that cause all the turmoil in the Middle East; Israel has had to respond as it does or it would soon be destroyed by all of the ignorant, hateful savages surrounding them. Israel promotes progress and modern society, whereas Iran, Syria, and many other Arab states curtail freedom and act on the basis of some twisted concept of Islam. For them, religion is the sole guiding force behind their primitive and barbaric domestic and foreign policies, and these nations are ruled by radicals who have openly called for the destruction of Israel, the U.S., and the West in general. If not for the existence of Jews and Israel, the Middle East would be even more of a shit-hole than it is now, you ignorant bastards. Wake up! Oh, and by the way, before you submit something (and i'm talking to everyone who has written an anti-Israel message), learn basic rules of grammar and spelling, because as it is now, your writing styles only make you seem less intelligent than I already know you are. 53.

Val, Registered It is so sad and bitter how truth and reality is being reversed; the torturer, occupier and killers are described as victims and the real victim & defender for their lives and dignity are described as terrorists. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves who you are supporting and what your hands are committing of crimes against humanity; you are a disgrace to the human race. You have brought the human race to its inferiority I personally feel ashamed & disgraced of the thought of belonging to the same species you belong to and sharing the same planet with you. Within yourselves you know very well how inhuman you all are and the enmity you are showing is actually nothing but hate and despise to your own selves. See what the hands of Israelis have been doing all through the years, just seek a little truth of what is happening of killing and torture in Lebanon, here is just a sample. http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=20060721&articleId=2787 Wake up America to you humanity. 38. Untitled

Menakhem, Registered It is so unfortunate that criminals like you exists in this world. Israel has been murdering everybody in the region and demolishing homes and countries, all with support of animals like you. You are disgusting two legged animal. The crimes and atrocities Israel has been committing in the world with our, American, tax dollars are despicable. It is not Islam that is the problem, it is the criminal government of Israel that massacred Palestinians to steal their land and continues to date to murder innocent people and destroy their homes and occupy their land, and with help of corrupt US government cover it behind holocaust. And ever since Israel has caused the Holocaust of the Palestinian and Middle East people and hide behind American military power. I bring Rachel Corey's inhumane death by Israeli soldiers to the attention of American people to help them realize what kind of animals the Israeli's are. The images from Palestine and Lebanon prove the brutality and animalism of Israelis. The world is waking up, no matter how many animals like you try to do the cover-up for Israel, and retaliate for all the murders, crimes, atrocities, and genocide Israel has committed in the region. Israel is the one involved in 9-11-2001 disaster in the U.S., and there is plenty of evidence to that, and more and more people are realizing this, and will make Israel pay for all the hardship it caused the world. You disgust me and you are a disgrace to humanity and all it stands for. Instaed of using your resources to promote death and distruction, you should promote peace and understanding. How can you live with yourself, then again animals like you have no conscience. But I am hoping God will shed some wisdom and love on you to become a human being and not the animal you are. Thank you 37. Untitled

Listen, I want to tell u somethings, first of all, thanx to US ARABS , u r gaining billion of dollars and thanx to US ARABS u will stop doing so much money, WHY!!!! because we have all the richness on earth, petrol, geographic location, identity, and most important of all a mind which we can use and thank GOD for it for u have none of it. We ARABS are no terrorists. YOU ARE. THE STUPID IGNORANT U.S PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF AND BUSH AND WHO ARE WORSE THAN YOU THE STUPID ISRAELI PEOPLE. Why do u ignorants call us terrorists, coz we defend what is ours, coz we dont want animals like you attacking us and killig our children and destroying our countries. Why do u call Hezbollah a terrorist organzation, coz it defends its land, its people, its faith... Hezbollah opened schools, hospitals, helps needy people... Is this why they are considered terrorists!!!!! I just pray and pray for God to help us get rid of u animals (U.S and Israel) as soon as possible so that justice prevails in this unjust world. You all should go to hell and to hell you will go. Go hezbolla, go Nasrallah, Go Iran and to hell with U.S and Israel. 36. Untitled

Val, Registered It is so sad and bitter how truth and reality is being reversed; the torturer, occupier and killers are described as victims and the real victim & defender for their lives and dignity are described as terrorists. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves who you are supporting and what your hands are committing of crimes against humanity; you are a disgrace to the human race. You have brought the human race to its inferiority I personally feel ashamed & disgraced of the thought of belonging to the same species you belong to and sharing the same planet with you. Within yourselves you know very well how inhuman you all are and the enmity you are showing is actually nothing but hate and despise to your own selves. See what the hands of Israelis have been doing all through the years, just seek a little truth of what is happening of killing and torture in Lebanon, here is just a sample. http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=20060721&articleId=2787 Wake up America to your humanity. 35.

krishna e bera, Registered Please label these things clearly as spoofs WITHIN the article. The letter is now circulating separately as if it were real. Of course you are not responsible for what others do, but you don't have to give bombs to irresponsible people either. The backlash when people find out this is not real causes more damage than any good you may be doing with 'might as well have been' news stories: damage in the form of ridicule at activists for playing fast and loose with the truth; damage in the form of cynicism and doubt about historical documents; damage to the credibility of sympathetic ordinary people who forward documents. Instead, or at least, provide a static bibliography of the googled facts you used to make this article. Most people will not take time and do not have time to look up things. Google only indexes websites, which can change very quickly and often do under pressure. A page of solid, researched facts is something we can rely on long-term for the cause, a stepping stone to justice. 34. Untitled

Naved Shoaib, Registered Its really a pity to hear that. Me, my family and all friends have decided to not to contribute to this disgusting cause. It really stinks. However, there is one good news under the lines, and that is, this is the beginning of the end of this cursed community. Very slowly they are making this world unbearable for themselves without knowing this fact. Further, specially Muslims should learn from them, not their cowardness but their unity as a nation. May Allah Curse them. 32. Untitled

Uchiha Torankusu, Registered Adam deary, If Israel do want peace, they wont attack innocent family in Lebanon. They wont fire rocket freely to lebanon state for the sake of their soldier (only a group of people) compared to what they had killed (WHICH WAS NOW ALMOST 50000 PEOPLE). Are you a human? can you imagined if that happen to you? you have no feeling as a human right? If israel do want peace, they had stop it long ago. they do not want peace!! they think that people who are not jew are only beast. just like darwin theory?? dont you have that stupid knowledge? you know nothing arent you? 31.

Melvyn, Registered Wow! What adult, mature conversation happens at this site. The parody above is well written and showcases the talents of an educated, left-wing Zionism hater. Shame the same can't be said for the writers of the previous comments who can't spell, string together a sentence, or present a coherent argument. I have no idea what point 'Tara' was making in the sexually explicit though utterly bizarre comment s/he left. It appears that truth is in very short supply here (Uchiha's claim that Israel has killed 50,000 people would be laughable if it weren't tragic that there are those who believe such things - the number in Lebanon is under 800 according to the Lebanese. No distinction is made in the total between racist Hizb'Allah terrorists and civilians). One question I'd like to ask Mr. Winkler is whether he thinks all donations to Israel are wrong. Is it *always* wrong to send Israelis (whom you obviously hate because they are Zionists and not because they are Jews) physical and moral support? The second Israel-Lebanon War was launched by Hizb'Allah. Everyone agrees about that. So before the Israeli response had begun, did you think that it was wrong of non-Israeli Jews to voice support for Israeli Jews and Arabs who were under attack? If the answer is that it is not always wrong, then why should the chairman of Starbucks be criticised for sending his financial support wherever he chooses? If it *is* always wrong, does your preferred (non-racist) solution parallel that of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who sees Israel's destruction as the path to a peaceful middle east? Apparently it's fine to say that a racist genocide, such as that suggested by Iran, can be the way towards peace. Israeli leaders who argue that you might have to fight to reach peace are declared 'racist'. It could be argued (though not by Tara) that making such a distinction between who is allowed to fight for peace and who isn't, is itself racist. 26. Untitled

V, Registered I have read many comments about the war in Lebanon and have not encountered one lebanese who commented. I think it is time for one of us to do it. To actually correct all of your info here are some facts and I think I am best placed to know them: - more than 1200 ppl were killed in the war on Lebanon. They all are civilians. Some are still under the rubble. If anyone tells otherwise they are lying. - Hizballah did not start the war, they just kidnapped 2 soldiers. The Israeli soldier still occupy a part of Lebanon which is called the Shabaa Farms. So Lebanon has the right to DEFEND itself too against the continuous assaults on the local waters and air in Lebanon. I am not a Partisan of Hizballah BTW, I am a Christian and I am against war in all its aspects but I rather keep my eyes opened and see the truth. I am not a racist I have friends from all over the world and from all religions. BTW Adam in one of ur previous comments you said all countries here shd accept Israel, but the problem is they do not accept anyone and that is a fact. U say we shd have a modern ruling, and a democratic one but the model ur talking about is not exactly a great one so no thanks. And anyway if u were better informed u would know that Lebanon is a democratic regime, ruled by a government and a President elected by the Parliament, who is brought to where they are by democratic elections. It has been happening that way here since the French were in Mandate. I have no problem with Israel if they do not litterally destroy my country over any reason they disfigure. They have bombed bridges during the last months, they have bombed hospitals and civilians. They have killed little children and they even bombed ambulances and Red Cross volunteers while they were trying to save air raids victims. They have bombed bridges in areas where no Hizballah exists, because they mostly are stationned in the south. So don't anyone tell me that they started the war. They started a military action and Israel declared an opened war on civilians. If u do not believe what i am saying look the whole thing up. I am raged against the 2 parts because it takes 2 to make a war. Israel is not the victim here, Lebanon is. I wonder how a diary factory is a threat? I wonder how the UNIFIL soldiers who were killed by an air raid on their local are a threat. They did not even dare receive fleeing civilians. We are still under blocus. The Beirut Airport was one of the first places targeted. It is a civilian airport and it DID NOT bring weapons to Hizballah. I just wish people will see beyond the lies, and open up their minds and eyes to see the truth. I don't think that the 60 people killed in Qana, 39 of which are children who were sleeping, were a threat! But it seems that some consider them so... This is what creates terrorism. A similar massacre happened 10 years ago in the same region. And as our representing person in the UN said, the survivors of this massacre are the ones fighting Israel now. The children of those who died in 96 are fighting Israel now, u think they won't hold grudge against those who killed they fathers? Put yourselves in their shoes, what will you do. And seriously I so want extremist ppl to stop standing up for us, we have enough trouble as it is. Lebanon is not a muslim country, is not a racist country, it is a country that holds ppl of all religions and races. So just LEAVE US ALONE. BTW most of the Arabic countries were totally agreeing with Israel on this so BUTT OFF! 25. Untitled

V, Registered sorry about the typos, I could not correct them since it is impossible to edit the comment. 24. Untitled

Adam, Registered Melvyn, I applaud you. You are the first intelligent person i've seen on this site. As for you, Tara, I must say that i'm really impressed with your mature analysis of my comments and sophisticated response. Clearly insulting my mother in distressingly poor English is a far more effective style of argument than actually considering the issues presented. Also, it is interesting to note that you call me a 'nerd' when you in fact visit the same website that I do and post comments on it as well. I guess you've never heard of the word 'hypocrite'. Also, I can't even begin to imagine what you mean by your ridiculous statements : 'All u do is postin these stupid comments ?! why? How come u don have the balls to face some muslims?! Just online?! Yeah I wouldn't except any thing more than that from a jew'. Not only did you actually fail to write a single proper sentence, but even if we assume I was able to understand something from that absurd jumble of words, it still proves that you are a complete idiot. First, you attempt to ask something about me posting comments online. Yes, that is what happens on an online site - people post comments, and others respond to them. Would you prefer that I parade around the streets with a banner displaying your stupidity to the world? Second, considering what you have just written, it would be impossible for you to refer to my comments as stupid. Also, what could you possibly mean by asking me why I don't have the balls to face some Muslims? Are you trying to ask whether I've ever spoken to a Muslim in person, because the answer would be yes. Some of my good friends are Muslim. If you were able to read above a first grade level, you would already know that I do not hate all Muslims, I merely despise the radical and authoritarian regimes governing Syria and Iran. Likewise, I can't possibly see what wearing a big black hat or putting my finger in my nose has to do with anything. And finally, you 'wouldn't 'except' anything more than that from a jew'? I'm not even going to begin trying to decipher that one. From your bizarre, barely legible message I can't tell whether you're retarded or below the age of 10. In either case, why don't you go outside and play and leave the discussion of serious issues to the adults? I'm sorry, did I just hurt your feelings? Maybe next time if you write me in 'my' language (khakhakhahkakhapookhipikhilakhooka), I may understand you better. 23. Untitled

Ahmad M M, Registered well Adam, I don't know your remember me or not? anyway I had put 2 or 3 comments as a reply to your ones. Your comments reveal some facts (I am going to rely on some quotes): you adore democracy& freedom 'I merely despise the radical and authoritarian regimes governing Syria and Iran' you write good English (of course not compared to poor (Tara). Her only excuse that she had to fall back on her poor English because she could not tolerate your teasing comments. you have some Muslim friends (Some of my good friends are Muslim). This is really astonishing. If the case is so I am sure that they pretend being Muslims or they can't express their ideas in English. This is because they did not refute your corrupted ideas. A 15 years old boy in any Arabic or Islamic country can easily show that the ideas you defend are really nonsense. You are merely an ideal jew who believes that Israel (though you are not Israeli or zionist!!! ) is a piece of heaven that accidently was put on earth. I am really keen on knowing your REAL nationality. You may be a fanatic American jew (by the way I have some American friends who are very rational & don't agree with Bush's stupid actions) & this explains why you hate Syria & Iran. Are you ready for a little history lesson, ok: During the cold war America's worst enemy was the communist camp (Russia etc). After the Soviet Union collapsed American presidents had to find an alternative enemy.(a proper excuse to keep bluffing taxation payers). The only alternative was Muslims. They depict Muslims as source of all evil in the world. They forgot that they are to ones who made Osam bin Laden to be their claw against Soviet. But the student turned against them. I won't complete the amsuing story as it needs volumes. To sum up: Israel could not exist without its mamy America and America will keep fostering baby Israel because of the pressure of jewish lobbey. America will keep trying forcing its so called democracy (just to steal Oil from Arab countries). I ask all wise Americans don't allow this insane creature (Bush) rules you any more. All you gain is hate all over the world. Muslims will win at the end because we defend our riht to live. Allah is the greatest 22. Untitled

Adam, Registered Ahmad, not only is everything you said false, but I am not even Jewish. 21. Untitled

Adam, Registered They needed a proper excuse to keep bluffing taxpayers? About what exactly where they trying to bluff the taxpayers? You make this statement as if it has any meaning or significance (it does not), yet fail to support it (because you can't). Also, my friends do not pretend to be Muslim (I don't know why anyone would 'pretend' to be a certain religion), and they are very intelligent and speak English quite fluently. Also, it is not my dream to live in Israel, as your comment suggests. I merely have enough wit to understand that Israel is in every way superior to Iran and Syria - culturally, politically, economically, domestically, etc. The Israeli government permits its citizens immeasurably more freedom than do the governments of Iran and Syria. Unlike these two radical states, the Israeli government does not treat women like second-class citizens, and it does not torture and kill political dissidents. The Israeli government encourages development of new technologies that are an example for many, as well as promotes a system of agriculture that feeds millions of people worldwide. Israel is a bastion of democracy in the Middle East and deserves support from any nation on Earth that wishes to promote democratic ideals. 20. Untitled

V, Registered All of this is soooo nice Adam. If they are so advanced why do they have to keep everyone at war with them, or have their own kind of peace. I wonder if u ever heard of Eretz Israel? It is the great Israel that extends form the Litani River south of my country Lebanon to reach Egypt. They might seem very democratic, but their PMs act as war lords towards the countries surrounding them. I admire their propaganda, it is so convincing, that most of the world believes that they are always victims. And Ahmad for God's sake don't tell me that a 15 year old is entitled to talk politics! If he is talking politics it means he was raised to believe something like hitler did with the Nazis, or he is doing it to oppose his parents and that is rarely done anyway. What maddens me about muslims in the arab world is that they pretend to be right and if u oppose their view you are the enemy. And if they don't share the same views they are not true muslims! BS! I wonder if someone should create a school that teaches people to think or search. And PLEASE stop shoving God into wars! God belongs to heaven, wars never did! And what will muslims win Ahmad? They will take over the world by the force of blowing it up and make everyone muslim the same way? How better than the nazis or the zionists will they be? Democracy is lie, that's what I learned, ppl telling u what u want to hear to get into a leading position. Other regimes are even worse and don't get me started there. And out of the bad (democracy) and the worse (other regimes) I choose the bad. What I hate most though is that Lebanon is being labeled along with the rest of the arab world. YES I despise that! WE adore our freedom of speech, WE adore being able to believe what we want, and seriously Ahmad people like you scare me, because they are a threat to my beliefs of freedom, because u sound like an extremist or a soon to be one. I just wonder how can some people like fighting, or consider human lives unimportant enough to be considered mere casualties. Wars are not fun, and those who say they are good please join me in one of the many that happen in my country. And Ahmad as far as the arabs are concerned, they are the deadest peoples on earth. They must learn to react faster or just shut up! 19. Untitled

Dora, Registered I just joined this interesting dialogue, I would like to commend V for everything you said is right, My condolences to you and everyone about the absolute savage destruction of your country and the murder of your and our people by the number one terrorists of the world as we all know. I can sense the frustration in all you say and how you wish people would see the truth, we all do at least we that have visions do. You see my dear to actually see, you need more than the eyes, you need a brain, so what i'm saying is all of us that have brains do see what's going on in the world. You are absolutely right that Hizbollah did not start the war, hizbollah fired no rockets into Israel that first day when Israel claimed they did. Please this trick has been used by Israel sooo many times, we were expecting it. This was all prearranged as part of a bigger plan they have for the middle east. While they were crying self defense against the kidnap of 2 soldiers, they kidnapped part of the elected palestine government... For God's sake where in the history of this world has a country ever kidnapped the government of another country??? And did we say anything about it here??? Oh no, nothing, business as usual. Our government is as corrupt as any government can be, and all these claims of spreading peace and tranquility are just that B.S claims!! This so called president has humiliated the united states almost beyond repair, he has wasted our resources for his own hidden agenda, he has corrupted other countries of the world, robbed them of their resources and murdered their civilians. And that is absolutely unacceptable in whatever religion you may choose to believe. It is soo sad that this will be the history of our generation. 16. Untitled

Adam, Registered Dora, you attempt to make some valid points, yet fail miserably. First of all, Hezbollah did start this war by kidnapping two Israeli soldiers. They did fire rockets into Israel and have been doing so ever since. And although you are correct in saying that Israel kidnapped members of the Palestinian government, this is irrelevant because that government is controlled by Hamas, a terrorist organization. Kidnapping members of such a government to prevent them from endangering Israeli lives is a reasonable move. Israel is merely doing what it must to ensure its safety, considering it is surrounded by terrorist organizations (Hezbollah, Hamas) and states that back such groups (Iran, Syria). Finally, the 'agenda' of the U.S. president is to spread democracy to a chaotic Middle East controlled largely by irrational Islamic fundamentalism. Supporting Israel in its struggles, whether they be combating Hezbollah or ensuring that Iran and Syria cannot pose even more serious threats to regional and world stability than they currently do, is the surest way to accomplish this goal. Israel is the sole democratizing force in the area and once the rest of the world's nations finally remove their blinders and recognize this, it may be possible to secure peace in the Middle East by neutralizing those rogue states that do all in their power to spread hatred, violence and radical religion. 15. Untitled

V, Registered Adam u r so stubborn and refuse to see facts. I won't even waste my time anymore in trying to make u see. And for ur info Hizbollah did not fire any rockets until Israel bombed the south. And if they r the only ones who are democratic and non terrorists why do they keep breaking the cease fire and how come our defense minister said that any one who fires a missile against israel will be court martialed. That's the last thing i'll say. Thanks Dora for ur sympathy and I should tell you that we too can see the difference between the people and the governments. V 14. Untitled

Naeem Qazi, Registered There is no right or wrong in politics & more so in international politics. Its like a cards game. Saddam blufffed, his bluff was called, he lost. On the other hand, Bush/Blair bluffed; their bluffed wasn`t called & they prevailed. The fact that their bluff of WMD has cost thousands of Iraqi civilians' lives & pointless deaths of US & British soldiers is long forgotten. Israel never believed in ME peace plan. They deliberately destabilized Yasir Arafat`s governement and actually made Hamas win; so that when Hamas comes to power, they can conveniently side track from peace process and the whole world will say that hamas are terrorist & its Ok if israel doesn`t deal with them. It was only a matter of time when America`s rhetoric stamp of authorization would have come saying 'forget old prescriptions, & accept new ground realities'.. Anyway, if we really want peace, its very simple: 1. Israel goes back to its legal boundaries. 2. Jurusalem being sacred to three religions, Islam, Jews & Christians is regulated like Vatican city & is totally demilitarized. 3. Palestinians regulate their armed militias & convert them into govt. troops such that they are under full control of govt. 4. Palestians trade off Gaza with Israel & get land adjacent to West bank & draw theirs & Israel`s permanent boundaries through independent UN mission. 5. Lebanon follows suit by regulating Hizbollah. Either regularize them as army & have control of central govt. over them or disband them. 6. Shebaa farms & Golan heights are handed over to righful owners. 7. All arabmuslim states accept Israel.............. This is if major powers want peace in ME,.......... Otherwise, we can keep on fighting, keep killing, keep giving birth to new generations of persecuted people who retaliate & use whatever is available at their disposal to express their anger..be it bombs, rockets, stones or curses. Remember, as long as people are persecuted, they will retaliate. Its happening in Turkish Kurdistan, Indian held Kashmir, Chechneya, Lebanon, Palestine, Assam and scores of other places. Somehow, the famous cliche' that difference between a freedon fighter and terrorist depends on who is in power has lost its meaning... Govt's have to realize that they can never crush these people by power... 13. Untitled

Melvyn, Registered 'Hizbollah did not fire any rockets until Israel bombed the south.' Patently untrue. The soldiers were kidnapped under a barrage of mortars. I suppose you could argue that 'mortars /= rockets' but it's a spurious and childish argument. Hizb'Allah picked the fight. Even they don't deny it. You're going further than the terrorists with this nonsense!
