Uninsured Rate

Definition

Percentage of the non-elderly population (under 65) without health insurance, 2011.

Description

Health insurance provides important protection for a household’s assets by reducing expenses incurred from a medical emergency or the treatment of a chronic illness that might otherwise require a family to spend down long-term savings, sell off assets or go into debt. In addition, because health insurance coverage encourages people to seek preventative care and treatment for injuries and illnesses, it minimizes the impact a major injury or illness would otherwise have on an individual’s ability to earn income. The uninsured are often one serious illness or accident away from financial insecurity.
