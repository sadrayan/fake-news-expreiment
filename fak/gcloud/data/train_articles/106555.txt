An interesting – albeit unconfirmed – theory regarding the Las Vegas shooting has emerged, with a new report alleging the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) now believes gunman Stephen Paddock likely had help planning and executing the deadliest mass shooting in US history from none other than the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino security guard who was shot in the leg that night.

Jesus Campos has been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st, as he supposedly rushed to Paddock’s suite, was shot in the upper thigh through the door, and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds. However, a senior ATF official involved in the investigation now believes he was likely an accomplice of Paddock’s, and may have even been involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddock’s 32nd-floor room.

According to an ATF official, these suspicions are corroborated by the extreme amount of gunpowder residue found on Campos’ hands. “They believe he killed Paddock, shot holes through the door and his own arm to produce physical evidence for his cover story, then went and lay next to the elevator,” a senior ATF official doing ballistic work for the shooting told GotNews.

This account would be consistent with leaked photos of Paddock’s dead body, which show casings on top of Paddock’s blood. Such a scenario would seem unlikely if Paddock had shot himself:

Authorities have similarly been piecing together information that shines light on the sophistication of the attack. “Paddock also had an electronic signal jamming device active and that is why the cameras were all out on the floor,” the ATF official explained.

Moreover, it appears the 64-year-old multimillionaire also plotted his attack well in advance: “Paddock at a minimum scouted out two separate music concerts, one being the EDC [Electric Daisy Carnival] and the other held at the Life is Beautiful venue plaza by Fremont, but didn’t pull the trigger,” the ATF senior official told GotNews. “Paddock had big plans, and didn’t plan on dying in the hotel room.” ABC News recently reported that Paddock had previously booked a hotel room overlooking Lollapalooza, and visited other musical festivals, presumably to scout for potential targets.

“Paddock also bought 60 guns total from at least 20 different gun stores, and he only visited them each once,” the official said. The ATF is looking into the real estate investor’s mysterious background, and so far has yet to reach a conclusion. A source familiar with the investigation told GotNews he “believes [Paddock] was an illegal gun broker or possibly working for a three letter agency to catch real criminals who are trying to buy illegal guns.”

Speculation that Paddock may have been an arms dealer has increased in recent days, in part due to a bizarre television interview his younger brother Eric gave, in which he discussed his brother’s background:

“People are saying ‘oh, he must’ve had help.’ Steve had no help. Steve didn’t take help. It did not take a village for Steve. Steve was an arm–,” Eric Paddock says in the strange clip, before awkwardly pausing, apparently catching himself. “I’m sorry. Please, don’t…”

Campos could not be reached for comment, and it should be noted that initial reports are often wrong or incomplete.

Since the publication of the article, the ATF contacted GotNews and said the article is incorrect
