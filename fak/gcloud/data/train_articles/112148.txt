“I'm here right now to thank you in person because that is my biggest dream," she said.

"Being able to stand on the stage with you in 2005, the outpouring of love that came from that ultimately provided my son when he graduates high school with a full ride to college.”

She repeated multiple times that her son is a Mexican-American and that Trump's generosity helped him.

Trump attempted to convince her she would be OK before leaving the stage to hug her.

“We’re going to be watching your boy, but you’re going to hopefully be around, you aren't going to have anyone watching," he said. "Those doctors are going to be so wrong.”

Various pageant blogs and an online fundraising page from FundAnything, which Trump had invested in, claim that 2005 Miss Wisconsin Melissa Young is very sick.

The fundraising page shows more than $18,000 raised for a college scholarship for Young's son.
