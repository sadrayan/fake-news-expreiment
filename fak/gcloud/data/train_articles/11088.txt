MURPHY SUPPORTS DELAY OF ACA REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESSES
U.S. Representative Patrick E. Murphy (FL-18) made the following statement in support of the Obama Administrationâ€™s decision to delay for one year the requirement in the Affordable Care Act that businesses cover their workers:



"I was pleased to hear of the Administration's decision to delay penalties for businesses under the Affordable Care Act. Our businesses are leading the way in economic growth and job creation as we continue to struggle to climb out of the recession. Just when the recovery is starting to take hold does not mean that we should be adding new uncertainty, taxes, or costly mandates to sectors of our economy that can least afford it.

"I urge Congress to work together in a bipartisan basis to improve the law and hold the Administration accountable to keep the focus on jobs during implementation of the law. Yesterday's announcement is a good first step to make sure that the business community is not overburdened and that our seniors and working families are protected as much as possible. But more work must be done. I am sponsoring several bills to help make the law better. This includes repealing the new taxes on insurance plans, including Medicare Advantage plans for seniors, to make premiums more affordable. In amending the bill to make it more effective we must also protect the crucial benefits that people are already receiving, including not being able to be kicked off insurance if they get sick and closing the Medicare prescription drug donut hole, saving seniors $600 annually."
