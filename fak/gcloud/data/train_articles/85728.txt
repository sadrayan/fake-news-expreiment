U.S. Senate candidate Fetterman goes for Bernie â€” NewsWorks
In a video in which he strolls through Wall Street (above), John Fetterman, the unorthodox, outsider candidate for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, has endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for president.

Fetterman says, like Sanders, he thinks the country suffers from "an epidemic of inequality."

"Bernie Sanders and I agree on a lot of other issues that are critical to this country," Fetterman says in the video, "whether it's immigration, whether it's marijuana legalization, whether it's universal pre-K or affordability for college education."

Fetterman, is the 6-foot-8 mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, who wears work shirts and has plenty of tattoos, including one of the ZIP code of his town.

"I'll always choose the innovator over the evolver," Fetterman said in a statement. "I'm proud to have Bernie's back in Pennsylvania."

Fetterman faces two other candidates in the April 26 Democratic primary.

Former Pennsylvania environmental secretary Katie McGinty has endorsed Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. In a statement, McGinty, who worked in the Bill Clinton administration, called Hillary Clinton "a proven champion for middle-class and working families, someone who shares the same values as myself."

The other candidate in the Democratic race, former U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak, hasn't made a presidential pick.

"Joe just focuses on the people of Pennsylvania so that he can continue to serve them," said Sestak spokesman Jake Sternberger.
