Gov. Rick Perry taxes returns 1987-present -- Updated

We've updated this item to include all of Gov. Rick Perry's income tax returns from 1987 to 2008. We have the 1995 return, but it is missing due to scanner problems. We will add it as soon as the scanner starts working again.

Perry has not yet filed his 2009 return. Spokeswoman Allison Castle said Perry plans on requesting an automatic extension.

And you thought your 401K took a beating. Gov. Rick Perry's blind trust had a capital loss of more than $500,000 in 2008.
