Corey calls Schneider plea deal ‘horrible’ in Senate testimony
“In this case, everybody talks about this particular victim and how people took up her cause; well, you notice that she still hasn’t come forward, and even the civil lawsuit she brought she brought as Jane Doe,” Corey said. “Now I’m the first person to tell you that those activities are within her rights and they should be respected, but what does that tell you about how anxious that individual was to take the stand and talk about activities in mixed company that she might never have even considered – and that’s before you get to cross-examination?”
