“Win Them Over By Whatever Is Available – Even Upon Utilizing The Cunning Of The Serpent!”

“Neither wicked men nor devils can hinder the work of ‘God,’ or shut out ‘His’ presence from ‘His’ people, if they will, with subdued, contrite hearts, confess and put away their sins, and in faith claim ‘His’ promises. Every temptation, every opposing influences, whether open or secret, may be successfully resisted, “Not By Might, Nor By Power, But By My Spirit, saith the ‘Lord Of Hosts!”

(Zachariah 4:6)

/*

The finite minds of men are inadequate to fully comprehend the plans and purposes of the “Infinite One.” To wise in their own conceit to search the scriptures with contrition of soul and earnest prayer for divine guidance, they have no shield from delusion. Satan stands ready to supply and deliver the heart’s desire of all who wish it. The plan of deception replaces the reality of truth.

Of the most successful agencies of the “Great Deceiver” are the divisive teachings and lying wonders of spiritualism. Disguised as an “Angel of Light,” he spreads his nets where least suspected. If only men would simply study the book of ‘God’ with earnest prayer, they might understand it; they would probably not be left to the darkness of receiving false doctrines…as they reject the truth, they fall prey to deception.

Many who have no real faith in God or in His word assent to some principles of truth and pass themselves off as Christians, are enabled to introduce their errors as scriptural doctrines.

Taking the position that it is of no consequence what men believe is one of Satan’s most successful deceptions. He knows the truth…he knows that the truth, received in the love of it, sanctifies the soul of the receiver; therefore he is constantly seeking to substitute false theories, fables, and another gospel.

From the beginning of man’s time on Earth, the servants of God have contended against false teachers, not merely as vicious men, but as inculcators of falsehoods that were (are) fatal to the soul.

The purposeful works of our great adversary is to confuse (the masses) minds so that they shall not discern the truth along with discord and division. Satan sees the Lord’s servants burdened because of the spiritual darkness of appetite or to some other form of self-gratification, and thus numbs their sensibilities so that they fail to hear the very things which they most need to learn.

Satan fully knows that all, whom he can lead to neglect prayer and the searching of the scriptures, will be overcome by his attacks. Therefore he invents every possible device to engross the mind in order to gain victory… “Victory at all costs!”

“The servants of “Hell,” instead of following the truth, make it their business and religion to change the truth and seek some fault of character of error of faith in those whom they do not agree. They will put a false coloring upon the words and acts of those who love and obey the truth. In order to sustain erroneous doctrines or un-Christian-like, (un-Islam-like, un-Hebrew-like, un-Jewish-like, un-Buddha-like, un-Hindu-like, etc.,) practices, some will seize upon passages of scripture separated from the context, perhaps quoting half of a single verse as proof to their point of view.

With the “Cunning of The Serpent” they entrench themselves behind disconnected utterances construed to suit their carnal desires.

…Many will fully pervert “The Word of God!”

This masterpiece…this successful accomplishment of Satan’s deceptions to keep the minds of men searching and conjecturing in regard to that which ‘God’ has not made known and which ‘He’ does not intend that we should understand. And this is one of the reasons Lucifer lost his place in Heaven. He became dissatisfied because all the secrets of God’s purposes were not confided to him, and he entirely disregarded that which was revealed concerning his own work in the lofty position assigned to him. By arousing the same discontent in the angels under his command, he caused their fall from grace as well. He now (and continually) seeks to imbue the minds of men with the same spirit and to lead them also to disregard the direct commands of God.

The utter yet subtle and mischievous error is the fast spreading, wide-spreading, and possibly ubiquitous belief that Satan has no existence as a personal being; that the name is used in scripture merely to represent men’s evil thoughts and desires. Wordly wisdom teaches that prayer is not essential.

Men of science claim that there can be no real answer to prayer; that this would be a violation of law, a miracle, and those miracles have no existence. The universe, they say, is governed by fixed laws, and God Himself does nothing contrary to these laws.

The errors of popular theology have driven many a soul to skepticism. This is one object which Satan seeks to accomplish. There is nothing that he desires more than to destroy man’s confidence in ‘God’ and in ‘His Word’ – “The Word Of God!”

Satan stands at the head of the great army of doubters, and he works to the utmost of his power to beguile souls into his ranks. It has become fashionable to doubt.

Large classes of people look upon “The Word of God” with distrust. They are un-willing to obey its requirements and endeavor to overthrow its authority. They read the Bible and listen to its teachings as presented from the sacred desk, merely to find fault with the scriptures or the sermon. Many become infidels in order to justify or excuse themselves in neglect of duty. Others adopt skeptical principles from pride and indolence in order to distinguish themselves by accomplishing anything worthy of honor, which requires effort and self-denial. They aim to secure a reputation for superior wisdom by criticizing the Bible and just-thinking people.

Not only do they not realize that they are entangling themselves in the snare of the fowler, they feel that they must maintain their positions while openly expressing unbelief…that must be maintained. And with this, they have united with un-Godly intentions, closing the gates of paradise – denying them passage therein.

Neither wicked men nor devils can hinder “The Work Of God,” or shut-out ‘His’ presence from ‘His’ people. Satan can present a counterfeit so closely resembling the truth that it deceives those who are willing to be deceived.

The ‘Lord’ permits ‘His’ people to be subjected to the fiery ordeal of temptation, not because he takes pleasure in their distress and affliction, but because this process is essential to their final victory.

‘He’ could not, consistently with ‘His’ own glory; shield them from temptation; for the very object of the trial is to prepare them to resist all the allurements of evil.

Satan is well aware that the weakest soul who abides in ‘Christ’ is more than a match for the hosts of darkness – should he reveal himself, he would be met and resisted.

No woman, man, or child is safe for a day or an hour without prayer. Satan is an expert in quoting scripture, placing his own interpretations upon passages, by which he hopes to cause us to stumble.

It is certain that the devils have a profound knowledge of all things. No theologian can interpret the “Holy Scriptures” better than they can; no lawyer has a more detailed knowledge of testaments, contracts, and actions; no physician of philosopher can better understand the virtues of the heavens, the stars, birds, fishes, trees, herbs, metals, and stones.

Satan possesses great courage, incredible cunning, superhuman wisdom, the most acute penetration, consummate prudence, an incomparable skill in veiling the most pernicious artifices under a specious disguise, and a malicious and infinite hatred toward the human race, implacable and incurable!”

“It Is Better To Rule In Hell Than To Serve In Heaven!”

We should all study the (Bible, Qur’an, The Torah, E. G. White, etc.) ‘Holy Books’ with humility of heart and never losing sight of our dependence upon ‘God.’

While we must constantly guard against the devices of Satan, we should pray in faith continually:

“Lead Us Not Into Temptation!”

Being “The First People” we have been placed in a position, a time, and a place of “Infinite Proportions” that only ‘GOD’ can undo!

We have survived every assault that man has afflicted upon us and survived. We have survived this current ‘MAAFA’ as we (a diversity of good people, God-Loving People) will survive this atrocity that is afflicted upon us today, tomorrow, and into infinity…with “The Grace of God!”

This project series will be presented in part, in order for those of us who haven’t a clue as to the importance of our people’s contributions in and to the United States as well as what we have introduced throughout the Whole World Wide!

There are many Black innovators who have not been included in the listing(s) due to lack of resource information.

Examples include the invention of ‘The Clock’ by Benjamin Banneker and the “Potato Chip” by George Crum and the first Black Woman Astronaut, Mae C. Jemison and Garrett A Morgan’s invention, the ‘Traffic Signal!

“We don’t know that things can be done, that dreams can be fulfilled, that great accomplishments can be realized, until somebody takes that first step and shows the way!”

~ Dr. Jessie Carney Smith ~

“What Is A Man/Woman Who Does Not Try To Make Things Better?”

Let Us Now Begin:

PART ONE:

“We all have our heroes and sheroes. For people who have been systematically important to remember and celebrate those who have won personal victories against the forces arrayed against them. This remembrance can take different forms. One is the folk tale. From Africa came tales of an animal – spider or rabbit – who, though cunning, triumphed over stronger predatory and dangerous animals. But apparent meekness was not the only strategy. Black people also celebrated, as openly as they dared the bold rebel who broke the bonds. Black folklore is a way of remembering in order to struggle against oppression and in the interest of building a community.

For many African Americans the first person to achieve a goal and gain recognition is ever so important as a symbol of hope and a beacon for the future. These woman and men become living proof that it is possible to crack what seems to be a monolithic system of oppression. P. B. S. Pinchback and L. Douglas Wilder are shining examples of men who joined the ranks of our heroes because they were the first to do what had never been done before by Black Americans. Pinchback was the first Black State Governor and held the appointed position in Louisiana from December 1872 to January 1873. More than a century would pass before Wilder became the first Black elected governor for the state of Virginia in 1990. Black Firsts records and celebrates the pioneers who displayed and continue to display great courage and perseverance in the face of odds that would discourage lesser souls.

Not all of the trailblazers encountered in Black Firsts set out to challenge the system directly. Many used their guile and courage to build and challenge the system directly. Many used their guile and courage to build and sustain the Black Community. And as a community, African Americans, no matter how oppressed, have always nurtured positive values that are then passed on to subsequent generations. Black Firsts records the names of African American women and men known to history who first formed the churches and built the schools and performed a myriad of other tasks without which Black Folks as a people could not have survived. In doing this, the book offers a sense of the richness of Black History and will perhaps inspire the ignorant of the forgetful to explore the past to gain insight for the present and strength for the future.”

~ Johnnetta B. Cole, President of Spelman College ~

Architecture:

1908 – Vertner W. Tandy, Sr., (1885-1949) was the first Black American architect registered in New York State. He designed Villa LeWaro, on the Hudson River, the mansion of hair care magnate Madame C. J. Walker.

Tandy also known for founding Alpha Phi fraternity at Cornell University.

1953 – Paul Revere Williams (1894-1980), was the first Black Architect to become a fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Certified in California in 1915, he designed homes and buildings for Hollywood luminaries. In addition to designing more than three thousand homes, ranging in value from ten thousand to six hundred thousand dollars, Williams served as associate architect for the fifty-million dollar Los Angeles International Airport.

1954 – Norma Merrick Sklarek (1928) was the first Black Woman registered architect. Registered in New York State and later in California (1962), she was also the first Black Woman fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1980.”

PART TWO:

Cartoons:

1910-George Herriman (1880-1944) was “The first Black” to achieve fame as a syndicated cartoonist. On July 26, 1910, the prototype of ‘Ignatz Mouse’ hit the prototype of ‘Krazy Kat’ with a brick. The strip ‘Krazy Kat’ was extremely popular in the 1920’s, especially with intellectuals, and continued with somewhat diminished success until July 25, 1944. Herriman was born in New Orleans in a family classified as Black, and the family moved to Los Angeles to escape racial labeling. Some of his friends called him “The Greek” but he never openly divulged his background.

1933-Elmer Simms Campbell (1906-1971) was “The First Black Cartoonist” to work for national publications. The St. Louis-born artist contributed cartoons and other art work to ‘Esquire,’ ‘Cosmopolitan,’ ‘Redbook,’ ‘The New Yorker,’ ‘Opportunity,’ and ‘Syndicated Features’ in 145 newspapers – (he was in nearly every issue from 1933 to 1958). Campbell created the character “Esky,” the pop-eyed mascot who appeared on the cover of ‘Esquire.’

1964-Morrie (Morris) Turner (1923), cartoonist and educator, created “Wee-Pals,” “The First Integrated Comic Strip in the World.” Influenced by Charles Schultz’s “Peanuts” and inspired by ‘Brother Dick Gregory.’ “Wee-Pals” became nationally syndicated and appeared in all of the large daily and Sunday comics. “Nippie,” the main character in “Wee-Pals” is named for the comedian ‘Nipsey Russell.’

1991-Barbara Brandon (1958) became “The First Black Woman Cartoonist” nationally syndicated in the white press. Her comic strip, “Where I’m Coming From,” appeared in the Detroit Free Press, and was acquired by Universal Press Syndicate in 1991. Brandon was born in Brooklyn, New York, and her father, Brumsic Brandon, Jr., was creator of the “Luther” comic strip which first appeared in the late 1960’s.

Circus:

1966-“The First Black Showgirl” with ‘Ringling Brothers Circus’ was ‘Toni Williams’ (1943) of Reading, Pennsylvania. Since then she has formed a trapeze act on her own.

1977-Bernice Collins (1957) was “The First Black Woman Clown with ‘Ringling Brothers.” The Kansas City native decided to become a clown when she was fourteen years old.

Adam said to his son Seth, “Thou knowest this world – that it is full of sorrow and weariness, and thou knowest all that has come upon us, from our trials in it. Therefore, I command thee to keep innocency, to be pure and just, and trusting in God; and lean not to the discourses of Satan, nor to the apparitions in which he will show himself to thee. Keep the commandments that I have given thee this day; then give the same to thy sons and daughters.

And so that this commandment abide firm among all your children; sever thy children and thy children’s children from Cain’s children; do not let them ever mix with those, nor come near them either in their words or in their deeds.”

PART THREE:

Dance:

1845-William Henry Lane (c.1825-52), “Master Juba,” was “The First Black Dance Star.” He took his stage name from the ‘African’ dance, the ‘Juba.’ In 1845, Lane won the title “King of All Dancers” after three challenge contests. He toured with three white minstrels, receiving top billing, and garnered acclaim for his 1848 performance in London. Lane died in 1852, without ever returning to the United States.

1923-In October, 1923, “Running Wild” was “The First Black Show” to introduce the ‘Charleston’ to non-Black audiences. After its appropriation by a white show in 1926, the dance achieved a world-wide popularity second only to the Black inspired ‘Tango,’ which came to Europe and America from Argentina. A third Black dance to achieve wide success in the 1920’s was the “Black Bottom,” which reached in “Dinah” at ‘Harlem’s Lafayette Theater’ in 1924. Both the Charleston and the Black Bottom were theatrical adaptations of dances known to Blacks in the South for a decade of more.

1932-Buddy (Clarence) Bradley was “The First Black to Choreograph a Show of White Dancers.” He was hired to prepare the London production of “Evergreen” for which he was in charge of sixty-four dancers. Bradley received full-credit in the program. His career from this time on was mainly in Europe, where he was an important figure in popular dance.

Hemsley Winfield (1906-1934) was “The First Black Dancer” to be involved in ballet. He choreographed and performed with his own company in the ‘Metropolitan Opera’s’ production of ‘Louis Gruenberg’s’ “The Emperor Jones.”

This was a one-time exception to the rules – management did not list the dancers in the program. The next Black dancer did not appear with the company until 1951. Winfield’s mother was a playwright, and he made his debut in one of her plays, “Wade In The Water” (1926). He became a dancer and a pioneer in Black concert dance, organizing the ‘Negro Art Theater Dance Group.’ This group gave its first concert on April 29, 1931, and appeared in ‘Hall Johnson’s’ “Run Little Chillun” in 1933.

1951-Janet Collins (1923-) was “The First Black “Prima Ballerina”” at the ‘Metropolitan Opera Company,’ a position that she held for three years. She made her debut in “Aida.” Collins was born in New Orleans on March 2, 1923, and her family later settled in Los Angeles. A graduate of Los Angeles City College and Arts Center School, Collins is known for her choreography and her dance instruction.

1958-“The First Black Dancer” in the country to become a member of a classical ballet company, the New York City Ballet, was ‘Arthur Mitchell’ (1934-). Born in New York City, Mitchell studied at the city’s High School of Performing Arts and at the School of American Ballet. He founded the “Dance Theatre of Harlem” as a school of dance – especially classical ballet for children, regardless of race. The first Black Classical Ballet Company in the United States, it made its debut at the “Guggenheim Museum of Art in York City.” In 1988 the company became the first Black cultural group to tour the ‘Soviet Union’ under the renewed cultural exchange program.

1963-Katherine Dunham (1910-) was the “First Black Choreographer” to work at the ‘Metropolitan Opera House.’ A dancer, choreographer, school founder, and anthropologist, she was born in Glen Ellyn, Illinois and graduated from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. Dunham incorporated her training in anthropology and her study of ‘African and West Indian Dances’ into her own techniques and dance instruction.

1984-The Alvin Ailey Dance Theater was the “First Black Modern Dance Troupe” to perform in the ‘Metropolitan Opera House.’ Founded in 1958 by ‘Alvin Ailey’ (1931-89), the troupe has performed before more than an estimated fifteen million people throughout the world. Ailey’s best known work, “Revelations,” based on his childhood experiences in Black Baptist Churches, was created in 1961. The dancer and choreographer was born in Rogers, Texas.

Dramatists:

1970-Maya Angelou (Marguerite Johnson, 1928), actress, dancer, and writer, was “The First Black Woman to have an ‘Original Screenplay'” produced, “Georgia, Georgia,” which she directed. Angelou was also “The First Black Woman to Have a Non-Fiction Work on the Best-Seller List.” Her autobiographical “I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings” (1970) evoked images of a ‘Black Girl’s Childhood’ in the South, and was nominated for a 1970 National Book Award and aired as a television movie in 1979. An artist of wide-ranging talents, she was nominated for a ‘Tony Award’ for acting and a ‘Pulitzer Prize’ for poetry.

Charles Gardone (1925-), playwright, was “The First Black Dramatist” to win the ‘Pulitzer Prize’ for drama, for the play “No Place To Be Somebody.”

“The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States on account of Race, Color, of previous condition of servitude!”

“The 15th Amendment to the Constitution granted African American Men the right to vote by declaring that the “right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Although ratified on February 3, 1870, the promise of the 15th Amendment would not be fully realized for almost a century. Through the use of poll taxes, literacy tests and other means, Southern states were able to effectively disenfranchise African Americans. It would take the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 before the majority of African Americans in the South were registered to vote.”

Being “The First People” we have been placed in a position, a time, and a place of “Infinite Proportions” that only ‘GOD’ can undo!

We have survived every assault that man has afflicted upon us and survived. We have survived this current ‘MAAFA’ as we (a diversity of good people, God-Loving People) will survive this atrocity that is afflicted upon us today, tomorrow, and into infinity…with “The Grace of God!”

She was born on November 9, 1922, in Cleveland, and later moved to Los Angeles From 1937 to 1964, Dandridge appeared in a number of films, often typecast in the stereotypical roles commonly given to Black actresses. In 1951 she was “The First Black” to perform in ‘The Empire Room’ of New York’s Waldorf Astoria. “Island In The Sun,” a 1957 film in which she appeared opposite white actor ‘John Justin,’ marked the first time the theme of interracial love was explored in movies. ‘Harry Belafonte’ and ‘Joan Fontaine were also paired in this film.
