Interesting Choice of Design Enhancements For New White House Fence�
Andrea Shaea King noticed some interesting new design elements in the recently upgraded fence surrounding the White House.

The New York Times has an article about Donald Trump and the GOP. Within the story on the NYT website there’s a video to give the GOP story some depth. Within the video the fence design elements were first noticed.

Some additional research into the fence and how it was upgraded for security reveals those design elements are quite factually there.

Interesting.
