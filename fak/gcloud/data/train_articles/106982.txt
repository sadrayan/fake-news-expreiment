Trump Says He’ll Be More Popular Than Fried Chicken, Watermelon in the Black Community
By Jamal Whiteman

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seems to still think he will win over black voters, even though he is currently polling at 1 percent.

In an interview with Tampa, Fla. station WFLA he was confident of gaining black votes.

“I think it’s really catching on because I see I’m going up very, very sharply with African American voters,” said Trump.

Trump later told the Conservative Chronicle that after his first term he will be extremely popular with African American voters.

“I’ll be more popular than fried chicken and watermelon in the black community,” he said.

Trump has recently been pushing hard for the African American vote. But he has been using controversial tactics. During a campaign stop in Michigan, Trump told a predominately white audience that black people had nothing to lose by voting for him.

“You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed — what the hell do you have to lose?” said Trump, according to a CNN article.

However, Trump seems to be playing both sides against the middle. At the same time he is appealing to black voters, he has embraced white nationalists. He regularly retweets white supremacist messages and Steve Bannon, the new CEO of the Trump campaign, turned Breitbart into a hot bed of white nationalism. Also, black people have been assaulted at Trump rallies and assailed with ethnic slurs.
