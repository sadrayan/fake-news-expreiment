"It's been pretty clear that secondhand smoke is detrimental to the health of children,” Dr. Caleb Buege said.

A lawyer and paralegal in Shepherdsville teamed up to help protect children from secondhand smoke.

“When you talk to day care owners, when you talk to school principals, they will tell you that this is a major problem and something needs to be done,” Attorney Joe Mills said.

Mills and Gloria Taft drafted an ordinance to prevent people from smoking in cars with children.

Three council members voted in favor of the ordinance, one opposed it.

Council Member Gloria Taft said the ordinance violates civil liberties.

“I understand the premise is to take care of children, but these people smoke in their homes as well as in their cars. At what point does the government stop,” Gloria Taft said.

"Of course we met resistance about infringing on rights, but for the most part, the response we got from people was it's the right of the child to have smoke free air,” legal assistant Kalynn Walls said.

According to the ordinance, drivers must be pulled over for another reason before they can be fined.

Drivers can be fined up to $250.

Taft is concerned about the effect the ordinance will have on visitors.

“There's no way for them to know they're entering a smoke-free-in-your-car town unless somebody pays for a billboard and that just hurts tourism,” Taft said.

But supporters of the ordinance said the safety of children is their No. 1 priority.

“I hope this idea will spread that other cities will take this idea and run with it. Other states will take this idea and run with it. The goal here is to change conduct, not generate fines," Mills said.

The amount of the fine is determined by the number of children in the car and their ages
