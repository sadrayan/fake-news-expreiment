John Kasich: Women Came Out of the Kitchen to Support Me
Ohio Governor John Kasich, who defunded Planned Parenthood yesterday, said Monday morning at a town hall in Virginia that he got elected governor to the state Senate because women “came out of their kitchens to support me.” Oh?

“I didn’t have anybody for me,” Kasich said, during a town hall at George Mason University in Fairfax this morning. “We just got an army of people who—and many women who left their kitchens to go out and go door to door and put yard signs up.”

One woman in the audience had a comment on that: “I’ll support ya,” she told him. “But I won’t be comin’ out of the kitchen.”

“I gotcha,” Kasich replied, though he probably doesn’t.

The current governor of Ohio recently shushed a female student trying to talk at a town hall at University of Richmond, telling her, “I don’t have any Taylor Swift tickets.”

It’s so impressive when someone can cram his entire foot in his mouth, isn’t it?

Update, 12:45 p.m.:

The full verbatim quote from the rally shows that Kasich was either talking about his race to the state Senate in 1978, or winning a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. We assure you women were working outside of the kitchen in both those years.
