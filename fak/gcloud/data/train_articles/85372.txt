These transitions can disrupt chronobiologic rhythms and influence the duration and quality of sleep, and the effect lasts for several days after the shifts.1,2 We examined the influence of these transitions on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction. To calculate the incidence ratio, we compared the incidence of acute myocardial infarction during each of the first 7 days after the spring or . . .
