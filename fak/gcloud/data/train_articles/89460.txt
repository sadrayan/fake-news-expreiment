Arthur I. Cyr: Cuba-U.S. ties shift with favorable winds
Winds of change are blowing in the Caribbean, and warming the historically rigid and frigid relations between Cuba and the United States.

Winds of change are blowing in the Caribbean, and warming the historically rigid and frigid relations between Cuba and the United States. On Dec. 17, President Barack Obama announced plans to resume diplomatic relations, along with an exchange of imprisoned individuals.

Obama urged Congress to act to lift the embargo of Cuba, which has been in place since late in the Eisenhower administration. He stated our country has been alone in pursuing that policy, reflecting news media commentaries.

Actually, that is false. Israel has been a consistent strong supporter of this � and other � U.S. policies.

But other nations do not support us, and realism urges flexibility. Increased trade and investment provides political leverage, and encourages freedom. Havana has become extremely active in opening their ramshackle economy.

Cuba�s President Raul Castro made noteworthy news by announcing in February 2013 that he will retire from that office in 2018. His older brother Fidel stepped down from the same post in 2008, after reaching age 85.

October 2012 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the world stood right at the edge of general nuclear war. This was a singular event, but also part of a long history of difficulties between the two countries.

Raul Castro by all accounts lacks the remarkable charismatic appeal of his older brother Fidel, but he has been effective. After the victory of the revolution in early 1959, he handled bloody mass executions with efficient dispatch, and since has run the military and pervasive security apparatus.

The Castro brothers quickly ended hopes for representative democracy and nationalized major industries, including U.S. corporate assets. Fidel Castro highlighted alliance with the Soviet Union by joining Nikita Khrushchev in a raucous 1960 visit to the United Nations. The New York session was punctuated by the Soviet leader publicly pounding a shoe on a desk (while wearing two shoes).

The Eisenhower administration began a secret intensive effort to overthrow the increasingly radical regime. The successor Kennedy administration drastically escalated such efforts. The disastrous failed Bay of Pigs invasion plagued President Kennedy until the missile crisis success.

Collapse of the Soviet Union ended vital economic support. Since then, the evolution of the Americas toward democratic governments has been striking. Cuba in consequence has become more isolated politically.

When Fidel Castro stepped down, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in a formal public statement endorsed the desirability of �peaceful, democratic change� in Cuba and also suggested that the international community work with the people there. The Bush administration began to bend a particularly restrictive hard line toward that island nation.

Obama early in his first term loosened continuing tight restrictions on interchange with Cuba. Cuban-Americans are allowed to travel and send financial remittances to relatives still living there. These are not prohibited by the Helms-Burton Act, passed during the Clinton administration. The real purpose of the law was to court the anti-Castro Cuban population of electorally pivotal Florida.

Cuba today encourages trade and investment along with steadily relaxing travel restrictions. In this context, the American economy has great advantages. As part of new efforts, we should work to expand cultural and educational as well as personal family exchanges with the island. President Dwight D. Eisenhower initiated comparable programs with the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War, to great benefit.

As Ike saw, the arts and science represent universal languages. The wisest warriors appreciate peace.
