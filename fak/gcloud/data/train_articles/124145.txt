Trump NFL Tweets Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria Impact
Journalists everywhere should hold the president accountable for not doing more. But once again, the media is distracted by Trump's BS. The five main political talk shows on Sunday spent less than a minute talking about the crisis in Puerto Rico. In yesterday's edition of The New York Times the front page was all about the NFL, while the story about Puerto Rico was below the fold. (Even more frustrating when you consider that more Puerto Ricans live in New York than in any other state.) Even Refinery29 has done less coverage on Maria than we did on Irma and Harvey. As of Monday afternoon, we had published exactly five stories about Hurricane Maria â€” and two were about Jennifer Lopez.
