Steve Biko Foundation
The Steve Biko Foundation

Established in 1998, the Steve Biko Foundation is a community development organization inspired by the legacy of Bantu Stephen Biko. Its vision is to be the premier independent promoter of the values Steve Biko lived and died for: restoring people to their true humanity. The Foundation focuses its work on reducing inequality, strengthening democracy and promoting the intangible aspects of development: history, identity, culture and values - the issues that speak to the soul of the nation.
