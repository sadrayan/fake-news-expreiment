Web Extra: Gov. Bruce Rauner full interview
Local 4 News had a 10-minute conversation with Illinois governor Bruce Rauner that covered the upcoming election and his decision to deposit $50 million into his campaign account.

Rauner responded to questions about the recent significant turmoil in his campaign that added four people to high-ranking positions. Three of them are from the far right or Libertarian think tank known as the Illinois Policy Institute. The governor was asked whether this shift is a sign his administration is in chaos as some political observers suggest or if the policies promoted by the Illinois Policy Institute are the type of policies he will pursue for the rest of his term.

Rauner sidestepped a question regarding the hiring of communications assistant Brittany Carl. Carl has taken heat recently for comments she made on a conservative blog before joining the Rauner Administration. Carl compared abortion to Nazi Germany's process of eugenics. Rauner did not answer when asked if she's staying with the administration.
