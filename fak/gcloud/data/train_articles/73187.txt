Women's Rights
Charlie supports a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions — as Governor, he vetoed a measure that required women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound, a law that Rick Scott signed. Charlie believes that government should stay out of personal health decisions between a woman and her doctor.

He supports equal pay for equal work, and is a proud supporter of the Violence Against Women Act.

Rick Scott, meanwhile, signed wildly anti-choice bills that open the door to governmental interference between a woman and her doctor. He also vetoed $1.5 million from the state’s budget for rape crisis prevention centers.
