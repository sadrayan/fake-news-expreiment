Donald Trump Is Not My President
Not one time did these “good Americans” become outraged at the Catholic Church when they found out about the priests abusing children. Not one time did these “good Americans” boycott and/or stop eating at Subway when Jared was arrested for the trash he

did. Not one of these “good Americans” worried when Donnie Dumbass refused to fly the flag at half staff for a decorated veteran. Please miss me with this fake outrage bullshit. It’s just further proof that it was NEVER about the flag, or patriotism, or the military, or veterans. It was ALWAYS about the color of the skin of the man who really started the fire!
