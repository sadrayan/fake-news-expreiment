Giant George, Guinness World Record, Tallest Dog
Giant George was the Guinness Book of World Records Tallest dog from 2010 - 2012. He made appearances on many TV shows such as The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, The Today Show, Regis and Kelley, Animal Planet, and many more. George passed away in 2013 and lived to be almost eight years old. He has become somewhat of a legend with a huge internet following, championing the idea that when our pets pass away, they are happy, safe, and restored to full health and strength on a place called the Rainbow Bridge; eventually being reunited with their human companions. Thousands of pet owners have sent messages to George on his Facebook Page asking George to welcome their pets when they cross over.
