The New Jersey Audubon Society is a privately supported, not-for profit, statewide membership organization. Founded in 1897, and one of the oldest independent Audubon societies, New Jersey Audubon has no connection with the National Audubon Society.

The New Jersey Audubon Society fosters environmental awareness and a conservation ethic among New Jersey's citizens; protects New Jersey's birds, mammals, other animals, and plants, especially endangered and threatened species; and promotes preservation of New Jersey's valuable natural habitats.

In order to achieve its purpose, New Jersey Audubon, through its Board of Directors, professional staff, members, and volunteers, endeavors to:

Develop, encourage, and support sound conservation practices, programs, and legislation.

Disseminate information on the natural environment through education programs, information services, and publications.

Advance knowledge of New Jersey's flora and fauna, and their relationships to the habitats on which they depend, through field research.

Acquire, establish, and maintain wildlife sanctuaries and educational centers.

New Jersey Audubon maintains stewardship of 34 sanctuaries and conducts its programs through seven staffed facilities.

The objectives of the Society are implemented by its professional staff under the leadership of its Executive Director and supervision of an elected, voluntary Board of Directors.
