North Carolina Democratic Party
Health care is a right, not a privilege. Everyone should have access to affordable, quality health care no matter how much money they have. And those dealing with substance abuse issues like opioids should be met with compassion, not contempt, and offered the help they need.

Democrats are fighting to protect the ACA â€“ and to build on it by expanding Medicaid and bring care to thousands more low-income people.
