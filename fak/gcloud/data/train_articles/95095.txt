Donald Trump says he understands Russia, and in an interview Thursday, he offered a glimpse of where his expertise derives from.

“I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Bret Baier Thursday night.

The comments came after Baier asked if Trump had ever spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this week, Trump declined to say if he has ever met Putin. In the interview with Baier, Trump said he still wouldn't say because "I don't want to hurt his confidence."

“OK, so you got to talk to him?” Baier asked Trump after he said he had hosted Miss Universe.

“No, I got to meet a lot of people. And you know what? They want to be friendly with the United States,” Trump said. “ Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with somebody?”

Trump sold the Miss Universe organization in September 2015.
