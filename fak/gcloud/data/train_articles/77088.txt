2016 Presidential Form 2 Filers

The table below lists all individuals who have filed a Statement of Candidacy (FEC Form 2) with the FEC to register as a 2016 presidential candidate.



Each individual who is a candidate for federal office must file an FEC Form 2 within 15 days of becoming a candidate. The candidate may file this form on paper or electronically. Paper filers may choose to send a letter that contains the information required on the FEC Form 2, in lieu of the form itself.



Under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), an individual becomes a candidate for federal office when:

The individual has received contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or made expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000; or



The individual has given consent to another person to receive contributions or make expenditures on behalf of him or herself and that person has received contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or made expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000 (11 CFR 100.3(a)).



Funds received and payments made for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate are not considered "contributions" or "expenditures" that may trigger candidacy. However, only funds permissible under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act) may be used for these exploratory activities. See 11 CFR 100.72 and 100.131 for further information. To obtain a list of 2012 presidential candidates, visit the 2012 Presidential Statements of Candidacy page.
