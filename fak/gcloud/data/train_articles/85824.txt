The Dino Directory
Jurassic Period (201 to 145 million years ago)

At the end of the Triassic Period there was a mass extinction, the causes of which are still hotly debated. Many large land animals were wiped out but the dinosaurs survived, giving them the opportunity to evolve into a wide variety of forms and increase in number.

The single land mass, Pangaea, split into two, creating Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. Despite this separation, similarities in the fossil records show that there were land bridges between the two continents.

Temperatures fell slightly, although it was still warmer than today due to higher amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Rainfall increased as a result of the large seas appearing between the land masses.

These changes allowed plants such as ferns and horsetails to grow over huge areas. Some of this vegetation became the fossil fuels that we mine today. Elsewhere there were forests of tall conifer trees such as sequoias and monkey puzzles.

The plentiful plant supply allowed the huge plant-eating sauropods – such as Apatosaurus, Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus – to evolve. These are the largest animals to have ever walked the Earth. By the end of the Jurassic their herds dominated the landscape.
