State of Illinois FY2017 Recommended Operating Budget: Analysis and Recommendations
The Civic Federation is unable to support Governor Rauner’s recommended budget for FY2017 because it has an operating deficit of at least $3.5 billion and presents an insufficiently detailed plan for closing the gap.

According to the report, the $3.5 billion deficit appears to be significantly understated, because it does not fully account for the actual cost of essential State services. Illinois’ backlog of bills could grow as high as $12.8 billion by the end of FY2017 under the plan. This budget as proposed would not move Illinois forward and would lead to further deterioration of the State’s finances. It would generate billions in additional unpaid bills and continue to count on future years’ revenues to pay for current, unmanaged obligations.

The Civic Federation presented its comprehensive plan for the State of Illinois in February when it released its State budget roadmap for FY2017. Spending controls are at the center of the Federation’s plan, but more revenue is needed to help reduce the operating deficit in FY2016, close the gap in FY2017 and pay down the backlog of bills.

Illinois' Fiscal Year begins July 1, 2016 and ends June 30, 2017.
