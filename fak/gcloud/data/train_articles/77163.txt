Dolphins stadium reno would create 4,000 jobs, says Dolphins website
Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross may not have a good reason for why Miami taxpayers should give him $200 million to renovate his privately owned stadium, but one thing he has got? A website!

The Miami Dolphins have created a website and social media campaign designed to bolster public opinion in their favor. MiamiFirst.com launched on Monday, when Dolphins owner Stephen Ross held a press conference announcing the team’s stadium renovation plan and proposal to fund it partially from additional state sales tax rebates and a hike in local hotel taxes.

In addition to a slew of crappy renderings — apparently one main goal of stadium renovations is so that Sun Life Stadium can host lo-res soccer games in the middle of a confetti storm — there’s an “economic impact” page that promises “JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!” How many jobs? Four thousand of them, though it doesn’t say how many of them would be part-time or only for the course of the construction work. It also cites the Florida tourism board as estimating that “every eighty visitors we attract to the State of Florida generate enough economic impact to support one full-time job,” which by calculating backwards we can assume means Ross thinks a renovated stadium will draw 320,000 additional visitors to Florida per year. That’s for a team that only draws 450,000 fans a season, even while selling out three-quarters of its capacity. Maybe he’s figuring people will come just to point and laugh.
