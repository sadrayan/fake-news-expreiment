Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV)
LOCATION: Puna, Hawaii Island (Kilauea East Rift Zone)

ENERGY SOURCE: Geothermal steam and hot liquid

TECHNOLOGY: Steam turbine generators

CONTRACT CAPACITY: 38 megawatts

POWER PURCHASE TYPE: Firm and as available

DESCRIPTION: PGV is a geothermal energy conversion plant bringing steam and hot liquid up through underground wells. The hot liquid (brine) is not used for electricity at this time. The steam is directed to a turbine generator that produces electricity.

The exhaust steam from this turbine is used to vaporize (heat) an organic working fluid, which drives a second turbine, generating additional electricity. The condensed steam from the organic fluid heat exchanger is re-injected into the ground through reinjection wells along with the brine.

The electricity generated by PGV is sold to Hawaii Electric Light Company and distributed to customers.
