Trump Fact Check: San Diego County Did Not Ask For Border Wall
President Trump said Wednesday that San Diego has asked him to start building its section of the border wall; a San Diego County spokesman told KPBS that the county has not made any such request.

The San Diego County Board of Supervisors did vote to support a federal lawsuit against California sanctuary laws last month, but that didn’t include a request for the wall.

"This county has taken no action with regard to the wall," said County spokesman Michael Workman.

The projects in question involve replacing 14 miles of primary border fencing along San Diego County's border, and eventually 14 miles of secondary fencing that runs parallel to the main fence. Congress authorized funding for fiscal years 2017 and 2018.

A spokesman for San Diego sector's Border Patrol said the agency was aware of "nothing new" in regards to the projects and that they do not yet have a start date for construction.

Here’s what President Trump told reporters in the White House:

“San Diego has asked us to go forward with their section of the wall in California.”

San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer has repeatedly called for "building bridges" at the border rather than walls. Last year, the city signed a memorandum of understanding with Tijuana, Mexico to increase cross-border cooperation.

A White House official told KPBS on background that the president might have been referring to some San Diego area residents.

President Trump says "San Diego" asked him to move forward on the border wall here. A San Diego County spokesman clarified that the county made no such request.
