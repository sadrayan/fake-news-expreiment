Panel of 16 Judges Agrees: Barr Has Enough to Indict Clinton and Obam…
A panel of 16 judges convened yesterday to process the information available to Attorney General Barr and their conclusion was unanimous: There is plenty of evidence to indict Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for Conspiracy to Create a False Conspiracy, a 2nd-degree felony with a 10-year mandatory minimum.

The judges all agreed that the initial dossier narrative used to obtain a wiretap of the Trump campaign was most likely bogus and that the conclusions inferred from any gathered from them is, therefore, fruit of the poisonous tree and not admissible in court.

The Trump Administration was quick to issue a statement through Director of Information and Propaganda, Art Tubolls:

“We are as pleased as ever that we are once again shown to have never done anything outside the law — ever. At this point, President Trump is innocent of so many things it will be difficult to justify how he couyld possibly be guilty of anything.”

It’s a brilliant statement. It makes perfect sense, and it tested very well with the base. Circular logic makes politics much easier for the common American.

The panel of judges also concluded that the election wasn’t fixed, that Hillary Clinton’s 3 million vote “win” were most likely illegal and she still lost, and that the movement by the states to ban abortion is a brilliant way to bring Roe before Trump’s new Supreme Court.

Each judge was compensated $400K from the Justice Department’s consulting fund. As retired conservatives appointed by Republicans below the Mason-Dixon Line, they were rated unbiased by the PEW Research Center.
