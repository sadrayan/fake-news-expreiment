TEMPE -- A Corona del Sol High School student shot himself Tuesday morning, according to Tempe police.

School officials called police just before 9 a.m. and reported a student holding a weapon while standing in a campus breezeway, said Molly Enright, a Tempe police spokeswoman.

A school resource officer saw the distraught male student standing with a gun and tried to talk to him but the student killed himself, police said.

No one else was injured, Enright said. The campus was secured and remained on lockdown until about 10:15 a.m. as a precautionary measure.

Tempe police asked any parents coming to the school to gather at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints location near Knox Road and Stanley Place.

Police identified the student early Tuesday afternoon as 18-year-old Marcus Wheeler.

Corona del Sol senior basketball player Isiah Bolden said he talked to Wheeler, who was a standout athlete at the school, on Tuesday morning, as he does every morning. Bolden said there was no sign that Wheeler was depressed or distraught.

"I wish he did show a sign so I could have talked to him," Bolden said.

Moments leading up to the shooting and the immediate aftermath played out on social-media accounts of students, parents and those affiliated with the school.

The lockdown happened during a class period. After the intercom announced there had been an incident, Aerienne Noyes, a sophomore who had a class with Wheeler, said her teacher let the students use their phones while they stayed in the classroom.

She said details started to surface as the students looked on Twitter and talked to each other about what happened.

"It was just a really sad tragedy," Noyes said.

Bolden said he heard about the suicide in his second-hour class and immediately broke down.

"This was so unexpected," he said. "He was a winner. He really enjoyed running and was one of the best at it.

"Everyone at Corona enjoyed his presence. He was a very likable person."

Tempe Union High School governing board president Moses Sanchez said a Corona student alerted him on social media about an incident on campus before the shooting took place.

Sanchez said that because the school was on lock down, no students witnessed the shooting.

Reaction to Wheeler's death also started to emerge from around the country, particularly from his former teammates.

Tevin Mayfield, who was part of Corona del Sol's Division I state championship track team last season and is now a freshman at Colorado State, said he talked to the victim almost every day.

"(He) is a little brother to me," Mayfield said in an electronic message. "I am overwhelmed with shock.

"He's the type of friend I would go to war with any day, because I know he would sacrifice himself to have my back."

The incident prompted athletic officials to cancel a high-school playoff baseball game in which Corona was scheduled to play on Tuesday. The games were rescheduled for Wednesday afternoon at Maryvale Stadium.

In response to the suicide, a dedicated, 24-hour crisis line was established at 1-800-203-2273 and other resources area available online at http://www.crisisnetwork.org or www.mercymaricopa.org.

Authorities also sent a mobile crisis team to the Tempe campus to assess the students' needs.

Mental-health professionals said it is important to remember that people experience and react to traumatic events in a variety of ways, some of which might not become evident for days or weeks. The responses can impact witnesses, friends, relatives and even those who see coverage in the media.

Common reactions to trauma can vary. They may include:

•Fear, anxiety or depression

•Nausea, dizziness, changes in appetite or sleep patterns

•Withdrawal from daily activities

•Symptoms of avoidance, including staying away from places related to the trauma or feeling detached

•Emotional outbursts or being easily startled

•Mood shifts or confusion

•Lack of concentration, not feeling like "yourself"

Here are ways to cope:

•Understand that these reactions are normal, especially soon after the traumatic event

•Keep up your usual routine

•Be with other people. Don't isolate yourself

•Exercise, try to relax and be kind to yourself

•Allow yourself to feel bad, but recognize that some things are beyond your control

•Try to face your fears and try not to shy away from situations, people and places that may remind you of the trauma

•Reach out to family, friends and your faith community for support. Talk about your feelings and what you're experiencing

•Seek trained help if you feel you need it by reaching out to a crisis line or mental-health center
