Barack Obama: ‘If Michelle Nunn wins, that means … we can keep on doing some good work.’
JACKSON — We told you earlier this week about President Barack Obama’s call-in to V-103 in Atlanta to fire up Democratic base voters, in lieu of an in-person visit.

The audio of the interview belatedly posted today and it included a quote coming to an attack ad near you:

“If Michelle Nunn wins, that means that Democrats keep control of the Senate. And that means that we can keep on doing some good work. So it is critically important to make sure that folks vote.”

Republican U.S. Senate hopeful David Perdue, who has owned the fact that he’s running against Obama as much as he’s running against Nunn, is already using the quote on the campaign trail. Here’s what he said this afternoon at a car dealership in Jackson:

“I’m running against a woman who now the president said is his. He said his policies are on the ballot in this race, it’s pretty clear. And this week he even said he needs Michelle Obama — Michelle Nunn, I’m sorry. He needs Michelle Nunn to go to Washington — you’d think one would be enough. He wants Michelle Nunn to go to Washington to help him continue these policies. The arrogance. “However you want to look at this thing — foreign policy, immigration, health care, education, debt and the economy — we’re not going in the right direction. And he wants Michelle Nunn to go with him to Washington to help him continue to do good things. I’m sorry, I don’t see it that way.”
