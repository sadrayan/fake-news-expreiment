Dr. Drennon:

Hello from the Austin newspaper and the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project. I write at the suggestion of Patti Radle as we evaluate the accuracy of candidate Lupe Valdez’s statement that she comes from the poorest ZIP code in San Antonio, 78207.

It would improve our story to share your perspective on this—including information on how the area within the ZIP code became (and persisted as) among the poorest in the city.

We count on attributable on-the-record information for our stories. I am trying to complete our review early this week.

I’d be happy to hear back by phone or email.

Thanks,

g.

Historically 78207 has been the poorest in San Antonio, and one of the poorest urban zip codes in the country. When it was originally built in the early part of the 20th century, most of it was NOT deed restricted, yet was situated amongst deed restricted neighborhoods. In addition, the lots were smaller and the infrastructure nearly nonexistent. That resulted in a non-Angle population living in very humble housing which was later redlined and thus denied capital for re-hab or upgrades. Due to local and federal policies like these, wealth was racialized, such that today this area is both poor and non-white. The housing was never replaced, thus it continues to house some of our poorest families.
