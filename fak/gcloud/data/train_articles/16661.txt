As it sits now one of the if not the most overrated historical site to visit in the USA. They need to rebuild the original footprint of the fort, show where the battle took place and make it worthy of the travel it takes to get there. It's an important site and should be hallowed ground.... it's just a shell and a tourist trap... Ripleys is litterally at the doorstep. Sad

The Alamo is a very sad reminder of what it really means to the City... Money. The city has snow cone vendors stationed on sacred grounds where soldiers fought and died. Theres plenty of Vending machines

along the walls with a store, where Soldiers fought, defended and died. In that store, You can purchase over priced crap like Coon skin caps, plastic Bowie knives and pick up advertised flyers, for stores, hotels and restaurants that are located in the surrounding areas. The commercialism that surrounds the Alamo is a disgrace and an embarrassment. Absolutely NO consideration for the lives that brutally ended, in battle.

This was a disappointment when compared with other surviving missions in the San Antonio area. It seemed that modernity overwhelmed the historical identity of the place. Commercialization and the surrounding city has overwhelmed.

The Alamo itself is interesting to see, it's just too bad that it's surrounding area is such a tourist trap. It's good for the local economy, though. The River Walk is kind of cool, but again, it's been overdone with bars, restaurants and gift shops. Shoot, the Alamo itself has a gift shop, although I didn't see the inside.

IMO- The updating and landscaping takes away from what I would consider to be authentic. Seems too artificial and lacks realism.

My sister and I hadn't been to the Alamo since the late 1990s and were super excited for her son to see it in person. We were both shocked on everything that has been built up around it and how fake it seemed to us. It was almost like a movie set and not a good one.

Thankfully my sister and I have our great memories of visiting and are glad that we do have those.

It was terrible. No place to park. Can't see it even from the road due to blocking it off. Bumper to bumper traffic. Left without getting to see anything�

History was good but it's been turned into a tourist trap. It was beautiful and interesting but not sure if I'd visit again.

One of those places "you should go" but it pales in comparison to some of the other Missions in the area. Very crowded and underwhelming. Go to say you have, but don't expect it to be earth shattering.

I went to the Alamo in March 1993. I was pretty let down. It was a large, empty building that smelled like a cellar. The grounds were beautiful, but the structure itself was disappointing.

Absolutely boring and overhyped. Visit the other missions. They are prettier and larger.

Sadly, I was severely underwhelmed. I'm glad I visited, but the next time I come to San Antonio, it'll be for the River Walk.

Overrated

Cool architecture but it way overrated and crowded not much to see for the trouble. I would say go early in the morning on a weekday if possible.

Small but worth the visit

This was not quite what I expected, very small and not much to see but it is a historic landmark worth the visit if you are in the area.

Alamo Visit

The Alamo mission its self is well worth a visit . The disappointment is how close other buildings have been allowed to be built so close to what should be a national monument .the entry to mission is free but we took the audio guide which you pay for but is worth it .

Worth a Stop but Not too Exciting

The Alamo, as a historical building, is definitely worth checking out, but don’t expect to spend much time there. It’s relatively small and there isn’t anything particularly important on display. Still, it’s an icon, and it does make you think of the historic battle that took place there.

A tourist spot

Maybe because I am not into history did not see the big to do about this place. It was OK. not something I would do again.

Not worth the drive

Unless you are close by, do not make the drive. The history of the area is good but not worth the time to travel there...especially if you have kids--they will get bored fast!

The Alamo

Glad it's free. Really not much to see. 20 minutes and you are done.

Worth it for the pic in front of the building

There is not a lot to see here surprisingly. They provide an interesting history of the conflict that lead up to and followed the massacre at the Alamo, but it only took us about an hour to get through everything. Its still a must see location in San Antonio, and its free, but temper your expectations if you haven't been here before.

A bit disappointing

This really felt like it was more about making money, selling tours and cheap souvenirs than about honoring and preserving history. If you want to see real history then tour the missions on the south end of town and just do a quick walk through here.

I can say we saw it

Historical landmarks are always kind of disappointing when in the middle of a city you know grew up around it. This is no exception. All the pictures you see are angled in such a way that you don't see its sandwiched between larger, modern buildings. That being said, i can say I've seen the Alamo and have pics to prove it. Just a shame the city had to swallow it up.

I expected more

Considering the significant historical importance of the place of Texas I expected more. The shrine is too dark and does not show too much about the events and protagonist. Too much room for the gift shop .The exhibition of Bowie was very well presented

Disappointing

Let me start by saying that I rarely share my negative comments because sometimes," its just me". This may be the case with The Alamo. My expectations were something else. I don't deny that the backstory with regard to Texas history is significant but it did not grab me. I spent 1/2 hour of quality time there and then another hour trying to find what I was apparently missing. To no avail. Yes, it's something to see if you happen to be in San Antonio but it wasn't all that interesting to me. Sorry Texas but I tried !

Not much to see

I'm glad the Alamo was close to other sites we wanted to see. I expected something more than what I saw. It took about 15 minutes to go through the whole thing.

Not worth the visit

Not that historic unless maybe you are a native Texan. Definitely not worth time spent trying to find parking.

Over rated

I've been to the Alamo several times and it never ceases to underwhelm. Skip the Alamo and go see the missions.

Boring

We spent about 20 minutes here and was ready to leave. They don't allow pictures inside the building. We did the audio tour and it just wasn't interesting. Of course, you can't go to San Antonio without seeing The Alamo. It was disappointing.

OK attraction, but don't center your day on it

It was somewhat interesting, but not a real attention getter and not a lot to see. I would not plan to spend a lot of time here. But certainly glad I can say I was there.

A little underwhelming

The grounds are pretty but the museum could use more literature around the history. I would suggest a guided tour. It wouldn't take very long to get through.

A little disappointing

It's a landmark. It's history. It's also in the middle of town and not that informative. We thought there would be more to see. Glad there are other activities in the area.

Beautiful but not what I imagined.

This is really right down town across from shop and with in walking distance to River Walk. Just not much to it.

Not Sure What To Expect

I was in San Antonio for a business trip and The Alamo was just a few blocks away, so decided to walk over and check it out. It was a little confusing where to start as people were walking around the grounds and standing in lines to get into the church. It was a really hot day, so I walked around the outside in the shaded areas. I can't say I saw anything that made me want to stop and go inside, so my stay was short. I did check out the gift shop but the prices were really high, even for a gift shop, so I didn't purchase anything. Not something I would recommend to friends and family.

Another Tourist Trap

It is just another tourist trap. Historical building and that is all. Love the shopping options around The Alamo.
