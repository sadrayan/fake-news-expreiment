Introduction

Welcome to the USDA Animal Care Public Search Tool.

Here you will find information and records that shed light on the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS) administration of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). APHIS’ Animal Care program is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the AWA, including establishing acceptable standards of humane care and treatment for regulated animals and monitoring and achieving compliance through inspections, enforcement, education, and cooperative efforts.

The AWA and its associated regulations seek to ensure the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation of certain warmblooded animals used or intended for use in research, exhibition, or as pets. Animal dealers and exhibitors must obtain a license, and research facilities, carriers, and intermediate handlers must obtain a registration. Animal Care inspectors conduct inspections of licensee and registrant animals, records, and facilities to assess compliance with the AWA and its regulations, and document their observations and professional assessments in inspection reports. Licensees and registrants must notify Animal Care of changes in their operations and file periodic updates with Animal Care, including annual reports of animal use by research facilities.

This Public Search Tool provides a list of persons licensed and registered under the AWA, inspection reports, and research facility animal use annual reports. Individuals or businesses seeking information or records that are not available through this Public Search Tool may be able to find what they are looking for elsewhere on APHIS’ website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare, or by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Information on how to submit a FOIA request to APHIS can be found at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/foia.
