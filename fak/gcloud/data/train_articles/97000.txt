Tax-Free Savings Account
Economic Action Plan 2015 proposes to increase the Tax-Free Savings Account annual contribution limit to $10,000, effective for the 2015 taxation year.

Canadians have many reasons to save at every stage of life. These can include saving for retirement, to start a business, to purchase a home or car, or for a vacation. Reducing taxes on savings can help Canadians achieve their goals, while also promoting investment, economic growth and jobs.

In Budget 2008 the Government introduced the Tax-Free Savings Account ( TFSA ). Available since January 1, 2009, the TFSA is a flexible, registered general-purpose savings vehicle that allows Canadian residents aged 18 or older to earn tax-free investment income, including interest, dividends and capital gains. TFSAs can include a wide range of investment options such as mutual funds, Guaranteed Investment Certificates, publicly traded shares and bonds. Contributions to a TFSA are not tax-deductible, but investment income earned in a TFSA and withdrawals from it are tax-free. Unused TFSA contribution room is carried forward and the amount of withdrawals from a TFSA can be re-contributed in future years.

The TFSA provides greater savings incentives for low- and modest-income individuals because, in addition to the tax savings, neither the income earned in a TFSA nor withdrawals from it affect eligibility for federal income-tested benefits and credits, such as the Canada Child Tax Benefit, the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax Credit, the Age Credit, and Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement benefits.

Canadians have embraced the TFSA for their savings needs. As of the end of 2013, nearly 11 million individuals had opened a TFSA and the total value of assets held in TFSAs was nearly $120 billion.

The TFSA is a popular means of saving for Canadians at all income levels. Individuals with annual incomes of less than $80,000 accounted for more than 80 per cent of all TFSA holders and about 75 per cent of TFSA assets as of the end of 2013. About half of TFSA holders had annual incomes of less than $42,000.

At the end of 2013, about 1.9 million individuals had contributed the maximum amount to their TFSAs. About 46 per cent of these individuals were seniors and over 70 per cent were aged 55 or over.

Furthermore, about 60 per cent of the individuals contributing the maximum amount to their TFSAs had incomes of less than $60,000 in 2013.

The TFSA was introduced with an annual contribution limit of $5,000, indexed to inflation in $500 increments. Due to indexation, on January 1, 2013, the TFSA annual contribution limit increased to $5,500.

Economic Action Plan 2015 proposes to increase the TFSA annual contribution limit to $10,000, effective for the 2015 and subsequent taxation years.

In combination with other registered savings plans, a $10,000 TFSA annual contribution limit will allow most Canadians to save a significant proportion of their annual incomes in a tax-efficient manner. In this context, the annual limit will not be indexed to inflation. It is estimated that this measure will reduce federal revenues by about $1.1 billion over the 2015–16 to 2019–20 period.
