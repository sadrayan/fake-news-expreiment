Edward Snowden tweeted gibberish and people are trying to figure out what it all means
If you're a fan of puzzles, Edward Snowden may have just ruined your Friday.

The former National Security Agency contractor turned whistleblower tweeted out a string of letters and numbers, which was either the result of him sitting on his phone or some cryptic code. Then, within minutes, he deleted it.

This isn't a code you can crack with Google (we tried), so therefore the people of the internet started falling over themselves to work out what the hell it meant. So far, there has been little success.

Crowdsourcing has been known to solve huge problems like this before. Remember the dress? We solved that problem quickly. Marina Joyce? Yeah, armchair detectives had that worked out.

Here's a look at the legit attempts to crack Snowden's code. Let's be real, he probably just left Twitter open in his pocket.

A code for nukes.

A digital signature.

Another Marina Joyce conspiracy theory.

It's a trap.

He had a big night out in Russia.

He has a new Netflix show (this was tweeted the day before):

At this rate, we may never crack the code. Send help.
