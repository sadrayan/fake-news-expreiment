The Peanut Allergy Epidemic: What's Causing It and How to Stop It: Heather Fraser, Woody Fraser-Boychuck, Janet Levatin: 9781632203571: Amazon.com: Books
Fraser has created a necessary text for anyone concerned with allergies, anaphylaxis, or the rise in life-threatening reactions to peanuts, which has become widespread and epidemic.” Mark Blaxill, cofounder, Health Choice and the Canary Party; coauthor, Age of Autism



Phenomenal detective work! Heather Fraser weaves history, medicine, and science into a convincing hypothesis to solve a modern medical mystery. The Peanut Allergy Epidemic explains the origins and recent dramatic rise in incidence of peanut allergy in particular, but also provides a context for a wide range of other increasingly common immunological diseases. It should be required reading for pediatricians. I hope it is read by parents and prospective parents everywhere before blindly consenting to prophylactic medical interventions for their children.” Jamie Deckoff-Jones, MD



May in time come to be recognized as a major landmark in medical history. . . . The author has shown plausible reasons that certain substances in vaccines may be playing a contributory role in many increasingly prevalent childhood health problems.” Harold E. Buttram, MD



This magnificent book is in a rare class of books that present impeccable scientific evidence in prose that is accessible to the educated lay public, while slowly unfolding a gripping mystery that grabs the reader’s attention all the way through. If Heather Fraser is right about the link between vaccines and peanut allergy, and the evidence speaks for itself, then it opens up the frightening possibility that vaccines play a major role in all the food allergies that beset today’s children.” Stephanie Seneff, PhD, senior research scientist, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory



In a world where scientific research demands thorough investigation into all causes of the allergy epidemic but one, Heather Fraser stands alone, shining her light on the stones intentionally left unturned for the last quarter of a century.” Robyn Ross, BS, JD, allergy advocate



[Fraser] masterfully demonstrates how, time and again, bizarre appearance and waning of widespread allergies to certain foods in human populations has followed the introduction and then withdrawal of specific medical formulations delivered by injection . . . The history of clinical and immunologic research illuminated by The Peanut Allergy Epidemic paves the way to finding the cause that will first be vehemently denied, then ridiculed, and finally accepted.” Tetyana Obukhanych, PhD, author, Vaccine Illusion



A compelling work on a subject that is taboo to the mainstream media.” Lawrence Solomon, columnist, Financial Post; executive director, Energy Probe
