FACT CHECK: Is This a Picture of a Bunny at a L'Oreal Animal Testing Lab?
In early 2013 an image of a suffering rabbit began to circulate online accompanied by a claim attributing the animal’s visibly poor health to laboratory testing conducted by the L’Oreal cosmetics and beauty company.

A version of the picture was posted to Twitter in February 2013, and in April 2013 the rabbit photo and rumor circulated on Tumblr and was also posted to Reddit:

When the photograph and claim spread across several social networks including Facebook in March 2015, L’Oreal responded on their own Facebook page, explaining that their cosmetics were never tested on animals except for instances in which such tests are mandated by law:

Thanks for the opportunity to clarify. L’Oreal no longer tests any of its products or any of its ingredients on animals, anywhere in the world. Nor does L’Oreal delegate this task to others. An exception could only be made if regulatory authorities demanded it for safety or regulatory purposes. You can read more about our policy here: http://bit.ly/LorealAnswers
