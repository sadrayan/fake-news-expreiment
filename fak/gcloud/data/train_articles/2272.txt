Groups air attack ads that Perlmutter's campaign says are untrue
E-mails between the players behind a health-care reform ad attacking Congressman Ed Perlmutter show they wanted the commercial to continue to run — despite concerns it contained errors — until their new spot was ready to air.

“When we do we have the new ad?�? Bruce Haynes at Purple Strategies asked on Wednesday. ” … I want to make sure this stays on till the new one ships.”

“Tomorrow,�? answered Parker resident Rich Beeson, of FLS Connect.

Perlmutter’s campaign has repeatedly asked that stations pull the initial ad, noting that 9News’ Adam Schrager had deemed claims “false�? in a truth test.

“If this ad gets ‘em this worked up, imagine what they’re gonna do when the next one goes live,�? wrote Kevin Wright, founder and director of Old Dominion Research Group.

The e-mails were also sent to Pete Meachum and Rob Collins with American Action Network, the outside group paying for more $1 million worth of attack ads against Perlmutter, a Golden Democrat running against Republican Ryan Frazier.

The new ad is as inaccurate as the first, said Perlmutter’s spokeswoman, Leslie Oliver.

It features a woman saying, “Apparently convicted rapists can get Viagra paid for by the new health-care bill.�?

Voters are then asked to call Perlmutter.

“The bill also doesn’t stop Martians masquerading as humans from getting a proctological exam,�? Oliver said. “The claims in this ad are just absurd and Ryan Frazier should condemn this ad and call on the American Action Network to disclose their donors.�?

The group has been profiled in recent stories about outside organizations raking in millions in secret donations to air attack ads, mostly against Democrats.

“This is an over the top, last minute, Hail Mary pass by a shady group of Wall Street guys who are mad at Ed for voting to reign in their risky gambling,�? Oliver said.

The first ad from American Action Network says Perlmutter “cut $500 billion in Medicare for seniors and then spent our money on health insurance for illegal immigrants.”

“Both of these claims are false,�? Schrager concluded, after reviewing the ad.
