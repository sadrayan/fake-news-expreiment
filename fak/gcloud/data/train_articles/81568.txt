Kaiser Health Tracking Poll -- February 2009 The first Kaiser Health Tracking Poll of 2009 finds the public is increasingly worried about the affordability and availability of care, with many postponing or skipping treatments due to cost in the past year and a notable minority forced into serious financial straits due to medical bills.



Slightly more than half (53%) of Americans say their household cut back on health care due to cost concerns in the past 12 months. The most common actions reported are relying on home remedies and over-the-counter drugs rather than visiting a doctor or skipping dental care.



In the face of the country’s current economic challenges the public’s support for health reform remains strong and their trust in President Obama to do the right thing in health care reform is high.



The February Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, the first in a series designed and analyzed by the Foundation’s public opinion survey research team, examines voters’ specific health care issue interests and experiences and perceptions about health care reform.
