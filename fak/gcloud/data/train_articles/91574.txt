Arkansas Secretary of State: Face Your Vote — New Voter ID Law
After January 1, 2014, Arkansas Act 595 of 2013 will require that voters show photo identification to vote.



Is it current? Is it valid?

If your photo I.D. has an expiration date, it cannot have expired more than four years before the election you’re voting in.



If you don’t have any of the types of photo I.D. shown here, contact your county clerk to get a FREE voter I.D. card before you head to the polls. (Download the Application and Oath.)
