Cryptid Museum â€“ Strange creatures found in the basement of a house in London
In 1960 in London, the workers assigned to the demolition of an old abandoned house made a strange discovery. They have found an incredible collection of fantastic creatures and strange skeletons hidden in the basement of this dilapidated house. This old house belonged to Theodore Thomas Merlin, a crypto-naturalist who during his long career has amassed numerous specimens from around the world. If these creatures thought to be nothing more than myth, the specimens of Theodore Thomas Merlin challenge our understanding of biology, chemistry and laws of physics. Elaborate jokes, weird creations of an artist or mysteries of evolution, the collection is now managed by Alex CF, curator of the Merrylin Cryptid Collection.
