Vote YES on Prop 56 to Save Lives
These claims are not only preposterous, they are insulting to those of us committed to the education and well-being of Californiaās children. We know that increasing tobacco taxes reduces youth smoking. Tobacco companies know this too. That is why they are spending millions to obfuscate the provisions of Prop 56 and mislead voters about its impact on schools. As educators, neighbors, parents and grandparents, we arenāt fooled. Tobacco companies do not care about our children, they want to create a new generation of consumers.
