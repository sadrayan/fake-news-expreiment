Leticia Van de Putte Responds to Call for National Guard on Border

San Antonio, TX -- Senator Leticia Van de Putte, Chair of the Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, and Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor, after many conversations with local, state, and federal law enforcement officials, faith and community leaders, and touring operations along the Texas-Mexico border issued the following statement in response to Governor Perry’s deployment of the Texas National Guard:

“Our Texas National Guard’s reputation is impeccable. The men and women of the Texas National Guard are trained to do many missions. But to strictly militarize the border won’t help us meet this unique humanitarian challenge. The people of the Rio Grande Valley have made that clear.

“As a sixth-generation Texan whose family has lived along the border, with extensive relationships with border law enforcement, faith and community leaders in the Rio Grande Valley for decades, I believe Governor Perry’s decision is the wrong way to go.

“Instead of ignoring local leaders and acting unilaterally, Washington D.C. and Austin should act responsibly. To keep Texans safe, we should support our local and state law enforcement and first responders with the resources that they request and need.”
