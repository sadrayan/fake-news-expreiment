Description

Since 2006, World Architecture Community provides a unique environment for architects, architecture students and academics around the globe to meet, share and compete.



Thousands of architects, architecture offices, students and academics are members of our portal where they can create their profile pages, and upload their projects and buildings. As a truly global platform, World Architecture Community is the place where international contemporary architecture is expressed from all horizons while providing an equal opportunity to those countries generally less covered by international media.



The mixture of exclusive and syndicated architecture news, published on World Architecture Communityâ€™s News section, was viewed close to 100 million times, and projects posted by its members were viewed over 40 million times in total, since 2008. With over 175,000 twitter followers, World Architecture Community is also quite active and followed on social media.



Finally, the WA Awards competition recognises the best projects and buildings in 3 different categories: Designed, Realised and Student. Up-to 10+5+X projects are awarded every cycle since 25 cycles, 3 times a year in a totally democratic selection, made by a combination of the votes of honorary members and previous cycle winners (10), as well as the ratings of our community members (5). The X corresponds to those special projects our jury members sometimes want to highlight for their innovative aspects.
