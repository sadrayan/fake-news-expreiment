Email, response to PolitiFact Texas, Peter Clark, chief of staff, state Rep. Mike Villarreal, April 10, 2013

1) Why was the adopted amendment sought? It’s not clear to me that such a study cannot occur without the intended change in law.

TEA has been slow to provide this data to researchers, so we wanted to communicate legislative direction.

2) Is this an accurate summary of his adopted amendment: “to enable researchers to access and analyze state-collected test results.”

Yes.

3) I trust we agree the 2007 Legislature created the fitness-test mandate—which is not what Rep. Villarreal said during this year’s floor debate. Agree?

Yes. The legislature established the mandate in 2007 and amended it in 2011, and he mistakenly said the legislature established it in 2011.
