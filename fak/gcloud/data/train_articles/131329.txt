Alpha Male Of The Month
I was headed to my gym in the downtown area at a stop light when 12 or 15 of them passed (you should see the freak shows who come out of the woodwork.) I don’t know what made me do it, but I rolled down my window and yelled, “You! You’re all unloved and unfuckable!”

They all turned around. As a White, blonde guy in a black BMW, I expected at least one harpy to yell back, but not one did.
