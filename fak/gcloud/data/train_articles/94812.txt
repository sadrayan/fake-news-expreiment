Investments

The world appears to be within reach of achieving the investment target in the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, which called on the global community to mobilize between US$ 22 billion and US$ 24 billion in low- and middle-income countries for the AIDS response by 2015.

At the end of 2014, US$ 20.2 billion was invested in the AIDS response in low-and middle-income countries.

Domestic resources constituted 57% of the total resources available for AIDS in low- and middle-income countries in 2014.

Between 2009 and 2014, 84 out of 121 low- and middle income countries increased their domestic spending on AIDS. Of these countries, 46 reported an increase of more than 50%, including 35 countries which reported an increase in domestic spending of more than 100%.

44 low- and middle income countries looked to international donors for 75% or more of their AIDS financing needs.

UNAIDS estimates that US$ 31.1 billion will be required for the AIDS response in 2020, with US$ 29.3 billion required in 2030.
