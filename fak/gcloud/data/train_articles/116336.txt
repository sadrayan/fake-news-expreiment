Russia too dependent on oil—and it's hitting the ruble, says ex-Russian fin min
Russia's economy is too reliant on oil and that is hitting the ruble, making it too volatile to become a reserve currency for the world, the deputy head of the presidential economic council and former finance minister said on Friday.

Alexei Kudrin, who is a reportedly a long-term confidant of the Russian president, made his comments at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, at which Vladimir Putin is also speaking.

"We are too dependent on oil and this is what stops our currency from being stable and makes it too volatile … as the price of oil dropped so did the Russia ruble," Kudrin said at a panel discussion hosted by CNBC.

Russia is one of the world's largest producers of crude oil, according to the Energy Information Administration, and its economy is heavily reliant on energy exports, which also include natural gas.
