MISLEADING E-MAIL

An e-mail has been circulating that contains a number of false statements about S-2099, Senator Jack Reed's Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000. Below is the text of the e-mail and the truth about the bill. Corrections are in blue. Gun owners beware! [Truth: Criminals who use handguns and handgun owners who give guns to criminals beware. The Handgun Safety and Registration Act of 2000 requires the registration of HANDGUNS to assist police in tracking down criminals who use handguns to commit crimes.] Senate Bill SB-2099 [Truth: S-2099] will require us to put on our 2000 1040 federal tax form all guns that you have or own. [Truth: Handgun Safety and Registration Act has nothing to do with your tax returns.] It may require fingerprints and a tax of $50 per gun. [Truth: As with a certain other weapons like short-barrelled shotguns and silencers, registration would require handgun owners to register their handguns with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. Registration requires handgun owners to submit a registration form, a picture, fingerprints and a one-time $5 registration fee.] This bill was introduced on Feb. 24. This bill will become public knowledge 30 days after it is voted into law. [Truth: This bill has been public knowledge since it was introduced in February. The text of the bill is available on-line through the Library of Congress. Click here to search for the text of S.2099 .] This is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Act of 1986. This means that the Finance Committee can pass this without the Senate voting on it at all. [Truth: Like every other bill introduced in the Senate, S. 2099 will go through the public process of review and approval by the Senate Finance Committee, review and approval by the full Senate, review and approval by a House of Representatives Committee, review and approval by the full House of Representatives and then go to the President for his signature.] The full text of the proposed amendment [Truth: It is actually legislation, not an amendment.] is on the U.S. Senate homepage, http://www.senate.gov/ You can find the bill by doing a search by the bill number, SB-2099. [S-2009] [Helpful suggestion: Go to http://www.gunregistration.org for a summary of the bill.] PRIVACY NOTICE:
