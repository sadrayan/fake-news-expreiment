Statement From Texans For Rick Perry Spokesman Mark Miner
“Bill White’s offensive belief that military men and women’s right to vote is somehow linked to the location of their children’s education is a terrible insult to the men and women of our armed forces who do not have children and to those whose children accompany them while they are stationed abroad. Bill White’s untenable anti-military position also ignores the rights of military men and women who remain connected to communities through their intention to return home following a deployment serving our nation. Bill White should immediately apologize for his attempt to deny military men and women their full voting rights.”
