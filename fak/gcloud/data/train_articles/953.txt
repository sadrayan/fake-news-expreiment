The Sex Offender Notification Process



Q: What is "community notification" about sex offenders?

A: On June 1, 1997, the Sex offender Registration and Community Notification Law went into effect thus giving law enforcement agencies the authority to disseminate information about certain sex offenders to the community if, in their opinion, releasing the information would enhance the protection of the public. Sex offender Registration law established a Special Bulletin Notification (SBN) process in which the Department of Corrections provides detailed information to locale law enforcement on certain sex offenders scheduled to be released in their localities. Special Bulletins also include the offender's physical characteristics including a photo, the offender's offenses and the offense profile, and the offender's release plan including name and phone number of the supervising agent. The Bulletin is used as a tool by law enforcement in their decision making process about the level, scope and method of subsequent community notification. In November of 2015, the Department of Corrections sought a formal legal opinion from the Wisconsin Attorney General on the meaning of the language "on 2 or more separate occasions" found in Wisconsin Statute 301.46 (2m)(am). On September 1, 2017 Attorney General Brad Schimel provided a formal opinion OAG-02-17 in which he concluded a number of items including "separate occasions" in WI Stat. 301.46 (2m)(am) should be interpreted as referring to the number of convictions, consistent with the supreme court's interpretation of the repeater statute in Wittrock and Hopkins. In both statutes, the term is used in a similar way: to count convictions either as a measure of criminality or potential dangerousness to the community. It is the fact of the additional criminality, as measured by multiple convictions that matters. He further concludes that convictions on "separate occasions" in WI Stat 301.46 (2m)(am) refers to multiple convictions, regardless whether they were part of the same proceeding, occurred on the same date, or were included in the same criminal complaint.
