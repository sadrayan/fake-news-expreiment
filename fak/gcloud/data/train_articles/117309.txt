Digital Photography, Random House, New York, 1992, was an early book which described the equipment and techniques of digital photography and image manipulation. It was written especially for professional and amateur photographers and graphic designers who wished to exploit the then new field of digital imaging. The book discusses both still video and the few digital cameras available at that time. This book is important to collectors of early still video and digital cameras because it provides much useful information about those early electronic cameras and associated equjipment.

CANON RC-560/570 – 1992. The RC-560/570 still video camera used a 1/2 inch, 410,000 pixel CCD image sensor and Hi-band specification to produce images with horizontal resolution of 450 TV lines. 3X zoom and integral automatic flash. An optional recording interface daughterboard for the Mac NuBus card could give the additional flexibility of converting digital images to analog and recording them with the camera. This would allow downloading a computer-generated presentation onto a video floppy from Aldus Persuasion or similar package (including photos originally taken by the electronic camera), as a series of video slides. When transferred into the computer, the pictures were digitized into 24-bit color or 8-bit grayscale tiff or pict files. The Canon RC-570 sold for $3,400. The Mac kit (RC-560) with NuBus digitizer board was $4,100 including the camera. Adding the digital-to-analog output daughterboard cost $400. The camera plus external video floppy drive package was $5,900 for the Mac; $6,650 for Next; $6,350 for Microchannel computers; and $6,250 for AT-bus PCs. We believe we were the first digital camera history web site to provide a photo and information concerning this camera.

KODAK DCS 200 - 1992. The DCS 200 had a built-in hard drive for image recording. On sale from 1992 to 1994, it was based on the Nikon N8008s. There were five variants of the DCS200: DCS 200 ci (color and integrated hard disk), DCS 200 c (color without internal hard disk), DCS 200 mi (black and white and integrated hard disk), DCS 200 m (black and white without internal hard disk) and the 'Wheelcam' (color by a triple green red and blue exposures). Resolution with the Kodak DCS 200 Digital camera was 1.54 million pixels, providing four times the resolution of still-video cameras at that time. Kodak's fully digital systems used a Nikon body and optics to capture the image. The image was then transferred to a CCD that converted the image directly into digital information. The CCD in the Kodak DCS camera system only used a small portion of the angle of view compared to conventional cameras; for example, a 28mm lens on the Kodak DCS Digital Camera was equivalent to an 80mm lens on a 35mm camera. The exposure index (EI) of the DCS camera equated to 50 to 400 IS0 for color images and 100 to 800 IS0 for black-and-white images . Kodak also made a special version of the DSC 200 called the High Speed Target Camera for use in parks to take photographs of visitors while they are on park rides.
