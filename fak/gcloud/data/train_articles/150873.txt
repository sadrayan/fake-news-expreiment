Does Peter Brabeck-Letmathe believe that water is a human right?
Yes. Our former Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe passionately believes that water is a human right. Everyone, everywhere in the world, has the right to clean, safe water for drinking and sanitation.

His critics use a video interview that Peter gave in 2005 to claim that he thinks all water sources should be privatised. This is simply false.

He supports the United Nations' view on water: ‘There is enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people, but it is distributed unevenly and too much of it is wasted, polluted and unsustainably managed’.

Peter is appalled by the fact that more than two billion people worldwide lack even a simple toilet, and that more than 1 billion lack access to any kind of access to improved drinking water.

Compare this to life in some countries, where people can use excess amounts of water – a precious and increasingly scarce resource – for non-essential purposes. In this context, Peter argues, access to water should carry a cost.

So if Peter Brabeck really cares about water, what is he doing to protect it?

Peter Brabeck has always taken a lead in arguing for more efficient water management by individuals, industry, agriculture and governments.

Peter chairs the 2030 Water Resources Group, an innovative collaboration between business, government and civil society that looks for practical solutions to address water scarcity.

He also leads the World Economic Forum Water Initiative, an influential public-private partnership that explores collaborative solutions to the problem of water scarcity.

Over the years, Peter has made his views on the subject of water scarcity clear in numerous interviews, panel discussions and TV programmes. Here are just a few examples:
