Qatar's population
Qatar is home to many different nationalities, with Qataris themselves only representing a minority. This extreme demographic shift has been taking place for the last several decades, but has skyrocketed in the last 10 years. The population today consists of people from all over the world, however the largest chunk comes from the Indian subcontinent.

Qatar’s population continues to swell with every passing year, having witnessed a massive increase of 9.5 percent compared to October 31, 2013 according to Qatar’s Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics. The total population numbered 2,269,672 at last available count on 30 Nov, 2014 (not including people with resident permits and Qatari nationals that were outside the country at the time). Qatari nationals number only 278,000, representing a mere 12 percent of the total population in the country. Indians at 545,000 and Nepalese at 400,000 actually far surpass them. Qatar´s Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics offers a month to month update on the population numbers, however it does not provide a breakdown per nationality. The Ministry of Interior also does not provide these statistics to the public, it however does seem to make it available to the Embassies, as some of them have told bq magazine the figures were given to them by the aforementioned Ministry. To overcome the hurdle of acquiring this information, bq magazine has used an alternative way to gather information on Qatar´s population by nationality. All the data comes from the Embassies of respective countries – either by the information given to us directly by them via email or telephone, or alternatively by gathering the numbers from Ambassadors who have been quoted by various media disclosing the number of their nationals in Qatar. The vast majority of data is from 2014.

A total of 63 countries have provided the data on the number of their nationals living in Qatar, with all the major ones such as India, Nepal, Philippines, Egypt, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, etc… included. This research is the most detailed and up-to-date overview of Qatar´s population by nationality that can be accessed by the public. No similar reports exist and the few that do are severely outdated. These numbers vary from estimations by respective Governments or Embassies, to the number of registered people with the Embassy, to, in some cases, exact numbers provided by the relevant Qatari government bodies. The total population number gathered by bq magazine is actually higher than the one currently published by Qatar Statistics Authority, as a consequence of various factors. There are a number of nationalities missing, some of which could potentially be present in significant numbers in Qatar. Those of Syria, Somalia, Algeria and Yemen being some of the likely ones. The reason for us not publishing the data is because not all Embassies were willing to disclose this information, simply did not possess the information or in some cases were not possible to get in contact with.

The gender ratio is heavily tipped in men´s favor, with the country having the most unnatural male to female ratio in the world, closely followed by other heavily expat populated countries of the GCC. People from the Indian subcontinent represent 55 percent of the total population, Arabs 27 percent, Far East Asians 11 percent, Westerners 3 percent and Sub-Saharan Africans 2 percent.
