FDLE's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) system allows us to provide standardized reports on crime statistics based on data gathered from across the state. Reports that provide both summary and detail information are issued semi-annually and annually. Here you can find data from the most recently released Crime in Florida Report as well as links to previous years.
