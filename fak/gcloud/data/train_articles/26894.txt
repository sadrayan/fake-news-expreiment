Federal Judge Nullifies PA Election Results For ‘Wide-Scale Voter Fraud’
Judge Marshawn Little has thrown out the results of the Pennsylvania special election, calling them “tainted beyond reproach.” According to the Pennsylvania Secretary of State, 22K more people voted than were registered.

The 45th Federal Appeals Court of Westmoreland County found that 22K possible cases of fraud were more than enough to call for a new, ID required special election. A new date will be announced when the logistics have been sorted out.

This is a breaking story. More details will be added as we hear them.
