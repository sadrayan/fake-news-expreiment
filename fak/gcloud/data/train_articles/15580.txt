The 83rd Texas Legislature appropriated approximately $11 million to DPS for testing sexual assault kits that meet the parameters of SB 1636. The money is being used to outsource DNA screening and testing to non-DPS labs, and pay for five forensic scientists at DPS labs to review the results and upload the qualifying DNA results into the CODIS database. The funding is for the biennium (two-year budget cycle) that began Sept. 1, 2013. The money was appropriated to DPS in the General Appropriations Act.

DPS does not track successful prosecutions related to sexual assault testing â€” whether kits or other evidence.

Effective June 1, the department entered into an interagency agreement with the University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC), which has agreed to test approximately 1,000 kits, and some agencies in the Dallas area have already been directed to send kits to UNTHSC.

In addition, DPS awarded contracts to Orchid Cellmark (Dallas) and Bode Technology (Virginia) in late July to test sexual assault kits related to SB 1636. In the coming months, we will ultimately direct agencies where to send their kits. The actual testing is expected to take place over two years.

Prior to the approval of legislative funding, DPS used grant money to test some cases, but that grant money was expended, so any additional testing will be through legislative funding.

(The term backlog is misleading, since most of the these sexual assault kits related to SB 1636 had never actually been submitted to a crime laboratory for testing, based upon decisions made locally within the law enforcement agencies and their associated prosecuting attorney offices.)
