Indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter told Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday that he will step down from his committee assignments after initially declining to do so, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO.

Ryan (R-Wis.) called on the California Republican, who has been indicted with his wife for allegedly using more than $250,000 in campaign funds to enrich their family, to relinquish his committee posts, including his spot on the House Armed Services Committee. A defiant Hunter, who on Thursday pleaded not guilty to all charges and is also accusing the Justice Department of conducting a “witch hunt” against President Donald Trump supporters like himself, initially refused.

Ryan’s office was readying a plan to strip him of those positions anyway by calling up a House panel that decides committee posts and holding a vote to remove him forcefully. The vote would have easily passed, according to multiple House Republican sources who say members are disgusted with the details in the indictment and Hunter’s alleged actions.

Hunter decided to step down before Ryan removed him.

“In light of recent events, I am requesting to be temporarily removed from my positions on the House Committees on Armed Services, Education and the WorkForce, and Transportation and Infrastructure. I fully intend to resume my position as an active member of these committees upon a successful resolution of the pending legal matters,” Hunter wrote in his letter to Ryan.

He added: “The charges against me are politically motivated and without merit. I intend to fight them fully.”
