AHCA: Medicaid Landing Page
Welcome to Medicaid!

Medicaid is the medical assistance program that provides access to health care for low-income families and individuals. Medicaid also assists the elderly and people with disabilities with the costs of nursing facility care and other medical and long-term care expenses.

In Florida, the Agency for Health Care Administration (Agency) is responsible for Medicaid. The Agency successfully completed the implementation of the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) program in 2014. Under the SMMC program, most Medicaid recipients are enrolled in a health plan. Nationally accredited health plans were selected through a competitive procurement for participation in the program.

The Division of Medicaidâ€™s website is designed to align with our functional organizational structure.

Some examples of where key information can be found under the new structure are below:
