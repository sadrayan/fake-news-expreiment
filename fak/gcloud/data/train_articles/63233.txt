Woodstock
Causes

Woodstock is committed to living by its principles- we believe in universal human rights, ethical business practices, unfettered creative expression, free trade, the loving care of our planet, the power of the individual to make a difference, and the overwhelming impact of communities to act as agents of peaceful change.



The original founders John Roberts, Joel Rosenman, Michael Lang and their families formed Woodstock Ventures to create events and develop projects which are consistent with Woodstock's values. Woodstock Ventures supports causes and organization we believe in. To submit your organization for consideration please contact us.
