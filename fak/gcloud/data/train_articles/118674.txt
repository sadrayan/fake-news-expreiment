Phelps founded the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, though most the small church's members are part of his extended family.

Their activities inspired a federal law on funeral picketing and laws in more than 40 states. But in a major free-speech ruling in 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the church and its members couldn't be sued for damages.

Phelps' church preached that deaths of U.S. military personnel were God's punishment for the nation's tolerance of homosexuality.
