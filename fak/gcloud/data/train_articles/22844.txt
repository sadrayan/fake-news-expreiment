Sales Tax Rates in Major Cities, Midyear 2017
Key Findings

There are roughly 10,000 sales tax jurisdictions in the United States, with widely varying rates.

Among major cities, Long Beach, California, and Chicago, Illinois, impose the highest combined state and local sales tax rates, at 10.25 percent. Four other cities—Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, and Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana, rank next highest with 10.0 percent combined rates.

Neither Anchorage, Alaska, nor Portland, Oregon, impose any state or local sales taxes. Honolulu, Hawaii, has a low rate of 4.5 percent and several other major cities, including Richmond, Virginia, keep overall rates modest.

A 1 percentage point increase in the Louisiana state sales tax, and ballot issues in California and Georgia, drove up rates in several large cities.

Research demonstrates a rise in cross-border shopping and other avoidance efforts as sales tax rates increase.

Sales taxes in the United States are levied not only by state governments but also by city, county, tribal, and special district governments. In many cases these local sales taxes can have a profound impact on the total rate that consumers pay.

Several private firms maintain databases of the sales tax rates in the roughly 10,000 local jurisdictions in the United States that levy them. Here, we list the combined state and local sales tax rates in major U.S. cities, defined as U.S. Census-designated incorporated places with a population over 200,000. This report complements our semiannual calculation of the average of all local sales taxes in each state.[1]

Highest and Lowest Sales Taxes in Major Cities

Last year, Chicago, Illinois, vaulted to the top of the list of cities imposing the highest combined state and local sales tax in the nation when a county tax increase brought the total rate to 10.25 percent,[2] a dubious distinction it now shares with Long Beach, California, which reached 10.25 percent on July 1, 2017, following the implementation of both city and county sales tax rate increases.[3] Four cities trail closely behind at 10 percent: Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama, and Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana.

The two cities in Louisiana are relatively new inclusions at the very top, driven by a 1 percentage point increase in the Louisiana state sales tax effective April 1, 2016.[4] They are followed by Seattle and Tacoma, Washington, at 9.6 percent; Freemont and Oakland, California, and Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, at 9.25 percent; and Glendale, Arizona, at 9.2 percent.

Portland, Oregon, and Anchorage, Alaska, have neither a state nor a local sales tax. Honolulu, Hawaii, has the third lowest sales tax among major cities with a rate of 4.5 percent. However, Hawaii’s overly broad sales tax makes this not strictly comparable with other states. Richmond, Virginia (5.3 percent), Madison, Wisconsin (5.5 percent), and Tulsa, Oklahoma (5.5 percent), also impose low combined state and local sales tax rates.

Sales Tax Rate Changes in Major Cities

This year’s expiration of the sales tax component of Proposition 30 (2012) reduced California’s mandatory state-collected local sales tax by 0.25 percent,[5] reducing overall rates for seventeen California cities on the list, though local rate increases in Los Angeles and Long Beach more than offset the statewide reduction in those jurisdictions.[6] Transportation referenda in the city of Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia, yielded an 0.9 percentage point rate increase, implemented in two phases, in Atlanta.[7] Meanwhile, Jersey City and Newark, New Jersey, saw modest rate reductions under the first phase of a transportation funding package which increased the state’s gas tax, phases out the estate tax, and reduced the state sales tax rate from 7.0 to 6.875 percent, with a further reduction scheduled for next year.[8]

The Role of Competition in Sales Tax

Sales tax avoidance is most likely to occur in areas where there is a significant difference between two jurisdictions’ sales tax rates. Research indicates that consumers can and do leave high-tax areas to make major purchases in low-tax areas, such as from cities to suburbs.[9] For example, strong evidence exists that Chicago-area consumers make major purchases in surrounding suburbs or online to avoid Chicago’s high sales tax rates.[10] At the statewide level, businesses sometimes locate just outside the borders of high sales tax areas to avoid being subjected to their rates. Delaware actually uses its state border welcome sign to remind motorists that Delaware is the “Home of Tax-Free Shopping.”[11] State and local governments should be cautious about raising rates too high relative to their neighbors because doing so may lead to revenue losses despite the higher tax rate.

Sales Tax Bases: The Other Half of the Equation

This report ranks states and cities based on tax rates and does not account for differences in tax bases (the structure of sales taxes, defining what is taxable and nontaxable). States can vary greatly in this regard. For instance, most states exempt groceries from the sales tax, others tax groceries at a limited rate, and still others tax groceries at the same rate as all other products.[12] Some states exempt clothing or tax it at a reduced rate.[13] The taxation of services and business-to-business transactions also varies widely by state.[14]

Tax experts generally recommend that sales taxes apply to all final retail sales of goods and services but not intermediate business-to-business transactions in the production chain.[15] These recommendations would result in a tax system that is not only broad-based but also “right-sized,” applying once and only once to each product the market produces. Despite agreement in theory, the application of most state sales taxes is far from this ideal.[16]

Hawaii has the broadest sales tax in the United States, taxing many products multiple times and, by one estimate, ultimately taxing more than 100 percent of the state’s personal income. This base is far wider than the national median, where the sales tax base applies to 36.3 percent of personal income.[17]

Conclusion

Sales taxes are just one part of the overall tax structure and should be considered in context. For example, Washington State has high sales taxes but no income tax, whereas Oregon has no sales tax but high income taxes. While many factors influence business location and investment decisions, sales taxes are something within policymakers’ control that can have immediate impacts.
