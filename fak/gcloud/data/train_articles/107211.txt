Bunion Surgery & Correction @evofoot
When it came to redesigning bunion surgery we didn’t stop with developing a new procedure, we created an entirely new philosophy: Form, Function, and Beauty. These are the three principles that set the standard for excellence in bunion correction. With the evofoot bunion correction, we get the foot back to the correct form, which allows it to function well. Keeping true to our heritage, evofoot bunion surgery is designed and performed with keeping the aesthetic appearance as a priority as important as function.

Our procedure builds on the techniques of renowned podiatric surgeons with a new perspective: provide patients with an advanced bunion correction that allows for a comfortable, functional recovery process, and a beautiful “open-toe shoe friendly” result.
