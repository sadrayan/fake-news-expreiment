Bryan Anderson Journalism
HELLO,

Thank you for visiting my personal website.

An editor-proclaimed "multimedia ninja," I am a recent graduate of Elon University with a double major in Journalism and Media Analytics and a minor in Political Science. I am now working as a political reporter for The Sacramento Bee.



Through my work with professional media outlets, I have extensive reporting experience. I enjoy covering hard news and telling stories through multimedia platforms.

​

I most recently served as an investigative fellow for News21, a political reporting intern for The Raleigh News & Observer and the enterprise manager for Elon News Network. I have had additional bylines in The Washington Post, Charlotte Observer and Burlington Times-News.

​

I've covered a wide range of events from Internet governance panels to major presidential campaign rallies and produced day-of breaking stories about erroneous tax letters as well as months-long enterprise stories about U.S. water quality. I've landed interviews with influential people ranging from then-candidate Donald Trump to "Sex and the City" star Kristin Davis. In the words of a former executive editor, "Bryan is dedicated to the craft of reporting and willing to cover stories anytime and anywhere."

​

I am an avid writer, fierce board game competitor, movie lover, sports enthusiast and (usually painfully) an Oakland Athletics and San Jose Sharks fan.
