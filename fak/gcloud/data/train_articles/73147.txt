Where court failed to instruct jury as to elements of statute which provided for enhancement of sentence, enhanced sentence was vacated and case remanded for trial on that issue. 256 C. 785. Based on plain language of section, its legislative history, and prior court decisions interpreting its provisions, application of sentence enhancement to manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, a class B felony, does not violate double jeopardy. 257 C. 544. Based on section's language and its legislative history, trial court properly applied section's sentence enhancement to defendant's split sentence. Id.

Failure to instruct jury re elements of statute was harmless error, since evidence against defendant was overwhelming and uncontested, and not violative of due process. 61 CA 417.

Failure of court to instruct jury that finding defendant used a firearm was harmless error where state has proven the elements necessary for the sentence enhancement. 74 CA 129. Plaintiff's claim that trial court did not put issue of enhancement under statute to the jury was harmless error since verdict required finding that the murder was committed with a firearm. Id., 391. Court declines to create a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness when the state seeks sentence enhancement pursuant to this section after defendant elects a jury trial. Sentence enhancement pursuant to this section not treated as essential element of the statute and state need only prove to jury the two elements of the statute and is not required to prove that length of defendant's incarceration should be increased. 81 CA 824.
