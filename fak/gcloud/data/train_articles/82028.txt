Donald Trump alleges widespread voter fraud in California. There's no evidence to back it up
Dhillon said she had not seen evidence of a systemic effort to rig California's elections, but said Republicans had often raised concerns about election operations. In particular, she criticized the state's relatively new law that requires the counting of any absentee ballot postmarked by election day and arriving as long as three days late. She said it was possible a ballot envelope could be postmarked using a private postage meter that had been set to Nov. 8 but was cast the next day.
