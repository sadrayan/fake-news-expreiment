Jeb Bush tries to undercut Donald Trump in Alabama
As Donald Trump prepared to hold a large rally in Alabama, Jeb Bush went on the offensive with an email to supporters:

Kevin,



We wanted to make sure you saw this.



Gov. Jeb Bush Blasts Donald Trump for His Many Extreme Liberal Positions



You may have heard Donald Trump is making a stop in Alabama tonight. Beneath Trump's bluster is a record that would make Hillary Clinton proud.



For years Donald Trump favored partial-birth abortions.

Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.

He’s supported restrictions on the Second Amendment.

And has long backed laws that infringe on states’ land rights.



Trump’s positions are deeply out-of-step with the Alabama way of life. We know Alabama cherishes life, especially the life of the unborn. Not a single Alabama taxpayer wants to see a massive tax increase. Trump’s history of supporting Democratic ideas will not go unnoticed in Alabama so please share with your friends.
