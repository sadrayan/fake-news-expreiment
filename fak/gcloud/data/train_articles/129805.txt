STORYLINE:



Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland on Friday for two days of summit talks with US President George W. Bush.



Bush will appeal for Moscow's help on a new UN resolution on sharing the burden of the reconstruction of and keeping the peace in Iraq.



Bush will also renew his objections to Russia's role in helping Iran to construct its first nuclear power plant, aides said.



Putin has opposed the US war in Iraq and expressed distress over the continuing conflict there.



US officials were heartened, however, that Putin's criticism of the American occupation of Iraq was relatively muted in his UN speech this week.



Putin has ruled out sending Russian troops as peacekeepers but may offer limited help as advisers, perhaps as police-force trainers, analysts suggested.



The two presidents were also expected to discuss Russia's oil resources.



US officials see rising Russian oil exports as an alternative to volatile Middle Eastern supplies.



Despite their policy disagreements, Bush and Putin have maintained warm personal ties.



Putin is expected to spend Friday evening and much of Saturday at the secluded retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains northwest of Washington DC.
