Is Matt Damon moving to Australia to escape Donald Trump?
Actor Matt Damon’s moving to Australia because he’s so upset with President Trump.

At least that’s what the New York Post is reporting. The problem is, it’s not even remotely true, according to Damon’s publicist.

In a story hyped as “exclusive” on its website, the Post says Damon has purchased property next door to his BFF Chris Hemsworth in Byron Bay, New South Wales, and he’s moving there because he’s upset about President Trump.

“Matt’s telling friends and colleagues in Hollywood that he’s moving the family to Australia” because he’s angry about Trump’s policies,” an unnamed source told the Post. “Matt’s saying the move will not impact his work — as he will travel to wherever his projects are shooting. He’s also telling friends he wants to have a safe place to raise his kids.”

But Damon’s rep Jennifer Allen says it isn’t so.

“Matt has visited Australia several times recently, but he has not bought a house there nor is he moving there,” she wrote in an e-mail to the Globe.

The 47-year-old Damon, who has four daughters with his wife, Luciana Barroso, has lived in LA and New York since leaving Boston. It’s true that he isn’t a big fan of Trump, criticizing him before and since the 2016 election.

When Trump was a candidate for president, Damon said he was “nervous” at the prospect of his election. “There’s no way we can let this guy be the [president],” he said. “To let that dude have the nuclear football, are you kidding me? He’s impulsive and rash, and doesn’t seem to think deeply about too many things.”

After the election, when Trump blamed “both sides” for violence involving white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., Damon called the comment “absolutely abhorrent.”
