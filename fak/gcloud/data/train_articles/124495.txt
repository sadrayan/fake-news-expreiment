Delivering for London
"London gave me the opportunities to go from the council estate where I grew up to being Mayor of the greatest city on earth. Now I’m working hard to ensure all Londoners get the opportunities that our city gave me and my family – and I’m standing up for our values. I’m proud that, together, we’re already delivering real results that will make a difference to Londoners' lives."

Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London
