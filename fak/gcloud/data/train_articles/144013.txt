In August, The Eagles' greatest hits album, released in 1976, surpassed Michael Jackson's 1982 album "Thriller" to take the top spot on the RIAA's (Recording Industry Association of America) list of the highest-selling albums of all time in the US.

The Eagles have the first and third best-selling albums of all time, with the band's "Hotel California" following "Thriller."

Other notable artists on the list include The Beatles and Led Zeppelin, which are both featured three times in the top 50 best-selling albums ever, and Garth Brooks, who also has three albums on the list.

Below is the list based on RIAA's data for the best-selling albums in US history (measured in "certified units" sold).
