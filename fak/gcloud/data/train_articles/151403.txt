In Inaugural Address, Trump Continues to Shun Establishment
“They’re kind of like the moon,” said Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College and a scholar at the Hudson Institute who has written extensively about Jackson’s influence. “They’re the brightest object in the night sky when the moon is full, but they wax and wane.”

On Friday, Mr. Trump’s moon was full. He dispensed with the usual grace notes of inaugural speeches, not even mentioning or shaking the hand of his vanquished opponent, Mrs. Clinton, who sat watching with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. (Mr. Trump did recognize the Clintons at a lunch at the Capitol after the ceremony.) While he thanked former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their “gracious aid” during the transition, he described the country Mr. Obama left behind as a Mad Max-like dystopia.

Using ominous language reminiscent of his speech at the Republican National Convention, Mr. Trump talked about “mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities,” “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation,” schools that teach students nothing, and “the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.”

Lest Republicans become complacent, Mr. Trump made it clear that he believes he is leading a populist movement that has little regard for any party platforms or loyalties. He thundered against free trade, a pillar of the Republican Party, as he did during the campaign.

He promised a Franklin D. Roosevelt-style public works campaign — “new roads and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways” — something the Republicans would have implacably opposed had it come from Mrs. Clinton.
