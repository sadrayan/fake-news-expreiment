2015 Sales

Quick Facts

U.S. sales broke the all-time record in 2015: 17.39 million units sold, a 5.8% increase over 2014’s 16.35 million.

2015 marks the sixth consecutive year-over-year sales growth, a trend not seen since the 1920s.

Trucks outsold cars for the third straight year – jumping 3% to a 56.7% market share, which was led by a record demand for CUVs with an all-time high annual penetration of 30% in 2015.

Small and Middle sized cars were the second and third best selling vehicles, but they also contracted as a percentage of sales in 2015 along with the large car segment.

Looking ahead: sales have increased for six straight years, if deliveries in 2016 beat 2015, which some project will happen, it would be the first time in the history of automotive sales records.

2015 Sales: Highest in History

2015 Sales vs. 2014: U.S. Light Vehicle Sales up 5.8%, Most Sales on Record

Light Trucks Help Fuel 2015 Sales

In 2015 light trucks sales increased nearly 13%, while car sales declined 2.1% over 2014. This is a change from past decade, when half of new vehicle sales have been split between cars and light trucks—minivans, SUVs and pickups. Often consumers choose light trucks for their passenger and cargo capacity, four-wheel-drive features, towing capacity and more.

HISTORIC SALES

Automakers sold over 17 million light vehicles in the U.S. market last year, up 5.8% from 2014, the highest mark in history, beating the sales record set in 2000. If forecasts hold true, 2016 could see sales reach another historic high.
