Early life and education [ edit ]

Root was born in Mount Vernon, New York, in 1961.[7] Root attended the Thornton-Donovan School in New Rochelle, N.Y.,[8] and was a member of the class of 1983 at Columbia University, studying pre-law and political science.

In June 2016, Root described himself as a "Jew turned Evangelical Christian".[9] As of November 2016, Root described himself as Jewish, and says he considers Donald Trump to be the first Jewish president, in the same sense that Bill Clinton was often called the first black president.[10]

Career [ edit ]

Root worked for WNBC radio (now WFAN) in the early 1980s. From 1989 through the early 1990s, he worked on the Financial News Network (now CNBC).

Root was founder and chairman of Winning Edge International Inc.[11] In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.

Root co-hosted King of Vegas on Spike TV. He produces Ghost Adventures on the Travel Channel.[12]

Politics [ edit ]

Root had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. He ran for a seat on the Westchester County Board of Legislators in 1983. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party.[13] He wrote a book on his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, which was published in 2009.[13]

2008 presidential campaign [ edit ]

On May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination. On May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the Libertarian Party presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who went on to the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.[14]

Though in the same graduating class as Barack Obama at Columbia University, Root has stated on a number of occasions that he has no recollection of having met or seen Obama at Columbia.[15][8] He has "stopped short" of actually claiming that Obama did not attend Columbia.[16]

In 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228–281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an at-large member.[17] At the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the "top-down faction."[18] The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.[19]

Return to the Republican Party [ edit ]

In September 2012, Root resigned all Libertarian Party positions, re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.[20][21] He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the "Enthusiasm Factor" for Romney was "huge".[22]

Root had announced that he intended to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2016, for the seat held by retiring Democratic Senator Harry Reid.[21][23] However, he did not run. He supported Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[24]

Root was opening speaker for Donald Trump's kick-off rally in Las Vegas during the 2016 presidential campaign. At the rally, Root, suggested that he wished ill upon Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, hoping they met the same ending as Thelma and Louise.[4]

Conspiracy theories [ edit ]

Root is known for spreading conspiracy theories.[4][5][6]

Root was a leading proponent of the false conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.[25] At one point, Root falsely claimed that Obama was not a student at Columbia University;[5] at another point, in an interview with Sean Hannity, Root said that he believed that Obama was a "foreign exchange student" at Columbia.[6] Root has described Obama as a "Marxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, globalist, middle class-hating, Muslim sympathizer".[6] He also claimed that Obama was gay, called him "Bathhouse Barry" and said that he had info from Obama's "friends in Chicago" about Obama's "sordid past".[6] He has described Obama as a "Manchurian candidate", possibly hired by the Bilderberg Group to destroy the United States and "kill all of us".[6]

He has promoted murder of Seth Rich conspiracy theories, and has at various times suggested that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Hillary Clinton, Donna Brazile, Bill Clinton, Eric Schneiderman and John Podesta were involved in the murder.[6]

During the white supremacist Unite the Right rally, Root falsely claimed that the white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. who killed Heather Heyer was "such B.S. Probably paid actors & infiltrators hired by Soros. No conservative I’ve ever met commits violence. EVER."[6]

Root tweeted in the aftermath of the 2017 attack in Las Vegas "This is a real thing. Clearly Coordinated Muslim Terror attack. PRAY for our Vegas police. PRAY for victims. VERY bad. Awful."[26] It was later confirmed that the shooter was 64-year-old Mesquite, Nevada, resident Stephen Paddock.[27] Root then defended his original claim by tweeting "Terrible day. Liberal fools criticizing me 4 reporting what I hear DIRECT from police & credible news sources. I report it as I hear it."[28]

Root has argued that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is motivated by "penis envy", because "Mueller’s is smaller than Trump’s."[6]
