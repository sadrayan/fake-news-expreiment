Pope Francis kissing the hands of David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger and John Rothschild
margsview says:

To even acknowledge without a sharp reprimand any of these people….given their history of initiating violence for profits defies, any claim to defend humanity.

Or as kissinger was quoted as saying ‘if we could get rid of 700 million people the world would be a better place…’. Perverted doesn’t come close to how vile these people have behaved, at the very least not to their past and ongoing suffering and destruction of millions of civilian victims….To treat humanity as mere units of cost or profit is pure evil……
