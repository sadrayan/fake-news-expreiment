Georgia insurance commissioner: I hope Obamacare implodes
Georgia's insurance commissioner lashed out at the new federal health insurance program and its troubled website on Monday.



State Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens told Channel 2's Lori Geary, "I hope this whole thing implodes," when questioned about the health care plan rollout.



Hudgens had not spoken publicly about the Affordable Health Care Act since the nationwide rollout of insurance exchanges on Oct. 1. Geary drove to Monroe County to interview the commissioner.



Hudgens encouraged Georgians who want to sign up for a health-insurance plan to wait until at least December, when the current issues may be cleared up.



"I think this is the climax of it, when the whole website crashes and not one person in the entire United States was able to sign up for Obamacare," Hudgens said referring to issues with the site over the weekend.



Hudgens vowed to be an obstructionist to the law during a campaign event earlier this year. He told Geary that the failures of the healthcare.gov website prove he was right.



"I have not been an Obamacare fan from day one and I have not changed my mind," Hudgens said. "Our department's only responsibility in the whole Affordable Care Act is to license the navigators."



Hudgens also told Geary he has not been able to find a Georgian who has successfully signed up and the federal government is withholding subscription numbers.



Licensed navigator Amanda Ptashkin said she supports the new health care law and she's encouraging Georgians to be patient.



"People have waited a very long time to be able to access insurance. They just have to wait a little bit longer until the kinks get worked out," Ptashkin said.



Hudgens expects it to take some time.



"Obamacare is not ready for prime time," Hudgens said.
