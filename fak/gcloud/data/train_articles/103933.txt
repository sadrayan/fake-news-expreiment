Anatomical Gift Program
At the time of the donor’s death, the person responsible for making final arrangements should call Harvard Medical School at 617-432-1735 as soon as possible to determine if HMS can accept the donation. HMS must receive donor remains within 24 hours after death unless specific exemption is granted by HMS. A body that has been autopsied or embalmed cannot be accepted for donation.

Once a gift is accepted, a funeral director chosen by the family should be contacted and instructed to consult HMS for instructions about the transportation of the body. HMS will pay a stipend directly to the funeral director toward the costs of transportation from the place of death to HMS and obtaining the Burial/Removal Permit and a certified copy of the Death Certificate.The funeral director will be reimbursed only for the cost of these services according to the policy and levels of reimbursement established by HMS. The donor’s estate will be responsible for any costs charged by the funeral director that exceed the stipend. If death occurs outside of Massachusetts, Harvard’s stipend to the funeral director will apply; however, any additional out-of-state travel expenses will fall to the donor’s estate.

In general, families are encouraged to discuss with the funeral director, before the remains come to HMS, whether and to what extent there may be additional charges.
