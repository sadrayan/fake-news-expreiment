Border Facts
Demand Stronger Border Security Now

DEAR NANCY PELOSI & CHUCK SCHUMER,

AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, I AM DEMANDING THAT YOU FINALLY PUT ME ABOVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND BUILD THE WALL!

OUR SECURITY IS NOT A POLITICAL GAME AND I AM TIRED OF YOUR PETTY OBSTRUCTION.

THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY, MY COMMUNITY, AND MY COUNTRY IS AT STAKE.

I AM STANDING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SECURE OUR BORDER AND DEMANDING THAT YOU DO THE SAME FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY.

SINCERELY,

A FED UP AMERICAN CITIZEN
