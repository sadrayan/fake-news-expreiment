Austin declared Most Vegan-Friendly City
Austin was recently named PETA’s Most Vegan-Friendly City, in part because of restaurants like Mother’s Café and Garden.

Here in Austin, we’re no strangers to finding our city’s name on lots of lists: Best Beertowns in America (Matador Network); Best Cities in the U.S. to Live, Work, and Make Movies (MovieMaker Magazine); Top 12 American Boomtowns (Bloomberg).

Well, we’ve topped another list, as noted by Paul McCartney from the Frank Erwin Center stage during his recent concert stop here: Austin is PETA’s (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) Most Vegan-Friendly City, edging out Portland, Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.

The humanitarian — er, animalitarian — organization gave us top marks in spite of the fact that you can’t sidestep a Grackle without accidentally falling through the door of a barbecue joint. PETA was enamored of vegan items in our food trucks, bakeries and ice cream parlors, as well as cruelty-free Tex-Mex dishes and, of course, Mother’s Café and Garden’s banana walnut pancakes.

Still, it’s impossible to try everything and, even with the No. 1 designation, we think Austin got short shrift. Here are 10 Austin vegan menu items that PETA must have missed:

10. Veganbock

9. Peaches and Herbivore

8. Hummus Helper

7. KUT’s Veg Drive

6. Macaroni and Whatever This Stuff Is

5. Endangered Barton Springs Saladmander

4. I Can’t Believe It’s Not Brisket

3. Round Rock Fauxnuts

2. Soylent Greenbelt

1. Screaming Vegetables
