FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 21, 1999

Release No. 45 E-MAIL RUMOR COMPLETELY UNTRUE WASHINGTON â€“ A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being circulated on Internet e-mail. As a matter of fact, the Postal Service has learned that a similar hoax occurred recently in Canada concerning Canada Post. The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill 602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service. No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell" exists. The U.S. Postal Service has no authority to surcharge e-mail messages sent over the Internet, nor would it support such legislation.
