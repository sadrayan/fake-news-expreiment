Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster says ABC News plans a piece that "mischaracterizes our efforts to prevent free classified ads for recalled sale items by craigslist users, and falsely accuses us of not cooperating with the Consumer Product Safety Commission."

The story will unfold across a couple programs, and the segments will begin to roll out Friday.

Buckmaster says the news org wouldn't take calls from Craigslist and "chose instead to ambush our largely-retired founder, Craig Newmark, outside his home on November 11."

"Our piece will be fair and accurate and will include comments from Craigslist and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the results of our ABC News investigation of the country’s product recall system conducted with 17 ABC stations across the country," an ABC News spokesperson told Poynter.

Disclosure: Newmark is on the Poynter Foundation's board and has donated to Poynter.
