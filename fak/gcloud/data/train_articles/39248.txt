Today, FDP Chair Allison Tant filed an elections complaint against Rick Scottâ€™s campaign, calling on the Florida Elections Commission to investigate and hold the campaign accountable.

Key Point: The complaint maintains that the campaign broke the law when the Scott campaign transferred nearly $27.4 million from one type of campaign account to another earlier this month. "They have violated the law and the governor is supposed to uphold the law," Tant told The Associated Press . . . If the governor's campaign were found to have violated the law, it could be subject to a fine up to three times the amount of the contribution, or about $82 million.
