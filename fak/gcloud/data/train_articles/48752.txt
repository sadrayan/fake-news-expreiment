Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker faced death threats and frightening encounters with protesters during the fight in his state over labor laws, he reportedly reveals in his new book.

Walker received letters targeting his family, including one that talked about following his children to school and another threatening to “gut [his wife] like a deer,” according to excerpts of the book from the publisher posted by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute.

The letter about his children was the worst moment of the fight over the anti-collective bargaining laws, he said.

“According to my staff, the only time they ever saw me angry during the entire fight over Act 10 was after I read that letter. They were right. I didn’t mind threats against me, but I was infuriated that these thugs would try to draw my family into it,” Walker wrote.

The governor also described incidents with protesters, including one in February 2011 in which protesters blocked his path to exit a manufacturing plant.

“As we tried to pull out, they surrounded the car and began beating on the windows and rocking the vehicle. Just as we extricated ourselves from their grip, a truck pulled up and blocked our path, playing a game of chicken with the troopers. They turned the lights and sirens on and warned him to get out of way. Eventually he backed up, and we sped off,” Walker wrote.

He said it was a lesson to see people “so blinded by their anger” that they would attack police cars. Amid the mounting protests and threats, Walker said security on him and his family was increased.
