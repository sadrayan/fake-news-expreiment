TFN President: Texas State Board of Education Adopts Flawed Science Standards

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

March 27, 2009

The Texas State Board of Education has adopted new public school science standards that publishers will use to craft new science textbooks up for adoption in 2011.

TFN President Kathy Miller is releasing the following statement:

"The word 'weaknesses' no longer appears in the science standards. But the document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into Texas classrooms.

"Through a series of contradictory and convoluted amendments, the board crafted a road map that creationists will use to pressure publishers into putting phony arguments attacking established science into textbooks.

"We appreciate that the politicians on the board seek compromise, but don't agree that compromises can be made on established mainstream science or on honest education policy.

"What's truly unfortunate is that we now have to revisit this entire debate in two years when new science textbooks are adopted. Perhaps the Texas legislature can do something to prevent that."
