Semester of strife capped longstanding issues with Wolfe, Loftin
The student protests over racial issues on the University of Missouri campus overshadow an environment of distrust and animosity at the highest levels that likely would have led to the ouster of UM System President Tim Wolfe or MU Chancellor Bowen Loftin or both, sources said.

Some faculty and deans on campus had been pushing for Loftin�s ouster for weeks, accusing him of creating a �climate of mistrust, miscommunication, chaos, despair, and anger� in the words of a letter from the Department of Romance Languages.

Loftin�s supporters, however, maintain that opposition came mainly from faculty worried he was upsetting their comfortable positions by pushing for financial reallocation and greater emphasis on teaching.

�There are truths at the university that must be addressed, and this productivity issue is a big part of it,� said Sen. Kurt Schaefer, R-Columbia. �Bowen Loftin was trying to correct these things and not getting support.�

Wolfe, meanwhile, was losing support because he was unable to deal with controversy. He was hired in 2011 after a career that included being president of Novell Americas.

�He has done a lot of good things for the university and is a nice person, but doesn�t have the skill set to run a higher education institution,� said a source close to the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Reports about the resignation of both top leaders Monday have focused on the role of student protests and racial issues that triggered them.

Curators named longtime MU administrator Mike Middleton as interim UM president Thursday. Loftin will take his new role on Jan. 1.

Neither Wolfe nor Loftin was available for interviews for this story. But the underlying issues of administration and personality for both men, including their dislike of each other, have played a bigger role in the result, sources said.

�The relationship was very, very strained,� the source close to the administration said. �That�s such a complicated thing. They are both strong-willed. I think the president at times thought he was chancellor of Mizzou, and the chancellor chafed at that.�

Loftin wants to raise MU�s rankings in the Association of American Universities, or AAU, a 62-member group of top research schools. His emphasis included reallocating funds to research and reducing the number of faculty who receive waivers from the standard teaching requirement.

His approach to those issues and other administrative matters upset the academic departments, leading to a letter signed by nine deans Monday calling for Loftin�s ouster and votes of no-confidence among faculty in the English and Romance Languages departments. The deans� letter cited Loftin�s handling of graduate student health insurance, the firing of the medical school dean and �creating a toxic environment through threat, fear and intimidation.�

Journalism School Dean David Kurpius, who took over the school on July 1, said he was confident the letter was the right thing to do.

�I listened a lot to the other deans and had a couple of examples, just in my short time here, which I felt added to what they were saying,� Kurpius said. �I believed we needed to have action moving forward, and I wasn�t seeing it.�

Deans met with Wolfe on Oct. 9 to call for Loftin�s removal and met with Wolfe and Loftin again four days later to repeat the demand. The board of curators met in lengthy closed sessions on Sept. 20 and Oct. 21.

Those meetings generated intense speculation that Wolfe was about to fire Loftin.

The romance languages faculty vote actually expressed a lack of confidence in Wolfe and Loftin, but by the time a letter announcing the vote was written, Wolfe had said he would resign, said Charles Presberg, department chairman.

�There was every reason to believe that with an explicit statement that Tim Wolfe was about to fire Loftin, that would have had full faculty support,� Presberg said. �If Tim Wolfe had acted, events could have been very different.�

The university provided Schaefer data that show about half of the tenure or tenure-track faculty received a waiver of the basic teaching requirement of 12 section credits or 180 student credit hours per year in each of the past two academic years.

The figures exclude faculty in specialty disciplines such as music or medicine, the university reported.

�Whether you side with Tim Wolfe or whether you side with Bowen Loftin, there is an indisputable reality that there are problems at the university that are now teed up to be fixed,� Schaefer said. �That starts with 50 percent of the faculty getting paid for full-time work they are not doing.�

The AAU includes only 34 public universities. Universities are ranked on four metrics � federal research funding, National Academy of Science members, faculty awards for quality work and faculty citation in high-impact journals.Loftin�s plan was to improve MU�s ranking AAU ranking from No. 32 of 34 to No. 28 by 2018.

�Bowen Loftin is not going to achieve any of that by showing contempt for your faculty, by making decisions that never involve faculty, undermining deans or making snide remarks about them,� Presberg said. �He is a person who never did try to persuade people.�

As the story of the changes underway at the university is told, it is important to keep in mind that the campus protests were the catalyst, but not the only reason, the two leaders are out.

�The popular national narrative is simply not the truth,� the source close to the administration said. �This is not in any way to minimize the racial issues. It definitely has been a factor that has brought people�s attention to it.�
