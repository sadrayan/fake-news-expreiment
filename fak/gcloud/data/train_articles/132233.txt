AP Style on ‘Dreamers’
This is a framing that tends to elicit positive feelings for the young beneficiaries and their quest for legal protection to live in the United States.

AP policy is to use “Dreamers” only in direct quotes or with quote marks for the purpose of explaining the term, such as, “They are commonly referred to as ‘Dreamers,’ based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act that would have provided similar protections for young immigrants.”
