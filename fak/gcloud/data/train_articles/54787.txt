In order to minimize download time, some of the larger chapters have been segmented into sections. The segmented chapters will have a "Next Section" button in the top and bottom right corners to navigate to the next section and a "Previous Section" button in the top and bottom left corners to navigate to the previous section.

The Code of State Regulations (CSR) is updated monthly. Pursuant to section 536.021.8, RSMo, "no rule...shall become effective prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the revision to the Missouri code of state regulations." Therefore, some of the rules published in the current version of the CSR may not be effective. A rule's effective date is found in the authority section at the end of the rule. If a rule's effective date has not arrived yet, the previous edition of the rule would be the rule still in effect. Previous editions of these rules may be available in the archived editions.
