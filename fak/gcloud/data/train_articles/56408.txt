May 17 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump donated his $100,000 quarterly salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the White House announced on Thursday.

"As you all know, President Trump is deeply committed to our veterans," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters. "These brave men and women have given so much to our country and deserve our absolute best, which is why this President is fighting for reform and accountability at the VA."

Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie accepted the check at a White House press briefing and said the money will go toward mental health and peer support programs, financial aid, education training, and research.

"The president's gift underscores his promise to do all he can for vets, which includes supporting those who care for veterans," Wilkie said. "Not just those of us at VA, but the husbands, the wives, the families and the community caregivers who are out there day in and day out."

Trump has donated each of his quarterly salary checks to federal agencies since taking office.

His previous donations have gone to the Department of Transportation, National Park Service, Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services.
