As Iraq is being overrun by ISIS – a brutal radical group deemed even by Al Qaeda to be too militant – Fox News host Jeanine Pirro blamed Barack Obama’s feckless foreign policy during the opening segment of Justice with Judge Jeanine Saturday.

The head of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was released by Obama in 2009. As he was leaving Camp Bucca in Iraq, al-Baghdadi warned his American captors: “I’ll see you in New York.”

Judge Jeanine warned America: “Yes indeed, you need to be worried.” The question is, are we listening?
