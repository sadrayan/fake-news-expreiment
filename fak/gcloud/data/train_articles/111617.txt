Slumabad â€“ Reaching out to the deprived
Our Story

My name is Muhammad Sabir. The story of PAKHIWAS is my story, but it is also the story of many gypsy children. I have dreamt of this project for years. I do not want any child to have to face the darkness of illiteracy, no matter if he or she is living on a footpath or a makeshift tent. Like other children, gypsy kids need a safe place to live, study and play. Life is hard for children in Pakistan, but PAKHIWAS is meant to be the hope worth working for and supporting. Join with us in this worthy cause.
