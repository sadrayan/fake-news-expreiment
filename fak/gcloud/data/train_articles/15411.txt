The number cited is taken from reporting on the issue from The Economist magazine in early December. A link to the article can be found below and the relevant information can be found here:

“Cheaper oil should act like a shot of adrenalin to global growth. A $40 price cut shifts some $1.3 trillion from producers to consumers. The typical American motorist, who spent $3,000 in 2013 at the pumps, might be $800 a year better off—equivalent to a 2% pay rise.”

Additionally,

Stuart had an interesting piece on this just a few days ago in QR. In it he writes:

“While the decline in crude oil prices will have a slight negative impact on the Texas economy and state finances, consumers of petroleum products, e.g., gasoline, will benefit. It is estimated that each 10¢ decline in gasoline prices increases disposable income by $120. According to Gasbuddy.com, there has been a substantial decline in gasoline prices. As shown in this figure, over the last three months, gasoline prices in Texas have declined by over a $1. This will provide the average household in Texas with an additional $1,200 in spendable income. This should result in sales tax collections increasing by around $350 million, which will offset some of the decrease from the downturn in investments in energy related industries.”

If you take $1,200 and divide by the median household income in Texas (about $52,000 in 2013 according to census), it actually represents an increase of about 2.3%

Finally,

Moody’s has also done some analysis on this as reported by the WSJ in mid-December:

“Lower-income households are the most sensitive to fluctuations in gas prices because they have lower savings. Last year, the bottom fifth of income earners spent more than 12% of their after-tax income on gasoline, compared to 3% for the top fifth of income earners. In 2000, the bottom fifth spent 8.5% of their income on gas, compared to 2% for the top fifth, according to Moody’s Analytics.”
