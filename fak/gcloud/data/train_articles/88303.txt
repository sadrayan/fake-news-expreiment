Romney endorses Ryan budget
At a campaign event in Chicago, he gives a big thumbs-up to Paul Ryan's budget plan:

I'm very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. It's a bold and exciting effort on his part and on the part of the Republicans and it's very much consistent with what I put out earlier. I think it's amazing that we have a president who three and a half years in still hasn't put a proposal out that deals with entitlements. This president's dealing with entitlement reform -- excuse me -- this budget deals with entitlement reform, tax policy, which as you know is very similar to the one that I put out and efforts to reign in excessive spending. I applaud it. It's an excellent piece of work and very much needed.

That first sentence is equally true if you replace "a big thumbs-up to Paul Ryan's budget plan" with "a gift-wrapped entitlements attack to his eager Democratic opponents."
