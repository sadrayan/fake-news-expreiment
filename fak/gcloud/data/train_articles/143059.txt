Summary

This visually explosive FBI document reveals the secret symbols organized pedophiles use to recognize each other and is likely to be of broad interest to readers, especially parents. Wikileaks has verified the document.

The classification codes in used in the document (different parts have different classifications) are:

LES Law Enforcement Sensitive FOUO For Official Use Only U Unclassified

Wikileaks believes the information will be of assistance to parents and other care givers in recognizing pedophiles. Wikileaks affiliated journalists obtained the document via "child erotica" networks in Spain, which raises the question of how this FBI document came into the hands of individuals so close to the people it is meant to be investigating.

Pedophiles who sexually abuse children as well as those who produce, distribute, and trade child pornography, are using various types of identification logos or symbols to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences. To specifically indicate the pedophile’s gender preference, members of pedophilic organizations encourage the use of descriptions such as “boylove”, “girllove”, and “childlove.”1 These symbols have been etched into rings and formed into pendants, and have also been found imprinted on coins.

31 January 2007

(U) Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles to Identify Sexual Preferences (U//FOUO) This intelligence bulletin addresses Crimes Against Children Standing Intelligence Requirements Set contained in Q-FBI-2200-005-06, HRWC CAC-VI.A.5. (U//LES) Pedophiles, to include those who sexually abuse children as well as those who produce, distribute, and trade child pornography, are using various types of identification logos or symbols to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences. To specifically indicate the pedophile's gender preference, members of pedophilic organizations encourage the use of descriptions such as "boylove", "girllove", and "childlove."1 These symbols have been etched into rings and formed into pendants, and have also been found imprinted on coins. (U) The BoyLover logo (BLogo) is a small blue spiral-shaped triangle surrounded by a larger triangle, whereby the small triangle represents a small boy and the larger triangle represents an adult man.2 A variation of the BLogo is the Little Boy Lover logo (LBLogo), which also embodies a small spiral-shaped triangle within a larger triangle; however, the corners of the LBLogo are rounded to resemble a scribbling by a young child.3 Images of the BLogo and LBLogo symbols are depicted below.

(U//LES) FBI investigations in several cities have uncovered several symbols used by pedophiles to proclaim their attraction to children. After a seizure of a subject's computer in connection with an Innocent Images case in the Jacksonville Division, a Computer Analysis Response Team forensic examiner came across an unfamiliar symbol that was integrated into a Web site banner named "ATBOYS.COM, where the "A" in "ATBOYS" was actually the BoyLove symbol and written as follows: TBOYS.com. It was further determined that "ATBOYS" is an acronym for Attracted To Boys.5 These pedophilia symbols also appear on Web sites such as one of the banners advertised on www.boylover.net, shown below.6 UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED//LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE (U//LES) In another incident, FBI Sacramento was alerted by the California Department of Justice about an unusual marking on a coin. Research of the marking concluded that the BoyLover logo (BLogo) was imprinted on the front of the coin, and the phrase "Kids Love Pedos" was engraved on the back of the coin.7 (Coins depicting the BLogo are pictured on page one.) The appearance of the BLogo on coins is another method used by pedophiles to announce their sexual preferences. (U) Pedophilia symbols on jewelry, coins, Web sites and other effects are indicative of advertisement methods used by child sexual predators to promote their cause. Pedophile activists advocate for the social acceptance of sexual relationships between adults and children. These organizations seek to decriminalize sexual relationships between adults and children and to legalize child pornography based on their belief that children have the ability to consent to sexual acts. (U//LES) Identical or similar jewelry and symbols as described in this intelligence bulletin should raise suspicion of possible pedophilia activity when found during searches. Investigators should also be attentive to pedophilia symbols advertised on Web sites. During examinations of computer files, investigators should be conscious of subjects who try to conceal child pornography by labeling them with symbols instead of the typical suggestive explicit names.
