Петиция · Lower Drinking Age From 21 to 18 · Change.org
Many countries around the world have lowered the drinking age to 18. If being a legal adult in the United States of America is 18 years old, why do you have to be 21 to have a drink legally? At the age of 18 you

- have the right to vote

- can serve on juries

- can get married (if you get married why can't you have a drink with your parenter to celebrate?)

- can smoke cigarettes

- can sign a contract

- can be prosecuted as adults

- can join the military

and so forth.

(Drinking Age Pros & Cons)

Being said that at the age of 18 you ARE an adult, why can't you have a drink?

Lowering the drinking age to 18 can reduce drinking activities and lower risks of thrill drinking. The countries that have legally made the drinking age 18 have seen a reduction of drunk driving accidents rather than in the U.S.

Colleges all over the United States have delt with the young adults having parties and getting drunk. Passing the law of the legal drinking age to be 18 would help colleges make rules for the students to not get intoxicated.

Adults have the right to state their opinion. 18-20 year olds have said that drinking is a enjoyable activity.

Out of the 50 states in the United States, the government should have the right to establish a lower legal drinking age "that reflects their unique demographics, legal context, and history."

It would be good for the economy because it would increase business for private business owners, and greater amounts of tax revenue would be collected by the government.
