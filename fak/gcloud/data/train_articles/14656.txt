New Ad In MN-08: Joe Radinovich Is Another Hypocritical, Tax-Raising Politician
Liberal politician Joe Radinovich voted to raise taxes on Minnesota families, yet he refused to pay his own bills

WASHINGTON – Congressional Leadership Fund (@CLFSuperPAC), the super PAC endorsed by House Republican leadership, today released a new ad, “Typical Politician,” in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District. The new ad, released the same week Radinovich won the Democratic primary, slams his liberal voting record hiking Minnesotans’ taxes by $2 billion, but refusing to pay his own bills. The ad will run on television and digital platforms in the Minneapolis media market.

“Liberal politician Joe Radinovich voted for a $2 billion tax hike on Minnesota families, yet he was cited thirty times for not paying court fines, and was turned over to a collection agency eight times after refusing to pay his own bills,” said Michael Byerly, CLF spokesman. “Joe Radinovich is a hypocrite who cannot be trusted in Congress.”

This is CLF’s first television ad in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District. In addition to the ad campaign, CLF has opened a field office in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District. Each CLF field office is supported by a full-time staffer and hundreds of interns and volunteers who engage with voters on a daily basis through hyper-targeted phone banking and door-to-door canvassing.
