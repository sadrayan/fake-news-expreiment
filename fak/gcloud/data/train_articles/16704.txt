Subject: Austin reporter, urgent inquiry for a PolitiFact Texas fact-check

Dr. Florida:

Good afternoon. I write on behalf of the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project based at the Austin American-Statesman as we gauge the accuracy of a recent claim by Greg Casar, a member of the Austin City Council.

Casar was quoted in this news story saying that Austin has “been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country.” YES IS TRUE. SEE BU BOOK THE NEW URBAN CRISIS AND MPI STUDIES

We’re aware of the 2015 institute study posted here showing the Austin area among national leaders. YES

For our fact-check, can you speak to whether repeated studies have found Austin leading the nation, or ranking among leaders, for economic segregation? We’d be happy to review such analyses.

Also, are there other authorities you’d recommend we contact? JOHN LOGAN AND DOUG MASSEY.

I’d be happy to hear back by phone or email. We also rely on attributable on-the-record information for all our stories. We hope to complete our review early next week.

Thank you,

g.
