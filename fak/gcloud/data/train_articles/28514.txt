Opponent: Timothy Kaine (227) Notes *Maine distributes its electoral votes proportionally, with two at-large electors representing the statewide winning presidential and vice presidential candidates and one elector each representing the winners from its two Congressional districts. For the first time since adopting this system, Maine's four electoral votes were split between the two major party tickets. The Clinton-Kaine ticket won the state and received the two at-large electors, as well as the electors from the First Congressional District, where Clinton-Kaine also won. However, the Trump-Pence ticket won the Second Congressional District and, thus, received its one elector. Also, there were faithless votes cast for president and vice president in Hawaii, Texas, and Washington.



**Popular vote totals are derived from the states' Certificates of Ascertainment. Donald J. Trump received fewer popular votes than Hillary Clinton, but received a majority of electoral votes.
