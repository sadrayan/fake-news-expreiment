Jobs and the Economy
The best way to help Wisconsin families is to ensure that there is a job available for every worker who wants one.

Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the nation, and it is no coincidence that our jobs are disappearing. Runaway government spending, paid for with high taxes, has led to the worst state unemployment rate in a generation. In the last year, Wisconsin lost a record-setting 130,000 jobs, and employers continue to lay off workers by the thousands.

From Harley-Davidson laying off hundreds of workers to Thomas Industries closing its doors in Sheboygan, one thing is clear: Wisconsin is not competitive. Other states are taking our jobs, and this must change.

I believe the first priority of our Governor is to ensure that the state is doing everything possible to foster job growth and a strong economy.

The fastest, most effective way to create new jobs is to cut taxes and implement regulatory and fiscal policies that encourage job growth and economic investment. History has proven that when taxes are cut, consumers and investors spend more money.

Reducing the tax burden will allow small businesses to invest more of their resources into job growth and production, which will ultimately increase tax revenues.
