Member Association
FIFA shares the success of the FIFA World Cup to support football development projects in our 209 member associations across the globe. Football has flourished as a global game because of this support. With more than $500,000 USD going into these programmes each day, we are spending more than ever on football development. Many member associations depend on this support to finance their day-to-day operations. It ensures that football can have a solid foundation throughout the world.
