Nathaniel was a dear firend of Abraham Lincoln.



After Lincoln moved to Illinois in 1830, Nathaniel moved with his father to Carroll Co., MO in 1855.



In 1860, he was living in Norborne. He wrote to Lincoln and received an appointment as Republican Precinct Committee Man. He placed Lincoln's name on the 1860 ballot. All of Natty's neighbors were Southern sympathizers. He had been talking about electing Lincoln for president in town. One morning at about 2 or 3 a.m. a neighbor rode up and told Natty not to light any lights. The neighbor wanted to warn him that his neighbors were planning to murder him and if he wanted to live he should be on his way.



After the warning, Natty moved back to Spencer Co., IN where he and four of his five sons enlisted in Company C 10th IN Cavalry ( Richmond Davis did not enlist). Natty was named 2nd Lieutenant.



The family appearently returned to Carroll Co., MO but in 1885 they moved to Harper Co., KS and settled on a farm in the extreme northwest corner of the county. In 1890, they moved to Attica, KS. Nathaniel was buried in Attica.



His tombstone reads as follows:

Through this inscription I wish to enter my dying protest against waht is called the Democratic Party. I have watched it closely since the days of Jackson and know that all the misfortunes of our nation has come to it through this so-called party, therefore beware of this party of treason.





He first married Mahulda CUMMINGS, daughter of John Ephraim CUMMINGS & Elizabeth LANMAN, 1 December 1836 in Spencer Co., IN. Born 1816 in Breckenridge Co., KY. Died 12 June 1853 in Spencer Co., IN.

65 iv. Henry Clay GRIGSBY

66 v. Nancy E. GRIGSBY

67 vi. James William GRIGSBY



He second married Catherine Davis POWERS, 9 May 1856 in Carroll Co., MO.



Research: It appears from records in the Lincoln National Memorial in Spencer Co., IN that Catherine Davis was married to Nathaniel Grigsby in Carroll Co., MO on 9 May 1856. However, in the Grigsby Memoriabilia 1779-1979 p. 259 the name was Catherine Powers Davis. This would jive with other records that show Natty having married Catherine Powers if she had formerly been married to a Davis. Carroll Co., MO records may say Nathaniel Grigsby to Catherine Davis.
