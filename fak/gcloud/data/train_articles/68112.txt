Teamsters, Boilermakers Endorsing Obama
Barack Obama is set to pick up the endorsement of another big union — none other than the Teamsters. Additionally, the Obama campaign announced in a press release that they've been endorsed by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, who could further help provide some blue-collar credibility in Ohio.

Obama is continuing to make inroads with working-class voters — the exit polls from Wisconsin showed him winning union households 53%-44%, and winning 54%-44% among voters making under $50,000. More unions jumping on board certainly couldn't hurt his momentum in that department.
