ABCNEWS.com : Beverley Lumpkin: Halls of Justice
The Great Hall  a two-story room used for department events and ceremonies  is home to two enormous and stylized but largely naked aluminum statues. On the left, the female figure represents the Spirit of Justice; the male on the right is the Majesty of Law (early editions of last week's column gave him the wrong name because of an error on the Justice Department Web site). The male is clad in only a cloth draped over his essential parts; the female wears a sort of toga-style garment, but one breast is entirely exposed. She's been fondly referred to for years, by at least some, as "Minnie Lou."

These statues no longer exist in all their glory. Minnie Lou and her mate now can only be imagined. Draperies, ordered by someone in Attorney General John Ashcroft's office, were installed two weeks ago. Well, Minnie certainly had readers reacting  here are some of their e-mails.
