Casper Planet
Old Warning With New Meaning

Archeologist Anita Wyderbox recently brought to surface an old hieroglyph 1000's of years old that was discovered in an ancient Egyptian library. Wyderbox says the hieroglyph may be small but packs a heated warning; more true in the coming month than ever. It states, "When the earth rumbles, rivers of red flow from the dirt, and the midday sky turns dark. The Wasps of Death shall be released". Why does that concern Casper, or any where for that m ... atter? Let us fill you in. Within the weeks leading up to the Eclipse next month, there has been an extreme pickup in seismic activity around the world's largest volcano. Seventy five percent of the killer bee population have migrated to within 100 air miles of the epicenter of the Eclipse. So just ask yourself this one question, Is this warning a coincidence? Or is it just that? A warning from the past, to protect our future against a mass wasp extinction event, much like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs? If you would like to be prepared, make sure you have plenty of vinegar, cow dung and ginger root on hand. When mixed, it is the only cure for Killer Bee stings.
