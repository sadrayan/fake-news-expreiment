Whoopi Goldberg Adopts Kitten Thrown from Car in N.Y.C.
A resilient kitten who survived being thrown from a moving car on New York City’s Verrazano Bridge in July has found a permanent home with Whoopi Goldberg.

The View cohost announced on her Facebook page Monday that she adopted the Russian blue cat named Verrazano, whose survival story tugged at heartstrings when he visited the talk show in July.

“For all of you who remember me on The View meeting Verrazano,” she wrote, “I adopted him and I was finally able to take him home.”

When the kitten was just 5 weeks old, an unidentified person tossed the cat from the window of a moving car on the bridge. Luckily, animal control officer Brendon Ocasio saw it happen and rescued the cat from the busy roadway.

Now nicknamed Vinny, the feline is settling well into his new digs but has one more challenge to overcome: Goldberg’s other cat, Oliver.

“Oliver’s not too happy but, Vinny is having the time of his life,” she said. “I think he’ll get Oliver to come around sooner than later.”
