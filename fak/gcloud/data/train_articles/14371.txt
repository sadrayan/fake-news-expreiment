WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Westwood) issued the following statement on Wednesday regarding the Obama Administration's announcement to postpone the Affordable Care Act's mandate for large employers to provide health care coverage to their workers until 2015:

“The Obama Administration’s decision to delay key provisions of the Affordable Care Act is a clear acknowledgement of the threat this law poses to the economy. The fact remains that delaying a bad idea does not make it a good idea; it just changes when Americans will have to deal with it. Callously, that reckoning is being delayed until after the 2014 Congressional elections.

This disastrous law should be repealed and replaced with common sense reforms that lower the cost of health care for all Americans.”
