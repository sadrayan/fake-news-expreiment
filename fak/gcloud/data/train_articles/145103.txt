McKinney gun instructor loses volunteer cop job after advocating 'deadly force' for monument vandals
A firearms instructor lost his volunteer police position in Tioga after a Facebook post suggesting "deadly force" could be used against vandals who deface a monument.

Phil Ryan had worked for about three years as an unpaid reserve officer for the Tioga Police Department, a small town east of Lake Ray Roberts, according to KTVT-TV (Channel 11).

The town's police chief dismissed Ryan after the post made the rounds online, according to the station. The chief added that he does not support the comments.

Phone calls to the department by The Dallas Morning News were not returned.
