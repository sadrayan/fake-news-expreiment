Mexico
We have expanded activities in Reynosa, Tamaulipas state, to provide medical, psychological, and social care in one of Mexicoâ€™s most violent areas. MSF provides primary and mental health care and social services at a clinic, and runs mobile clinics in two shelters for migrants and deportees and at the Tamaulipas Institute for Migrants (ITM).

In Matamoros, across the border from the American city of Brownsville, Texas, MSF teams care for migrants and deportees at two shelters. And in Nuevo Laredo, we started providing medical and psychosocial services at two new points, with a special focus on caring for victims of violence.

In Mexicali, MSF recently opened a facility to provide assistance to migrants, refugees, and newly deported people. We also cared for people traveling in migrant caravans at two temporary emergency projects in Tijuana and Piedras Negras.

In Acapulco, MSF has expanded its activities to new neighborhoods and also provides services around the clock at Renacimiento hospital. In 2017, MSF staff treated 200 victims of sexual violence and carried out 2,307 individual mental health consultations. The team also facilitated community support groups and neighborhood activities.
