FACT CHECK: Melania Trump Copied Statement from Hillary Clinton
On 8 October 2016, Melania Trump released a statement concerning the release of a tape containing offensive remarks her husband Donald Trump had made about women back in 2005:

The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.

Shortly after Melania Trump released her statement, an image began circulating on Facebook suggesting that her remarks were a near verbatim copy of a statement released by Hillary Clinton in 1998 concerning her husband Bill Clinton’s relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky:

While the statement from Melania Trump is real, the one from Hillary Clinton is not. We found no record of the former First Lady’s issuing such a statement on 8 December 1998, or at any other time.

This image was simply a political barb aimed at mocking Melania Trump over an earlier plagiarism scandal and/or mocking Hillary Clinton by suggesting that her husband had engaged in the same type of behavior as Melania Trump’s husband had.
