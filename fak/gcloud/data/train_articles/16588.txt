Thanks for the opportunity to speak. Attached is our analysis of existing debt, with no new bond authorization, and the subsequent taxpayer impact of the projected AV Growth and difference between no bond and proposed bond. In short, in 2021, the district could lower its tax rate by about three cents to just over $.08 cents and the taxpayer impact is $123 annually.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Best Regards,

One last point, if the bond doesn’t pass, the district would have to consider increasing the tax rate on the M&O to address critical safety issues. We have over $3B in critical facility deficiencies. With no bonding capacity to fix critical safety issues, the district would need to cover emergencies on the M&O tax rate. Since the district currently has a deficit in the General Fund, it would need to increase the M&O tax rate to maximum under law, 1.17 or a nine cent increase. While I estimate that the district would collect about $107.2 Million in tax revenue from the increase, under recapture laws, the district would only retain about $25.7 million, and $81.5 million would be sent to the state.

Accurate to say that per the modeling, the homesteader at median value would pay $382.25 in 2027-28 for I&S taxes if prop passes compared to $197.89 if the prop does not pass? That’s a $184.36, 97 percent difference.

I would say that: Assuming that the district issues no new debt, and continues to pay down existing debt, with nearly 60% of the existing debt paid off, taxpayers could see……….

As I stated, this is highly unlikely and I don’t think it’s realistic. As schools continue to deteriorate over the next 10 yrs, one could speculate that home values could drop and I may have to increase the rate for the existing debt;

Or, consider an M&O increase.

In follow-up, in FY2022, of the total $135.1 million, the incremental debt service from the proposed 2017 bonds is $35,517,700.

The estimated revenue generated from the $.0297 is $35,523,869. We only assume a collection rate of 99%, because of historical collections and risk of delinquencies.

I hope this helps connect the understanding.

We just spoke.

I wanted to briefly circle back to ask under what worst-case future scenario the district believes it might need to raise the tax rate to cover the cost of the bonds? Has an answer to this kind of question been posted by the district already?

We estimate that if AV growth stayed flat for the next 8 years or there was a cumulative decline in AV of 20%, we would need to consider increasing the tax rate. Of course these events would buck historical trends of the last 10 years where there was only year that AV declined, in 2011 due to the national recession-arguably the worse in history. Even still, there was subsequent growth thereafter and the decline was made-up after two years and growth doubled after that.

Is this the tax-impact document you were describing to me as a result of our inquiries? When did it post?

Yes. This was added in addition to the tax capacity analysis deck we already had on our debt page modeling the impact of a flat tax rate. It was added on Monday. I needed the weekend to reconcile which method to use. I had to confer with my school district colleagues across the state, as well as other financial firms and none of them had heard of this type of modeling as it bunks what is traditionally is done. Dallas, Plano, others have used the traditional approaches but the fervor here in austin from this anti tax group is fueling more skepticism and calls for transparency that’s confusing and misleading in some respects. We’ve complied with the Comptroller’s requirement for debt transparency.
