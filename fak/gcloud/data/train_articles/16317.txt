In response to your question yesterday, the specific passage under contention relates the following:

"Coal, the target of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, generates 34 percent of Texas’s electricity. The plan eliminates coal-fired power plants and requires Texas to assume reductions in excess of 27 other states combined.”

The source of the confusion appears to be the reasonable reading that the second sentence refers to the elimination of all coal-fired plants. It does not: all coal-fired plants are not eliminated, though a great number of them will be: enough to cause grievous harm to the Texas economy and Texas families. The sentence is accurate — “[t]he plan,” in fact, “eliminates coal-fired power plants” — but the extent and quantity of that elimination is apparently unclear to some readers.

We are forwarding below and attached some data that ought to clarify the remarkable extent of de facto coal-fire plant elimination in Texas under the CPP. Please do let us know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,

Caroline Espinosa

Additional data:

> Henneke’s op-ed states, “The plan eliminates coal-fired power plants…” but does not claim elimination of all coal-fired power plants. This statement is confirmed as accurate by the the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition based upon data within EPA’s rule making record.

> On page 34 of its May 2015, Analysis of the Impacts of the Clean Power Plan, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that the emission performance goals in the Clean Power Plan result in more retirements (i.e. elimination) of existing fossil fuel-fired plants. http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/powerplants/cleanplan/pdf/powerplant.pdf

> Retirements of coal-fired power plants has been widely reported in the media.

> · Proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2014, the plan would require states to reduce air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions and would likely speed the retirement of older, inefficient coal-fired power plants. http://www.govtech.com/fs/Phasing-Out-Coal-Fired-Power-Plants-Would-be-Good-for-the-Country.html

> I understand that EDF and perhaps the Statesman have of questioned the veracity of your op-ed statement “The [Clean Power] plan eliminates coal-fired power plants. . . “. On behalf of the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition, I am glad to provide you with a significant body of evidence based on our research that backs up your statement.

>

> I did not take your statement as an assertion that all coal plants would be eliminated (at least not right away), but rather as an assertion that it was clear that the rule, as proposed, would force the retirement of some coal plants in Texas. Our research indicates that your statement is accurate based on a number of things in EPA’s rulemaking record, including the following:

>

> 1. EPA’s Integrated Planning Model (IPM). As reflected in the first slide of the first attachment *(entitled “June 22 Texas CPP and Haze Impact on Fleet Slides”), EPA’s IPM model, based on the budget proposed for Texas, projects the retirement of 24 of the 41 coal-fired units in Texas (reflecting 12,760 MWs of the 25,302 MW nameplate capacity of the Texas coal fleet). The remaining three slides in that attachment is a list of key data regarding the entire Texas coal fleet. The information in the retirement chart comes from two primary sources of information. The first source is EPA’s parsed data files available in the rulemaking docket. This includes files outlining how EPA’s Option 1 (all 4 BSER Blocks are utilized) impacts units in 2025, under a scenario where each state is responsible for complying with the rule, rather than compliance at a regional level. Attached to this email is the file in its original form, as well as an edited version which limits the file just to Texas units, hides certain columns, and highlights projected Texas retirements. The second source of information is not found in the rulemaking docket, but it is available on EPA’s Clean Power Plan IPM website(http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/powersectormodeling/cleanpowerplan.html). The specific file can be found in the Option 1 – State folder and is titled Proposed Clean Power Plan_Option 1 State_rpe file. Sorting this data requires additional work, as the RPE file does not identify units by name and combines some units by site. However, through an analysis of the description of the plants (location/region, capacity, fuel type, etc.), names were assigned. Then, each run was compared to determine if any plants were no longer included in the IPM run – a sign that the plants were no longer modeled as operating. The years of review were 2016, 2018, 2020, 2025, and 2030. A 2016 base case was also reviewed and is available on EPA’s IPM website (linked above). Both an unaltered and edited version (limiting to Texas coal plants, and additional plants in the SPP West region) of the Option 1 RPE file are attached. Looking solely at ERCOT as an example, while there are no plant names assigned, it is evident how fewer units are included under each run as years progress. Note that the chart demonstrates the point that significant retirements are expected by 2020, which is an extremely short timeframe that could expose the Texas market to dramatic reliability concerns. As described below, even those plants not projected by EPA to retire by 2020 are is put in serious jeopardy by the rule, as proposed, due to the budget EPA proposes to force Texas to meet and the assumptions built into EPA’s budget derivation.

>

> 2. EPA’s budget derivation spreadsheets in the rulemaking docket reflect an EPA assumption that 51.91% of the coal-fired generation will be down-dispatched in favor of natural gas-fired generation (55.36% if 2013 were used as the baseline year). These assumptions and the source documents for the calculation are reflected in the last attachment to this email, entitled “Block 2 EPA Fuel Switch assumptions.” See EPA Technical Support Document: Goal Computation, “Data File: Goal Computation – Appendix 1 and 2 (XLS)”, available at: http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards/clean-power-plan-proposed-rule-technical-documents. Review Excel Spreadsheet page “Appendix 1 – Proposed Goals.” For Texas, compare Column F – “Hist Coal Gen (MWh)” to Column M – “Redispatched Coal Gen. (MWh). This shows a change from 138,705,138 MWh to 66,698,233 MWh. This is a reduction of 72,006,905 MWh or 51.91%.

>

> 3. A comparison of the interim and final budgeted rates proposed for Texas by EPA (853 and 791 lb/MWh, respectively) with the emission rates of the Texas coal-fired power plants (ranging from 1931 to 2607 lbs/MWh). Whatever compliance mechanism is assumed (direct emission rates, cap and trade, carbon tax, etc.), a budget rate that is less than half the lowest-emitting coal plant and less than a third of the highest emitting coal plant will so disadvantage coal in the marketplace that it is logical to assume that the economic viability of some, if not all, of those plants would be severely undermined, especially in highly competitive electric power market like Texas. See EPA Technical Support Document, “Data File: 2012 Unit Level Data using the eGRID Methodology,” available at: http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards/clean-power-plan-proposed-rule-technical-documents. Method for parsing the data:

> · Filter the units by state, then by fuel type – coal (“LIG” or “SUB”), then remove units identified as “EXCLUDE” by EPA (which cancels duplicated entries and incorporates other EPA factors). This provides you the list of Texas coal plants.

> · Then for each plant, take the carbon dioxide emissions in tons (Column N) and multiply by 2000 lbs/ton. This provides that CO2 emissions in pounds.

> · Then divide that total emission in pounds by total electric generation in MWh (Column J).

> · The result is a unit-by-unit lbs/MWh emissions rate.

>

> One final point – it has become commonplace to hear EPA claim that its rule won’t “force” any specific retirements and that the states have “flexibility” in complying with their budgets. This is a disingenuous argument given that the very assumptions built into the budget derivation assume fuel switching off of coal and the mandatory budget of 853/791 lb/MWh necessarily makes the majority, if not all, coal plants incapable of competing in a market forced to meet such an extraordinarily low budget.
