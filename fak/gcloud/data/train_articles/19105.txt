Heck Statement on Default Prevention Act of 2013
WASHINGTON -- Congressman Joe Heck (NV-03) today released the following statement after voting in favor of a bipartisan deal to fund the federal government, prevent a default, and set up long-term budget talks. The legislation also overturns a rule issued by the Obama Administration to ignore verification requirements in order to receive health insurance subsidies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

"Government by crisis is not an effective way to govern. Families in Nevada have endured unnecessary hardships due to a widespread failure of leadership in Washington. That is not what the people expect and it is certainly not what they deserve.

“This bipartisan bill paves the way for us to reopen the government and address our long-term spending and debt issues. It also ensures our seniors and veterans continue to receive their benefits and maintains our nation's military readiness.

"I am deeply disappointed this legislation did not include spending reforms to address this administration's spending addiction. The ball is now squarely in the court of the president and leadership in both houses to move those negotiations forward.

“As I have stated all along, the healthcare law must be repealed, repaired, and replaced because of the burdens it places on individuals, families, and businesses, but not at the expense of a prolonged government shutdown.

“I am hopeful that we can reach a responsible long-term budgetary agreement. Anything less that does not address the sequester's impact on our military readiness, reduce our debt and deficit, and help grow our economy is unacceptable and I will no longer support band-aid approaches to these serious problems."
