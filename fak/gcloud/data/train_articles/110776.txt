Can shoe size predict penile length?
The penis appears in virtually every aspect of life; medicine, arts and culture, religion, media and common folklore. Penile length is often a common denominator, with the well-held belief that a longer penis is a measure of increased masculinity. Many believe that the size of a man's penis can be estimated by assessing various other parts of his body, notoriously his shoe size [ 1 ]. Because there is uncertainty about the nature of the relationship between a man's shoe size and penile length, we conducted a prospective study to scientifically address the issue.

Subjects and methods

The study comprised 104 men consulting for various urological reasons; no men had congenital or acquired abnormalities of the penis. The nature of the study was fully explained to the men and verbal consent was obtained. In the flaccid state the penis has no fixed length, which is known to vary in response to touch, temperature, bodily activity and other environmental influences. Thus measurements were made immediately after the men undressed, to minimize the effects of temperature.

The true physiological length of the penis can only be obtained when the penis is fully erect; it was not feasible for the present study to measure this variable and thus an indirect method was used. Two previous studies have shown that stretched penile length is a valid estimate of erect length [2,3]. Thus the linear distance from the symphysis pubis to the tip of the glans along the dorsal aspect, under maximal extension of the phallus, was recorded using a measuring tape. All lengths were measured by two urologists and recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm. The age and shoe size (converted to the British scale) was documented for each subject and all data stored confidentially on a personal computer. The results were assessed statistically using a least-squares regression model, with the level of significance chosen as P < 0.05.
