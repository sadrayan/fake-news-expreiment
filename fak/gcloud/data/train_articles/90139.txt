Bill White Supported Lawsuits – And Legislation – To Limit Military Participation In Local Elections
Hidden Taxes Day 86: Liberal trial lawyer hiding his past anti-military effort

As liberal trial lawyer Bill White continues to hide his income tax returns for 86 days and counting, he is also hiding his past anti-military efforts.

“Though he continues to hide his tax returns, liberal Bill White cannot hide the truth about his efforts to restrict the voting rights of men and women of the armed forces,” said Texans for Rick Perry spokesman Mark Miner. “Bill White should come clean and apologize for supporting lawsuits and legislation that would have made it harder for military men and women serving overseas to fully participate in the democratic process.”

In March 1997, as Chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, White supported frivolous lawsuits filed by two Democratic candidates in Val Verde County who claimed that approximately 800 mail-in ballots cast by military members caused them to lose their November 1996 elections. At the time, “White said military voters are entitled to have a say in the races for federal offices – president, vice president and the Congress – but not in state, county or local elections.” [1]

Weeks later, White defended partisan legislation that military advocates warned “would sharply restrict voting rights for Texas armed services personnel stationed elsewhere.” [2]

The restrictions, included in an amendment sponsored by Rep. Hugo Berlanga, passed the Texas House on April, 30, 1997. The next day, the Houston Chronicle published the article, “Bill would deny military personnel vote in local elections,” describing the anti-military legislation. (Full article below) [3]
