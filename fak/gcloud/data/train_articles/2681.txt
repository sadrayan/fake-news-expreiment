--> The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Bruce M. Alberts is president of the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. William A. Wulf is interim president of the National Academy of Engineering. The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Kenneth I. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine. The National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy's purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce M. Alberts and Dr. William A. Wulf are chairman and interim vice chairman, respectively, of the National Research Council.

--> Preface The Committee on Population was established by the National Research Council in 1983 to bring the knowledge and methods of the population sciences to bear on major issues of science and public policy. The committee's mandate is to conduct scientific assessments of major population issues and to provide a forum for discussion and analysis of important public policy issues related to population. The papers in this volume were first presented at a Committee on Population workshop on the demography of American Indians and Alaska Natives. The workshop, which was held in May 1995 at the request of the Public Health Service, brought together researchers from different disciplines to discuss recent issues in American Indian demography and their implications for health service delivery. At that time, a number of alternative plans for reforming healthcare were being considered, each of which offered explicitly and implicitly different options for providing healthcare to beneficiaries of the IHS. The papers prepared for the workshop were not designed to present the needed information directly, but to provide background data that could be used by the Public Health Service and the IHS in preparing such estimates for their deliberations. A major challenge for demographers concerned with American Indian and Alaska Native populations is to differentiate between changes in the size, characteristics, and distribution of these populations caused by fertility, mortality, and migration trends and changes caused by the increased tendency of people to identify themselves as Indians in response

--> to census or survey questions on race, ethnicity, and ancestry. Over the last 20 years, changes in self-identification have been substantial and have affected estimates of birth and death rates, as well as estimates of the geographic and income distributions of American Indians. Changes in self-identification and eligibility affect the estimates and projections, particularly the long-range projections, of the population relevant to Indian Health Service (IHS) and other agencies that provide services for American Indians. Many of the people newly identifying themselves as American Indian are unlikely to have been served in the past by the IHS. Hence, designing plans for coverage of eligible IHS beneficiaries, projecting enrollments, and estimating utilization and premiums, requires up-to-date estimates of the size, composition, distribution, economic characteristics, and health care needs of the potentially eligible populations. This volume pulls together information on the demography and health status of American Indians. The work would not have been possible without the efforts of several people, but two deserve special recognition. First, the committee was extremely fortunate in being able to enlist the services of Gary D. Sandefur, a distinguished scholar of American Indian demography, to collaborate on the project and ensure that it was a success. Second, committee member Ronald R. Rindfuss worked diligently to organize the workshop and share the editorial duties for this volume. The committee expresses its heartfelt appreciation to both of them for contributing so much of their valuable time and expertise. The committee is grateful to the Public Health Service for its financial support and to staff members Susanne Stoiber and Maruta Zitans for their interest and efforts during the development of the workshop. The Committee would also like to thank the National Institute on Aging for providing funding for this project. Finally, we thank the staff at the National Research Council, who made it all possible. The work took place under the general direction of John Haaga, director of the Committee on Population. Barney Cohen, program officer, provided a constant intellectual and managerial presence for the project, from the organization of the workshop to the publication of this volume. Trish DeFrisco, senior project assistant, efficiently and diligently took care of all the logistical arrangements and prepared the papers for publication. We also thank Rona Briere for her skillful editing of the manuscript. We are grateful to them all. Ronald D. Lee, Chair Committee on Population
