Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein wraps up testimony in trial of ex-employee Christina Kitterman
Scott Rothstein wrapped up more than 8 1/2 hours on the witness stand Thursday by telling jurors that he is paying for his crimes and that everyone who helped him should own up and do the same.

"You see these?" Rothstein said, rattling his handcuffed wrists in the air in front of him. "I'm in prison for 50 years — I will die there."

In an unusual move, the defense for Christina Kitterman, an attorney who formerly worked for Rothstein, called the convicted Ponzi schemer who has cooperated extensively with federal prosecutors, to testify as a defense witness for Kitterman in her trial on federal wire fraud charges.

"We never called him to prove the truth of anything he said," Kitterman's defense attorney Valentin Rodriguez Jr. said after court Thursday. "The jury needed to know who he was and who he is today."

Who Scott Rothstein is today, beginning the fifth year of the 50-year prison term he is serving, is pretty much the same opportunistic conman that he was when he was running his $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme, Rodriguez suggested.

Dressed in the same blue cotton T-shirt and jeans he wore on the first day of his testimony, Rothstein also sported what looked like a cheap black wristwatch — a sharp contrast to his days of collecting designer watches, some of which cost $500,000 each.

Rothstein forcefully defended himself, denying that was unfairly smearing Kitterman in court using the same manipulative and dishonest tactics that earned him the dubious honor of being South Florida's most successful swindler.
