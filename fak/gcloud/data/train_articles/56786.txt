WASHINGTON â€” House Speaker Paul Ryan raised more than $44 million in 2017, a record amount for a House speaker in a non-election year, as Republicans gear up for fierce midterm battles.

The Wisconsin Republican transferred $32 million of his haul to the National Republican Congressional Committee, his aides said Thursday in announcing the fundraising totals.

The GOP faces a tough climate ahead of November's elections: The newly elected president's party typically loses seats in the midterms; President Trump's approval ratings are at historic lows and a wave of GOP House retirements has put more than two dozen seats up for grabs.

Democrats need to net 24 seats to take control of the House.

In addition to the $32 million he transferred to the House fundraising committee, Ryan also hosted nearly 50 fundraisers for GOP House members that sent $4.75 million into individual campaign accounts, Ryan's aides say.
