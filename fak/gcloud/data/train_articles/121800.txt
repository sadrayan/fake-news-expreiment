Emissions of CO 2 are the main contributor to anthropogenic climate change. Here we present updated information on their present and near-future estimates. We calculate that global CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel burning decreased by 1.3% in 2009 owing to the global financial and economic crisis that started in 2008; this is half the decrease anticipated a year ago1. If economic growth proceeds as expected2, emissions are projected to increase by more than 3% in 2010, approaching the high emissions growth rates that were observed from 2000 to 20081, 3, 4. We estimate that recent CO 2 emissions from deforestation and other land-use changes (LUCs) have declined compared with the 1990s, primarily because of reduced rates of deforestation in the tropics5 and a smaller contribution owing to forest regrowth elsewhere.

Fossil fuel CO 2 emissions for the globe are computed from statistics on energy consumption at the country level6, 7 and converted to CO 2 emissions by fuel type8. The growth in CO 2 emissions closely follows the growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) corrected for improvements in energy efficiency4. Thus, the contraction of GDP owing to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 was expected to cause a decrease in global CO 2 emissions. Emissions in 2008 grew at a similar rate to the previous eight years, but they decreased by 1.3% in 2009. Despite this drop, the 2009 global fossil fuel and cement emissions were the second highest in human history at 8.4 ± 0.5 Pg C (30.8 billion tons of CO 2 ), just below the 2008 emissions7.

This global decrease hides large regional differences. The largest decreases occurred in Europe, Japan and North America (for example, USA −6.9%, UK −8.6%, Germany −7%, Japan −11.8%, Russia −8.4%), whereas some emerging economies recorded substantial increases in their total emissions (for example, China +8%, India +6.2%, South Korea +1.4%).

The observed decrease of 1.3% in global fossil fuel emissions in 2009 is less than half of the decrease of 2.8% projected a year ago1. That projection used a forecast from the International Monetary Fund for the annual real growth in world GDP2 and assumed that the carbon intensity of world GDP (that is, the fossil fuel emissions per unit of GDP) would continue to improve following a long-term trend reduction of carbon intensity of −1.7% yr−1. The decrease in emissions was lower than projected for two reasons. First, the actual decrease2 in GDP (−0.6%) was lower than forecast in October 2009 (−1.1%) because of continuing high GDP growth in China (+9.1%) and other emerging economies. Second, the carbon intensity of world GDP improved by only −0.7% in 2009, less than half of its long-term average, because of an increased share of fossil fuel CO 2 emissions coming from emerging economies with a relatively high carbon intensity and an increasing reliance on coal. Both globally and for emerging economies, the fraction of fossil fuel emissions from coal increased in 2009, as in 20081.

As the global economy recovers, the world GDP is projected to increase by 4.8% in 20102. Even if the carbon intensity of world GDP improves following its long-term average, global emissions will have increased again by more than 3% in 2010 (Fig. 1).

Figure 1: Global CO 2 emissions since 1997 from fossil fuel and cement production (a) and LUC (b). Fossil fuel CO 2 emissions were based on United Nations Energy Statistics to 2007, and on BP energy data from 2007 onwards6, 7. Cement CO 2 emissions are from the US Geological Survey. LUC CO 2 emissions were based on the revised statistics of the Food and Agricultural Organization5, 9. Both sources of emissions are updated from ref. 1 (shown in black dashed line).

Historical CO 2 emissions from LUC were revised and updated to 2009 using new data on forest cover and land use — reported by each country and compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization5 — and a LUC emission model9. The estimate of average 2000 to 2009 LUC emissions of 1.1 ± 0.7 Pg C yr−1 has been revised downwards from the estimate that was made in 20091 (Fig. 1), primarily because of a downward revision of the rates of deforestation in tropical Asia. LUC emissions for the past decade are now lower than their 1990s level (1.5 ± 0.7 Pg C yr−1), although the decadal difference is still below the uncertainty in the data and method. A recent decrease in LUC emissions would be consistent with the reported downward trends of deforestation detected from satellite data in the Brazilian Amazon10 and Indonesia11. Temperate forest regrowth in Eurasia has constantly increased since the 1950s at a rate of 0.2 Pg C yr−1 per decade. For the first time, according to our estimate, forest regrowth has overcompensated LUC emissions at temperate latitudes and has resulted in a small net sink of CO 2 (< 0.1 Pg C yr−1) since 2000 in these latitudes.
