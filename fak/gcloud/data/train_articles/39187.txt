This week, I would like to welcome Ken Tucker as the new secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections. Ken brings 34 years of law enforcement experience with him to his new position.

I would also like to announce that Chuck Corley will be removing “interim” from his job title and will serve as Secretary of Florida Department of Elder Affairs. Chuck brings over 30 years of health and human service experience to the agency.

I look forward to working with both of them as we strive to make Florida the best place to live, work and play.

Also this week, I took action on the proposed budgets of Florida’s five water management districts.

All together, these budgets reflect a reduction of more than 700-million-dollars over last year.

That includes 200-million-dollars in property tax cuts.

I want to thank the districts and the Department of Environmental Protection for their hard work as they examined their budgets to find efficiencies and savings.

Florida’s water management districts are changing the way they do business.

They can better focus on their core mission by avoiding new debt, getting rid of dual pension plans and eliminating non – “core mission” – activities.

Their core mission is to protect our water supply, water quality, and natural resources and provide flood protection.

These proposed budgets will help them focus on these responsibilities. Florida’s water management districts will protect Florida’s water resources for the future while serving as better stewards of taxpayer dollars.
