Nevada: Approved 2017 *unsubsidized* indy mkt rate hikes: 10.6% (vs. 15% requested)
Last year, the average full-price rate hikes approved by state regulators tended to be several percentage points lower overall than the increases requested by carriers. This year, there's been very little of that; in most case so far, the regulators have pretty much authorized the premium rate increases as requested by carriers...and in many cases have approved higher increases than requested. As a result, the overall national averages approved have been pretty close to the requests (around 24-25% nationally).

However, Nevada is an exception to this trend. Back in early June, the weighted average increases requested were just over 15% state-wide (this was confirmed by the NV DOI a month later). Yesterday, however, the DOI released the approved rate hikes, and I'm happy to report that they lopped about 1/3 off the average hikes:
