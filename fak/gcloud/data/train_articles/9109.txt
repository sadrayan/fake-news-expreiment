About the UCF College of Medicine
The UCF Academic Health Sciences campus is now available in the official UCF App.

Established in 2006, the UCF College of Medicine is one of the first U.S. medical schools in decades to be built from the ground up. As a new medical school, UCF’s program epitomizes innovation, high-tech learning tools and a pioneering spirit to educate young doctors and scientists in a new and better way for the 21st century.

The college is unique nationally because of its large undergraduate and graduate programs in biomedicine through its Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences. The Burnett School has almost 3,000 undergraduate majors — making it the third most popular major at UCF. The medical school also offers joint degrees, including an M.D./Ph.D., an M.D./M.B.A. and an M.D./M.S. degree in hospitality.

The UCF College of Medicine is a research-based medical school with a culture based on partnerships and collaboration. The college’s medical and biomedical programs capitalize on UCF’s existing strengths in biological sciences, modeling and simulation, engineering, optics and photonics, psychology, chemistry, film and digital media, business and nursing.

The college is a founding member of Orlando’s growing Medical City at Lake Nona. The UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona now includes the medical school’s new 170,000-square-foot medical education facility, featuring the latest in lab and classroom technology, as well as its new 198,000-square-foot Burnett Biomedical Sciences building.
