Angels for Alanna by Dawn Jacob Smith
Imagine leaving your 7 month old baby girl with the babysitter before work. You carry on with your day, just like every other day. After work, you go home to your precious baby girl, just like every other day...But this day is different! When you arrive home you learn that there was an accident and your sweet angel has been burned (severely), in a bathing accident? You take that baby to emergency and she gets transferred to the burn unit.



This is where we step in...this young mother did everything right! She went to work to care for her child and trusted her child in the care of another, like so many of us do every day. Alanna, at 7 months, is still in the burn unit and getting better. But the financial strain that is now on her mother due to this accident is going to be great! The hospital treatment bills and the babies aftercare are going to add up!



All I can say is when I saw the pictures last night, I knew I had to help! So all donations received through the campaign will be used to pay for medical expenses and after care treatment for Alanna.



Please keep hoping and praying that Alanna won't need to endure skin grafting!
