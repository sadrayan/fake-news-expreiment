‘He Was Very Much Involved’: Al Sharpton Heralds Prince’s Commitment to Civil Rights
Prince wasn’t just one of the greatest artists of all time, he was very involved in political causes, as Al Sharpton fondly reflected on MSNBC earlier this afternoon.

Last year, Prince got very involved in the Baltimore protests following Freddie Gray‘s death. He headlined a concert there titled “Rally 4 Peace” and released a song titled “Baltimore” with lyrics like “It was a good day/At least a little better than the day in Baltimore” and “Are we gonna see another bloody day?”

Sharpton spoke with Brian Williams about Prince’s activism in both Baltimore and following the death of Trayvon Martin:

“I remember, Brian, when we were raising the issue of justice around the Trayvon Martin killing. Prince called me and sent some funds that I gave to the family for him, and never wanted recognition for it… He was one that didn’t want to make a lot about about his humanitarian and activist involvements, but he was very much involved in what was going on in the country.”
