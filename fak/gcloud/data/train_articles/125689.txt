FALSE: Wendy's Employee Putting Feces in Food
In March 2016, the Now8News website published an article reporting that a Wendy’s employee had been arrested after confessing to putting his feces in the restaurant’s chili:

A Wendy’s employee is now under arrest after he admitted to “pooping” in several hundred batches of chili since 2013. Brian Casper, 28, had been an “on time and reliable employee,” according to the manager and coworkers at the Mobile, Alabama location. The fact that this happened was a shock to everybody at the restaurant, including the several thousand customers who may have consumed Casper’s feces.

The above-displayed story was replicated on several other disreputable web sites, such as TMZ World News (no affiliation with TMZ.com) and FoxNews3 (no affiliation with FoxNews.com). While all three of these web sites specialize in fake news stories, only TMZ World News featured a disclaimer labeling its content as satire:

(TMZ World) is the most notorious entertainment website in the world with the most shocking Satire News to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief.

All three versions of the story also included a photo allegedly showing Wendy’s employee “Brian Casper.” This photo, however, is actually the mugshot of a Michigan man who was arrested in 2011 for a crime unrelated to feces (marijuana possession and furnishing alcohol to a minor) and briefly made headlines when he tucked his ears through his stretched lobes.
