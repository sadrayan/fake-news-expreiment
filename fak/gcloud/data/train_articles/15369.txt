Email, Zac Petkanas, communications director, Wendy Davis campaign, May 7, 2014

12:53 p.m.

Senator Davis stopped by the event to talk about Texas and give an update on her campaign against Greg Abbott.

I’ve attached the event invitation, which you’ll note does not include Senator Davis’ name. Additionally, I’ve included the remarks she gave which do not include a fundraising pitch for anybody.

(The invitation and prepared remarks are separately sourced in our fact check--PolitiFact Texas.)
