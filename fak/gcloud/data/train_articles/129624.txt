Missing Woman's Disappearance Suspicious
A Visalia woman is still missing almost a week after she was last seen in Lemoore. Sheriff deputies are now calling it a suspicious disappearance.

The Tulare County Sheriffs Department has been actively investigating the case and searching for 31 year old Cecilia Cabrera since she went missing and say her burned vehicle makes the disappearance suspicious.

Cabrera was last seen on surveillance video leaving the Tachi Palace Casino last Thursday just after midnight. According to the Sheriffs Department, she is seen alone but it's still unclear if she left by herself.

"We don't have the parking lot. We have her walking out of the casino," Captain Tom Sigley said. He also said Cabrera went to the casino with her husband at about 11pm and went missing just after midnight.

Her 2013 Grey Malibu was found in an orchard near Goshen by the California Highway Patrol Thursday morning. A couple of things making the case suspicious "One, her vehicle was burned. Two, her four kids are still here. They're currently in the care of her mom and her sister but there were no plans for her to go out of town," Captain Sigley said.

Cabrera is a mother of four. Her family is desperate to find her so they've created a Facebook page titled "Missing Cecilia B Cabrera." It has over 2500 followers.

"Social media is dynamic. People talk, if anybody has any information as far as her whereabouts, if they know of anything that's happened to her reach out to us. That's what we're looking for," Captain Sigley said.

Cabrera is Hispanic. She's about 160 pounds and about 5'1 with brown hair and blonde highlights. She was last seen wearing a black shirt, dark jeans and sandals. Her family has passed out fliers hoping to bring her home safely.

Although detectives have gotten some calls, they say nothing has lead then to Cabrera's whereabouts. Anyone with information is asked to call the Tulare County Sheriffs Department at 559-733-6211
