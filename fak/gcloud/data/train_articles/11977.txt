Facts of the Case:

Torcaso was denied his appointment to Notary Public on Maryland because he refused to declare his belief in God. Article 37 of Maryland�s Declaration of Rights states �[N]o religious test ought ever to be required as a qualification for any office of profit or trust in this State, other than a declaration of belief in the existence of God .. ." Torcaso sued because he felt the test unfairly penalized him for not believing in God.







Decision:

In a unanimous decision, the Court ruled that Maryland�s religious test violated Torcaso�s right to religious freedom.





Majority Opinion: (Justice Black)

The desire to protect people from taking religious test oaths led to the construction of Article 37 of the Constitution. It stated that, �no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.� This was followed by the passage of the First Amendment that further granted citizens religious freedom. �We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person "to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion." Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.�







Significance:

This decision prevented states from using religious faith as a prerequisite for holding public office. The Court rejected the argument that holding such jobs is a privilege that can be restricted to people of faith.
