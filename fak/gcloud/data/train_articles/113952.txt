American company microchips employees with device the size of a grain of rice
A US company is microchipping its employees to enable them more convenient access to workplace amenities.

The Wisconsin company - Three Square Market – designs software for break room markets that are commonly found in office complexes.

Now ABC News reports just as people can purchase items at the market using phones, Three Square Market wants to do the same using a microchip implanted inside a person’s hand.

Todd Westby, Three Square Market CEO, said: "It's the next thing that's inevitably going to happen, and we want to be a part of it.”

More than 50 employees have volunteered to have the devices implanted with a chip that is about the size of a single grain of rice.

Along with purchasing market kiosk items, employees will be able to use the chip to enter the building via the front door and log onto their computers.

The chip – which costs $300 and is currently being paid for by the company – is implanted between a person’s thumb and forefinger.

Westby assured ABC News the chip does not use GPS tracking and the data is both encrypted and secure.

No one who works at Three Square Market is required to get the chip implant.

It follows on from Sydney man Meow-Ludo Disco Gamma Meow-Meow who implanted his Opal card chip in his hand last month.
