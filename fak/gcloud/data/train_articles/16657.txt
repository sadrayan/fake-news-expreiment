Jonathan, Andy:

We just heard back from the Capitol Architect’s office about which statues hold guns or swords. That emailed reply is pasted below my signature to this note.

To refresh, we’re fact-checking Jonathan’s statement in an email blast that in the U.S. Capitol, “Stephen F. Austin’s and Sam Houston’s statues” are “the only ones holding a rifle or a sword.”

If you’d like to offer any other information, write or call me soon?

Thanks,

g.

From Jonathan:

"The comment I made was based on my recollection and what I noticed this time at the Capitol -- that may be because my focus is always primarily on Texas."

Since we are Texas Values, an organization dedicated to, among many goals, the freedom of religious expression, you may find this interesting: http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ln-resolution-to-replace-junipero-serra-statue-put-on-hold-20150702-story.html
