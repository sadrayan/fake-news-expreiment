Surprise! Obama White House aids owe $333,485 in back taxes
When it comes to “paying your fair share,” President Obama's White House has done a lot of finger pointing at successful Americans in the private sector. However, when it comes to the people who work at the White House (whose average salaries are paid by the taxpayer and are far higher than the average American’s), there is a disconnect.

from Investors Business Daily:

A new report from the Internal Revenue Service has just revealed that 40 of Obama’s White House aides owe their employer, the federal government, a total of $333,485 in back taxes.

This is the third straight year that the chief executive of the United States has been unable to get his own staff members to keep up with a citizen’s legal income tax obligations. to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes owed. All this while Obama has made such rhetorical hay about corporations and the wealthy paying their fair share.

In its previous report the annual IRS audit accounting found that 36 of the Democrat’s White House aides owed $833,000 in back taxes. The year before it was 41 Obama staff members owing $830,000. In the past year Obama’s teleprompter has been on automatic pilot with oft-repeated demands that Americans and profitable corporate giants pay their fair share of taxes.

Because, as you may have heard him claim, Obama so wants to protect the middle class and we really need to pay down the national debt that he’s done so much to grow by 60% to $16.6 trillion in just the 1,511 days he’s been spending.

"America succeeds when everyone does their fair share," Obama asserted in more than one speech, "when everyone plays by the same rules." Uh-huh.
