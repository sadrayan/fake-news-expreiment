Governor Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens’ Obstructionism is Causing Problems for Georgia

We want Georgia’s taxes to pay for Georgians’ healthcare — not someone else’s.

We want the $30 billion Medicaid expansion for working families that you refused.

We want the 70,000 new jobs in Georgia that you turned away.

We want more than just one licensed insurance exchange navigator in Georgia.

And, Georgians deserve all the benefits of Obamacare — with no more “obstructions.”

We call on Gov. Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens to

STEP UP and lead, or STEP ASIDE.

Georgians deserve affordable healthcare without being barred from insurance due to pre-existing conditions, or facing annual and lifetime caps on benefits. No Georgian should file bankruptcy or lose their home because of an accident or life-threatening illness.

Tell Governor Deal and Commissioner Hudgens to STEP UP OR STEP ASIDE and let others lead Georgia to better healthcare.
