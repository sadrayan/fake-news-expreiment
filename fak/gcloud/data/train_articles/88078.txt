Unemployment has crept up in Pennsylvania over the year, rising to 5.6 percent in July, up from 5 percent a year ago. Nearly 367,000 Pennsylvanians were out of work, the U.S. Labor Department reported Friday.

New Jersey's rate has declined from a year ago, but is inching back up. In July 2015, the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent. In May, it fell to 4.9 percent, but has since increased to 5.2 percent in July.

Pennsylvania's payrolls have increased over the year, to 5.9 million jobs in July up from 5.8 million jobs last July. Job growth has not been sufficient to keep up with the growth in the labor force.

New Jersey's payrolls increased to 4.6 million jobs in July, up from 4.5 million a year ago. However, New Jersey is losing jobs at the rate of about 9,000 a month since May.
