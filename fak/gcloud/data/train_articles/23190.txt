A recently published biography of the 44th president by David Garrow, called “Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama” unearthed the Trump quote in an unpublished law paper Obama authored when he was a soon-to-be Harvard Law School graduate in 1991, according to a Complex report.

"I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don't make it, my children will,” reads a line in the paper titled “Race and Rights Rhetoric,” Obama authored with his friend Robert Fisher.

“[Americans have] a continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility, values that extend far beyond the issue of race in the American mind. The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American—I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don't make it, my children will,” they wrote.

Trump has been touted as a symbol of success in books, movies, and television shows throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Tensions between Trump and Obama began when Obama became president and Trump pushed the 'birther conspiracy' that he was not born in America and thus could not run for president.

Obama spoke out against Trump when he ran as the Republican presidential candidate.
