According to reports, Mr Mthethwa had walked into the water at the aptly named Crocodile River, and was around 30 meters from the bank when the animals attacked.

Eyewitness Deacon Nkosi, a member of the church, was quoted as saying: “The pastor taught us about faith on Sunday last week.

“He promised he would demonstrate his faith to us today, but he unfortunately ended up drowning and getting eaten by three large crocodiles in front of us.

“We still don’t understand how this happened because he fasted and prayed the whole week.

"They finished him in a couple of minutes. All that was left of him when they finished eating him is a pair of sandals and his underwear floating above the water.”

According to reports, emergency services arrived within half an hour of the attack taking place, but they were unable to help the unfortunate pastor.
