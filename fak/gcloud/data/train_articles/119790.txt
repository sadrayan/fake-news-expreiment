Interstate 238
Notes

This road is a travesty. About 2 miles of CA 238 got Interstate funding. OK I can handle that. But why couldn't you have called it something nice like I-480 (CA seemed to have no qualms about using just about every other x80 option in the Bay Area). Not only is this route not a spur off of I-38, but I-38 doesn't even exist. Even it did exist, it wouldn't go there anyway. What were they thinking?!



Yes, that is the whole road between those two rectangles.

The voice of reason in me compells me to let you know about Casey Cooper's rebuttal to this page. Be forewarned though, this page places goals like saving money and helping out commuters higher than the goal of making road geeks happy. I suppose if you have your priorities in that order you can rationalise this.
