Attack against the OSCE SMM. Hug accused the
The First Deputy Chairman of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine Alexander Hug has connected the militants' attack against the patrols of SMM observers in Yasynuvata with the inability of the leaders of the "DPR" terrorist organization DNR to control their armed groups. Hug stated this at a briefing in the temporarily occupied Donetsk on Wednesday, - UNIAN reports.

He recalled the incident that occurred on June 20, when the armed militant of the "DPR" had tried to attack the OSCE SMM observers who were in cars at the railway station in occupied Yasynuvata.

"The fact that the so-called "DPR" is not able to exercise control over this area or does not want to control its people is absolutely unacceptable", - Hug stated.

At the same time, Hug stressed that "they unconditionally put the hand to enable this mission to work in safety on this territory". "We have called and will continue to call upon those who exercise working control to take measures so that those who committed this aggressive act would be brought to justice", - Hug emphasized.

At the same time, he noted that the mission would like to see practical measures that would demonstrate the desire of the militants' leaders to "take their commitments seriously (on the implementation of the Minsk agreements â€“ ed.)".

As previously reported, on June 20, armed militants of the "DPR" had tried to attack observers of the OSCE SMM, who were in cars, in occupied Yasynuvata: they hit the windows with their gunstocks, fired into the air and at the car. The authorities of the "DPR" had unconvincingly tried to shift the responsibility for the incident from their militants to certain "special services of Ukraine".
