Sanders Statement on Effort to Repeal Clean Power Plan
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement today after voting to stop a bill that would repeal the Clean Power Plan.

“It is an embarrassment that with few exceptions Republicans refuse to recognize the reality of climate change, and even fewer are prepared to do anything about it. Today’s vote to block the Clean Power Plan is a stark reminder that instead of worrying about the future of our planet, Republicans are more concerned with their campaign contributions.

“We need comprehensive legislation to aggressively transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to clean energy. We can create a new sustainable energy economy to protect vulnerable communities while transitioning workers into renewable energy jobs. The United States must lead the world in confronting this planetary crisis.”
