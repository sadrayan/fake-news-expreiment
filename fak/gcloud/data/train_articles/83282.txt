Opa-locka airport gets to keep air traffic controllers
The flight tower at Opa-locka Executive Airport will remain operational, even as the Federal Aviation Administration has decided that 149 federal contract towers will close.

The closures come as part of federally mandated spending cuts the agency must make, and the FAA plans to begin a four-week phased closure beginning on April 7.

The agency has made the decision to keep 24 federal contract towers open that had previously been proposed for closure because doing so would have a negative impact on the national interest, according to the FAA.

“Thanks to efforts of the citizens of Miami Lakes and all surrounding areas of Dade County, the flight towers at Opa-locka will remain open,” Miami Lakes Mayor Michael Pizzi said at a press conference on Friday.

Pizzi also met with David Grizzle, chief operating officer of the air traffic organization for the FAA in Washington.

“I made sure Opa-locka was put at the top of the list," Pizzi said, adding that he spent more than an hour with Grizzle.

In early March, the FAA proposed closing 189 contract air traffic control towers as part of its plan to meet the $637 million in cuts required under budget sequestration.

While Opa-locka was spared, North Perry Airport in Pembroke Pines will have its tower closed.

Pizzi said he was “saddened” by that news.

“We’re happy in Miami Lakes, but we’re not going to open up the champagne until North Perry and Boca and the rest of them are open,” he said.

He said he stands with the Air Traffic Control Association and airports that will soon not have flight towers.

For Pizzi, safety is a main concern when it comes to the closures.

“When you fly in without the air traffic controllers, it’s like the skyway equivalent of a four-way stop,” Pizzi said. “To create a four-way stop in the sky above our communities isn’t a very smart thing to do.”
