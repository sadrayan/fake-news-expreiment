Huckabee super PAC raises $3.6 million, mostly from one donor

Almost all the money raised by the super PAC supporting former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee came from one donor: Ronald Cameron of Little Rock, Arkansas.

Cameron, the CEO of the agribusiness behemoth Mountaire, gave $3 million to the pro-Huckabee super PAC Pursuing Americaâ€™s Greatness, according to a Friday FEC filing. Cameron is a regular donor to major Republican causes.

After Cameron, Sharon Herschend of Herschend Family Entertainment donated $500,000 to the super PAC. Real estate investor Jon K. Gibson and Cary Maguire, president of the Maguire Oil donated $50,000 each.

In total, the super PAC raised $3,604,855.94.

A Quinnipiac University poll published Thursday found Huckabee with 6 percent support among Republican primary voters, tied with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Sen. Rand Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio. The poll found him trailing Donald Trump (20 percent), Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (13 percent), and former Florida governor Jeb Bush (10 percent).
