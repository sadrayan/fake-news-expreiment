FALSE: Donald Trump Drops Out of Race
On 22 December 2015, the web site Q Political published an article reporting that Republican candidate Donald Trump had dropped out of the 2016 Presidential race:

Donald Trump has been dominating the polls for weeks and has shown no sign of slowing down in this Presidential race. So it came as a shock to everyone when he announced that he will be withdrawing from the race this week. “I have never been a fan of politicians and just realized I was slowly becoming my own worst enemy. I’m dropping out of the race to leave a path for others to succeed since I am so awesome that nobody else could have stood a chance against me.”

While Q Political frequently publishes publishes articles misleading titles, the web site isn’t specifically known as a satirical one, and therefore many readers may have missed the “satire” tag underneath the article reporting Trump’s departure from the presidential race:

In fact, not only has Donald Trump not announced his departure from the 2016 presidential race, he told the Washington Post in an interview published on on 9 December 2015 that he “will never leave the race.”
