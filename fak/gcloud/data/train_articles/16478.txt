Josh:

Good afternoon.

We are looking over a claim by Anita Perry, in her Sept. 28 interview at the Tribune conference, that only four countries allow abortions after 20 weeks. This strikes us as identical in meaning to an August statement by Carly Fiorina rated Half True<http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/22/carly-fiorina/only-four-countries-legalize-abortion-after-5-mont/> by PolitiFact in Washington, D.C.

Would you have any information you’d like us to consider?

Thanks.
