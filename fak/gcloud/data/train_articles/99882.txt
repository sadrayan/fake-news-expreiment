Negligence by school officials at Gwendolyn Brooks Elementary-young girl suffers from injuries
A Gwendolyn Brooks Elementary School in DeKalb, IL failed to contact Monica Jefferson whose daughter face was severely injured from a school field trip. Monica posted on social media regarding the incident that involved her daughter. Jefferson said her daughter participated on a sledding field trip with the school, when her daughter got injured. The incident left her daughter with facial injuries.

Jefferson said, “Nobody call me and let me know how she hurt her face or what was going on with my baby face at all. But I get a call from a outsider about what happened to my baby face. The school didn’t call me or the principal didn’t call.”
