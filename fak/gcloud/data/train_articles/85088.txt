North Carolina Conservation Network
About Us

Mission

The NC Conservation Network supports, trains, and coordinates diverse groups and directly advocates to achieve equitable and sustainable solutions for our environment.

Our Goals Include:

providing updates and environmental news to NC environmental groups;

training activists to become more effective advocates;

fostering healthy patterns of communication and collaboration; and

convening and facilitating coalitions to address significant environmental issues.
