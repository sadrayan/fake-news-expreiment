“We stand in solidarity with them in condemning these outrageous attacks against innocent people. We will do whatever is necessary to support our ally Belgium in bringing to justice those who are responsible,” the president, who is currently abroad on an historic trip to Cuba, said at the beginning of remarks to the Cuban people in Havana today.

The president said the latest attacks are also “another reminder that the world must unite” against the “scourge of terrorism.”

“We must be together regardless of nationality or race or faith in fighting against the scourge of terrorism,” he said. “We can and we will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the world.”

The president spoke to Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel this morning and offered his condolences on behalf of the American people and pledged “the full cooperation and support of the United States,” the White House said.

Obama was briefed on the attacks this morning, according to a White House official. The White House said that U.S. officials are in close contact with Belgian counterparts and will provide additional updates as available.

The U.S. embassy in Brussels released a security message recommending sheltering in place and avoiding all public transportation. The message urged U.S. citizens in the country to monitor local media reports and follow instructions by local authorities.
