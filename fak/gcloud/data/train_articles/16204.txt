I see that the department policy posted here has been expanded with point No. 10. When did this change occur and why? Were there other changes?

Good Afternoon -

The revision happened on January 31, 2017 at 3:40 pm and was done in the interest of clarity. Item #10 was added and Item #4 was clarified by adding the highlighted verbiage:

4. Except as otherwise provided in this policy, TCSO personnel shall not expend county resources or time communicating with ICE regarding an inmate’s release date, incarceration status, or court dates, unless ICE presents a judicial warrant or order. Information regarding incarceration status of inmates is available on the TCSO website. Information regarding court dates is available on the Travis County Courts’ website. TCSO personnel shall not use any department resources to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. TCSO personnel shall not request backup or interpretation assistance from ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents, but in the event of an emergency should contact supervisors within TCSO.

The policy took effect on February 1, 2017.

Best,

Kristen Dark
