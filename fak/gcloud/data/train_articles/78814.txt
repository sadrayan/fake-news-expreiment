Obama vs. Obama: President Signals Intent to Break Campaign Promise on Lowering Health Care Premiums
During last year's campaign, then-Senator Obama unveiled a health care plan that he promised would save families up to $2,500 in premiums



"For those who have insurance now, nothing will change under the Obama plan - except that you will pay less. Obama's plan will save a typical family up to $2,500 on premiums by bringing the health care system into the 21st century..." ("Background Questions and Answers on Health Care Plan," www.barackobama.com)

Now, President Obama embraces the Senate health care bill that will raise premiums by $2,100 according to the Congressional Budget Office

"From day one, our goal has been to enact legislation that offers stability and security to those who have insurance and affordable coverage to those who don't, and that lowers costs for families, businesses and governments across the country. Majority Leader Reid, Chairmen Baucus and Dodd, and countless Senators have worked tirelessly to craft legislation that meets those principles." ("Statement from President Obama on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act," www.whitehouse.gov, 11/18/2009)

"Average premiums per policy in the non-group market would in 2016 would be roughly $5,800 for single policies and $15,200 for family policies under the proposal, compared with roughly $5,500 for single policies and $13,100 for family policies under current law." (Letter to the Honorable Evan Bayh, Congressional Budget Office, 11/30/2009)
