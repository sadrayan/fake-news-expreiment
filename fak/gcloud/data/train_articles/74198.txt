Lawmakers seek to limit weeks of unemployment benefits â€” again
Potential Sliding Scale of Unemployment Benefits Under House Bill 288, the statewide unemployment rate would determine the number of weeks someone could receive unemployment benefits. Rep. Scott Fitzpatrick, R-Shell Knob, who introduced the bill, said there was no "scientific" approach to creating the scale. This is the proposed setup: Unemployment Rate Maximum Number of Weeks Eligible for Benefits <6% 13 6-6.5% 14 6.5-7% 15 7-7.5% 16 7.5-8% 17 8-8.5% 18 8.5-9% 19 9%+ 20
