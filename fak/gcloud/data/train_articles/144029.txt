President Bill Clinton's decision to lie under oath about his consensual affair with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky almost forced him from the presidency.

But allegations made by four other women that Clinton either sexually assaulted or harassed them have done little to discredit him among his supporters. Clinton has denied all of the allegations against him, including those made by four other women who say they had consensual extramarital relationships with him.

As a national spotlight focuses on sexual assault and harassment following a flood of accusations of misconduct against dozens of prominent men in Hollywood, the media, and politics, Democrats and others on the left are beginning to reexamine their response to the allegations against Clinton.

"Everybody in the mainstream press is calling all of Bill Clinton's crimes infidelities," Kathleen Willey, one of the women who has accused Clinton of harassment, told the Fox News host Sean Hannity in October 2016. "Rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment are not infidelities. They are crimes and they are misdemeanors."
