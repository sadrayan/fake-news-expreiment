CJTF-101 clarifies facts addressing viral email regarding Sen. Obama visit
BAGRAM AIR FIELD, Afghanistan (July 26, 2008) â€” Combined Joint Task Force-101 has received numerous media queries following a widely circulated viral email regarding Sen. Barack Obama's visit to Bagram. The email incorrectly implies that the delegation came here as a campaign stop. A public event was not the intent of the visit (it was a congressional delegation visit with two other senators) and advance publicity was consciously minimized as is standard with these visits, to preserve security and to maintain impartiality. Despite efforts to minimize advance publicity, Sen. Obama and his colleagues shook many hands prior to the briefings they received. In fact, those briefings were delayed as the senators took time to shake hands, speak to troops, and pose for photographs. Sen. Obama did not go to the "Clamshell" recreational tent or play basketball during his stop here. His itinerary was set by CJTF-101 prior to the visit. All Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines should participate in their right to vote and support any candidate they personally choose. While CJTF 101 cannot say if this blog is authentic, the comments in it are inappropriate and factually incorrect. They may also be inconsistent with the policies and regulations of the DoD and the Army. Our institution is impartial to the political process and our troops are required to treat our elected officials with the dignity and respect they merit. -30- (More information on service member restrictions can be found in DoD Directive 1344.10, Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces on Active Duty.)
