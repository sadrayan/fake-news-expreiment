Act 746 is codified at and amended both Ark. Code Ann. §§ 5-73-119 and -120 (Repl. 2013). Act 746s amendments to § 5-73-120 are the ones relevant to the questions posed.

[2]Open carry is not a term used in Act 746 or § 5-73-120. For purposes this opinion we use it to refer to carrying a handgun in plain view without any type of license.

[3]Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(a) (Repl. 2013) (A person commits the offense of carrying a weapon if he or she possesses a handgun, knife, or club on or about his or her person, in a vehicle occupied by him or her, or otherwise readily available for use with a purpose to attempt to unlawfully employ the handgun, knife, or club as a weapon against a person.). Where my opinion discusses handguns under this statutory provision, I use it as shorthand for handguns, knives, or clubs.

[4]See Ark. R. Crim. P. 3.1 (2014).

[5]As discussed in further detail at pages 1214 below, a person upon a journey may keep a handgun in his vehicle and this handgun may be concealed in his vehicle even without a concealed-carry license. But that person may not take the gun from the car and carry it on his or her person in a concealed manner unless he or she has a concealed-carry license.

[6]The concealed-handgun licensing law is codified at Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-301 et seq. (Repl. 2005 and Supp. 2013). Concealed means to cover from observation so as to prevent public view. Ark. Code Ann. § 5-7-301(2) (Supp. 2013). Concealed handgun licenses are issued by the Department of Arkansas State Police. Law enforcement officers and others of similar duties are exempt from the licensing requirements. Ark. Code Ann. § 5-7-304 (Supp. 2013).

[7]Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(a) (Repl. 2005). The statute includes definitions of handgun, knife, and club. Handgun is defined as any firearm with a barrel length of less than twelve inches (12) that is designed, made, or adapted to be fired with one (1) hand. Id. at (b)(2). For the definitions of knife and club, see id. at (1) and (4). These definitions were not amended by Act 746.

[8]Id. at (c)(4) and (8).

[9]Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(a) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added).

[10]In general, criminal offenses are composed by specifying the type of prohibited conduct (i.e. the actus reus) that must occur together with the type of mental state (i.e. mens rea). E.g., 1 Whartons Criminal Law § 27 (15th ed.) (Reduced to its simplest terms, a crime consists in the concurrence of prohibited conduct and a culpable mental state.).

[11]Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(a) (Repl. 2005).

[12]Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(c) (Repl. 2005) (emphasis added).

[13]Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(c) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added).

[14]See Hercules Inc. v. Pledger, 319 Ark. 702, 706, 894 S.W.2d 576 (1995) (The basic rule of statutory construction is to give effect to the intent of the legislature, and when a statute is clear, it is given its plain meaning.).

[15]Stoner v. Watlingten, 735 F.3d 799, 80405 (8th Cir. 2013) (citing three Arkansas Supreme Court cases and noting that [g]iven this precedent, a reasonable officer would understand that a violation of Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(a) is predicated upon a person having the required intent under the statute).

[16]See, e.g., McGuire v. State, 265 Ark. 621, 626, 580 S.W.2d 198 (1979) (There was a presumption of fact that the loaded pistol was placed under the seat as a weapon.); Stephens v. City of Fort Smith, 227 Ark. 609, 611, 300 S.W.2d 14 (1957) (where weapon was loaded, the presumption is that it was placed in the glove compartment of the car as a weapon.). These cases trace back to Carr v. State, 34 Ark. 448, 450, 36 Am.Rep. 15 (1879) (If the state, in a given case, should show that pistols were worn concealed, the jury might well presume that they were loaded, and worn as weapons.).

[17]It is of course conceivable that the Court could, if ever asked, disagree with my analysis and determine that the carrying of a loaded handgun can be in and of itself the basis for a presumption of intent to unlawfully employ the handgun as a weapon against a person.

[18]It is black-letter law that an affirmative defense requires the defendant to prove the matter, usually by a preponderance of the evidence. See Ark. Code. Ann. § 5-1-111(d)(1). The legislatures reclassification of the list in Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(c) signaled a shift of the burden of proof on these issues from the handgun possessor to the State.

[19]A person may also possess a handgun without violating § 5-73-120(a) if: (1) the person is in his or her own dwelling or place of business or on property in which he or she has a possessory or proprietary interest; (2) the person is a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, or member of the armed forces acting in the course and scope of his or her official duties; (3) the person is assisting a law enforcement officer, correctional officer, or member of the armed forces acting in the course and scope of his or her official duties pursuant to the direction or request of the law enforcement officer, correctional officer, or member of the armed forces; (4) the person is carrying a weapon when upon a journey, unless the journey is through a commercial airport when presenting at the security checkpoint in the airport or is in the persons checked baggage and is not a lawfully declared weapon; (5) the person is a registered commissioned security guard acting in the course and scope of his or her duties; (6) the person is hunting game with a handgun that may be hunted with a handgun under rules and regulations of the Arkansas State Game and Fish Commission or is en route to or from a hunting area for the purpose of hunting game with a handgun; (7) the person is a certified law enforcement officer; (8) the person is in possession of a concealed handgun and has a valid license to carry a concealed handgun under § 5-73-301 et seq., or recognized under § 5-73-321 and is not in a prohibited place as defined by § 5-73-306; (9) the person is a prosecuting attorney or deputy prosecuting attorney carrying a firearm under § 16-21-147; or (10) the person is in possession of a handgun and is a retired law enforcement officer with a valid concealed carry authorization issued under federal or state law. See Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(c).

[20]See Ark. R. Crim. P. 3.1 (2014).

[21]As discussed in further detail at pages 12-14 below, a person upon a journey may keep a handgun in his vehicle, and this handgun may be concealed in his vehicle even without a concealed-carry license. But that person may not take the gun from the car and carry it on his or her person in a concealed manner unless he or she has a concealed-carry license.

[22]The concealed-handgun licensing law is codified at Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-301 et seq. (Repl. 2005 and Supp. 2013). Concealed means to cover from observation so as to prevent public view. Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-301(2) (Supp. 2013). Concealed handgun licenses are issued by the Department of Arkansas State Police. Law enforcement officers and others of similar duties are exempt from the licensing requirements. Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-304 (Supp. 2013).

[23]Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(c)(8). The referenced § 5-73-321 provides license reciprocity for those with valid concealed-carry licenses issued by another state.

[25]It is well established that amendments or repeals by implication are not favored in construing statutes. E.g., Cummings v. Washington County Election Comn, 291 Ark. 354, 724 S.W.2d 486 (1987).

[26]See Ark. R. Crim. P. 3.1 (2014).
