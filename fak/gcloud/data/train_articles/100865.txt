Trudeau presents new plan for Canada’s environment and economy
Share



VANCOUVER – The Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, Justin Trudeau, today presented an agenda for real change that will create clean jobs, grow the economy, and protect the environment.

“During the Harper decade, our environment has suffered. Canadians cannot afford to let this inaction continue – the cost is too high,” said Mr. Trudeau. “We will undo the damage done by Stephen Harper and give to our children and grandchildren a country even more beautiful, sustainable, and prosperous than the one we have now.”

The Liberal plan will deliver real change for our environment by: taking action on climate change; investing in clean technologies; creating clean jobs and investment; restoring credibility to environmental assessments; preserving and promoting our National Parks; and protecting our wildlife and waterways. In the process, we will phase out fossil fuel subsidies; expand investment in the clean technology sector; create a Green Investment Bond to develop more renewable energy; and suspend admission fees to our National Parks for the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation.

“The Conservatives have refused to take meaningful action on climate change, slashed environmental protections, muzzled and cut funding for science, and allowed other countries to take the lead on creating new clean jobs,” said Mr. Trudeau. “The Liberal plan will ensure that Canada can tap into the vast economic opportunities of our environment and create the sustainable prosperity middle class families need.”
