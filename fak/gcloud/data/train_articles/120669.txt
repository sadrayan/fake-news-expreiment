Department of Labour warns public of fake website promising UIF benefits 16 November 2018 The Department of Labour is warning the public of a bogus website going around on WhatsApp and other social media platforms. In the website the would-be fraudsters are promising to help members of the public on how to get their benefits.



The fraudsters are advising members of the public to follow the instructions on the website. The fraudsters further claim that they have a list of “workers who worked between the 1990 and 2018, have the rights to get the benefits of R33 000 by the Department of Labour of South Africa”, and that they (workers) should check if their name is in the list of the people who have the rights to withdraw this benefit.



The Department of Labour manages the unemployment insurance fund (UIF) unemployment benefits, and has never published any list of people to withdraw any benefits. The claim is a blatant fake.



Unemployed workers must apply for benefits at their nearest labour centre in person. They must be registered as work-seekers and take the necessary documents with them.



The Department of Labour wishes to distances itself from such a claim. There is no list of workers who are due to get benefits.



The Department also wishes to inform the public that the Department services are offered for FREE.
