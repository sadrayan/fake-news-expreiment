Emails, Haley Graves, communications director, U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, Oct. 11 and 14, 2013

CBO’s projected revenues for FY 2014 is $3.042 trillion. http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44172-Baseline2.pdf

Congressman Williams believes that deep spending cuts and tax reform would keep us from needing to raise the debt ceiling.

Thanks,

Haley

Communications Director

Congressman Roger Williams (TX-25)

Here’s what the Congressman said in the interview.

Tilove: “Do you think the warnings about what a failure to enact a debt ceiling increase, the effect on the economy, is overblown or is that real?”

Williams: “We’re not going to default because we do have $3 trillion of cash flow coming in to America. Alright? Now the cash flow doesn’t flow evenly – it’s like your business. You have receivable, this and that, but you do have $3 trillion in cash. That’s more cash flow than we’ve ever had coming in to the government than ever. And so we can pay our bills. We can pay our debt service, we can pay our military, we’re not going to default.”

The CBO shows in its baseline budget projections that the United States is expected to take in $3.042 trillion.

He didn’t talk about outlays- he talked about revenues and cash flow coming in to the government. Are you trying to fact check a number or statistic that was never brought up in the interview?

I can see now the argument that the cash flow would cover projected interest costs of $237 billion through the fiscal year. However, Rep. Williams referred to “paying our bills.” Did he mean interest only?

Congressman Williams has said all along that the U.S. will not default because the $3 trillion of cash flow will cover our interest payments and bond holders.

We check what people say, in this case the reference to bills. Fair to say that he means to say covering interest payments only?
