Cannabis sales and distribution in the provinces and territories
The Cannabis Act came into force on October 17, 2018. Provinces and territories are responsible for determining how cannabis is distributed and sold within their jurisdictions.

They set rules around:

how cannabis can be sold

where stores may be located

how stores must be operated

Provinces and territories also have the flexibility to set added restrictions, including:

lowering possession limits

increasing the minimum age

restricting where cannabis may be used in public

setting added requirements on personal cultivation

Each province and territory has its own excise stamp for legal cannabis products.

You are responsible for knowing what will be legal in the province or territory where you live or visit.

We have provided links to all provinces and territories, with a brief outline of what is legal there (as of October 17, 2018). Go to your provincial or territorial website for more details.
