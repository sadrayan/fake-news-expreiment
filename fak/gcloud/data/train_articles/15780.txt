Evidently he did not have his facts correct, which is my fault, so you can blame me.

Jones did, though. Did he get it wrong?

I think it does, thanks. You’re saying the club makes no claim to the cheerleaders appearing before more troops than Bob Hope.

Gardner:

The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have made 78 trips to U.S. Military Installations oversees since 1979. A few years back we were informed by the USO that the number of trips made by the DCC was more than any other entertainment group that has worked with the USO. That milestone reflected the total number of trips made—and not the total number of troops entertained.

I hope that clears things up for you.

Gardner,

We do not have any information from Bob Hope’s figures. What we can claim is that "The DCC Show Group has proudly entertained U.S. military personnel around the world since 1979 – making more international tours with the USO than any other entertainment group.”

This resolution from Congress says Hope appeared before millions of troops.

Any information on how many troops Bob Hope entertained? According to this web page, he made his first USO stop in the early 1940s and his last one in the 1990s. I wonder if it’s likely he entertained more troops than the Cowboy cheerleaders have so far.

On their webpage, there is also a two paragraph part about the USO tours, but I changed it to 2014 and 78 tours instead of 2013 and 77 with the updates from the Show Group’s recent tour:

"While the high-profile experiences of being a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader are unique, for many of the members of the squad the most rewarding of their activities are in somewhat less glamorous surroundings. In 1979, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) requested their presence on a USO Christmas tour of installations in Korea. The ladies performances were so enthusiastically received by the thousands of American troops serving their country so very far from home that a tradition was born.

Through 2014, the Cheerleaders, the DOD and the USO have since teamed up an unprecedented 78 times to boost the morale of the men, women, and families of our U.S. military at hundreds of bases and outposts around the world. If our country’s forces are stationed there, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders stand ready to offer their own brand of thanks to these dedicated young Americans. The one-hour variety shows bring standing ovations and tears to the eyes of the audiences and the entertainers alike. The ladies have their meals in the mess halls and share in close conversations about the Cowboys, happenings in the States and loved ones at home."

For a fact check of Jerry Jones, I am curious on how he concluded the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have entertained more troops than Bob Hope.

Thanks for any and all detail.

I am hoping to write this up today.
