Project Description:

Reimburses cost and covers future expenses of PGA Historical Center which celebrates the growth and history of golf in the United States as paralleled by the advancements of the Professional Golfers' Association of America. The project is a new and exciting resource for golf historians as well as beginners and serves as a highly functional conference facility. It is also the home of the Probst Library, which includes more than 6,000 hard-cover books, more than 3,000 handbooks and yearbooks; and some 600 bound periodicals including every edition of "PGA Magazine" dating back to its origins in 1920.

Is this a water project as described in Chapter 2002-291, Laws of Florida? No

Measurable Outcome Anticipated:

Golf is a very viable and profitable part of the State's tourism industry with an estimated 1,169 golf courses in Florida, garnering an annual revenue of $4.4 billion in 2000. Out of State visitors accounted for more than 33% of the total rounds played in Florida in 2000, while travel-related expenses by these golfing visitors reached $22.9 billion. As evidenced by the large role that golf plays in the State's tourism industry, a comprehensive one-of-a-kind historical center would bring additional revenue to our State's tourism industry.
