Corporate Spending in Denver Mirrors Broader Shift to Democrats
DENVER -- For the past decade, corporations have showered Republicans with money and attention. But this week's Democratic convention shows how much things have changed.

Corporations sponsored hundreds of cocktail parties, receptions and A-list concerts for Democratic lawmakers, aides and delegates gathered for the convention this week.

With Democrats in control of Congress and Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama generating excitement across the country, companies appear to be springing for far fewer parties at the Republican convention next week in Minneapolis.

A list of Democratic convention events compiled by the Washington lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates LLC is three times as long as one it compiled for the Republican convention.

A separate study by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute shows that 141 companies have donated $160 million to the host committee for the Democratic convention, compared with 80 companies and $100 million for the Republican convention.

Precise figures are impossible to produce because companies aren't required to disclose all of their spending at conventions, and host committees may report spending at a later date. But nonpartisan watchdogs have been monitoring spending by special interests in Denver. "There certainly seems to be more parties at the Democratic convention than [planned for] the Republican convention," said Nancy Watzman with the Sunlight Foundation.

A look at the Democratic convention schedule underscores the strong corporate presence.

Monday, financial-services companies including Merrill Lynch & Co.; Fidelity Investments; and the trade association for the mutual-fund industry, the Investment Company Institute, sponsored a forum on financial literacy with former Democratic Rep. Harold Ford of Tennessee.

Tuesday, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. and the railroad industry threw a reception for policy makers and delegates at the Wynkoop Brewing Co. That evening, the technology industry hosted a reception at the Rioja restaurant that was packed with Democratic insiders and corporate lobbyists. Guests nibbled on finger food and mingled with the likes of Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden. The tab was picked up by industry trade groups TechNet, the Consumer Electronics Association and the Telecommunications Industry Association.

The attention that businesses are devoting to Democrats at the convention underscores a broader shift in political spending as the Democratic Party increases its power in Washington.

For the first time in at least a decade, corporations are spending more money to elect Democrats this fall than they are on Republicans. Data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics show that corporations and their political action committees have contributed $115.9 million to Democratic candidates, the Democratic Party and outside political organizations this election cycle, compared with $111.5 million for Republicans. The data don't include donations from individuals.

That gives Democrats a 51% to 49% advantage over Republicans in corporate money.

Businesses in recent election cycles have given about 66% of their donations to Republicans and 33% to Democrats, according to the center's data. In the last presidential election, corporations spent $178.3 million to help Republicans and $100.1 million to benefit Democrats.

One reason for the shift to Democrats is that most corporations are risk-averse when it comes to political spending.

"Almost all corporations and trade associations operate in a bipartisan manner, but the majority party always receives more attention and resources," said Dan Berger, a lobbyist for the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. "This is not an unusual political phenomenon, it is political reality."
