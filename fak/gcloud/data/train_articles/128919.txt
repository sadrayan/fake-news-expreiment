Okay, very fancy doorknockers. Nak Armstrong — the Texas-based jewelry designers who also created Jenna Bush Hager’s wedding earrings — said the first lady was wearing their creation, made of watermelon tourmalines, rainbow moonstone, aquamarine, black spinel, green tourmaline, white diamond, and 18k rose gold.
