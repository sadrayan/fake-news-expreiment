Q&A With Charlie Crist
Washington Wire sat down for a wide-ranging conversation with Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running for U.S. Senate as an independent. Crist’s comments, made last week show his past frustrations with running in the Republican primary, and how he is more open now about centrist and liberal views – except for gun rights. His skepticism about Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan comes after the National Rifle Association, a group that Crist has long cultivated, opposed her confirmation. See this WSJ story for more on Crist’s political strategy.
