Baking Memories 4 Kids
Each holiday season, Baking Memories 4 Kids sells chocolate cookies that are undeniably, mouth- wateringly delicious. But it’s more than just the taste that brings our customers back year after year, so much more.

Baking Memories 4 Kids, a non- profit (501 (c)(3) foundation, utilizes the money generated from our cookie sales in a very special way, we make memories. From each container sold and every donation received, we are able to provide children with life threatening and /or terminal illnesses and their families an all-expense paid vacation to ALL the theme parks in Orlando, Florida. For one week, these courageous families can focus on each other in a positive, uplifting environment instead of beside a hospital bed. We recognize that having a loved one who is ill affects more than just the person afflicted, it encompasses the world of everyone around them. We give them the opportunity to create amazing, lifelong memories that may be a form of comfort for their journeys ahead.

The hope for the future of our foundation is that we will have no need to exist. With that in mind, we donate a portion of our proceeds each year to St Jude Children’s Research Hospital. In the meantime, we will continue to help families make the most of their time together.

We challenge you to find another treat that is more satisfying than knowing that with each delicious bite you take, there is a child with a smile on their face and a song in their heart and it’s because of you.

Please join the hundreds of our supporters and become a Memory Maker today!
