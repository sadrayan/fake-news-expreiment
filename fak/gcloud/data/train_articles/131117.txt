Tucson

Wednesday September 27 and Thursday September 28, ‘Building the Wall’ offers a dystopian view of the future. By Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning playwright Robert Schenkkan. Join Refuse Fascism members and other’s in support of this play that helps provide a window into a world that none of us want. But if apathy persist, that is most likely, what we’ll all get. We encourage everyone to attend/support this play.

Continues through Oct 15.

Cabaret Theatre @ the Temple of Music and Art. 330 S. Scott Ave.

Join Refuse Fascism members and other’s in support of this play that helps provide a window into a world that none of us want. But if apathy persist, that is most likely, what we’ll all get. We encourage everyone to attend/support this play.

Our goal is to assemble in front of the Theatre, before and after, @ all 15 performances. We will be handing out buttons, flyer’s, palm cards, stickers and objective conversation. All free.

During each performance, those outside will make an assessment of the situation and whether or not a march through the downtown streets of Tucson will be appropriate. If so, the march will return to the front of the theatre, before 9:00 o-clock evening performances (3:30 Sunday matinee) to greet the exiting audience.
