Corliss Farm Maple Syrup Production 2015

We are members of the NH Maple Producers and will be participating in the Maple Producers weekend March 28th and 29th.



The original sugar house was built in 1978 and replaced in 2001 with a new Post and Beam construction building.



The Sugar House is located at 411 Shaker Road. Drive up the driveway just past the house on the right. You can't miss it.

Be sure to stop by if you see smoke from the stack or us boiling on the webcam.
