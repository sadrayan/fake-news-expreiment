Water and Environmental Engineering « Civil Engineering
Water and environmental engineering has to do with water resources development and management, yield analysis, low and flood flow hydrology, river hydraulics, design of hydraulic structures such as dams, tunnels and pump stations, water services, water quality and water treatment, as well as coastal and port engineering.

Lake St Lucia (Prof G.R. Basson) Prof Basson was contracted since 2013 as hydrodynamic modelling and sediment dynamics specialist to work with a project team of hydrologists and ecologists to analyse various scenarios and make recommendations on the future management of the Lake St Lucia system. The recommendations by Prof Basson and his team are now being implemented in the field in a phased approach.

Prof HE Jacobs is the director of the Institute for Water and Environmental Engineering (IWEESU). IWEESU specializes in research and specialized consulting in the fields of river hydraulics and sedimentation, eco-hydraulics, coastal engineering, water resources management and water services.
