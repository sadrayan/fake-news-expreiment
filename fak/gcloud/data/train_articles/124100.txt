Black Magic Fuckery
In recent months people have been complaining about deteriorating post quality in r/blackmagicfuckery and a lot of them have a point. The sub blew up exponentially very quickly and with that, many people from r/all started to get a wrong impression of what this sub is about.

Our mod team has had a more ‘laid back’ approach to removing posts on this sub, especially already popular posts. We want to change this and be more strict about removing posts that don’t fit the sub and have created some new guidelines which will be integrated into the rules soon.

We were only a core team of 5 mods for a while but have recently added more mods to help us clean up from now on. We already have been removing more posts recently and people have begun to notice and generally appreciate it. I think this shows we’re heading in the right direction.

Here are some new guidelines hopefully closer defining which posts qualify as bmf. The existing rules will stay as they are.
