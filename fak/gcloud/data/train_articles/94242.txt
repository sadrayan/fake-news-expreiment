BREAKING: Supreme Court Reversal Gives Trump An AMAZING Present And A Win Over Illegal Aliens
The Supreme Court has decided today that illegal aliens do not possess the right to sue anyone if it happens that they feel mistreated. This passed by a simple 5-4 voting majority. The right-leaning Court one more time showed the United States that those illegal immigrants are illegal at first place, hence should not be put over, or equalized to the U.S. citizens.

That implies if somebody’s arrested, and appears to be illegal, he does not have the right to a federal nor a private attorney, nor to a speedy trial in America.

Here they have the right to be loaded onto buses and sent back to where they belong, to apply for legal citizenship like everyone else. It means that sanctuary cities have no right to tell federal agencies that they can’t come in and collect illegals for deportation.

It is just the right time for the left snowflakes to realize that in the United States under control of Donald Trump, we are taking care of and looking after ourselves. Anyone coming from a different country who is not in immediate threat and has intentions to blow everything, including himself, up, is just not accepted here.
