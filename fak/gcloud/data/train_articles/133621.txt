Roosevelt Warm Springs
Founded by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1927, Roosevelt Warm Springs (RWS) continues a tradition of compassion and quality care that spans over 90 years. Started to treat patients who had contracted polio, the campus has transformed into a comprehensive rehabilitation center embracing the tenets of public service, technological advancement, program diversity and continuing education on behalf of persons with disabilities. Roosevelt Warm Springs remains a national treasure and Georgia "point-of-pride."
