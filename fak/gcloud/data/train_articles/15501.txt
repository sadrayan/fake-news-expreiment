“The 79th Texas Legislature further amended the residency requirements in 2005 through the passage of Senate Bill 1528.

T

he additional amendments maintained the 36-month pathway for non-U.S. Citizens, but extended it to all U.S. citizens.

Prior to these amendments, many U.S. Citizens were inadvertently prevented from attaining Texas residency status because of unanticipated circumstances.For example, students born and raised in Texas but whose parents moved out of state before they had enrolled in college were previously classified as nonresidents unless they had enrolled in college prior to their parents’ departure. Additionally, students raised by grandparents or other family members who had never gone to court to acquire legal custody were considered residents of the state in which their parents lived. Current statutes allow students in both of these cases, and other similar circumstances, to qualify for Texas resident status.” (“Overview: Eligibility For In-State Tuition And State Financial Aid Programs,”
