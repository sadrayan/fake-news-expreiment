Hillary Clinton Campaign Paid Second Document Destruction Company

Tuesday the Washington Free Beacon reported that the Hillary Clinton campaign paid Nevada-based American Document Destruction $187 for document and/or computer hard drive destruction. The payments are reported on documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) by the campaign.

However, American Document Destruction is only one of two companies providing similar services to the Clinton campaign. Another company with several branches in Nevada, Shredco Inc., is also listed in the FEC documents:

On its website, Shredco describes itself as "a locally owned and operated company dedicated to providing safe, secure, and convenient document destruction at a low price and great value.
