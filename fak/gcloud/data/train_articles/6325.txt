A rocket ship economy: Cramer voted for tax cuts, Heitkamp did not
A “rocket ship” economy:

U.S economic growth was stronger than initially thought in the second quarter; it was the economy’s best performance in nearly four years with GDP increasing to 4.2 percent.



President Trump’s economy beat expectations in August 2018 in an impressive month that saw 201,000 jobs added.



“Wage growth soar[ed] at its fastest pace since the Great Recession” and the unemployment rate held “near a generational low” of 3.9 percent.



The "strong" jobs report was widely praised thanks to companies "aggressively hiring" in August, with commentators calling the report "a positive sign," "good economic news," and evidence that the economy "keeps getting better and better and better."
