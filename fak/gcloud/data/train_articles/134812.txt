The University of Alabama
Roll Tide – and welcome to The University of Alabama!

From our rich history to our role as champions in both athletics and academics, the Capstone is a vibrant part of Tuscaloosa and the surrounding communities. Being the state’s flagship university means we are committed to influencing and bettering the lives of those close to home and all across the globe.

I invite you to spend some time looking at the University’s website to learn as much as you can. Call and speak to an adviser who can answer your questions about degrees and programs, about financial aid and scholarships, and about any other topic that interests you. Then, make a personal visit to our welcoming and inclusive campus and let us share our vision with you.

I am confident there is something here for you at The University of Alabama, whether you are a new high school graduate, a professional pursuing an advanced degree, a prospective faculty member who is committed to research and teaching, or an alumnus or donor who wants to give back to the University. We want you to be a part of our far-reaching impact. We want all members of the UA family to fulfill their ambitions and to achieve personal success. We want you here.

I welcome you to UA and to your future, and I encourage you to be part of the place Where Legends Are Made.

Dr. Stuart R. Bell

President
