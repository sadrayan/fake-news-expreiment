Is there research out there, such reliable estimates?

Gardner,

We have no research data on this, but Pia says: “If you take a million workers out of the Texas labor force, economic activity will contract.”

James:

Hello again.

For a fact check we’re researching, Bernard Weinstein suggested we interview Pia Orrenius, by phone or email.

At issue: A claim by Chuck Todd on Meet the Press last Sunday: “There have been some estimates that if you deported everybody who is in Texas illegally, it would actually be an economic – it would create an economic recession in Texas.”

We are seeking any such research/estimates that were out in public in some way before last weekend.

Thanks.
