Fighting for Immigrant Communities
Tim believes that America is made stronger by its diversity, and that the promise of the American Dream is threatened by an anti-immigrant agenda led by the Trump administration. Tim believes we need comprehensive immigration reform and strongly supported legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 to create a path to citizenship and fund border security. During that debate, Tim proudly delivered the first-ever Senate floor speech in Spanish.

Tim has been an outspoken opponent of President Trump’s attempts to ban immigration from Muslim countries, harshly restrict legal immigration, and threaten TPS recipients and Dreamers with deportation. Tim firmly believes immigrants enrich our society and bring skills and talents that help ensure we remain competitive in a global economy. That’s why he is a strong supporter of the Dream Act and has been working with his colleagues to find a solution to protect Dreamers and TPS recipients from deportation.
