Americans like me don't belong on Texas' botched list of possible noncitizen voters — but there I am
*

My dread crept in a week ago, after I read that Texas Secretary of State David Whitley told counties that his office had flagged 95,000 people because their names on voter rolls matched records in a driver's license database that identified them as noncitizens at the time they got their cards. He said he had forwarded the list to the Texas attorney general’s office, which has the authority to prosecute election crimes.

Eligible Texas voters “should not have their voices muted by those who abuse the system,” Whitley said in a press release.

I scrolled and I scrolled through the state advisory and news accounts on my phone, wanting to know more. Then I pulled my driver's license out of my wallet to confirm what I already knew: I had last renewed it before my naturalization ceremony. Was I on that list?

The original secretary of state advisory cautioned that its data matches were WEAK — in capital letters. And we’ve been down this road before in Florida, which in 2012 produced a list of 180,000 potentially ineligible voters, according to news accounts. And in the end, only 85 names — in a state of more than 10 million registered voters — were removed from voter rolls for being noncitizens.

Still, after the Texas announcement, politicians hinted at widespread wrongdoing.

“VOTER FRAUD ALERT,” Attorney General Ken Paxton trumpeted on Twitter.

Gov. Greg Abbott retweeted him and added: “Thanks to Attorney General Paxton and the secretary of state for uncovering and investigating this illegal vote registration.”

And President Donald Trump entirely misinterpreted the secretary of state’s statistics: “58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote,” he tweeted Sunday, warning without proof about “rampant” voter fraud.

The secretary of state’s office didn’t correct the president publicly.
