Fight for the Colors: Online Relic Room: Flags by Heroes Borne
Civil War Room On April 15, 1861, when President Lincoln made his first call for troops to preserve the Union, Ohio answered immediately. Of President Lincoln's call for 75,000 men, Ohio's quota was 13,000. Sixteen days after the President's call there were enough volunteers from Ohio to meet the full national requirement of 75,000 men. More than 100,224 men enlisted in 1861, filling nearly eighty-one infantry regiments, more than eight cavalry regiments, and twenty-nine artillery batteries. Over the course of the five-year war, Ohio contributed 346,326 soldiers to fight for the Union cause. Of that number, 11,237 men were killed in battle and 13,354 died of disease. 434 flags date from the Civil War, representing 177 regiments of infantry, cavalry troops and artillery. There are national colors, regimental colors, guidons, and flank markers. Also included are flags of the Black Brigade and the Ohio Ex-Prisoners of War.
