National Information Platforms for Nutrition (NIPN) is an initiative of the European Commission supported by the United Kingdom Department for International Development and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Delegation of the European Union has funded a project to establish a Kenya National Information Platform for Food and Nutrition (KNIPFN) as a part of this international effort. The initiative aims to strengthen national capacity to make better use of existing information and data to inform policies, programmes and interventions in all sectors that could contribute to better nutrition for the Kenyan population.

The project is being implemented by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) in partnership with the Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA), and in collaboration with all the sectors that have a role in improving nutrition in Kenya including the State Department of Planning. KIPPRA will take the lead in policy analysis while KNBS will lead the statistical analysis of the existing data available. The work of the KNIPFN will be supported throughout the project by a Global Support Facility (GSF) managed by the Agrinatura Consortium, which is also funded by the donors to the NIPN initiative. The KNIPFN initiative invites application from suitably qualified individuals with excellent credentials to fill the following positions:
