Major changes coming to Disneyland for Marvel fans
The Guardians of the Galaxy are toppling the Tower of Terror.

Disney is replacing the vertigo-inducing “Twilight Zone”-themed elevator ride at its California theme park with a new attraction that will open next summer based on the space super heroes.

The new ride, revealed at Comic-Con over the weekend, will bring thrillseekers through a museum where the characters from the hit Marvel film are being held as prisoners.

“The captor doesn’t know it but Rocket Raccoon has escaped and is enlisting our aid—all the guests—to help the Guardians in a breakout scheme,” Joe Rohde, creative director at Walt Disney Imagineering, said in a statement. “And the rest is comical chaos; a very funny, very irreverent story and a really wonderful addition to Disney California Adventure.”

Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT! will be the first of many super-hero based rides rolling out at Disneyland over the next few years.

Disney did not mention what would happen to the other Tower of Terror ride at Disney World, but revealed that the California ride’s final “drop day” will be in early January.

Construction will wrap on the new ride by next May, just in time for the release of “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.”

Fans of the the Tower of Terror, which debuted at Disney World in 1994 and features a 13-story drop, were angry their beloved adrenaline-booster was getting the boot.

“Tower of Terror is a classic Disney ride and it’s becoming Guardians of the Galaxy? Will they turn Jungle Cruise into Star Wars next?” @OfficialBilly_R tweeted.

“THE TOOK THE ALADDIN SHOW> THEY CHANGED SOARIN OVER CALIFORNIA. THEY CANT HAVE TOWER OF TERROR TOO,” @smalljustin wrote.

“Why would you take down the tower of terror I hate y’all that’s one of the main reasons I go to Disneyland,” @nochillnic fumed.
