Mormon missionary from Utah hurt in Brussels now in a coma
A Utah Mormon missionary seriously injured during a bombing at the Brussels airport is now in a medically induced coma.

The family of 66-year-old Richard Norby of Lehi said in a statement issued Wednesday by the LDS Church that shrapnel caused severe trauma to the man's lower leg, and he also suffered second-degree burns to his head and neck.

After a lengthy surgery, he is now expected to stay in a medically induced coma for a few days.

His family said a lengthy recovery is expected.

His wife, Pamela Norby, wasn't at the airport when the explosions happened Tuesday.

Norby, a former teacher and administrator in the LDS Church Educational System, also served as a mission president in the faith's Ivory Coast Abidjan Mission from 2003 to 2005.
