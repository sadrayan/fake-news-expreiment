Did Dr. Ben Carson go too far in Fox comments on same-sex marriage?
I have been tracking the dance Johns Hopkins nuerosurgeon Dr. Benjamin Carson has been doing with Fox News since his appearance last month at The National Prayer Breakfast. You can see my concerns about the relationship here.

But Tuesday night, Dr. Carson went to a place on Sean Hannity's show that surprised even me. And I did not think anything done on such a partisan show could shock me after years of being appalled by Hannity's shamelss shilling for right-wing causes and candidates.

Hannity asked Dr. Carson for his thoughts on same sex marriage, and the Hopkins doctor compared gays to people in "NAMBLA" (North American Man/Boy Love Association) and "people who believe in bestiality."

Just to be clear, what I am questioning is the language used by Carson in denouncing same-sex marriage on Fox.

House Speaker John Boehner, for example, also disagees with same sex marriage. But here's his reply when asked about it Sunday on ABC by Martha Raddatz: “I believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. It’s what I grew up with it. It’s what I believe. It’s what my church teaches me. I can’t imagine that position would ever change,” he said.

That sounds like a statement of belief plain and simple. Now take a look at the video and the harsh language and comparisons made by Carson and let me know what you think.

I believe Fox has created a climate that fosters such partisan, polarizing and possibly hurtful language. Not so, at ABC News. That doesn't excuse those who indulge in it, though.
