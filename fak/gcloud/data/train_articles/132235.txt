DPS boat with machine guns to patrol Rio Grande (update 3)
The Texas Department of Public Safety is deploying a ferocious new boat to patrol the Rio Grande- part of a small fleet.

The 34-foot long shallow “interceptor” craft will be outfitted with six machine guns mounted on its deck, according to DPS.

The agency confirmed that the guns will capable of firing in a fully automatic mode, giving it an overwhelming edge on just about anything it would find along the river.

According to a DPS news release:

The Tactical Marine Unit and the patrol vessels represent a significant enhancement of the state’s efforts in combating Mexican drug cartels and other criminal organizations that transport illegal drugs into Texas and varieties of weapons, explosives and munitions out of our state into Mexico. They will be used to impact so-called splashdowns, where drug smugglers crash their vehicles into the Rio Grande River and transport contraband back into Mexico.

It is the second of three boats the agency expects to deploy on the river in the South Texas region.

(updated) Three more are destined later to patrol the Inter-Coastal Waterway.

It is to be commissioned Thursday in Austin and named in honor of a DPS trooper David Rucker, killed in 1981 while making a traffic stop in Cameron County, which hugs the Texas-Mexico border.

Rucker’s family will participate in the ceremony.

Rucker died on Highway 100 between Laguna Vista and Los Fresnos, according to an appeals court file.

A cocaine trafficker named Leonel Herrera was later convicted of killing Rucker as well as a Los Fresnos police officer Enrique Carrisalez, who stopped him several minutes after he’d killed the DPS trooper. He was executed in 1993.

Here is a note from an old appeals court document form the Herrera case.

As noted below, DPS has repeatedly jumped into the fray on the border. It joins other agencies, such as the Border Patrol with boats on the river.
