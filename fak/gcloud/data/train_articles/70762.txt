15 timely payment of debt service on the bonds, such payment shall be made from

16 the general revenues of the State of Arkansas. In order to secure the payment

17 of debt service, any trust instrument, resolution, or other document setting

18 forth the security for the bondholders may provide for the direct payment of

19 the federal highway assistance funds that are designated revenues directly

20 into a trust fund, or to a paying agent, for the payment of debt service on

32 indenture are applicable.

33

34 SECTION 12. REFUNDING BONDS.

35 (a) The Commission may issue bonds for the purpose of refunding bonds

36 previously issued pursuant to this Act; provided, however, that the total

---------------------------------------------------------------------End of Page 9

1 amount of bonds outstanding after the refunding is completed does not exceed

2 the total amount authorized by this Act.

3 (b) Such refunding bonds shall be special obligations of the State of

4 Arkansas, secured as set forth herein, and shall be secured and sold in

5 accordance with the provisions of this Act.

6

7 SECTION 13. TAX EXEMPTION. All bonds issued under this Act, and

8 interest thereon, shall be exempt from all taxes of the State of Arkansas,

9 including income, inheritance, and property taxes. The bonds shall be

10 eligible to secure deposits of all public funds, and shall be legal for

11 investment of municipal, county, bank, fiduciary, insurance company and trust

12 funds.

13

14 SECTION 14. POWERS OF COMMISSION. All powers granted to the Commission

15 pursuant to this Act shall be deemed in addition to such powers as already

16 exist pursuant to Amendment 42 to the Arkansas Constitution and the laws of

17 the State of Arkansas. No member of the Commission shall be liable personally

18 for any reason arising from the issuance of bonds pursuant to this Act unless

19 such person shall have acted with corrupt intent.

20

21 SECTION 15. All provisions of this act of a general and permanent

22 nature are amendatory to the Arkansas Code of 1987 Annotated and the Arkansas

23 Code Revision Commission shall incorporate the same in the Code.

24

25 SECTION 16. If any provision of this act or the application thereof to

26 any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect

27 other provisions or applications of the act which can be given effect without

28 the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this

29 act are declared to be severable.

30

31 SECTION 17. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are

32 hereby repealed.

33

34 SECTION 18. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is hereby found and determined by the

35 Eighty-second General Assembly that there is an immediate need for the

36 construction, reconstruction and renovation of highways and roads comprising

---------------------------------------------------------------------End of Page 10

1 the U.S. Interstate system within the State of Arkansas and that such a

2 program cannot be accomplished without the issuance of bonds secured by

3 federal highway assistance payments to finance the program. Therefore, an

4 emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for

5 the preservation of the public peace, health and safety shall become effective

6 on the date of its approval by the Governor. If the bill is neither approved

7 nor vetoed by the Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the

8 period of time during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is

9 vetoed by the Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective

10 on the date the last house overrides the veto.
