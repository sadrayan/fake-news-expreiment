President Obama to attend fundraiser in Austin on first day of SXSW
Just when you thought SXSW traffic couldn't get any worse ... now the president is coming to town.

President Obama will be in Austin on Friday, March 11 for a fundraiser -- the same day SXSW kicks off. According the Travis County Democratic Party, the fundraiser will take place at the Austin Music Hall.

"I was thrilled to find out President Obama was coming back to Austin. He always encourages us always challenges us to work hard and to serve others so it's going to be great to see him come back to Austin," says Vincent Harding, chair of the Travis County Democratic Party.

Few details about his trip have been publicized, but if you would like to attend the event, general admission tickets start at $250. If you'd like a picture with the president, you'll need to contribute $10,000.

In July of 2014, the president visited Austin. He made a stop at the Paramount Theatre where he made a speech focusing on the economy. He also visited Franklin BBQ and was one of the only people ever allowed to cut the line. The trip in March will be his sixth stop in Austin since taking office.

"The president says he has a special place for Austin in his heart. Every time he comes, he talks about the rally that was held at Auditorium Shores in 2007 where over 20,000 people showed up. It was at that place that Obama said he knew that he would be the president," Harding says.
