SUMMARY AS PASSED SENATE: (all summaries)

Voter identification requirements; photo ID. Requires photo ID at the polls by eliminating all forms of identification that do not contain a photograph of the voter from the list of forms of identification any one of which a voter must present in order to be allowed to vote. The bill also adds a valid United States passport to the list and requires that a student identification card issued by an institution of higher education in the Commonwealth contain a photograph in order to be used by a voter. The bill does not affect the right of a voter who does not present one of the required forms of identification to cast a provisional ballot. The bill also provides that the State Board shall provide free voter registration cards that contain a voter's photograph and signature if the voter does not possess other satisfactory photo ID. The bill has a delayed effective date of July 1, 2014, and its provisions are contingent upon funding being included in a general appropriation act passed by the 2013 Session of the General Assembly.
