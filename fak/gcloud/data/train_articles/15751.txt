Hi Gardner: Yes, that's correct. Mexico has an excellent voter registration system that was created to overcome decades of fraud (ie, multiple votes, voting by dead people). Context is extremely important here -- I would not view the comparison to the conservative push for voter ID laws in the US as a similar issue.

Best,

Elaborate on your concern about context?

Decades of massive voter fraud in Mexico that may have decided the outcomes of elections and then a publicly funded program to get citizens voter ID cards without, as far as I am aware, complaints re: access in Mexico vs. 31 credible incidents of voter fraud in the US 2000-2014 (Wash Post) and a push for voter IDs without commensurate public funding to get them to disadvantaged populations. The latter has a clear partisan motivation.
