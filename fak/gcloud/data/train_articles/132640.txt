Young Donor Plasma Transfusion and Age-Related Biomarkers
Brief Summary:

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the beneficial effects of infusions of plasma from young donors using blood biomarkers.

Each patient will receive an infusion of plasma derived from a young donor (16-25 years of age). A panel of age-associated biomarkers will be measured before and after treatment.

We have drawn biomarkers from clinical measures of aging and physiology, biomarkers of disease advancement, as well as biomarkers of aging from animal and human studies. These will represent a spectrum of physiologic pathways with evidence-based connections to aging. They include the physiologic processes of inflammation, neurogenesis, stem cell proliferation, blood clotting, immune function, and amyloid plaques. Organ function which will be specifically measured includes the liver, bone marrow, kidneys, pancreas, muscles, cardiovasculature, cerebrovasculature, and the thyroid. Specific disease states connected to these biomarkers include anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, elevated risk of cancer, atherosclerosis, dementia, and cataracts.
