Most Vociferous Anti-Gun Zealot in North Carolina?



An alert from a national organization not up to speed on local North Carolina political issues condemning Senator R. C. SOLES over the recent shooting at his home has been circulating recently. Part of a fund raising alert from the National Association for Gun Rights (NAGR) calls Soles, “the most virulent anti-Second Amendment activist in the state” and the “most vociferous anti-gun zealot in North Carolina.” One problem, a little fact checking leads to a question…



BUT, IS IT TRUE?



As much fun as it is to catch anti-gun politicians in their own hypocrisy, this is not such a case. In the interest of fair play and truth, GRNC is compelled to point out that while not excellent, R. C. Soles is not a “virulent anti-Second Amendment activist” nor a “vociferous anti-gun zealot.”



To the question of why GRNC has not weighed in on this situation, the following would apply. 1) This circumstances are just too bizarre and murky to figure out until a fuller investigation has been done; 2) the charges are simply not true - he is mediocre at worst and has voted with us on most major issues; 3) GRNC has far more relevant targets to go after in NC to expend any time on this; and 4) gun owners should beware attempts to raise money through hyperbole.
