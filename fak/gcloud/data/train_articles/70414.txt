Can a recount help Moore?

Secretary of State John Merrill said it's too soon to know whether the margin of victory in Alabama's special election on Tuesday will trigger the state's automatic recount law.

State law calls for an automatic recount in a general election if a candidate wins by not more than 0.5 percent, unless the defeated candidate submits a waiver.

Merrill said it is doubtful the outcome of the state's U.S. Senate race will change. "It would be very unlikely for that to occur," Merrill said late Tuesday.
