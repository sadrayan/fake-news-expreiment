Returns Policy
RETURNS

Lowe's is committed to partnering with you to achieve your home improvement goals.

If you're not completely satisfied with your Lowe's purchase, simply return the merchandise to any Lowe's store in the US. Most new, unused merchandise can be refunded or exchanged with proof of purchase within 90 days of the original purchase date. Some exceptions to the standard policy exist. Please see the Policy Exceptions section below.

Returns with valid proof of purchase will be exchanged, refunded in cash, credited to your account or refunded via in-store credit based on the original method of payment unless noted in our Policy Exceptions. Returns made with a gift card or in-store credit will be refunded as in-store credit.

In most instances, your receipt can be retrieved by using the original credit card, checking account number, MyLowe's card or by your phone number. For returns without valid receipt, Lowe's, at its discretion, may issue in-store credit for the item's current selling price.
