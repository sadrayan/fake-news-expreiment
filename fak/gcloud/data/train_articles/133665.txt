M25

At 117 miles, the M25 or Lon­don Orbital Motor­way is the sec­ond longest city bypass in Europe. Its radius varies from 13 to 22 miles from Char­ing Cross. Most Lon­don roads are man­aged by Trans­port for Lon­don but as part of England’s strate­gic road net­work, the M25 is man­aged by the High­ways Agency.

A Royal Com­mis­sion first sug­gested a ring road for Lon­don in 1905 but only parts of the planned road were cre­ated at that time. By the 1970s, the huge growth of motor traf­fic had led to firm Gov­ern­ment plans for what became the M25. The last 13 miles from Mick­le­field to South Mimms opened ahead of sched­ule in Octo­ber 1986 by then Prime Min­is­ter Mar­garet Thatcher.
