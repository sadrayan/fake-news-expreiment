U.S. Senate: Women in the Senate
Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia, the first woman to serve in the United States Senate, took the oath of office on November 21, 1922. Having been appointed to fill a vacancy on October 3, Felton's official service began on that date but she served only 24 hours after taking the oath. The 87-year-old Felton's largely symbolic Senate service capped a long career in Georgia politics and journalism.

The first woman elected to the Senate was Hattie Wyatt Caraway of Arkansas. Appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, U.S. Senator Thaddeus Caraway, Ms. Caraway then sought and won election on her own in 1932. She was reelected in 1938 and served until 1945.
