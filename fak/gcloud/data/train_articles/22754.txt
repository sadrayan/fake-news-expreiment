Florida's Climate Threats
Even though average annual rainfall in Florida is 54 inches (greater than any other state but Louisiana), it is not evenly distributed and has some unusual characteristics that tend to produce periods of water shortages. For example, Florida is first, or tied for first, in the country for the proportion of summer versus winter rainfall, the difference in rainfall between the normally wettest and driest months, and the difference in rainfall between relatively wet and dry summers.
