Bill White for Texas
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Wednesday, July 21, 2010

Rick Perry ducks debates, editorial boards, voters Far cry from "If two debates are good, twelve will be great."

HOUSTON -- Twenty-five year incumbent career politician Rick Perry is refusing to debate, refusing to meet with newspaper editorial boards and refusing to be accountable to voters. Perry's approach is dramatically different from what it was in 2002, when he said, "If two debates are good, twelve will be great."

Perry's 2002 press release with the statement was unearthed using the Wayback Machine and is available at: http://www.scribd.com/doc/34644336/Rick-Perry-on-2002-Debates.

Bill White has accepted five statewide televised debates in addition to numerous other debates. The campaign is reviewing additional proposals.

"You know a career politician's been in office too long when he's hiding from the Texas taxpayers who sign his paychecks. What makes Perry think it's acceptable to refuse to answer unscripted questions?" said Bill White.

"Rick Perry doesn't want taxpayers to know he nearly doubled state spending, doubled state debt and helped create an $18 billion budget deficit," said Katy Bacon, campaign spokesperson. "But Texas voters don't have much patience for an elected official who refuses to be accountable."
