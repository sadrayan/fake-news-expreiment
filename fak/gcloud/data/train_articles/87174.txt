Commercial Banks
In the 2014 campaign cycle, people and political action committees associated with commercial banks gave more than $28.2 million to federal candidates, committees, parties and outside money groups that support them. Besides trade groups such as the American Bankers Association, the industry includes financial institutions such as Quicken Loans, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase.

In the early 1990s, the industry split its support between Democrats and Republicans, but since then has heavily favored Republicans, with the exception of the 2008 election cycle. In recent years, the lean has become even more pronounced. In 2014, 72 percent of the industry's donations to candidates and parties, or more than $19 million, went to Republicans.
