Group Wants Walmart to Back Immigration Reform



ATLANTA  The Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights will lead a boycott of Walmart to call for the worlds biggest retailer to adopt a favorable position vis-a-vis immigration reform.



The aim of this initiative is to send a signal, give a wake-up call to Walmart, which, with its huge number of Latino customers, also has a moral obligation  and with the enormous influence that it has  to support (immigration) reform, GLAHRs Teodoro Maus told Efe.



A Month Without Wal-Mart, which is slated to begin on March 20, seeks to send a message of lack of conformity regarding such a pro-immigration-reform stance and the firms behavior toward the Hispanic community, GLAHR says.



We have received a series of complaints regarding abuses, some of them serious, both from customers and from employees of the store regarding the treatment that the store gives them, Maus said.



GLAHR has documented more than a dozen complaints of abuse and bad treatment toward Hispanic customers and employees at Walmart stores in the Atlanta area.



The activist also said that the group had initiated talks with other Hispanic organizations on the national level with the aim of extending the initiative to other states. EFE
