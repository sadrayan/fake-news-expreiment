CBP Use of Force Statistics Fiscal Year 2018
U.S. Customs and Border Protection is charged with enforcing the nation’s laws while protecting the civil rights and civil liberties of every individual with whom we interact. CBP’s authority to enforce the law, even to the point of lethal force, appropriately bears the burden of accountability, which includes integrity and transparency.

These data reflect singular uses of force by and assaults on CBP personnel, as well as the incidents which the actions comprise. The inclusion of incidents provides additional context to the uses of force and assaults, as there may be multiple actions—assaults and/or uses of force--during a single incident. Presenting these actions within the framework of incidents depicts the circumstances more clearly.

For example, consider a hypothetical CBP utilization of a less-lethal device such as a PepperBall® Launching System (PLS) for area saturation against 15 subjects. This is counted as 15 singular uses of force but one incident. Likewise, five subjects throwing rocks at three CBP agents or officers is counted as 15 singular assaults but one incident.

Singular uses of force by CBP law enforcement personnel in FY18 were 8 percent lower than FY17; however, incidents involving use of force were up 16 percent. Incidents involving assaults on CBP agents and officers increased 22 percent from FY17 to FY18, but singular assaults decreased 6 percent.

Use of force involving firearms has dropped over the years from a high of 55 in FY12 to a low of 15 in FY18, a 73 percent decrease.

In FY18, CBP personnel have been involved in 534 incidents that include at least one use of force, and 450 incidents that include at least one assault. There have been 913 singular uses of force and 794 singular assaults.

Fiscal year tables were prepared on October 9, 2018; any uses of force or assaults entered after this date for the time period are not reflected in these tables. These statistics represent assaults and uses of force involving Authorized Officers/Agents during CBP operations only; off-duty incidents are not included. Occasionally, more than one component will be involved in the same incident. Therefore, the sum of the component totals may be greater than the CBP incident total. Previously published statistics are occasionally revised based on internal review, investigative findings, and National Use of Force Review Board (NUFRB) decisions; therefore, these tables may not match previously published statistics.

For reporting purposes, CBP categorizes uses of force into the following: “firearm,” “less-lethal device,” “other less-lethal force,” or “force used against vehicles/vessels.” A CBP law enforcement officer’s use of a baton, electronic control weapon, PepperBall® Launching System, or other less-lethal device is reflected under “Less-Lethal Device.” The “Other” column includes less-lethal uses of force, such as physical strikes without a weapon, use of a patrol K9, or applications of force other than a firearm or less-lethal device. “Force used against vehicles/vessels” includes uses of air disabling fire and small boat interdiction, and uses of vehicle immobilization devices or offensive driving techniques.
