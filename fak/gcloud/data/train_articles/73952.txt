(CNN) Morgan Freeman is backing Hillary Clinton for president, the actor told CNN's Don Lemon.

The Oscar winner also told Lemon that he doesn't have any trust issues with Clinton.

"Not with me, she doesn't," Freeman said in an interview that aired Friday on "CNN Tonight." "I can't say that she doesn't, because all you need in some cases for people is to say it. Just put it out there and it gets legs. The Clintons have been being beat down ever since way back, so she just was going along with that legacy that she's inherited over the amount of time she's been in politics, which is a long time."

Freeman added, "I think this is just made-up stuff, just, you know, it's political hogwash."

Freeman on Friday also narrated a new Clinton spot , called "All the good," which details Clinton's early career after finishing law school.
