Executive Summary

Oregon has a fast growing illegal alien population and a related rapidly increasing fiscal burden on the state's taxpayers. Major cuts had to be made in the state's 2012-13 budget to pare back spending for schools and social safety net programs to overcome a revenue shortfall of $3.5 billion. This report identifies more than $1 billion in annual fiscal costs borne by the state's taxpayers because of illegal immigration. State lawmakers have available the means to reduce that burden.

This study examines what the estimated 170,000 illegal aliens and an additional 64,000 U.S.-born children of illegal aliens cost Oregonians.

Major findings:

K–12 Education Costs

About $575 Million

About $575 Million Supplemental English Instruction

About $159 Million

About $159 Million Justice and Law Enforcement

(includes policing, court and prison costs)

About $140 Million

(includes policing, court and prison costs) About $140 Million Health Care and Social Assistance

About $125 Million

The average Oregon household headed by a U.S. citizen pays about $728 annually to cover the costs of the state's illegal alien population.

The estimated tax revenue from illegal aliens is about $77 million — 7.3 percent of the estimated burden. Illegal aliens pay relatively little in taxes, mainly because of their low earnings.
