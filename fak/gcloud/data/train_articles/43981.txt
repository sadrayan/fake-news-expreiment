George Soros letter reveals globalist plan to destroy the First World by eliminating national borders with global migrant blitzkreig invasions
'Let's take down all borders'

'No one has voted on this'

(NaturalNews) As the Left continues to lose the battle for America's soul, its greatest champions are going full-out in an attempt to turn the tide any way they can – even if it means destroying the country.One of the vilest among them is billionaire George Soros, a Hungarian-born U.S. citizen who now seeks to demolish the country that gave him his riches along with its allies.As reported by, Soros recently publicly confirmed that, yes, he seeks to essentially wipe out all European borders following an accusation made last week by the prime mister of his birth country, Viktor Orban (who, unlike Soros, actually has towith the tens of thousands of second- and third-world migrants streaming into his country and other European nations – while Soros lives free of such inconveniences in his $10 million mansion/castle outside of New York City ).In recent days, Orban has accused Soros of deliberately encouraging the migrant crisis now engulfing the continent."This invasion is driven, on the one hand, by people smugglers, and on the other by those (human rights) activists who support everything that weakens the nation-state," Orban said. "This Western mindset and this activist network is perhaps best represented by George Soros."Following Orban's statement, Soros sent an email to, in which he claimed that his foundations actually help "uphold European values," while Orban's actions in bolstering the Hungarian border and thus impeding a huge influx of migrants "undermine those values.""His plan treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle," Soros added. "Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle."In October, Orban accused pro-immigration non-governmental organizations (NGOs) of "drawing a living from the immigration crisis." He singled out those funded by Soros, who is a strong supporter of transnational bodies like the European Union and the United Nations. Also, his Open Society Foundation (OSF) provides assistance for pro-immigration activists, and he is well-known in the U.S. and internationally for supporting "progressive" (read) causes like the Bill and Hillary Clinton Foundation and the Center for American Progress.In fact, the OSF website notes: "We believe that migration and asylum policy should be grounded in economic and demographic realities, not driven by temporary political considerations or popular misconceptions."In Europe, many of our civil society partners are raising their voices demanding a common European approach in line with international human rights commitments."In a recent interview , Orban said that immigration and multiculturalism were working in tandem to change the face and traditions of Europe, it's "Christian roots" in particular, all while creating "parallel societies" (just like mass immigration in the U.S. – and isn't it peculiar that President Obama and Lefty Soros have theon mass immigration?).As reported by, Orban said that Europeans should "stick to our Christian values" and "Europe can be saved," but only if citizens "take seriously the traditions, the Christian roots and all the values that are the basis of the civilisation of Europe .""What sort of Europe do we want to have? Parallel societies? Muslim communities living together with the Christian community?" he asked, adding that there is also an anti-democratic aspect to what's taking place."Nobody has voted for what is going on, so the quality of European democracy is in question.""Millions of migrants are coming to the European Union," he said, noting that European countries are neglecting various treaties that respect national boundaries.In recent days, RT.com has reported that the migration policies of Germany were so upsetting the country's population that some analysts are predicting widespread anarchy or even civil war.Hansjoerg Mueller of the Alternative for Germany party also said the country may be on its way to becoming a "banana republic without any government."
