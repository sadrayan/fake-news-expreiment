With Imports Banned, Russian Cheese Fills the Need for Brie
GOLOVKOVO-MARINO, Russia — The creamy goat cheese produced at Koza Nostra, a 12-acre farm in this village 75 miles north of Moscow, had largely been a labor of love. The farm had been losing more than $5,000 a month.

Then Russia was hit by Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, and Moscow retaliated by banning European cheese and other agricultural products.

Practically overnight, the farm’s phones started ringing with orders. Restaurant chefs and grocery store managers were clamoring, “‘We want cheese, we want cheese,’ ” said Daniel G. Sokolov, who manages the farm with his wife, Maria V. Sokolova.

The farm now churns out up to 140 pounds of goat cheese a day, some selling for as much as $14 a pound.
