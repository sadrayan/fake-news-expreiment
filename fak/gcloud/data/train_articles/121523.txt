Costa Rica suspension bridges
There are six bridges in total, the longest of which spans some 984 feet. The trails extend for slightly over a mile and a half (2.5 km), making this tour extremely feasible for anyone in moderate shape. The climb is not strenuous or muddy, as the trails are well-maintained and generally very flat. Local guides accompany each tour and help visitors learn about native plant and animal species.

This tour generally lasts two to three hours. Tours depart at 7:30 AM, 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM. Groups can be no larger than ten people.

Until recently, little was known about life in the tops of tropical forests, as it was nearly impossible to get so high. Early explorers used ropes and pulleys or ladders carved into tree trunks to make their way up. Today, biologists explore the forest canopy using towers, suspension bridges and construction cranes.

Biologists now know that about 90 percent of all organisms in a rainforest are found in the canopy. The sun that barely reaches the forest floor strikes treetops with full force, fueling the photosynthesis that eventually results in leaves, fruit and seeds. Since there's a bounty of good food way up there, animals abound in the canopy as well.

Many plants in Monteverde’s cloud forests are specially adapted to absorb moisture directly from the ever-present mist. Epiphytes (plants that live on trees in order to reach the sunlight) are plentiful in these forests, adding to the water-gathering ability of the trees. However, the epiphytes are not parasites—they feed off water, dust and nutrients that accumulate around their own roots.

Costa Rica has roughly 1,400 species of orchids, almost all of them epiphytes. Other epiphytes include bromeliads, which – although there are only 200 species of them – are much more commonly seen than the orchids. The epiphytes, treetops and vines create a canopy that preserves the moisture within the forest and also provides a home for many small animals and insects that live in the canopy.

Costa Rica’s rainforests comprise some of the world's most complex ecosystems. The Sky Walk gives visitors the unique chance of seeing this complex web of life up close.

Because there is a 12 person maximum capacity per bridge, RESERVATIONS are recommended, especially in July and August and from December till May.

Round trip transportation is available.
