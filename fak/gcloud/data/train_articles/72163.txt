From more than a million dollars in donations to a relatively meager few thousand, Hollywood A-listers are putting money forward to support their favorite presidential hopefuls in the 2016 election.

Hillary Clinton has raised the most money during the campaign, and this is especially true when it comes to power players in the entertainment world. Steven Spielberg and studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg have donated more than a million to support her run. But, as The New York Times points out, the upper echelon of donors in elections tends to include more people from finance and energy.

Business Insider has compiled reporting on contributions and searched the Federal Election Commission database to highlight the biggest donors from Hollywood in the current race. While not a comprehensive list — there are many smaller amounts coming from individuals in entertainment — it includes the largest known sums and focuses only on donations of $2,500 or more. The maximum an individual can contribute to a campaign in an election cycle is $2,700, but Business Insider also looked at larger contributions to super PACs.
