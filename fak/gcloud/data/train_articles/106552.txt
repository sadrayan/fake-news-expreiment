“I say to the devil, I know I gotta pay a price for what I’ve been teaching all these years.”

Wait . . . did Louis Farrakhan just declare Jesus is Lord?

My first instinct was to find a loophole in his wording. When Farrakhan said “my Jesus lives” and emphasized the “my,” I thought maybe he was trying to give himself license to declare that his “redeemer” can be whoever he wants it to be, and that he could express that by referring to said redeemer as “my Jesus.” That would be more consistent with the way Farrakhan has expressed himself throughout his public life. But what about this? “I say to the devil, I know I gotta pay a price for what I’ve been teaching all these years. You can have the money, you can have the clothes, you can have the suit, you can have the house but, me, you can’t have.” If that doesn’t sound like full-throated repentence, I don’t know what does. It’s always wise to be circumspect about a single statement someone makes, no matter how earth-shaking it may appear to be. If Farrakhan has decided to profess Christ as Lord, that’s absolutely wonderful, but you’d expect he’d expound upon it in future statements or interviews. He’d explain how and why he came to that decision. He’d address all the reasons people find this surprising and explain how he came to make this profession.
