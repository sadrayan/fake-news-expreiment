FRC Action
Welcome to the FRC Action Vote Scorecard for 2018, the Second Session of the 115th Congress!

This online scorecard is a compilation of the significant votes on federal legislation affecting family values that FRC Action either supported or opposed so far in 2018, the Second Session of the 115th Congress. As Republicans enjoyed unified control of the federal government under Republican President Donald Trump, 2018 has presented enormous opportunities for the enactment of conservative, pro-life and pro-family legislation and the confirmation of pro-life judges and cabinet secretaries.

This 2018 scorecard will continue to be updated throughout the year but reflects congressional votes through October.
