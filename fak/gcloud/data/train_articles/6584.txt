Future Passenger Rail

Upon approval of the referendum, the rail portion of the plan would enter the next phase of planning which includes federally mandated environmental studies, line engineering, and land acquisition along the planned corridor. With the additional planning, plus the actual construction time, we expect the rail line to be built and operational within approximately 10 years. The commuter rail line includes:

24 miles of rail from downtown St. Petersburg through the Gateway/Carillon area to downtown Clearwater

16 stations

57 minutes travel time
