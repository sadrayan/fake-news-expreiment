Ryan gives NRA campaign cash to gun control groups
Rep. Tim Ryan is giving the campaign money — $20,000 in all — he's received from the National Rifle Association to gun control groups.

The Niles Democrat, who began his career in Congress with an "A" rating from the NRA, decided to donate his NRA money to Sandy Hook Promise, Americans for Responsible Solutions and Everytown for Gun Safety.

His move follows an announcement from Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota, that he would donate $18,950 of his past NRA contributions to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund.

Ryan, a recreational hunter who, according to a spokesman, "has no interest in taking guns from law-abiding citizens," publicly supports a ban on bump stocks, which the Las Vegas shooter is believed to have used to make his semi-automatic weapons fire at an automatic rate.

Ryan has signed onto a House bill that would ban such devices. He broke with the NRA after the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, according to a spokesman.

John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, thanked Ryan and Walz in a statement.

"We applaud Congressman Ryan for his leadership and urge other Ohio state and federal representatives to follow suit and reject the NRA's dangerous agenda," said Michelle Mueller, a volunteer with the Ohio Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.
