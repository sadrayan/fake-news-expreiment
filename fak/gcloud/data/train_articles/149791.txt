Justin Schneider responds to civil suit, denies strangling victim unconscious
"Astonishingly, Schneider never spent a day in jail. Instead, because he is well-off, and because his parents hold well thought of religious positions in that community, he obtained bail and was released to the "custody" of his parents. He was placed on "home arrest" which, in the case of Schneider, meant that he could stay at his parent's home in Homer and effectively be on vacation and do whatever he wanted to do."
