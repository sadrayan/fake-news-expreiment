Expand Brady Background Checks
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or the Brady Law, was enacted 25 years ago. It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on November 30, 1993, and went into effect February 28, 1994.

Since the Brady Law took effect, it's blocked more than 3 million prohibited gun sales and processed over 278 million purchase requests. When someone goes to a federally licensed dealer to buy a gun, the retailer contacts the FBI to run a background check. The FBI checks the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to see if they are a convicted felon, fugitive, domestic abuser, or other prohibited purchaser. If the system reveals the buyer is legally barred from owning a gun, then the sale is denied.

Simply put, the Brady Law prevents guns from getting into dangerous hands.
