JEFF SESSIONS CAUGHT COLLUDING WITH OBAMA
JUST IN: Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ future in Donald Trump’s White House is in jeopardy after new reports have indicated that he has been taking advise from members of Barack Obama’s administration.

The Gateway Pundit reported that back in March of 2017, Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign including the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. He reportedly made this announcement just one day after he was sworn in as Attorney General after advice from Obama lawyers in the Department of Justice.

Last night, Fox News contributor and legal expert Gregg Jarrett told Sean Hannity that Sessions actually used the wrong law when he announced his recusal after Obama officials purposely misled him.

“He betrayed the president,” Jarrett said. “He knew when he was sworn in that he was going to recuse himself and the very next day he put the recusal in motion. He never told the president about that. And by the way he cited the regulation in his recusal… He cited the wrong law. It didn’t apply.”

“I think he was being advised badly at the time,” contributor Sara interjected.

“Yeah, by Obama’s holdovers. Who in the world would believe them?” Jarrett said.

This comes as rumors are swirling that Trump is considering firing Sessions, as the president is still frustrated at him for recusing himself from the Russia probe.

“Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else,” Trump said last summer.

Last weekend, Sessions said he stands by his decision to step down from the investigation.

“I think that’s what I had to do,” Sessions said.
