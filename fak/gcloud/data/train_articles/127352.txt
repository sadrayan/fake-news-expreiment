25 Clever, Funny, and Cruel Signs At Sporting Events
If you really want to get the attention of a professional athlete at a sporting event, you should obviously throw batteries, a full beer, or a half-eaten slice of pizza at him. Hastily scribbling a “clever” message on a piece of cardboard? Probably not going to be as effective. The problem is, uptight stadium security will get their undies in a bunch if you lovingly hurl something at an athlete — especially if, say, you accidentally give the athlete a black eye. So you’re stuck with going the safe route and making a sign. But if you’re going to do it, you’d better be creative.

That means no “John 3:16″ and no “D-(picture of a picket fence).” Instead, take your inspiration from these brilliant sign makers, who no doubt got themselves on ESPN thanks to their signs … except for the ones that were a little too risque for the WWL.
