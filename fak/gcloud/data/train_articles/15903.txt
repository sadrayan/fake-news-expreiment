We don't find evidence of a Texas law on shooting bears from a 2nd story window. However, the myth below regarding buffalo is often discussed:

Q: It is illegal to shoot buffalo from the second floor of a hotel (myth).

A: This language does not appear in current laws, although anyone who attempted this might in some cases be violating more general laws, such as laws related to disorderly conduct or estray animals. We have been unable to locate anything this specific in historical state laws.
