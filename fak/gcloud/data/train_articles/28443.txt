Environmentalists did not trash a California park on Earth Day
CLAIM: Photo of park strewn with garbage is captioned, “THIS IS HOW ENVIRONMENTALISTS LEFT A PARK IN CALIFORNIA AFTER A EARTHDAY (sic) CELEBRATION.”

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The photo used in Earth Day posts being shared on Facebook was taken nearly a decade ago to show debris left after “tailgating” parties at a college football game in Georgia.



THE FACTS: The photo, which shows an area littered with cups, trash bags and cardboard, was taken at the University of Georgia in Athens following a Saturday college football game on September 12, 2009.

The image with the false caption began appearing days after Earth Day celebrations on April 22 this year.



The Atlanta Journal Constitution published the photo with a story Sept. 17, 2009, about the mess party-goers left at the Bulldogs’ home opener against South Carolina.



Workers collected about 70 tons of garbage along with tents, grills, coolers and chairs following the tailgate, according to a 2011 Associated Press story. The college tightened rules regarding tailgating following the controversy.
