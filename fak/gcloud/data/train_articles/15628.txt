The TCEQ numbers may be accurate but they are misleading.

TCEQ is lumping together Texas' ozone woes in Houston and DFW with all the other ozone areas in the nation, including areas that have minimal or no problems compared to Texas.

This approach is highly misleading!

Of course Texas has made progress in reducing ozone, but Texas also has some of the worst ozone woes in the nation and it's easy to show lots of progress against the likes of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Illinois, Georgia, etc. which all have far lower ozone levels than Houston and DFW.

TCEQ's comparison to other states with few ozone problems is roughly analogous to comparing a driver who

gets 30 speeding tickets a year and reduces it by 50% over ten years to 15 per year while a second driver

only had 3 tickets and reduces it by 33% to 2 tickets per year.

The first driver had the greatest % reduction at 50% and the greatest volume reduction but also had the worst

speeding record by far.

These comparisons are misleading.
