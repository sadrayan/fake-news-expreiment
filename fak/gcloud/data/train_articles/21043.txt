Trump praises Kanye for his ‘great taste’
The bromance between President Trump and Kanye West continued Thursday, with the commander-in-chief commending the rapper’s smarts and “good taste.”

“I get along with Kanye,” the president said on “Fox & Friends,” a day after West professed his “love” for Trump on Twitter.

“Kanye looks and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it’s been in the history of our country. He sees, by the way, female unemployment – women unemployment — the lowest it’s been in now almost 19 years,” Trump said.

“He sees that stuff and he’s smart. And he says you know what Trump is doing a much better job than the Democrats did,” POTUS said.

West on Wednesday tweeted: “You don’t have to agree with Trump but the mob can’t make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don’t agree with everything anyone does. That’s what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.”

On the lengthy call, Trump took aim familiar targets: Hillary Clinton, James Comey and the media.

“Had I not gotten elected, Hillary [Clinton] would have come in – she would have added more rules and regulations. We would have been out of business because you saw what was happening. We were going down.”

He assailed the “fake news” media and doubled down that there “is no collusion with me and the Russians.”

“No one has been tougher to Russian than I am – you can ask President Putin about that,” the president said.

And he again called the former FBI director “a leaker and he’s a liar.”

“Comey, what he did…was terrible. He leaked classified information in order to try to get a special counsel,” Trump said.

Trump called Comey’s memos on the former FBI head’s meetings with Trump “phony.”
