Veteran budget expert leaving Ohio Senate for OSU
The person who knows more about state budgeting than anyone in the Statehouse is leaving his post after 23 years in the Ohio Senate.

The person who knows more about state budgeting than anyone in the Statehouse is leaving his post after 23 years in the Ohio Senate.

Brian Perera, the Senate�s deputy chief of staff for budget and finance, will become a lobbyist for his alma mater, Ohio State University. He takes over on Oct. 20 as assistant vice president for state relations.

Often a voice of reason (and moderation) in the GOP caucus, Perera has been leaned on heavily by a half-dozen Senate presidents and hundreds of members over the years as they crafted two-year budgets and other spending and tax legislation.

Armed with spreadsheets, binders of documents and a keen memory, Perera has been one of the few folks in this age of term limits who can bring historical context to an array of complicated spending items. He is among the few who can explain the web of where the money comes from, where it goes, why a budget item exists, and why slashing it could produce unintended consequences.

He once wrote a check to the state for 89 cents, because he wanted to personally double the size of the state�s rainy day fund. And yes, the check was deposited.

�The end of a remarkable era...will miss this most remarkable man!� Sen. Tom Patton, R-Strongsville, posted online. �Wish him the best at OSU. Urban Meyer could not have recruited a finer public servant. The state of Ohio cannot comprehend the debt it owes to Brian Perera!�

Perera, an 80s music aficionado and long-time host of the Rockin� Fiscal Eve party held every June 30, the last day of the fiscal year, also earned respect from the media for his willingness to explain issues and his strong belief in an open and transparent government.
