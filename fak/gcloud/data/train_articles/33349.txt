Senate Democrats' effort to block Trump move on Russia sanctions fails
Washington (CNN) Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked a Democratic effort to keep sanctions on companies tied to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, ending what was the most aggressive congressional pushback so far on the Trump administration's foreign policy toward Russia.

The sanctions resolution from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, which required 60 votes to proceed, was defeated in a 57-42 vote. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders missed the vote.

But the result still represented a symbolic rebuke of the Treasury Department's decision in December to lift the sanctions on the companies tied to Deripaska, a Kremlin ally. Eleven Republicans joined with Democrats to support Schumer's resolution, arguing that the Trump administration erred in deciding to lift sanctions on Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, as well as EN+ Group and JSC EuroSibEnergo.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has introduced a parallel resolution that the House will consider on Thursday, the deadline for invoking congressional review of the sanctions move, according to a Democratic leadership aide. While the matter is dead in the Senate, the House still could opt to pass the resolution disapproving of the sanctions relief.

Under a 2017 sanctions law, Congress has the authority to halt any decision by the Trump administration to weaken sanctions, providing lawmakers with a 30-day window to reject the plan.
