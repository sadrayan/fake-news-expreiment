Terror Threat Along Porous Border

A government watchdog group claims Islamic militants are currently operating in Mexico and plan to attack our southern border.

Judicial Watch reports agents have been put on "high alert" as we commemorate the attacks of 9/11.

National security expert Ed Turzanski says it’s no secret terror groups and drug cartels are working together.

“We've seen Muslim prayer rugs and other items that have been left behind by people entering the country illegally,” Turzanski tells KTRH News.

“We know that Al Qaeda and other Islamists have been working with narcotraffickers who work with human smugglers,” he says. “It shouldn't be a surprise that people who have a common goal of fighting against American law enforcement would come together.”

Turzanski says the blame falls squarely on the White House for not securing the border.

“Someday we'll find out something that something terrible came in all because we had the means to exercise control over our border and chose not to,” he says.

The president meantime, still insisting he doesn't want to put the cart before the horse.
