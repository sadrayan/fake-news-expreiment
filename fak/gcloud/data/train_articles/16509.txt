Subject: Seeking up-to-date information, accidental child shootings in Texas

Good morning. I write to seek your help today getting the latest full-year information on accidental child shootings in Texas and fatalities. If there’s a year-by-year chart, that would help too.

I am pasting below my signature an April 1995 news story noting such a figure -- at that time attributed to the Texas Department of Health.

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks,

g.

Got it, Gardner. If we have data, it will likely be only for fatalities. Are there particular years you’re interested in? Are you defining child as under 18?

It would be nice to have data that aligns with this sentence in the 1995 news story:

Forty-two children younger than 17 were killed in accidents involving firearms in 1993, the latest year for which data are available from the Texas Department of Health

4:01 p.m.

See the data attached for 2000-2015. Since there were fewer than 10 deaths for most years, we grouped two years together to provide releasable data. Due to changes in the coding system used to classify deaths, these numbers may not be directly comparable to data from before 1999.
