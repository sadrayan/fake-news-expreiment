It's a non-issue. There are 2 ways the Census collects these data.

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is collected in March of each year, and it is data about the previous calendar year. It is the official measure of national poverty levels.

The American Community Survey (ACS) is collected throughout the year with much bigger sample sizes. These "continuous" data are assembled into chunks about the previous 12 months. The ACS data are recommended for state level poverty data.

And it is fine to compare poverty rates from years ago to today.
