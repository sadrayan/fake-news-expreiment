WEARING A TRUMP HAT IN HOLLYWOOD (Attacked On Camera)
Published on Nov 12, 2017

Disclaimer: We never did anything remotely inflammatory or investigative to anyone. The point of this video was simply to wear a conservative symbol in a very liberal area.



The gay area was fine, everyone was nice and we were pleasantly surprised. It was once we went to the Walk of Fame and saw protesters that things hit the fan. Yet and still, we stayed true to the experiment and didn't do anything rude. We just wanted to see the reaction to the hats.
