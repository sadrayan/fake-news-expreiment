Trivia

The Chinese dragon uses mimicry to lure a tiger before killing it. In real-life, tigers are also capable of mimicry. Bengal tigers are known to mimic Sambar deer calls, while Siberian tigers can mimic Asian black bears. Sloth bears have been known to run upon hearing actual sambar deer, in the belief that they were in the presence of tigers. See more
