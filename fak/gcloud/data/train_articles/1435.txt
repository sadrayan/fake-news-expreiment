Nra Losing Influence On Legislators Gun Group Says Lobbying Tactics Are To Educate, Not Intimidate
WASHINGTON -- A few days before the House approved the Brady Bill, U.S. Rep. Mike Andrews of Texas received from the National Rifle Association a videotape of television ads set to run in his congressional district.

Andrews, one of several House members who switched to the gun-control side of the debate, saw the videotape as a veiled threat by the powerful gun lobby to take aim at him if he voted against its wishes.

As evidence, an Andrews aide cited an accompanying letter from top NRA lobbyist James Jay Baker, who pointed out that his organization spends millions of dollars annually on public relations and TV ads.

Before his May 8 vote for the Brady Bill, the fifth-term Democratic congressman from Houston had a 100 percent approval rating from the NRA.

NRA officials insisted the letter and videotape were sent not to intimidate wavering members of Congress but to educate the public on the Brady Bill and the NRA-backed alternative.

Andrews` concern over the ads -- one of which warns viewers that the Brady Bill ``lets bureaucrats decide if you can own a gun`` -- vividly illustrates the fear the NRA can instill in elected officials. Yet his final ``yes`` vote and the overwhelming passage of the bill also indicate that the gun lobby may have lost its tight grip on Congress.

Advocates were jubilant over winning House approval of the first major gun- control legislation in nearly 23 years.

``All of these people who did switch are going to get re-elected next year, and they`re going to see that voting against the NRA is really quite painless,`` predicted Jeff Muchnick of the Washington-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

NRA officials, who note that the legislative and political battles over gun control are far from over, say they get their power from the people.
