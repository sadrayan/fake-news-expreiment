Email, Susan Carroll, professor of political science and women's and gender studies; senior scholar, the Center for American Women and Politics of the Eagleton Institute of Politics, Rutgers University, July 29, 2016

I am a political scientist at Rutgers, a Senior Scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics, and a colleague of Debbie Walsh. People have measured the gender gap in various different ways, sometimes for their own political advantage (to make it seem smaller or larger).

At CAWP we try to measure it as objectively and simply as possible as the difference between the proportion of women and proportion of men supporting a given candidate (and as Debbie makes clear, the victorious candidate when there is one, regardless of whether that candidate is D or R). If there is not yet a winner, it would then make the most sense to calculate gender gap based on the difference between the proportion of women and proportion of men supporting the candidate that is leading in the poll.

Gallup and others make the calculation needlessly complicated by combining figures for both candidates.

CAWP is the oldest (since 1971) and most respected bipartisan university-based research and education center on women and politics in the country. I would think that in a sea of conflicting calculations, some of which are political in nature, it would seem to make sense to go with the definition offered by perhaps the most venerable nonpartisan institution in the field of women and politics. But then, that's just my scholarly opinion.
