Preface

This budget is not meant to be just a vision for the future, but a starting point to begin the discussion about the proper role of government.

The challenges ahead of us are daunting, and will likely require all Americans to participate in the necessary sacrifices to come. It was in 1975 that our country experienced

a tipping point. For the first time in our nation’s history,

entitlement spending surpassed the amount of spending on general government and the programs prescribed to us in the U.S. Constitution, such as national defense, the protection of property rights by the Justice Department and the Judicial Branch, and basic infrastructure needs. In order to preserve and restore the foundations of our country, we will need to begin tackling our largest vulnerabilities, such as entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. While it is im perative to be cognizant that many people have planned their futures around such programs, it is necessary to begin to reform and restructure these programs for future generations. Furthermore, we need to return many of the responsibilities of the federal government back to those who handle them best: the states, local communities, and most im portantly, individuals and families.
