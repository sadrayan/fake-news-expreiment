NY State Senate Bill S240
S. 240 2 A. 21 Section 1. Legislative intent. The legislature finds that comprehen- sive reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion, is a fundamental component of a woman's health, privacy and equality. The New York Constitution and United States Constitution protect a woman's fundamental right to access safe, legal abortion, courts have repeatedly reaffirmed this right and further emphasized that states may not place undue burdens on women seeking to access such right. Moreover, the legislature finds, as with other medical procedures, the safety of abortion is furthered by evidence-based practices developed and supported by medical professionals. Abortion is one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States; the goal of medical regulation should be to improve the quality and availability of health care services. Furthermore, the legislature declares that it is the public policy of New York State that every individual possesses a fundamental right of privacy and equality with respect to their personal reproductive deci- sions and should be able to safely effectuate those decisions, including by seeking and obtaining abortion care, free from discrimination in the provision of health care. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to prevent the enforce- ment of laws or regulations that are not in furtherance of a legitimate state interest in protecting a woman's health that burden abortion access. § 2. The public health law is amended by adding a new article 25-A to read as follows: ARTICLE 25-A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACT SECTION 2599-AA. POLICY AND PURPOSE. 2599-BB. ABORTION. § 2599-AA.
