CNN LIVE EVENT/SPECIAL

GOP Presidential Debate. Aired 8:10-11:15p ET.

Aired September 16, 2015 - 20:10 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.



JAKE TAPPER, CNN MODERATOR: I'm Jake Tapper. We're live at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California for the main event. Round 2 of CNN's presidential debate starts now.



The eleven leading Republican candidates for president are at their podiums. They are ready to face off, and if you've been watching this race, you know anything could happen over the next few hours.



To viewers who are just joining us, welcome to the Air Force One Pavilion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Our thanks to the staff here and especially to former first lady Nancy Reagan for this impressive setting with Ronald Reagan's presidential plane as our backdrop.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: This debate is airing on CNN networks in the United States and around the world. It's also being broadcast on the Salem Radio Network. I know everyone is very eager to get started.



But first, I want to explain the ground rules tonight. My name is Jake Tapper. I'll be the moderator. I will be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt. He worked in the Reagan administration for six years. And by CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash.



I will ask follow-up questions, I will attempt to guide the discussion. Candidates, I will try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions. You'll have one minute to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. I'll give you time to respond if you've been singled out for criticism.



Our viewers should know we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up. These 11 Republicans are positioned on the stage based on their ranking in recent national polls.



Our goal for this evening is a debate. A true debate, with candidates addressing each other in areas where they differ. Where they disagree -- on policy, on politics, on leadership. Now, let's begin.



I'd like to invite each candidate to take 30 seconds to introduce him or herself to our audience. First to you, Senator Paul.



SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: Good evening, everyone. I'm an eye surgeon from Bowling Green, Kentucky. My wife, Kelly, and I have been married for nearly 25 years, and I spend my days defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.



I think there's nothing more important than understanding that the Constitution restrains government, not the people.



Thank you.



(APPLAUSE)



FORMER GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE, R-ARK.: I'm Mike Huckabee. I'm delighted to be on this stage with some remarkable fellow Republicans.



None of us are a self-professed socialist. None of us on this state are under investigation by the FBI because we destroyed government records, or because we leaked secrets.



I know that there are some in the Wall-Street-to-Washington axis of power who speak of all of us contemptuously. But I'm here to say that I think we are, in fact, the A team.



We have some remarkable people, and, in fact, not only are we the A team; we even have our own Mr. T, who doesn't mind saying about others, "you're a fool."



And I'm delighted to be here with all of these guys, and would put any of them in an administration that I led. Thank you very much.



(APPLAUSE)



SEN. MARCIO RUBIO, R-FL.: Thank you. My name is Marco Rubio. I'm from Florida. My wife Jeanette and I are the proud -- we've been married 17 years, and we're the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening.



I'm honored to be here at the Reagan Library, at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service, but also our love for country.



And I'm also aware that California has a drought, and so that's why I made sure I brought my own water.



(LAUGHTER)



TAPPER: Senator Cruz?



SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS: I'm Ted Cruz. I am the son of an Irish-Italian mom and a Cuban immigrant dad who fled oppression and came to America seeking freedom. I'm a husband to my best friend, Heidi, who's here tonight. I'm a dad to two little girls who are the loves of my life, Caroline and Catherine.



If you're fed up with Washington, if you're looking for someone to stand up to career politicians in both parties, I'm the only one on this stage who has done that over and over again, and if we stand together, we can bring America back. DR. BEN CARSON: Hi, I'm Ben Carson, and I'm a retired pediatric



neurosurgeon. I'm here with my wife, Candy, of 40 years, and two of my sons, and their wives.



I stress the pediatric part of my career because the reason that I've gotten involved in this race is because I'm very concerned about the future of our children, and the direction of our country is one that does not portend well, unless we, the people, intervene and retake our rightful place at the pinnacle.



And I just want to be -- make it clear that I'm grateful to be here with all of you again, and welcome the addition of Carly Fiorina, as well.



(APPLAUSE)



DONALD TRUMP: I'm Donald Trump. I wrote "The Art of the Deal". I say not in a braggadocious way, I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world, and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again. We build our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life altogether.



Thank you. Thank you.



(APPLAUSE)



FORMER GOV. JEB BUSH, R-FLA.: I'm Jeb Bush, and I believe America's on the verge of its greatest century, and I'm ready to lead. I'm a committed, conservative reformer that cut taxes, that balanced budgets, that took on the special interest in Florida, and we won.



I look forward to talking tonight about how we can fix a broken Washington D.C., and create an environment where people can rise up again in this great country.



Thank you.



(APPLAUSE)



GOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS.: Good evening, I'm Scott Walker, and tonight, I want to thank Mrs. Reagan, and the Reagan Library for hosting us. You see, in my lifetime, the greatest president was a governor from California. Ronald Reagan knew how to go big, and go bold. He understood the essence of moving this country forward, and that's what I did when I took on the status quo in my state, and the Washington based special interest.



Now, more than ever, America needs a leader who will go big and bold again. Someone who's been tested. I'm ready to be that leader. Thank you.



(APPLAUSE)



CARLY FIORINA: Good evening. My story, from secretary to CEO, is only possible in this nation, and proves that everyone of us has potential. My husband, Frank, of 30 years, started out driving a tow truck for a family owned auto body shop. We have come to a pivotal point in our nation's history where this nation's possibilities and potential are being crushed by a government grown so big, so powerful, so inept, so corrupt, and a political class that refuses to do anything about it.



I am prepared to lead the resurgence of this great nation.



(APPLAUSE)



GOV. JOHN R. KASICH, R-OHIO: Hello, I'm John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio. Emma, and Reese, my children, and Karen, love 'ya girls. Thanks for watching tonight.



By the way, I think I actually flew on this plane with Ronald Reagan when I was a congressman, and his goals, and mine, really much -- are pretty much the same. Lift Americans, unify, give hope, grow America, and restore it is to that great, shining city on a hill.



Yes, he was a great one, and I learned much from watching him. The most important thing, hope to Americans, unify, lift everyone in America.



(APPLAUSE)



GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J.: Hi, my name is Chris Christie, and I'd like to you take the camera off me and put it on the audience because I'd like to ask all of you, how many of you, raise your hand, believe that in today's Barak Obama America your children will have a better life than you've had?



You see? That's why I'm running for President. Because leadership is not about me, it's about our country. And, what we talk about tonight, it's not about us, it's about the people in the audience tonight, because in seven short years this president has stripped away their trust, and their faith, and their belief that the next generation will have a better life. He's stolen that from us, and when I'm president, I'm going to take it back.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Thank you one and all for being here. There are many important policy issues facing our nation. We're going to get to many of them tonight, but I do want to start off with some current events in the news, and also some of the comments the candidates have recently made on the campaign trail.



TAPPER: Mrs. Fiorina, I want to start with you. Fellow Republican candidate, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, has suggested that your party's frontrunner, Mr. Donald Trump, would be dangerous as President. He said he wouldn't want, quote, "such a hot head with his finger on the nuclear codes."



You, as well, have raised concerns about Mr. Trump's temperament.



You've dismissed him as an entertainer. Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes?



FIORINA: You know, I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer. He's been terrific at that business.



I also think that one of the benefits of a presidential campaign is the character and capability, judgment and temperament of every single one of us is revealed over time and under pressure. All of us will be revealed over time and under pressure. I look forward to a long race.



TAPPER: You didn't answer my question. Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes? It's an issue that one of your fellow candidates has raised.



FIORINA: That's not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer, and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America.



TAPPER: Mr. Trump?



(APPLAUSE)



TRUMP: Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage. He's number 11, he's got 1 percent in the polls, and how he got up here, there's far too many people anyway.



As far as temperament -- and we all know that -- as far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament. I built a phenomenal business with incredible, iconic assets, one of the really truly great real-estate businesses.



And I may be an entertainer, because I've had tremendous success with number-one bestsellers all over the place, with "The Apprentice" and everything else I've done.



But I will tell you this: What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman, and that's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back, because we owe $19 trillion right now, $19 trillion, and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back.



And believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm. But we will be respected outside of this country. We are not respected now.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Mr. -- Senator Paul, your name has been invoked.



PAUL: I kind of have to laugh when I think of, "Mmm, sounds like a non sequitur." He was asked whether or not he would be capable and it would be in good hands to be in charge of the nuclear weapons, and all of a sudden, there's a sideways attack at me.



I think that really goes to really the judgment. Do we want someone with that kind of character, that kind of careless language to be negotiating with Putin? Do we want someone like that to be negotiating with Iran? I think really there's a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried. I'm very concerned about him -- having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his -- his visceral response to attack people on their appearance -- short, tall, fat, ugly -- my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?



TAPPER: Mr. Trump?



(APPLAUSE)



TRUMP: I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there.



(LAUGHTER)



That I can tell you.



WALKER: But Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake...



TAPPER: I want to -- I want to give Mr. Trump...



WALKER: But Jake, this -- this is -- this...



TAPPER: ... Mr. Trump, I want to give you another chance -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond to something that your rival to your left, Governor Bush, said.



Governor Bush told me last week when I read him the quote from Governor Jindal that he agrees you're not a serious candidate.



Tell Governor Bush why you are a serious candidate and what your qualifications are to be commander-in-chief. TRUMP: I've actually been in politics all my life, although I've been on that side as opposed to this side. I'm now a politician for about three months. Obviously, I'm doing pretty well. I'm number one in every polls (sic) by a lot.



But the qualification is that I've dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world. Everything I've done virtually has been a tremendous success.



When markets changed, when things turned, I heard Governor Pataki, who, by the way, was a failed governor in New York, a very seriously failed -- he wouldn't be elected dog catcher right now. I heard what he had to say.



And I will tell you this: Atlantic City, I've made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City. I left seven years ago, I've gotten great credit for my timing, and that's what I'm all about.



I'm a businessman, did really well, really well, and Jeb, what I want to do is put that ability into this country to make our country rich again. And I can do that, and I'm not sure that anybody else in the group will be able to do that.



TAPPER: Governor Bush, would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes?



BUSH: I think the voters will make that determination.



But what I know to be true is that the next president of the United States is going to have to fix an extraordinary difficult situation. This administration, with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, has created insecurity the likes of which we never would've imagined. There's not a place in the world where we're better off today than six and a half years ago.



And that requires a steadiness. That requires an understanding of how the world works. That requires an understanding and appreciation of American leadership in the world.



You can't just, you know, talk about this stuff and insult leaders around the world and expect a good result. You have to do this with a steady hand, and I believe I have those skills.



WALKER Jake, this is -- this is -- this is...



TRUMP: But I have to say...



WALKER This is actually what's wrong -- this is what's wrong with this debate. We're not talking about real issues.



And Mr. Trump, we don't need an apprentice in the White House.



(APPLAUSE)



We don't need an apprentice in the White House. We have one right now. He told us all the things we wanted to hear back in 2008. We don't know who you are or where you're going. We need someone who can actually get the job done.



And you talked about business.



TRUMP: Well, in Wisconsin...



WALKER You -- you -- let me finish...



TRUMP: Excuse me.



WALKER No, no...



TRUMP: In Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2 billion right now.



WALKER You're using the talking...



TRUMP: I would do so much better than that.



WALKER Mr. Trump, you're using the talking points of the Democrats...



TRUMP: No.



WALKER ... and as we all know...



TRUMP: I'm using facts.



WALKER ... that failed three times in four and a half years when I got elected, because it is working. We balanced a budget.



You want to talk about balanced budgets? You took four major projects into bankruptcy over and over and over again. You can't take America into bankruptcy. That's what's wrong with the politicians in Washington right now. They think we can take a country into bankruptcy.



(CROSSTALK)



TRUMP: Every major business leader, has used the -- I never went bank bankrupt, by the way, as you know, everybody knows. But -- hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I'm in business. I did a very good job.



But I will say this, and people are very, very impressed with what I've done, the business people. But when the folks of Iowa found out the true facts of the job that you've done in Wisconsin, all of a sudden you, tubed (ph), he was No. 1 and now he's No. 6 or seven in the polls.



So, look, we brought it out, you were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state. You lost 2.2 -- you have right now, a huge budget deficit. That's not a Democratic point. That's a point. That's a fact. And when the people of Iowa found that out, I went to No. 1 and you went down the tubes.



TAPPER: Governor Walker?



WALKER: Jake, yeah, absolutely, I'll take this on, because this is an issue that's important in this race.



Just because he says it doesn't make it true. The facts are the facts.



(APPLAUSE)



We balanced a $3.6 billion budget deficit, we did it by cutting taxes -- $4.7 billion to help working families, family farmers, small business owners and senior citizens. And it's about time people in America stand up and take note of this.



If you want someone that can actually take on the special interest of Washington, which you yourself said you were part of, using the system, we need somebody that will stand up and fight for average Americans to put them back in charge of their government.



I'm the one who is taking that on. I'll do that as your next president.



TAPPER: Let's move on.



(APPLAUSE)



KASICH: Jake, Jake. TAPPER: A phenomenon going on in the race right now is the



political...



OK, Governor Kasich, go ahead.



KASICH: Listen, you know, I -- if I were sitting at home and watch thing back and forth, I would be inclined to turn it off. I mean, people at home want to know across this country, they want to know what we're going to do to fix this place, how we'll balance a budget, how we're going to create more economic growth, how we'll pay down the debt. What we're going to do to strengthen the military.



So, we just spent 10 minutes here...



TAPPER: We have a lot of issues coming up, sir.



KASICH: But -- but wait a minute. It's a lot of ad hogshead. Now, I know that it may be buzzing out there, but I think it's important we get to the issues, because that's what people want, and they don't want all this fighting.



TAPPER: We are getting to the issues, sir.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Phenomenon going on in the race is the political outsiders in the race, Dr. Carson, Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, all together, have majority support in the polls.



Governor Christie, I want to ask you about something that Dr. Carson said the other day.



Dr. Carson said campaigning is easier for him, because he's not a politician. He can just tell the truth, therefore, while politicians, quote, "Have their finger in the air to see and do what is politically expedient."



Governor Christie, tell Dr. Carson, is that a fair description of you?



CHRISTIE: Well, I know Ben wasn't talking about me, I'm sure he was talking about one of the other guys, not me.



(LAUGHTER)



As far as being an outsider is concerned -- as far as being an outsider is concerned, let me tell you this, Jake, I'm a Republican in New Jersey. I wake up every morning as an outsider. I wake up every morning with a Democratic legislature who trying to beat my head in and fight me because I'm trying to bring conservative change to a state that needed it desperately.



And so, everyone can talk us here about their credentials. But the bottom line is, every morning I get up, I veto 400 bills from a crazy liberal Democratic legislature, not one of them has been overridden. I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history, according to Americans for Tax Reform. What folks want in this country is somebody to go down there and get the job done. And that's exactly what I'll do.



So, I know this much, that what the American people want to hire right now is somebody who believes in them. And believes that they are the ones who can fix our country. I will be the vessel through which they can fix this country, but it's not about me.



It's about all of you. And getting this government off your back and out of your way, and letting you succeed. I know Ben wasn't talking about me.



TAPPER: Well, let's find out. Thank you.



CHRISTIE: Look at him smiling at me right now. I know Ben didn't mean it about me. One of these other guys, I'm sure.



TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Christie.



Dr. Carson, who were you thinking about on this stage when you said that?



CHRISTIE: Be honest, Ben, be honest.



TAPPER: And more broadly, is experience in government not important for a president to have?



CARSON: Typically, politicians do things that are politically expedient. And they are looking for whatever their particular goal is.



That is not the reason that I have gotten into this thing. I'm extraordinary concerned about the direction of this country, the divisiveness that is going on, fiscal irresponsibility, the failure to take a leadership position in the world.



All of those things will lead to a situation where the next generation will not have a chance that we've had now. So I don't -- I don't want to really get into describing who's a politician and who's not a politician, but I think the people have kind of made that decision for themselves already, and will continue to do so as time goes on.



TAPPER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.



CHRISTIE: See, Jake, it wasn't me.



(LAUGHTER)



FIORINA: Jake, I'll tell you -- I'll tell you why people are supporting outsiders. It's because you know what happens if someone's been in the system their whole life, they don't know how broken the system is. A fish swims in water, it doesn't know it's water. It's not that politicians are bad people, it's that they've been in that system forever.



The truth is 75 percent of the American people think the government is corrupt; 82 percent of the American people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases, 25 years in other cases. The border's been insecure for 25 years; 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care. These things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo.



You know what a leader does? They challenge the status quo, they solve problems that have festered for a long time and they produce results. That is what my whole life has been about. People know this is about far more than replacing a D with an R --



TAPPER: Thank you.



FIORINA: -- this is about changing the system.



TAPPER: Thank you. Thank you Ms. Fiorina.



(APPLAUSE)



Governor Bush, in addition to the fact that he's an outsider, one of the reasons Mr. Trump is a frontrunner, Republican voters say, is because they like the fact that he is not bought and paid for by wealthy donors. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that the $100 million you've raised for your campaign makes you a puppet for your donors. Are you?



BUSH: No. Absolutely not. People are supporting me because I have a proven record of conservative leadership where I cut taxes $19 billion over eight years. We shrunk the state government workforce, we created a climate that led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating. People know that we need principle-centered leadership, a disrupter to go to Washington, D.C. The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something -- that was generous and gave me money -- was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida --



TRUMP: I didn't --



BUSH: Yes you did.



TRUMP: Totally false.



BUSH: You wanted it and you didn't get it because I was opposed to --



TRUMP: I would have gotten it.



BUSH: -- casino gambling before --



TRUMP: I promise I would have gotten it.



BUSH: during and after. And that's not -- I'm not going to be bought by anybody.



TRUMP: I promise if I wanted it, I would have gotten it.



BUSH: No way. Believe me. TRUMP: I know my people.



BUSH: Not even possible.



TRUMP: I know my people.



TAPPER: Is there anything else you want to say about this?



TRUMP: No. I just will tell you that, you know, Jeb made the statement. I'm not only referring to him. I -- a lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here. And the donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people.



I'm spending all of my money, I'm not spending -- I'm not getting any -- I turned down -- I turn down so much, I could have right now from special interests and donors, I could have double and triple what he's got. I've turned it down. I turned down last week $5 million from somebody.



So I will tell you I understand the game, I've been on the other side all of my life. And they have a lot of control over our politicians. And I don't say that favorably, and I'm not sure if there's another system, but I say this. I am not accepting any money from anybody. Nobody has control of me other than the people of this country. I'm going to do the right thing.



TAPPER: Governor -- BUSH: You've got, according to your -- to what you said on one of the talk shows, you got Hillary Clinton to go to your wedding --



TRUMP: That's true. That's true.



BUSH: -- because you gave her money. Maybe it works for Hillary Clinton --



TRUMP: I was -- excuse me, Jeb.



BUSH: -- it doesn't work for anybody on this -- on stage.



TRUMP: I was a businessman, I got along with Clinton, I got along with everybody. That was my job, to get along with people.



BUSH: But the simple fact is --



TRUMP: I didn't want to -- excuse me. One second.



BUSH: No. The simple fact is, Donald, you could not take --



TRUMP: OK, more energy tonight. I like that.



(LAUGHTER)



Look --



BUSH: I was asked the question. TRUMP: I didn't want -- it was my obligation as a businessman to my family, to my company, to my employees, to get along with all politicians. I get along with all of them, and I did a damn good job in doing it. Go ahead.



BUSH: So he supports Pelosi, he supports Schumer, he supports Clinton --



TRUMP: Got along with everybody.



BUSH: When he -- and he -- when he asked -- when he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no.



TRUMP: Wrong.



BUSH: We said no. And that's the simple fact. The simple fact is --



TRUMP: Don't make things up. Jeb, don't make things up. Come on.



BUSH: Don't cut me off.



TRUMP: Don't make things up.



CARSON: Jake, can I say something about that?



TAPPER: Sure Dr. Carson.



CARSON: You know, when I entered this race, all the political pundits said it's impossible; you can't do it because you're not connected with the money. And there's no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully.



I in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest group or lick the boots of billionaires. I have said to the people if they want me to do this, please get involved. And we now have over 500,000 donations, and the money is coming in.



But the pundits forgot about one thing, and that is the people. And they are really in charge.



TAPPER: Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let's move to Russia if we could.



Russia is sending troops and tanks into Syria right now to prop up a U.S. enemy, Bashar al-Assad. President Obama's incoming top general says, quote, "Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security."



Mr. Trump, you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin, you say you will get along, quote, "very well." What would you do right now if you were president, to get the Russians out of Syria?



TRUMP: So, number one, they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero.



Syria's a mess. You look at what's going on with ISIS in there, now think of this: we're fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants.



I would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe -- and I may be wrong, in which case I'd probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with.



We don't get along with China. We don't get along with the heads of Mexico. We don't get along with anybody, and yet, at the same time, they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and every other way. We get along with nobody.



I will get along -- I think -- with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable -- stable world.



TAPPER: So, you -- just to clarify, the only answer I heard to the question I asked is that you would -- you would reach out to Vladimir Putin, and you would do what? You would...



TRUMP: I believe that I will get along -- we will do -- between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems, we won't have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations. TAPPER: Senator Rubio, you've taken a very different approach to the -- the question of Russia. You've called Vladimir Putin a, quote, "gangster."



Why would President Rubio's approach be more effective than President Trump's?



RUBIO: Well, first of all, I have an understanding of exactly what it is Russia and Putin are doing, and it's pretty straightforward. He wants to reposition Russia, once again, as a geopolitical force.



He himself said that the destruction of the Soviet Union -- the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, and now he's trying to reverse that.



He's trying to destroy NATO. And this is what this is a part of. He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East.



Here's what you're going to see in the next few weeks: the Russians will begin to fly -- fly combat missions in that region, not just targeting ISIS, but in order to prop up Assad.



He will also, then, turn to other countries in the region and say, "America is no longer a reliable ally, Egypt. America is no longer a reliable ally, Saudi Arabia. Begin to rely on us."



What he is doing is he is trying to replace us as the single most important power broker in the Middle East, and this president is allowing it. That is what is happening in the Middle East. That's what's happening with Russia, and...



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator Rubio.



(CROSSTALK) TAPPER: I want to bring in Carly Fiorina.



(APPLAUSE)



FIORINA: Having...



TAPPER: Ms. Fiorina, you have met...



FIORINA: Having met Vladimir Putin, if I may...



TAPPER: ...yeah, you've met Vladimir Putin. Yes.



FIORINA: Having met Vladimir Putin, I wouldn't talk to him at all. We've talked way too much to him.



What I would do, immediately, is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet, I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland, I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states. I'd probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message. By the way, the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know General Suleimani's name is because Russia is in Syria right now, because the head of the Quds force traveled to Russia and talked Vladimir Putin into aligning themselves with Iran and Syria to prop up Bashar al- Assad.



Russia is a bad actor, but Vladimir Putin is someone we should not talk to, because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side, and we have all of that within our control.



We could rebuild the Sixth Fleet. I will. We haven't. We could rebuild the missile defense program. We haven't. I will. We could also, to Senator Rubio's point, give the Egyptians what they've asked for, which is intelligence.



We could give the Jordanians what they've asked for...



TAPPER: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.



FIORINA: ...bombs and material. We have not supplied it...



TAPPER: Thank you.



FIORINA: ...I will. We could arm the Kurds. They've been asking us for three years. All of this is within our control.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.



While you're -- while you brought up the subject of General Suleimani of the Quds forces from Iran, the next president, no matter who he or she may be, will inherit President Obama's Iran deal.



Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one, as you have promised to do, is, quote, "inexperienced," and, quote, "playing to a crowd." Respond to Governor Kasich, please.



CRUZ: Well, let me tell you, Jake, the single biggest national security threat facing America right now is the threat of a nuclear Iran. We've seen six and a half years of President Obama leading from behind. Weakness is provocative, and this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic.



This deal, on its face, will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, making the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.



This deal abandons four American hostages in Iran, and this deal will only accelerate Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons. You'd better believe it. If I am elected president, on the very first day in office, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Why is that not, as Governor Kasich says, playing to the crowd and an example of you being inexperienced?



CRUZ: Well, let's be clear when it comes to experience. What President Obama wants to do is he's run to the United Nations, and he wants to use the United Nations to bind the United States, and take away our sovereignty. Well, I spent five and a half years as a Solicitor General of Texas, the lead lawyer for the state, in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I went in front of the Supreme Court, and took on the world court of the United Nations in a case called Medellin v. Texas, and we won a historic victory saying the World Court, and the U.N., has no power to bind the United States, and no President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, has the authority to give away our sovereignty.



And, so, if there's anyone up here who would be bound by this catastrophic deal with Iran, they're giving up the core responsibility of commander in chief, and as president, I would never do that.



TAPPER: Governor Kasich...



KASICH: ...Yeah, well...



TAPPER: ...Did Senator Cruz just play to the crowd?



KASICH: Well, let me just say this. First of all, I think it's a bad agreement, I would never have done it. But, you know, a lot of our problems in the world today is that we don't have the relationship with our allies. If we want to go everywhere alone, we will not have the strength as (ph) if we could rebuild with our allies.



Now, this agreement, we don't know what's going to happen in 18 months. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. I've seen lots of issues in foreign affairs, and foreign -- in terms of global politics, you have to be steady.



Now, here's the -- if they cheat, we slap the sanctions back on. If they help Hamas, and Hezbollah, we slap the sanctions back on. And, if we find out that they may be developing a nuclear weapon, than the military option is on the table. We are stronger when we work with the Western civilization, our friends in Europe, and just doing it on our own I don't think is the right policy.



TAPPER: ...Thank you, Governor. I want to go to Senator Paul.



TRUMP(?): ...Slow (ph) and steady, (inaudible) chicken...



TAPPER: I want to go to Senator Paul. Senator Paul, the White House is rolling out the red carpet next week for the President of China, President Xi. Governor Walker says that President Obama should cancel the state dinner because of China's currency manipulation, and because of China's alleged cyber attacks against the United States.



Is Governor Walker right?



PAUL: I think this goes back to essentially what we've been saying for the last two or three questions. Carly Fiorina also said we're not going to talk with Putin. Well, think if Reagan had said that during the Cold War? We continued to talk with the Russians throughout the Cold War which is much more significant that where we are now.



Should we continue to talk with Iran? Yes. Should we cut up the agreement immediately? That's absurd. Wouldn't you want to know if they complied? Now, I'm going to vote against the agreement because I don't think there's significant leverage, but it doesn't mean that I would immediately not look at the agreement, and cut it up without looking to see if whether or not Iran has complied.



The same goes with China. I don't think we need to be rash, I don't think we need to be reckless, and I think need to leave lines of communication open. Often we talk about whether we should be engaged in the world, or disengaged in the world, and I think this is an example of some who want to isolate us, actually, and not be engaged.



We do need to be engaged with Russia. It doesn't mean we give them a free pass, or China a free pass, but, to be engaged, to continue to talk. We did throughout the Cold War, and it would be a big mistake not to do it here.



TAPPER: Governor Walker, Senator Paul seemed to suggest...



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: ...that canceling the state dinner would be rash, and reckless.



WALKER: Two parts to that, one on China, one back for a second on Iran.



When it comes to China, why would we be giving an official state visit to a country that's been involved in a massive cyber attack against the United States? That's not just a visit, that's a 21 gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House. It just doesn't make any sense. If we're ever going to send a message to them, wouldn't this be the time, when they've issued this, sort of, massive attack against us? And, Jake, for the question, I was one of the first ones to call for terminating the bad deal with Iran on day one. The President came after me and said I need to bone up. You know, the President who called ISIS the JV squad said I needed to bone up.



The reality is it's a bad deal on day one, and it's a bad deal because this president has allowed Iran to go closer, and closer.



I'd love to play cards with this guy because Barack Obama folds on everything with Iran. We need a leader who's going to stand up, and actually (INAUDIBLE)...



FIORINA: ...Jake...



TAPPER: ...Governor Bush...



CRUZ(?): ...Jake...



TAPPER: Governor Bush, your father was the chief diplomatic envoy to China back when Nixon opened relations to China. Is Scott Walker's approach the right one, canceling the state dinner?



BUSH: No, I don't think so, but we need to be strong against China. We should use offensive tactics as it relates to cyber security, send a deterrent signal to China. There should be super sanctions in what President Obama has proposed. There's many other tools that we have without canceling a dinner. That's not going to change anything, but we can be much stronger as it relates to that.



As it relates to Iran, it's not a strategy to tear up an agreement. A strategy would be how do we confront Iran? And, the first thing that we need to do is to establish our commitment to Israel which has been altered by this administration. And, make sure that they have the most sophisticated weapons to send a signal to Iran that we have Israel's back.



If we do that, it's going to create a healthier deterrent effect than anything else I can think of.



TAPPER: I want to turn...



FIORINA: ...Jake, (INAUDIBLE)...



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: ...I want to turn to Governor Huckabee who has been very patient. Somebody had to be 11th, and he is, but, I do want to change the subject to the event that you had...



HUCKABEE: I would certainly love to get in on this, because I think the single...



(CROSSTALK)



TAPPER: ... however you want, but I want to ask this question.



HUCKABEE: I've been patiently waiting, and I'm going to just say this about Iran.



TAPPER: All right, sir, go ahead.



HUCKABEE: Because I think it is incredibly important. This is really about the survival of Western civilization. This is not just a little conflict with a Middle Eastern country that we've just now given over $100 billion to, the equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion.



This threatens Israel immediately, this threatens the entire Middle East, but it threatens the United States of America. And we can't treat a nuclear Iranian government as if it is just some government that would like to have power. This is a government for 36 years has killed Americans, they kidnapped Americans, they have maimed Americans. They have sponsored terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, and they threaten the very essence of Western civilization.



To give them this agreement, that the president treats like the Magna Carta, but Iranians treat it like it's toilet paper, and we must, simply, make it very clear that the next president, one of us on this stage, will absolutely not honor that agreement, and will destroy it and will be tough with Iran, because otherwise, we put every person in this world in a very dangerous place.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: OK.



(UNKNOWN): Jake, I'd like to...



TAPPER: We're going to turn now to Hugh Hewitt, from Salem Radio Network.



HUGH HEWITT, RADIO HOST: Thank you, Jake.



Mr. Trump, two years ago, President Obama drew a red line that the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad crossed, President Obama threatened to strike. He did not, his knees buckled.



We now have 4 million refugees, Syria is a living hell, and he turned to the Congress for the authority to back him up. You have three senators to your right that said, no. Do they bear responsibility for this refugee crisis, and what would you have done when Bashar Assad crossed the line?



TRUMP: I wouldn't have drawn the line, but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across. They do bear some responsibility, but I think he probably didn't do it, not for that reason.



Somehow, he just doesn't have courage. There is something missing from our president. Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force, done something to Assad -- if he had gone in with tremendous force, you wouldn't have millions of people displaced all over the world.



HEWITT: How much responsibility, Mr. Trump, do the senators hold?



TRUMP: They had a responsibility, absolutely. I think we have three of them here...



HEWITT: Senator Rubio...



TRUMP: I think they had a responsibility, yes.



RUBIO: Let me tell you -- I will tell you we have zero responsibility, because let's remember what the president said. He said the attack he would conduct would be a pinprick. Well, the United States military was not build to conduct pinprick attacks.



If the United States military is going to be engaged by a commander- in-chief, it should only be engaged in an endeavor to win. And we're not going to authorize use of force if you're not put in a position where they can win.



And quite frankly, people don't trust this president as commander-in- chief because of that.



(APPLAUSE)



HEWITT: Senator Paul? PAUL: I think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when we shouldn't. Had we bombed Assad at the time, like President Obama wanted, and like Hillary Clinton wanted and many Republicans wanted, I think ISIS would be in Damascus today. I think ISIS would be in charge of Syria had we bombed Assad.



Sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil, and sometimes intervention sometimes makes us less safe. This is real the debate we have to have in the Middle East.



Every time we have toppled a secular dictator, we have gotten chaos, the rise of radical Islam, and we're more at risk. So, I think we need to think before we act, and know most interventions, if not a lot of them in the Middle East, have actually backfired on us.



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator Paul.



(APPLAUSE)



I want to turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.



RUBIO: Hold on, a second, Jake, he asked me, as well. I'd like to actually...



TAPPER: That would be fair, you're right. You're the third senator.



RUBIO: ... respond. I think I'm the first senator.



(LAUGHTER)



The No. 1 test for use of military force should be the vital national security interest of the United States. The reason why I opposed President Obama bombing Syria, is because he couldn't answer the question what do you do if chemical weapons end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusra, like Al Qaida, like ISIS?



Now, I also want to respond to several folks up here who said we should trust this Iranian deal, see if the Iranians will comply.



Anyone who is paying attention to what Khamenei says knows that they will not comply. There is a reason Khamenei refers to Israel as the little Satan, and America as the great Satan.



In the middle of negotiating this treaty, Khamenei led the assembled masses in chanting, death to America. I'm reminded of a great editorial cartoon. It shows the Ayatollah Khamenei saying, "Death to all Americans," and then it shows John Kerry coming back, saying, "Can we meet ya half way?"



(LAUGHTER)



We need a commander-in-chief who will stand up and protect this country. And I'll tell you, I can't wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton and to make abundantly clear if you vote for Hillary, you are voting for the Ayatollah Khomeini to possess a nuclear weapon and if you elect me as president, under no circumstances will a theocratic ayatollah who chants death to America ever be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.



(CROSSTALK)



TAPPER: We're going to go to Dana Bash...



(CROSSTALK)



KASICH: No, no, no. I want to -- I want to -- I want to say something about what the senator just said.



FIORINA: And then it'll be my turn.



KASICH: No one is -- no -- let me -- let me suggest to you we believe that we operate better in the world when our allies work with us. President Bush did it in the Gulf War. We work better when we are unified.



Secondly, nobody's trusting Iran. They violate the deal, we put on the sanctions, and we have the high moral ground to talk to our allies in Europe to get them to go with us.



If they don't go with us, we slap the sanctions on anyway. If they fund these radical groups that threaten Israel and all of the West, then we should rip up the deal and put the sanctions back on.



And let me make it clear -- let me make it clear...



(CROSSTALK)



KASICH: ... if we think -- if we think they're getting close to a -- to developing a nuclear weapon and we get that information, you better believe that I would do everything in my power as the commander-in- chief to stop them having a nuclear weapon.



CRUZ: Jake, Jake... KASICH: We can have it, and we can have our allies, and we can be strong as a country, and we can project across this globe with unity, not just doing it alone. That is not what gets us where we want to get as a nation.



TAPPER: Senator Cruz?



CRUZ: Jake, there is no more important topic in 2016 than this topic right here, and I've listened to several folks saying, "Well, gosh, if they cheat, we'll act."



We won't know under this agreement -- there are several facilities in Iran they designate as military facilities that are off limit all together. Beyond that, the other facilities, we give them 24 days notice before inspecting them. That is designed to allow them to hide the evidence.



And most astonishingly, this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. That makes no sense whatsoever.



And let me know -- President Obama is violating federal law...



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.



CRUZ: ... by not handing over the side deals, and we ought to see the United States Congress...



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.



CRUZ: ... stand up together and say, "Hand over this treaty, and protect this country."



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. I want to...



FIORINA: Jake?



TAPPER: ... turn back to Governor Huckabee...



FIORINA: Jake?



TAPPER: I want to turn back to Governor Huckabee.



Governor Huckabee, last week, you held a rally for a county clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, as I don't need to tell you.



You've called what happened to Kim Davis, that clerk, "an example of the criminalization of Christianity." There are several people on the stage who disagree with you.



Governor Bush, for example, says that that clerk is sworn to uphold the law. Is Governor Bush on the wrong side of the criminalization of Christianity?



HUCKABEE: No, I don't think he's on the wrong side of such an issue. Jeb is a friend. I'm not up here to fight with Jeb or to fight with anybody else.



But I am here to fight for somebody who is a county clerk elected under the Kentucky constitution that 75 percent of the people of that state had voted for that said that marriage was between a man and a woman.



The Supreme Court in a very, very divided decision decided out of thin air that they were just going to redefine marriage. It's a decision that the other justices in dissent said they didn't have and there wasn't a constitutional shred of capacity for them to do it.



I thought that everybody here passed ninth-grade civics. The courts cannot legislate. That's what Roberts said. But heck, it's what we learned in civics.



The courts can't make a law. They can interpret one. They can review one. They can't implement it. They can't force it.



But here's what happened: Because the courts just decided that something was going to be and people relinquished it and the other two branches of government sat by silently -- I thought we had three branches of government, they were all equal to each other, we have separation of powers, and we have checks and balances.



If the court can just make a decision and we just all surrender to it, we have what Jefferson said was judicial tyranny.



The reason that this is a real issue that we need to think about...



TAPPER: Thank you, Governor.



HUCKABEE: No, no. Let me finish this one thought, Jake. I haven't gotten that much time, so I'm going to take just what little I can here.



We made accommodation to the Fort Hood shooter to let him grow a beard. We made accommodations to the detainees at Gitmo -- I've been to Gitmo, and I've seen the accommodations that we made to the Muslim detainees who killed Americans.



HUCKABEE: You're telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected Democrat county clerk from Rowan County, Kentucky? What else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a Fort Hood shooter or a detainee at Gitmo?



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Well, I'm not telling you that, Governor. But Governor Bush is, because he -- because he disagrees. He thinks that Kim Davis swore to uphold the law.



You disagree? You're not -- you don't...



BUSH: I don't think -- you're not stating my views right.



TAPPER: OK. Please do.



BUSH: I think there needs to be accommodation for someone acting on faith. Religious conscience is -- is -- is a first freedom. It's -- it's a powerful part of our -- of our Bill of Rights.



And, in a big, tolerant country, we should respect the rule of law, allow people in -- in -- in this country -- I'm a -- I was opposed to the decision, but we -- you can't just say, "well, they -- gays can't get married now."



But this woman, there should be some accommodation for her conscience, just as there should be for people that are florists that don't want to participate in weddings, or bakers. A great country like us should find a way to have accommodations for people so that we can solve the problem in the right way. This should be solved at the local level...



TAPPER: You did...



BUSH: And so we do agree, Mike.



CHRISTIE: I was --



(CROSSTALK)



TAPPER: Governor, you said, quote, "she is sworn to uphold the law."



CHRISTIE: She is, and so if she, based on conscience, can't sign that -- that marriage license, then there should be someone in her office to be able to do it, and if the law needs to be changed in the state of Kentucky, which is what she's advocating, it should be changed.



TAPPER: Let me go to my colleague Dana Bash, who has a question.



DANA BASH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Governor Kasich, Senator Cruz is so committed to stripping federal funds from Planned Parenthood that it could result in shutting down the federal government in just about two weeks. Do you agree with Senator Cruz's tactic?



KASICH: Well, I agree that we should defund Planned Parenthood. I don't know many people in America who don't think that we should, and in my state, we're trying to figure out how to get it done, because we are threatened with the federal government taking all of our Medicaid money away.



I think there is a way to get this done by giving governors the ability to be able to act to defund Planned Parenthood. But when (ph) it comes to closing down the federal government, you gotta be very careful about that.



When we shut the government down -- if we have a chance at success and it's a great principle, yes. The president of the United States is not going to sign this, and all we're gonna do is shut the government down, and then we're gonna open up -- open it up, and the American people are gonna shake their heads and say, "what's the story with these Republicans?" So I think there is a way to get to cutting off the funding for



Planned Parenthood. I was in the Congress for 18 years, balanced the budget, cut taxes, got it done. Changed welfare, went around the president to get welfare reform done.



There are ways to do it without having to shut the government down, but I'm sympathetic to the fact that we don't want this organization to get funding, and the money ought to be reprogrammed for family planning in other organizations that don't support this tactic.



But I would not be for shutting the government down...



BASH: Thank you.



KASICH: ...because I don't think it's going to work out.



BASH: Thank you.



Senator Cruz, I would just add that, on this stage not that long ago, Senator Graham said that this tactic that you're pushing would tank the Republicans' ability to win in 2016.



CRUZ: Well, let me tell you, Dana, number one, I'm proud to stand for life. These Planned Parenthood videos are horrifying. I would encourage every American to watch the videos. See -- seeing your Planned Parenthood officials callously, heartlessly bartering and selling the body parts of human beings, and then ask yourself, "are these my values?"



These are horrifying. On these videos, Planned Parenthood also essentially confesses to multiple felonies. It is a felony with ten years' jail term to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That's what these videos show Planned Parenthood doing.



Absolutely we shouldn't be sending $500 million of taxpayer money to funding an ongoing criminal enterprise, and I'll tell you, the fact that Republican leadership in both houses has begun this discussion by preemptively surrendering to Barack Obama and saying, "we'll give in because Obama threatens a veto."



You know, Obama's committed to his principles. His liberal principles, he will fight for them. He says...



BASH: Thank you, senator.



CRUZ: I will veto any budget that doesn't fund Planned Parenthood, and Republicans surrender. We need to stop surrendering and start standing...



BASH: Thank you...



CRUZ: ...for our principles.



(APPLAUSE)



(CROSSTALK) BASH: Governor -- governor, I want to go to you. Is it what Senator



Cruz says, a surrender by Republicans?



CHRISTIE: We're not -- what I can tell you is this. We didn't surrender in New Jersey, six years ago, as the brand new first ever pro-life governor of New Jersey since Roe versus Wade, I defended Planned Parenthood.



And I've vetoed Planned Parenthood funding, now, eight times in New Jersey. Since the day I walked in as governor, Planned Parenthood has not been funded in New Jersey. We stood up and every one of those vetoes has been sustained.



But here's the problem, we're -- we're fighting with each other up here. We agree. Let's ask Hillary Clinton. She believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts...



BASH: But...



CHRISTIE: ...Dana, in a way that maximizes their value for sale for profit. It is disgusting, and the American people need to hear it...



BASH: But is it...



CHRISTIE: ...we shouldn't be fighting with each other. She's the real opponent, she's the real problem.



BASH: But, governor, the -- but, governor, the reality is, in just two weeks' time...



(APPLAUSE)



BASH: ...we are going to be facing a question about whether or not it's enough to shut down the government to make that statement, because there is still a Democrat in the White House. Do you oppose it or support it?



CHRISTIE: I'll tell you what -- I'll tell you what I'd be willing to fight for. I'll tell you what I'd be willing to fight for. Why will (ph) we put tax reform on the president's desk, so we can simplify this tax system?



BASH: Yes or no, do you support this shutdown?



CHRISTIE: No, no, it's really important, Dana. We got to talk about what we would be willing to shut down for. Why don't we put tax reform on this president's desk, and make him veto it if that's what he wants to do? Why haven't we repealed and replaced Obamacare?



Make him veto if that's what he wants to do.



BASH: We're talking about Planned Parenthood right now.



CHRISTIE: And why don't we do the same thing with Planned Parenthood?



BASH: Can you answer yes or no?



CHRISTIE: We elected a Republican Congress to do this. And they should be doing it, and they're not. And they're giving the president a pass.



FIORINA: Dana, I'd like to...



BASH: One more time. I'm sorry, I just want to get the answer.



CHRISTIE: I put it in the list, Dana. We should be doing these things and forcing the president to take action.



BASH: So you would support a shutdown.



CHRISTIE: Let's force him to do what he says he's going to do. Now I don't know whether he'll do it or not, but let's force him to do it.



FIORINA: Dana, I would like to link these two issues, both of which are incredibly important, Iran and Planned Parenthood.



One has something to do with the defense of the security of this nation. The other has something to do with the defense of the character of this nation. You have not heard a plan about Iran from any politician up here, here is my plan. On day one in the Oval Office, I will make two phone calls, the first to my good friend to Bibi Netanyahu to reassure him we will stand with the state of Israel.



The second, to the supreme leader, to tell him that unless and until he opens every military and every nuclear facility to real anytime, anywhere inspections by our people, not his, we, the United States of America, will make it as difficult as possible and move money around the global financial system.



We can do that, we don't need anyone's cooperation to do it. And every ally and every adversary we have in this world will know that the United States in America is back in the leadership business, which is how we must stand with our allies.



As regards Planned Parenthood, anyone who has watched this videotape, I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, it's heart beating, it's legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.



This is about the character of our nation, and if we will not stand up in and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Dana, I want to continue on the subject.



Governor Bush, you recently said while discussing Planned Parenthood, quote, you're "not sure we need a half billion for women's health issues." Now you've since said that you misspoke, you didn't mean to say "women's health issues."



But Donald Trump said that quote, that comment, which Hillary Clinton did seize upon immediately, will haunt you the same way Mitt Romney's 47 percent video haunted him.



Tell Donald Trump why he's wrong.



BUSH: Well, he's wrong on a lot of things, but on this he's wrong because I'm the most pro-life governor on this stage. I got to act on my core beliefs. It's part of who I am. Life is a gift from God. And from beginning end we need to respect it and err on the side of life.



And so I defunded Planned Parenthood. We created a climate where parental notification took place. We were the only state to fund crisis pregnancy centers with state moneys. We were totally focused on this. And I would bring that kind of philosophy to Washington, D.C.



So here is a solution to this. Title X of the HHS funding, there is something that was the "Reagan Rule." It was passed in 1988. And in that rule it was defined, and the courts approved this, that a Planned Parenthood, you couldn't separate the money between the actual abortion procedures, and there are 330,000 abortions that take place in this clinic, and their promotion of it.



He interpreted it the right way, the courts ruled in his favor, and Planned Parenthood did not get funding during that time until President Clinton came in.



When I'm elected president, we will restore that interpretation of Title X. And this deal will be finished.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Bush.



Donald Trump, let me just...



TRUMP: Jeb, just...



TAPPER: The quote was, "I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues." He said he misspoke. You said that that's going to haunt him. Why do you think that?



TRUMP: I think it will haunt him. I think it's a terrible. I think it's going to haunt him absolutely. He came back later and he said he misspoke. There was no question because I heard when he said the statement. I was watching and he said the statement.



And I said, wow, I can't believe it. I will take care of women. I respect women. I will take care of women.



One thing we will say and I would like to get back to the Iran situation. We're talking about Iran. The agreement was terrible. It was incompetent. I've never seen anything like it. One of the worst contracts of any kind I've ever seen.



And nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places. But certainly North Korea.



And Ted and I have spoken. We've -- a lot of us have spoken. We're talking about Iran. They are bad actors, bad things are going to happen. But in the meantime, you have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, I'm ready to use them. And we don't even mention it.



TAPPER: Governor Bush?



BUSH: There are 13,000 community-based organizations that provide health services to women, 13,000 in this country. I don't believe that Planned Parenthood should get a penny from the federal government. Those organizations should get funding, just as I increased funding when I was governor of the state.



That's the way you do this is you improve the condition for people. And, Donald, when I was governor, we also increased the opportunities for women.



Women's income grew three times faster than the national average when I was governor.



TRUMP: So why didn't you say it? Why didn't you say it?



BUSH: We improved -- we improved --



TRUMP: I know, but why did you say it? I heard it myself. Why did you say it?



BUSH: -- we increased child support -- we increased child support with a broken system by 90 percent.



TRUMP: You said you're going to cut funding for women's health. You said it.



BUSH: I have a proven record. I have a proven record.



TRUMP: You said it.



TAPPER: I want to -- we're going to get to --



WALKER: Jake, just one more moment. This is -- there's something bigger to this. Now, I -- like so many other governors here, I defunded Planned Parenthood four-and-a-half years ago, in a Blue State. But it's bigger than that. We did that in a Blue State, we took the money and put it into women's health, so we did exactly what we're talking about here.



But I think the bigger issue here is we should be able to do this nationally, and this is precisely why so many Republicans are upset with Washington. They see the House and they see the Senate and they say why can't we pass this. Why can't we defund Planned -- put it in a spending bill.



Forget about the 60-vote rule, there's no reason -- and the Constitution doesn't call for 60 votes. Pass it with 51 votes, put it on the desk of the president --



TAPPER: Thank you, Governor.



WALKER: -- and go forward and actually make a point. This is why --



TAPPER: Thank you, Governor.



WALKER: -- people are upset with Washington.



TAPPER: We're going to -- we're going to get to many of these issues. This -- we're still in the first block, believe it or not. We're going to get to many of these issues, but before we end this block, Ms. Fiorina, I do want to ask you about this.



In an interview last week in Rolling Stone magazine, Donald Trump said the following about you. Quote, "Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?" Mr. Trump later said he was talking about your persona, not your appearance. Please feel free to respond what you think about his persona.



(LAUGHTER)



FIORINA: You know, it's interesting to me, Mr. Trump said that he heard Mr. Bush very clearly and what Mr. Bush said. I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.



(APPLAUSE)



TRUMP: I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman.



TAPPER: All right. On that note, in less than two minutes -- we're going to take a very quick break. In less than two minutes, the most contentious issue on the campaign trail. And the candidates on the stage are split over how to handle it. That's coming up next.



Please give some applause to the candidates.



(APPLAUSE)



(COMMERCIAL BREAK)



TAPPER: Welcome to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate. No topic perhaps has been more combustible in this campaign than the issue of immigration.



Mr. Trump, you have called for deporting every undocumented immigrant, Governor Christie has said, quote, "There are not enough law enforcement officers -- local, county, state and federal combined -- to forcibly deport 11 to 12 million people."



Tell Governor Christie how much your plan will cost, and how you will get it done.



TRUMP: Correct. First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works. So important, and it's a big part of it.



Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside, and I think Chris knows that, maybe as well as anybody.



They go, if I get elected, first day they're gone. Gangs all over the place. Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you look.



We have a country based on laws. I will make sure that those laws are adhered to. These are illegal immigrants. I don't think you'd even be asking this question if I didn't run because when I ran, and I brought this up, my opening remarks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time. And, then they found out with the killing of Katie, from San Francisco, and so many other crimes, they found out that I was right.



And, most people, many people, apologized to me. I don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me. So, we have a country of laws, they're going to go out, and they'll come back if they deserve to come back. If they've had a bad record, if they've been arrested, if they've been in jail, they're never coming back. We're going to have a country again. Right now, we don't have a country, we don't have a border, and we're going to do something about it, and it can be done with proper management, and it can be done with heart.



TAPPER: Governor Christie, you and I have talked about this in an interview. You say that his big wall, his plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, it sounds great, but it's never going to happen.



Tell him why you're skeptical of his plans?



CHRISTIE: First of, Jake, I don't yield to anybody on how to enforce the law. I'm the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a United States Attorney after September 11th, and I know how to do this.



The fact is though that for 15,000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding, and the current number of law enforcement officers. Here's what we need to do, and I think this is where Donald is absolutely right. What we need to do is to secure our border, and we need to do it with more than just a wall.



We need to use electronics, we need to use drones, we need to use FBI, DEA, and ATF, and yes, we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa, and when they overstay their visa, we need to tap them on the shoulder, and say, "You have overstayed your welcome, you're taking advantage of the American people. It's time for you to go."



If we had that kind of system in place, we wouldn't have the 11 million people we have now.



TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Christie... TRUMP: ...By the way, I agree with -- with what Chris is saying, but, I will say this. Illegal immigration is costing us more than $200 billion dollars a year just to maintain what we have.



TAPPER: I want to bring in Dr. Carson because he too has been skeptical of your plan to immediately deport 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants. He said, quote, "People who say that have no idea what this entails."



Why do you say that, Dr. Carson?



CARSON: Well, first of all, I recognize that we have an incredible illegal immigration problem. I was down in Arizona a few weeks ago at the border. I mean, the fences that were there were not manned, and those are the kind of fences when I was a kid that would barely slow us down. So, I don't see any purpose in having that.



Now, what we need to do is look at something that actually works. Yuma County, Arizona. They stop 97 percent of the illegal immigrants through there. They put in a double fence with a road so that there was quick access by the enforcement people.



If we don't seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesn't matter. It's kind of ridiculous all the other things we talk about. We have the ability to do it, we don't have the will to do it.



There was one area where they had cut a hole in the fence, and to repair it, they put a few strands of barb wire across. Well, the photographers who were there with us, they wanted to photograph us from the side of the Mexicans, and they went through there, and they were not physically fit people, and they took their cameras and things with them, and shot us from the other side.



That's how easy it is to get across. And, the drugs, I mean, it goes on, and on, and on. ICE tells them to release these people, 67,000 criminals released...



TAPPER: ...Dr. Carson...



CARSON: ...on to our property, it's ridiculous.



TAPPER: With all due respect, you said about Donald Trump's plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, "People who say that have no idea what this entails."



Why not?



CARSON: Well, I have also said, if anybody knows how to do that, that I would be willing to listen. And, if they can, you know, specify exactly how that's going to be done, and what the cost, and it sounds reasonable, then I think it's worth discussing...



TRUMP(?): ...(INAUDIBLE)...



TAPPER: ...let's continue the conversation about illegal immigration with Dana Bash.



BASH: Governor Bush, Mr. Trump has suggested that your views on immigration are influenced by your Mexican born wife. He said that, quote, "If my wife were from Mexico, I think I would have a soft spot for people from Mexico." Did Mr. Trump go to far in invoking your wife?



BUSH: He did, he did. You're proud of your family, just as I am.



TRUMP: Correct.



BUSH: To subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate, and I hope you apologize for that, Donald.



TRUMP: Well, I have to tell you, I hear phenomenal things. I hear your wife is a lovely woman...



BUSH: She is. She's fantastic.



TRUMP: I don't know her, and this is a total mischaracterization...



BUSH: She is absolutely the love of my life, and she's right here...



TRUMP: Good.



BUSH: And why don't you apologize to her right now.



TRUMP: No, I won't do that, because I've said nothing wrong.



BUSH: Yeah.



TRUMP: But I do hear she's a lovely woman.



BUSH: So, here's the deal. My wife is a Mexican-American. She's an American by choice.



She loves this country as much as anybody in this room, and she wants a secure border. But she wants to embrace the traditional American values that make us special and make us unique.



We're at a crossroads right now. Are we going to take the Reagan approach, the hopeful optimistic approach, the approach that says that, you come to our country legally, you pursue your dreams with a vengeance, you create opportunities for all of us?



Or the Donald Trump approach? The approach that says that everything is bad, that everything is coming to an end. I...



BASH: Mr. Trump?



TRUMP: Jeb said...



BUSH: I'm on the Reagan side of this.



TRUMP: ... that they come into our country as an act of love. With all of the problems we that we have, in so many instances -- we have wonderful people coming in. But with all of the problems -- this is not an act of love. He's weak on immigration -- by the way, in favor of Common Core, which is also a disaster, but weak on immigration.



He doesn't get my vote.



BASH: Mr. Trump...



FIORINA: Dana, with all being said to Mr. Trump...



BASH: Go ahead.



FIORINA: Immigration did not come up in 2016 because Mr. Trump brought it up. We talked about it in 2012, we talked about it in 2008. We talked about it in 2004.



TRUMP: Not with this intensity.



FIORINA: We have been talking about it for 25 years. This is why people are tired of politicians.



BASH: Ms. Fiorina -- Ms. Fiorina, we're going to come to you, we're going to come to you.



I just want to give Governor Bush a chance to respond to what Mr. Trump said. BUSH: Look, first of all, I wrote a book about this, three -- four years ago, now. And I laid out a comprehensive, conservative approach for immigration reform.



And it does require securing the border. No one disagrees with that. But to build a wall, and to deport people -- half a million a month -- would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, Donald. Hundreds of billions of dollars. It would destroy community life, it would tear families apart.



And it would send a signal to the rest of the world that the United States values that are so important for our long-term success no longer matter in this country.



(APPLAUSE)



TRUMP: As I said, we are spending $200 billion -- we are spending $200 billion a year on maintaining what we have. We will move them out. The great ones will come back, the good ones will come back.



They'll be expedited, they'll be back, they'll come back legally. We'll have a country -- they'll come back, legally.



BASH: OK, on that note, you have criticized Governor Bush for speaking Spanish on the campaign trail. You said, quote, "He should really set an example by speaking English in the United States."



What's wrong with speaking Spanish?



TRUMP: Well, I think it's wonderful and all, but I did it a little bit half-heartedly, but I do mean it to a large extent.



We have a country, where, to assimilate, you have to speak English. And I think that where he was, and the way it came out didn't sound right to me. We have to have assimilation -- to have a country, we have to have assimilation.



I'm not the first one to say this, Dana. We've had many people over the years, for many, many years, saying the same thing. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.



(APPLAUSE)



BUSH: Well, I've been speaking English here tonight, and I'll keep speaking English.



But the simple fact is, if a high school kid asks me a question in Spanish, a school -- by the way, a voucher program that was created under my watch, the largest voucher program in the country, where kids can go to a Christian school, and they ask me a question in Spanish, I'm going to show respect and answer that question in Spanish.



Even though they do speak English, and even though they embrace American values.



(APPLAUSE)



TRUMP: This is a reporter, not a high school kid.



RUBIO: Ms. Dana, I agree that English is the unifying language of our country, and everyone should learn to speak it. It's important.



I want to tell you a story about someone that didn't speak English that well. It was my grandfather; he came to this country in the 1960s, as a -- escaping Cuba. And he lived with us, growing up.



And my grandfather loved America. He understood what was so special about this country. He loved Ronald Reagan; he would be very proud of the fact that we're here this evening.



My grandfather instilled in me the belief that I was blessed to live in the one society in all of human history where even I, the son of a bartender and a maid, could aspire to have anything, and be anything that I was willing to work hard to achieve.



But he taught me that in Spanish, because it was the language he was most comfortable in. And he became a conservative, even though he got his news in Spanish.



And so, I do give interviews in Spanish, and here's why -- because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility.



And if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me. Not from a translator at Univision.



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator Rubio. (APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Senator Cruz -- Senator Cruz, this week, we learned more about Dr. Carson's plan for the 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country.



Dr. Carson proposed giving these undocumented immigrants a six- month grace period to pay back taxes then to let them become guest workers and only to deport people who failed to do that.



CARSON: Not exactly what I said.



TAPPER: Well, how would you say it, sir? I was just reading the Wall Street Journal quote, but please tell us.



CARSON: Well, what I said, after we seal the borders, after we turn off the spigot that dispenses all the goodies so we don't have people coming in here, including employment, that people who had a pristine record, we should consider allowing them to become guest workers, primarily in the agricultural sphere, because that's the place where Americans don't seem to want to work.



That's what I said. And they have a six-month period to do that. If they don't do it within that time period, then they become illegal, and as illegals, they will be treated as such.



TAPPER: OK, from the horse's mouth, Senator Cruz, does that fit your definition of amnesty?



CRUZ: Well, Jake, you know, I'm -- I'm very glad that Donald Trump's being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration. I think that's very important.



I like and respect Ben Carson. I'll let him talk about his own plans.



But I will say this: The natural next question that primary voters are asking, after we focus on illegal immigration is, okay, what are the records of the various candidates? And this is an issue on which there are stark differences.



A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and, in fact, who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan.



In 2013, when Barack Obama and Harry Reid joined the Washington Republicans in a massive, I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions helping lead the fight.



You know, folks here have talked about, how do you secure the borders? Well, I've been leading the fight in the Senate to triple the Border Patrol, to put in place fencings and walls, to put in place a strong biometric exit/entry system...



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.



Senator Rubio...



CARSON: Can I -- can I -- can I just...



TAPPER: ... I'm not sure...



CARSON: Can I correct...



TAPPER: We'll come back to you -- we'll come back to you in one second, sir.



But Senator Rubio, I'm not sure exactly whose plan he's -- he's saying is -- constitutes amnesty, but I know he has said it about your plan in the past, so I want to give you a chance to respond, then, Dr. Carson, we'll come to you.



CARSON: OK.



RUBIO: Well, let me say that legal immigration is not an issue I read about in the newspaper. Immigration, illegal immigration, all the good aspects of immigration and all the negative ones as well, I live with. My family's immigrants. My neighbors are all immigrants. My in-laws are all immigrants.



So I've seen every aspect of it, and I can tell you America doesn't have one immigration problem, it has three.



First, despite the fact that we are the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally.



Second, we have a legal immigration system that no longer works. It primary is built on the basis of whether you have a relative living here instead of merit.



And third, we have 11 million or 12 million people, many of whom have been here for longer than a decade who are already here illegally.



And we must deal with all three of these problems. We cannot deal with all three of these problems in one massive piece of legislation. I learned that. We tried it that way.



Here's the way forward: First, we must -- we must secure our border, the physical border, with -- with a wall, absolutely. But we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system. 40 percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa. We also need a mandatory e-verify system.



After we've done that, step two would be to modernize our legal immigration system so you come to America on the basis of what you can contribute economically, not whether or not simply you have a relative living here.



And after we've done those two things, I believe the American people...



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. RUBIO: ... will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone who's been here and isn't a criminal. If you're a criminal, obviously, you will not be able to stay.



TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.



Senator -- Dr. Carson...



(APPLAUSE)



... I want to give you 30 seconds. I'd like you to answer the question.



Senator Cruz describes plans such as yours as amnesty. Why is your plan not amnesty?



CARSON: My plan is not amnesty for a number of reasons.



Number one, you know, I've talked to farmers, and they said they cannot hire Americans to do the kind of job that I'm talking about.



And the second reason is because the individuals who register as guest workers, they don't get to vote, they are not American citizens, and they don't get the rights and privileges of American citizens. So that's key.



But the other thing that I want to bring up is, I mentioned something earlier. I think it was just sort of glossed over.



I talked about the success in Yuma County, I mean, incredible success, and the Department of Justice said, "No, we don't want to do that. That's too successful."



We don't have to keep reinventing the wheel. All we have to do is look at things that work. All we have to do is use a little common sense.



TAPPER: Thank you, Dr. Carson. I want to talk about the issue of birthright citizenship, which -- which has emerged since the first debate as -- as an a -- a major issue in this campaign.



Mr. Trump, you say that babies born in the United States to undocumented immigrants should not any longer get automatic American citizenship. Ms. Fiorina says that you are pandering on this issue and acting like the politicians that you rail against. What's your message to Ms. Fiorina on birthright citizenship?



TRUMP: Well, first of all, the -- the 14th Amendment says very, very clearly to a lot of great legal scholars -- not television scholars, but legal scholars -- that it is wrong. It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesn't even need that.



A woman gets pregnant. She's nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don't think so.



And by the way, Mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn't have that. We're the only ones dumb enough, stupid enough to have it. And people -- and by the way, this is not just with respect to Mexico. They are coming from Asia to have babies here, and all of a sudden, we have to take care of the babies for the life of the baby.



The 14th Amendment, it reads properly, you can go and -- it's probably going to be have to be check -- go through a process of court, probably ends up at the Supreme Court, but there are a lot of great legal scholars that say that is not correct.



And in my opinion, it makes absolutely no -- we're the only -- one of the only countries, we're going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years? I don't think so.



TAPPER: Ms. Fiorina, the vast majority of countries do not have birthright citizenship...



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: ...Donald Trump is right about that. Why is it pandering when he's -- he says this?



FIORINA: First let me say, We have just spent a good bit of time discussing, as Republicans, how to solve this problem. I would ask your audience at home to ask a very basic question. Why have Democrats not solved this problem?



President Obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on solving the immigration problem. He entered Washington with majorities in the House and the Senate. He could have chosen to do anything to solve this pro -- this problem. Instead, he chose to do nothing.



Why? because the Democrats don't want this issue solved.



TAPPER: Ms. Fiorina...



FIORINA: They want it to be an issue that they can use. As to birthright citizenship...



TAPPER: Please.



FIORINA: ...the truth is, you can't just wave your hands and say "the 14th Amendment is gonna go away." It will take an extremely arduous vote in Congress, followed by two-thirds of the states, and if that doesn't work to amend the Constitution, then it is a long, arduous process in court.



And meanwhile, what will continue to go on is what has gone on for 25 years. With all due respect, Mr. Trump, we've been talking about illegal immigration for 25 years. San Francisco has been a sanctuary city since 1989. There are 300 of them.



And meanwhile, what has happened? Nothing. The border remains insecure. The legal immigration system remains broken. Look, we know what it takes to secure a border. We've heard a lot of great ideas here. Money, manpower, technology... TAPPER : Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.



FIORINA: ...mostly, apparently, leadership...



TAPPER: Thank you.



FIORINA: ...the kind of leadership that understands how to get results.



TAPPER: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond...



TRUMP: I agree 100 percent, by the way, with Carly on the fact that the Democrats do not want to solve this problem, for the obvious reasons, but they do not.



But I believe that a reading of the 14th Amendment allows you to have an interpretation where this is not legal and where it can't be done. I've seen both sides, but some of the greatest scholars agree with me, without having to go through Congress.



If you do go through Congress, you can absolutely solve the problem. TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Paul...



FIORINA: But you -- you would stipulate, Mr. Trump, but not everyone agrees with you.



TRUMP: That's true, sure.



FIORINA: OK.



TAPPER: Senator Paul, I want to bring you in. Where -- where do you stand on the issue of birthright citizenship?



PAUL: Well, I hate to say it, but Donald Trump has a bit of a point here.



The case that was decided around 1900 was, people had a green card, were here legally, and they said that their children were citizens. There's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens.



So it hasn't really been completely adjudicated. The 14th Amendment says that "those who are here and under the jurisdiction." The original author of the -- of the 14th Amendment said on the Senate floor that this was applying to slaves, and did not specifically apply to others.



TAPPER: All right. Senator Paul, thank you so much. Let's turn to a new topic. We've received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs. We have two CEOs on stage right now.



Ms. Fiorina, you were CEO of Hewlett Packard. Donald Trump says you, quote, "ran HP into the ground," you laid off tens of thousands of people, you got viciously fired.



For voters looking to somebody with private-sector experience to create American jobs, why should they pick you and not Donald Trump?



FIORINA: I led Hewlett Packard through a very difficult time, the worst technology recession in 25 years. The NASDAQ stock index fell 80 percent. It took 15 years for the stock index to recover. We had very strong competitors who literally went out of business and lost all of their jobs in the process.



Despite those difficult times, we doubled the size of the company, we quadrupled its topline growth rate, we quadrupled its cash flow, we tripled its rate of innovation.



Yes, we had to make tough choices, and in doing so, we saved 80,000 jobs, went on to grow to 160,000 jobs. And now Hewlett Packard is almost 300,000 jobs. We went from lagging behind to leading in every product category and every market segment.



We must lead in this nation again, and some tough calls are going to be required. But as for the firing, I have been very honest about this from the day it happened. When you challenge the status quo, you make enemies. I made a few. Steve Jobs told me that when he called me the day I was fired to say, hey, been there, done that twice.



It's also true that the man that led my firing, Tom Perkins, just took --



TAPPER: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.



FIORINA: -- out a full-page ad in the New York Times to say he was wrong, I was right. I was a terrific CEO, the board was dysfunctional. And he thinks I will make a magnificent president of the United States.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina. TRUMP: Well --



TAPPER: Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump, why would you be better at creating jobs than Carly Fiorina?



TRUMP: -- let me -- well, let me just explain. The head of the Yale Business School, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, wrote a paper recently, one of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen, ranked one of the top 20 in the history of business. The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster. They still haven't recovered. In fact, today, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, they fired another 25 or 30,000 people saying we still haven't recovered from the catastrophe.



When Carly says the revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq, it was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company.



Now one other company before that was Lucent. Carly was at Lucent before that. And Lucent turned out to be a catastrophe also. So I only say this. She can't run any of my companies. That I can tell you.



TAPPER: Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you a chance to respond.



FIORINA: You know, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is a well-known Clintonite and honestly had it out for me from the moment that I arrived at Hewlett Packard. But honestly, Mr. Trump, I find it quite rich that you would talk about this.



You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money. That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once --



TRUMP: I never filed for bankruptcy.



FIORINA: -- not twice, four times, a record four times. Why should we trust you to manage the finances --



TRUMP: I'll tell you why; it's very simple.



FIORINA: -- of this nation any differently than you managed the finances --



TRUMP: I'll tell you. I was running --



FIORINA: -- of your casinos?



TRUMP: -- Carly, Carly --



TAPPER: Mr. Trump.



TRUMP: -- I've made over $10 billion. I had a casino company -- Caesars just filed for bankruptcy. Chris will tell you -- it's not Chris' fault either -- but almost everybody in Atlantic City is either in trouble or filed for -- maybe I'll blame Chris.



FIORINA: Well --



TRUMP: But Atlantic City is a disaster --



FIORINA: Well, Mr. Trump --



TRUMP: Wait a minute, Carly. Wait. I let you speak. Atlantic City is a disaster, and I did great in Atlantic City. I knew when to get out. My timing was great. And I got a lot of credit for it.



Many of the great business people that you know -- and Carl Icon (ph) is going to work with me on making great deals for this country. But whether it's Carl or so many others that we read about all the time --



TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.



TRUMP: -- they have used the laws of the land, which is the --



(CROSSTALK)



TAPPER: Governor Christie's name has been invoked. I'd like to give him a 30 second opportunity.



CHRISTIE: Jake listen. While I'm as entertained as anyone by this personal back-and-forth about the history of Donald and Carly's career, for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesn't have a job, who can't fund his child's education, I've got to tell you the truth. They could care less about your careers, they care about theirs.



(APPLAUSE)



Let's start talking about that on this stage and stop playing -- and stop playing the games. Stop playing --



KASICH: There's a --



CHRISTIE: John -- I'm not done yet, John.



FIORINA: A track record of leadership is not a game. It is the issue in this election.



CHRISTIE: Stop -- and stop playing -- and Carly -- Carly, listen. You can interrupt everybody else on this stage, you're not going to interrupt me, OK?



The fact is that we don't want to hear about your careers, back and forth and volleying back and forth about who did well and who did poorly. You're both successful people. Congratulations. You know who's not successful? The middle class in this country who's getting plowed over by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Let's start talking about those issues tonight and stop this childish back-and-forth between the two of you.



(APPLAUSE)



TAPPER: Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you



KASICH: Jake --



TAPPER: Governor Kasich, I'm coming to you next, but Ms. Fiorina's name was mentioned, and I have to give her the opportunity to respond if she wants it.



FIORINA: Well, I thought we had been hearing quite a bit about Govenor Christie's record as governor, actually. I think track records are very important. I completely agree that what's at stake here is the future of this nation, and the future of every American.



But I do think that a track record of leadership is vital because in the end this election is about leadership. And let's talk about what leadership is. It's not about braggadocio, it is about challenging the status quo, solving problems, producing results.



And the highest calling of leadership is to unlock potential in others.



TAPPER: Thank you. FIORINA: Problems have festered in Washington for too long. And the potential of this nation is being crushed.



TAPPER: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.



Governor Kasich, I want to come -- I'm coming to you. I'm coming to you. Let me ask the question. You can use the time however you want.



KASICH: OK, Jake.



TAPPER: Donald Trump says that the hedge fund guys are getting away with murder by paying a lower tax rate. He wants to raise the taxes of hedge fund managers, as does Governor Bush. Do you agree?



KASICH: I don't at this point in terms of changing the incentives for investment and risk-taking.



But let's just stop for a second. There's one person on this stage that does have a record. I'm the only person on the stage and one of the few people in this country that led the effort as the chief architect of the last time we balanced the federal budget.



We also cut taxes. And when I left Washington in 2000, we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming. I had spent 10 years of my life to get us to that point, went out in the private sector, was a great experience, and went into Ohio and took an $8 billion hole and turned it into a $2 billion surplus.



We've had the largest amount of tax cuts of any sitting governor. We've grown well over 300,000 jobs. You see, I've done it in both places. I'm the only one here that has done it in both places.



It took a lot to get us to a balanced budget. It was legitimate. It was real. And we negotiated it. A lot of what we're talking about here tonight as we take this position and that position, you know what? At the end of the day, America has got to work.



We've got to figure out how we come together to deal with this -- with our fiscal problems because when we deal with that, we create a stronger economy for everybody. People have a chance to rise.



So, you know, when we think about how we make a choice, it's the person that lands that plane. It's not somebody that talks about it. It's about the person who has done it. And I've done it in...



TAPPER: Thank you, Governor.



KASICH: ... both places. And I did it including people in the other party. And that's how we were successful.



TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich.



KASICH: And that's how I will be president, using that experience to drive this country forward. Thank you.



(APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Huckabee, I want to bring you in on the question of



hedge fund managers and taxing them. You have said that you are bothered by the fact that hedge fund managers pay such a low tax rate and make 2,500 times what people who work for them make.



Do you agree with what Donald Trump and Governor Bush have proposed, raising their tax rates?



HUCKABEE: I have a different idea. I think we ought to get rid of all the taxes on people who produce. Why should we penalize productivity? And it's why I'm an unabashed supporter of the "fair tax," which would be a tax on our consumption, rather than a tax on our productivity.



In other words, you're not going to tax anybody for what they earn, whether it's w
