Home of the Affordable Housing Programme

Allocation of houses to qualified applicants would start as soon as the construction of the affordable houses begins. The (allocation) process for the available houses would be done in a regular, fair and transparent system free of any human intervention and contact.

The initial eligibility for allocation will depend on several factors such as when you registered, family status as well as demand across the housing categories.

Those who do not get an allocation in the initial allocation are then put on a waiting list to ensure that they get priority in subsequent allocations.
