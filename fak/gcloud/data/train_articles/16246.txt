Folks:

U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said today: “One third of all federal prisoners today are illegal immigrants.”

Is this so? Any wrinkles/caveats?

I remember from the other day this bureau chart, which seems to show that about 22 percent of prisoners are citizens of other countries.

Is this the latest and most detailed data on prisoner citizenship?

What share of (and how many) federal prisoners are illegal immigrants?

Any other relevant data?

I am trying to isolate accurate information today.

The chart you reference on the Bureau of Prisons' website (found here https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_citizenship.jsp) is up to date. 22% of the Bureau's inmates are non-US citizens. The Bureau of Prisons does not track the total number of illegal immigrants.

Thanks,

A follow-up query: What is the latest available data on the total number of individuals incarcerated in federal prisons throughout the year and the total number of aliens incarcerated throughout the year?

Subject: Re: Texas reporter

To clarify, are you asking for the total number of individuals who came into BOP custody at any point in time during CY 2016 (as opposed to the total number at any one point in time)? And the same for non-citizens?

I will ask our subject matter experts if that is something we track.

I think so. I am trying to assess if at different times the prison population had more or less than the 22 percent noncitizen population tallied at the one point in time.
