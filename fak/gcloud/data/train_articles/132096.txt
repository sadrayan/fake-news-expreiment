Online 'Killer Bug' Warning Revealed As Hoax
A warning message about a “new killer insect” that spreads a deadly skin-disfiguring virus infection through skin contact has gone viral online. But the warning, which has been circulated widely online, causing panic among susceptible social media users, is a hoax, according to The Inquisitr.

The hoax warning, accompanied by alarming images, the stuff of a hypochondriac’s nightmares, has emerged on social media this month.

The purveyors of the online hoax display a photo of an insect, with a warning to viewers to never touch any creepy-crawly that looks remotely like the insect because touching it or attempting to kill it with bare hands infects with a deadly virus that spreads to the rest of the body in a matter of minutes.

“If you ever see this insect, please don’t try to kill it with your bare hands or touch it, this insect spreads virus to the place of bodily contact and circulates the entire human system in minutes, it was first sighted in India.” – Online message

The insect in the photo has been identified as a giant water bug, a large insect found mostly in North America, South American, Northern Australia and East Asia in freshwater environments. The bugs are not known to transmit any viruses to humans.

The accompanying image of a diseased hand was created with makeup, according to a YouTube video.
