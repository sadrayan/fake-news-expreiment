Nigeria Certificate In Education NCE
Objectives of the N.C.E. (DLS) Programmes

The National Policy on Education prescribes that the NCE Certificate shall be the minimum qualification for all teachers in our schools.

However, in spite of the efforts of several states aimed at producing enough qualified teachers to meet the target requirement of the policy, Nigeria is yet to adequately address the problem of the shortage of qualified teachers.

The NCE by Distant Learning (DLS) has therefore come to serve as one of the most cost-effective and time tested strategies with a high rate of success for over-coming this problem nation-wide.
