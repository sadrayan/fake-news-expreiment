Cabbage Patch Kids
Hand-stitched Original

Cabbage Patch Kids

Each one is an individual hand-stitched work of soft-sculpture delivered by local artists. They are carefully "born" in our Cleveland, Georgia Cabbage Patch. No two Originals are ever exactly alike. Adoption fees begin at $225.00. Birth Certificates and Adoption Papers are included and you will have the opportunity to change the name and birthdate of your Cabbage Patch Kid. Display boxes are not included.
