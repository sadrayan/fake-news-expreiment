President Barack Obama Endorses Charlie Crist for Congress
Do you have Charlie’s back, too? Chip in something today.

“I’m humbled and honored that President Obama, one of the greatest leaders in our nation’s history, has my back,” said Governor Charlie Crist. “Outside of the voters of Pinellas County, no endorsement means more to me. He’s done so much for our beautiful Florida – guiding us out of the recession, working for greater equality, opportunity, and prosperity. He’s a great friend.”

As Governor of Florida, instead of playing politics, Charlie Crist helped save thousands of jobs and led the state out of the great recession by cutting taxes, supporting President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus package, and reining in wasteful spending. Crist enraged partisan Republicans by acknowledging the dangers of climate change, extending voting hours during the 2008 historic election of Barack Obama, and vetoing anti-choice legislation.

Crist also guided our state and beach communities through the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, vetoed new burdensome teacher legislation, and restored automatic restoration of civil rights for non-violent ex-felons.

In 2014, Florida Democrats nominated Charlie Crist to be Governor again. During that campaign, Crist was the first major party nominee in Florida history to campaign on legalizing same-sex marriage, and was one of the only high-profile candidates in the country to give a full-throated defense of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.

At the urging of friends, family, and neighbors, Governor Crist announced late last year he would run to represent the new Florida Congressional District 13.
