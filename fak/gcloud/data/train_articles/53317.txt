in the region (after Uruguay and Argentina) on this

variable and yet, only about 4% of the population is

illiterate and it is very di fficult to reduce this level,

particularly in single year s. For the year 1985 the

HDI rating for Cuba was 96% later reduced to

92.4%; based on the first figure there was stagnation

by 1998 (96.4%) but based on the second figure

there was an increase (deterioration) of 4 percentage

points. Since 1990 (94%) there was constant growth

in this variable, but the increase in 1995-1997 was

only two tenths of a percentage point: from 95.7% to

95.9% (UNDP 1990-1999), which does not seem to

explain Cuba’s great leap forward in 1997. The

HDRO (2002) repeated the first argument summa-

rized on the life expectancy indicator but, once again,

did not address the major point: the minute increase

in literacy in 1995-1997 could not explain the jump

of Cuba in the HDI in 1997. (The comparison be-

years; UNDP 1999: 165).

The second variable of the education indicator is the

percentage of school-age population enrolled in the

three educational levels (see first three columns of

Table 2). In Cuba, elementary instruction was al-

ready available to the whole population since the end

of the 1960s and, based on official data the gross en-

rollment rate was 100% in 1989. 6 Since 1990 -1991,

however, that rate began to decrease and was 99.3%

in 1992 and 99.1% in 1999 (ONE 1998, 2000). Ac-

cording to UNESCO (2001), Cuba reached the

highest percentage of coverage at the secondary level

i n 1 9 8 9 w i t h 9 0 . 2 % , t h e n d e c r e a s e d t o 7 4 . 5 % i n

1994 and increased to 80% in 1996-1997, still 10

percentage points below the 1989 level. 7 Enrollment

in higher education dropped 56% in 1989-1999

(CEE 1991, ONE 2000); the gross rate was 20.5%

in 1989 (21.8% in 1987; UNESCO 2001) and de-

clined to 12.4% in 1996-1997 (this continuing de-

cline is acknowledged by CIEM 2000). Given that

primary and higher education gross enrollment rates

fell almost without interruption in 1989-1997, and

that the rate of secondary education in 1997 was well

below the 1989 level, the combined rate of the three

levels must have fallen in that period.

Unfortunately, the HDI does not have a consistent

series on the three combined educational levels for

1989-1999: in the first three years it used average

years of schooling, but since 1992 it shifted to the

school enrollment rate and the two cannot be con-

nected. 8 The last column of Table 2 shows the de-

cline of the combined gross enrollment rate for the

three levels of education in 1992-1994, estimated by

6. In fact, in 1970-1985 the pe rcentage exceeded 100% since there was not a pe rfect matching between enrollment and school-age

population at the primary level (UNESCO 2001).

7. A study of the HDI done in Cuba acknowle dges that “the secondary level is the most problematic of the Cuban educational syste m”

and there was “a slight decline in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 years, bu t recovered in the following two years” (CIEM 2000: 82; aut hor’s

translation). However, the 1989 level had not been recovered by 1997.

rates separately but the combined rate of the three levels. The study of the HDI do ne in C uba doe s n ot o f fer separate series of those
