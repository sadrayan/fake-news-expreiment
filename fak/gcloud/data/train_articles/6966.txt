Madison School Board finalizes budget, OKs 1.75% property tax hike : Wsj
The Madison School Board finalized its 2012-13 budget Monday, unanimously approving the maximum amount of property taxes allowed by the state.

Total property taxes will increase 1.75 percent, or by $8 on an average Madison home.

This year a $15 million increase in state aid, resulting primarily from the school district's new 4-year-old kindergarten program adding about 2,000 students, made it possible for the board to tax the maximum amount, while keeping the property tax increase among the smallest in the past decade.

The School Board hasn't raised the maximum amount of property taxes under state-imposed limits in the past three years as it experienced significant reductions in state aid.

In 2010, the board increased total taxes 4.6 percent or about $170 on an average home, though it could have raised taxes nearly 9 percent.

Last year the board reduced total taxes 0.3 percent or about $3 on an average home, but could have increased taxes 4 percent.

This year the board could have reduced property taxes again, but agreed to use its $8.3 million in untapped taxing authority on district recommendations for one-time technology upgrades and curriculum materials, and additional staff and programming as part of its plan to raise minority and low-income student achievement.

School Board President James Howard said by taxing the maximum amount this year, when the total increase is still less than inflation, the board prevents larger increases in future years should state aid decline again.

"Any time you can keep it below the accepted rate of inflation should be looked at as a success," Howard said.
