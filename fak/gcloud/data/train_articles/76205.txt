Are they worth it?
In a new paper the Economic Policy Institute, a think-tank, calculates that chief executives at America's 350 biggest companies were paid 231 times as much as the average private-sector worker in 2011. This ratio, which includes the value of share options, has begun to rise again after falling during the recession (see chart). This disparity matters more in bad times when the average Joe is feeling the pinch. Wages in America have been flat for years while CEO pay has risen substantially, sometimes with little relation to company performance. Disgruntled shareholders are making their displeasure known. This week the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, a big investor in Sprint Nextel, said it would vote against the re-election of boss Daniel Hesse to the board (plus five other senior executives) at this month's annual meeting in protest at compensation packages and underperformance. (This despite Mr Hesse's announcement that he will sacrifice a $3.25m chunk of his package.) In Britain, shareholders are also in fighting form. On May 8th the head of Aviva, a big insurer, stepped down after more than half of investors voted down proposed executive pay packages. It is the third such resignation in what is already being dubbed the 'shareholder spring'.
