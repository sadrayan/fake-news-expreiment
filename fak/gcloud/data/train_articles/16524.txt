Subject: Queries for a PolitiFact Texas fact-check

As mentioned, I write on behalf of the Austin newspaper and the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project because we’re reviewing the accuracy of a claim by U.S. Senate hopeful Beto O’Rourke, who said in Waco recently (about the 14-minute mark here) that “PTA meetings are now being conducted to help parents tell their kids” that if a guy with an AR-15 walks into their classroom, “you are supposed to create as much chaos as you possibly can. They want you to scream and yell and dance around and throw books and just keep moving.”

An O’Rourke campaign spokesman, Chris Evans, told us that O’Rourke was relying on a Redmond, Washington resident’s statement on Facebook. Evans further told us this direction to parents comes from ALICE, a training system by the ALICE Training Institute that stands for “Alert Lockdown Inform Counter Evaluate.” During the training segment, Evans wrote, police officers explain that children should confront the shooter if need be and act aggressively.

My queries:

In the Lake Washington district, are PTA meetings being conducted to help parents tell their children to react in the described ways?

Lake Washington School District has worked with our local law enforcement to train our staff, students and parents on ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate). We work with our local law enforcement agencies (we are part of four police jurisdictions) to offer ALICE trainings for parents, so they can better understand what ALICE is and how its principles can help increase odds of survival and minimize the loss of life in the event of an aggressive intruder.

Are there child trainings like this being offered?

We have drills around ALICE, but depending on the age level of the kids, we modify the lessons to be reasonable. For example, young students (like kindergarteners), do “listening drills.” These drills ask them to listen to the instructions of their teacher for a set period of time. This is a principle that would be important in the event of a true active shooter situation.

If so, to what degree (every elementary school or what)?

Our schools run drills every month, at every school (elementary through high school). The types of drills vary by month (i.e., one month it could be a fire drill, another month an earthquake drill, etc.) At least once per year our staff do an ALICE table-top exercise that allows them to talk through an active shooter situation and determine what actions to take.

If not, does this clam have any element of truth?

We do use ALICE principles, and we do train our parents on how ALICE will be utilized in the schools. Some of these claims can be attributed to the “Counter” portion of ALICE, but these elements are not taught in the manner characterized in this video clip.

Any other factual points to consider?

The ALICE Program provides students and staff with a “toolbox” of appropriate responses to an active shooter situation. They are not followed in order, (i.e., you don’t first Alert then Lockdown, then Inform, etc.). Staff members are asked to use their best judgement on which of the tools will best suit their current situation.

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

I hope to complete our story this week. I’d be happy to hear back soon by phone or email.

Thanks,

You wrote that “these elements are not taught in the manner characterized in this video clip.”

What’s not taught in what manner? What exactly is the candidate not getting right, factually speaking?

Thanks again,

What I meant by my comment, “these elements are not taught in the manner characterized in this video clip,” is that the candidate is focusing only on one aspect of ALICE – the counter portion.

It is important to note that the age level of the child dictates what they are asked to do as they drill for ALICE. At the elementary level, students are usually taught that the ALICE principles are for when an “unsafe person” is in the building. We don’t specifically mention the weapon they may be carrying. Students are told to listen to their teacher and follow what the teacher asks them to do – lockdown, counter, evacuate, etc.

I would highly recommend that you reach out to someone at ALICE Training Institute to get their comment as well.

As far as a PTSA contact, I would recommend that you connect with Liz Hedreen, she is the President of the Lake Washington PTSA Council. Her email address is: president@lwptsa.net.
