Form 10-K

The federal securities laws require public companies to disclose information on an ongoing basis. For example, domestic companies must submit annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K for a number of specified events and must comply with a variety of other disclosure requirements.

The annual report on Form 10-K provides a comprehensive overview of the company's business and financial condition and includes audited financial statements. Although similarly named, the annual report on Form 10-K is distinct from the “annual report to shareholders,” which a company must send to its shareholders when it holds an annual meeting to elect directors.

Following are the deadlines for companies to file Forms 10-K and 10-Q:

Category of Filer (public float) Revised Deadlines For Filing Periodic Reports Form 10-K Deadline Form 10-Q Deadline Large Accelerated Filer

($75MM or more and less than $700MM) 75 days 40 days Non-accelerated Filer

(less than $75MM) 90 days 45 days
