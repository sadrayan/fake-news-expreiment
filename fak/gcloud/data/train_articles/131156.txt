More disclaimers (not to be confused with “disk climbers” which is a sort of Silicon Valley prostitute)

SADFLAG.com is backed by billions of dollars from shadow governments and secretive billionaires with hard to pronounce names and faces that look like they have been (or should be) poisoned.

Unfortunately they refuse to pay for our web hosting. For that we pimp products and services and get paid when you buy something or follow a link somewhere.

When we’re trying to exploit your laughter we’ll tell you.

Those were long sentences. You must be parched.
