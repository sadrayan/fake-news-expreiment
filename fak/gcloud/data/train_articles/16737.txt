Folks:

I write seeking the senator’s factual backup for a fact-check of this claim: “In 2010, 48,000 felons and fugitives lied and illegally tried to purchase guns.” The Obama administration “prosecuted only 44 of them.”

On this TRAC post from 2013, the number “44” appears in connection with a particular federal statute. I don’t yet see corroboration from a federal source.

?

Thanks,

g.

Any errors in that fact-check?

Where did the senator get his figure at that time?
