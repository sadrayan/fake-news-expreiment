Erie Canal Online
U ntil the American colonies declared independence in 1776, European settlement of the New World was largely confined to the eastern seaboard. The Appalachian Mountains were a formidable obstacle to westward movement.

Only the Mohawk River Valley in New York offered both a land and a water passage through the mountains.

By 1817, plans for a man-made waterway fed by the Mohawk River and bypassing its waterfalls and rapids had been made. This plan created the Erie Canal which connected Albany and the Hudson River in the east with Buffalo and the Great Lakes in the west. When completed in 1825, the Erie Canal traversed New York. It turned New York Harbor into America's number one port, and it shaped the social and economic development of the nation. Shipping costs dropped dramatically, immigrants to America, in search of new lands and new opportunities in the west, crowded canal boats. Cities and industries along the canal developed and flourished. The Erie Canal brought prosperity to Syracuse and to America.

These Web pages will help you travel back in time with a teen-age girl as she takes a trip on the canal from Amsterdam to Syracuse. Along the way, you'll learn more about the history of the Erie Canal. And you'll learn about Syracuse's Erie Canal Museum, which is housed in the 1850 National Register Landmark Weighlock Building. The Weighlock Building is the only remaining structure of its kind in the world, originally designed to weigh canal boats and collect tolls.

And you can also follow along on a modern adventure as two writers from The Syracuse Newspapers take a two-week canoe trip on the length of the canal during the summer of 1996. A Canal Timeline Hear the Erie Canal Song Back one page | Erie Canal Home
