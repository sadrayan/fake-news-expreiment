Good Hair Gone Bad Quickie: Gary Dourdan and Brother
So what if I had a crush on Gary Dourdan when he played Shazza on A Different World? And so what further if I still kind of have a crush on him when I see him on CSI? Heâ€™s from Philly and I like a little green-eyed cuteness every once in a while. But howabout the report that his brother Demitris Hirsch was arrested yesterday in Lafayette, LA on charges of aggravated battery with a dangerous weapon? Yipes. Just look at these two. This goes to show how thin a line good hair must walk. And just because I like it, one of my favorite Shazza scenes! Work it, Kim.
