PPIC Statewide Survey: Californians and Their Government (PPIC Publication)
Some findings of the current survey:

Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by a wide margin in California, and half of likely voters are more enthusiastic about voting than usual.

In the US Senate race, Kamala Harris leads Loretta Sanchez by 22 points; a third of Republicans say they will not vote in this race.

Majorities favor measures to extend a tax on high incomes, increase cigarette taxes, and legalize marijuana, but the state school bond measure fails to garner majority support.

Slightly more than half of Californians have a favorable view of the Democratic Party; fewer than one in four view the Republican Party favorably.
