Trump’s False Claims Rejecting Puerto Rico’s Death Toll From Hurricane Maria
the facts

False.

President Trump rejected the official estimate from the Puerto Rico government that nearly 3,000 people died from Hurricane Maria through a series of misleading or false claims on Thursday.

He cited an outdated tally that officials had acknowledged almost immediately was too low, misleadingly suggested that doubt over the tally did not emerge until “a long time later,” accused Democrats, without evidence, of inflating the figures and wrongly described the current official estimate as counting all deaths on the island, regardless of whether they were related to the storm.

The 3,000 figure comes from an estimate in a study by independent researchers at George Washington University and commissioned by the Puerto Rico government.

The researchers found that government data documented 16,608 deaths from September 2017 to February 2018 — 2,975 more deaths than under predicted mortality rates. In other words, researchers explicitly tried to avoid counting people who “died for any reason, like old age.”
