Michelle Obama on 'secret' London visit
Michelle Obama took a whistle-stop tour of Westminster yesterday en route to America from Paris, arriving to visit some of the most venerable British institutions after one of the most dramatic and damaging weeks in the country's recent political history.

Visiting a Westminster sullied by a foiled leadership plot, expenses scandal and the spiralling fortunes of the Labour party must have seemed a long way from the current state of US politics for Obama and her daughters.

During what was referred to widely today as a "secret" visit, but perhaps more appropriately catergorised as a private, unofficial tour, Obama was said to have had a meeting with Sarah Brown at Downing Street. And from the heavy security close to Big Ben yesterday, it was surmised that the first lady took Sasha, eight, and Malia, 10, to see Big Ben.

Obama had stayed on in Paris for sightseeing and shopping (apparently at Bonpoint, the glamorous children's clothing store in Saint Germain) after the president returned to the US at the end of his trip to Europe, and she is understood to have arrived in the UK with their daughters early yesterday. They reportedly flew to Stansted airport in Essex in a Boeing 757 US air force jet before being escorted to London by secret service agents.

After the tour of the Houses of Parliament yesterday, the first lady was photographed being driven away holding a souvenir: a tourist's guide to the Commons, complete with a cover photo of the outgoing Speaker, Michael Martin.

Perhaps not the most appropriate memento, given the circumstances.
