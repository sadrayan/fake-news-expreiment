Heller’s GOP Allies Ram Yucca Mountain Bill Through Republican-Controlled House

With backing from the Trump Administration, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just passed reckless legislation that would restart failed efforts to turn Yucca Mountain into a permanent dump for the rest of the nation’s nuclear waste.

The vote is a reminder that Sen. Dean Heller has frequently let Nevadans down when it comes to opposing Yucca Mountain because he’s preoccupied with partisan loyalty and his own self-interest. Heller couldn’t even stop his close friend of more than a decade, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, from bringing the Yucca Mountain bill to the floor for today’s vote. Just five of Heller’s Republican colleagues in the House voted against the bill.

Heller has voted for a GOP budget that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain, and he voted to confirm President Trump’s pro-Yucca budget director last year. Heller has also taken tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from out-of-state Yucca proponents.

Rosen for Nevada spokesperson Molly Forgey released the following statement:

“On Sen. Heller’s watch, his Republican allies in Washington just pushed a bill through the House that could turn Nevada into the nation’s nuclear waste dump. When it comes to Yucca Mountain, Sen. Heller’s record shows he can’t be trusted to put partisanship aside and stand up for Nevada’s best interests. Jacky Rosen has been unwavering in her commitment to keeping nuclear waste out of Nevada, and she will carry this fight forward when she’s elected to the Senate in November.”
