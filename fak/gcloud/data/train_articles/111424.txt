The South African Book Development Council
What is Book Development?

The term was coined by UNESCO to cover the myriad range of people, processes and skills which go into the making and reading of a book. The need for book development is a condition not only for having more books created or output, but also different kinds of outputs to that which were previously produced as well as changes in the technical and institutional arrangements by which output is produced and distributed.
