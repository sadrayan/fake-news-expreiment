Two cases of oral-stings by sperm bag of squid.
Two patients after eating raw squid complained of severe pain and foreign body sensation in their oral cavity. On consultation of a doctor, several small spindle-shaped stings stuck on the surface of the tongue and mucous membrane of the oral cavity were found. After all stings were pulled out, the pain was allayed and the wounds eventually healed. The foreign bodies were tentatively determined to be the sperm bag of Tadorodes pacificus. These cases suggest that fresh squids should be carefully prepared before eating them raw or "sashimi".
