Apple's founding document sold for $1.59m at auction
The contract, which is on typewriter paper, is signed by Apple’s three co-founders and is the first document to bear the name of a company that has defined consumer technology for the past decade.

Eduardo Cisneros, a US businessman who runs a television company, bought the document. It was drawn up by Ron Wayne, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, on April 1, 1976, in California.

However, he pulled out of the partnership less than a fortnight later because he was concerned about the venture's risks. His withdrawal prompted him to sell his 10pc share in the company for $2,300.

The document was acquired by US business executive Wade Saadi in 1994 from Mr Wayne for a few thousand dollars.

The contract represents "a point in time when I was infatuated with what Steve Jobs achieved at Apple Computer", said Mr Saadi, who doesn’t own any Apple products.
