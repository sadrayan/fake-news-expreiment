Please note: CRP does not provide street address or phone information for contributors. Federal law prohibits the use of contributor information for the purpose of soliciting contributions or for any commercial purpose. This database includes Federal Election Commission records of receipts from all individuals who contribute at least $200 (smaller contributions are not part of the public record). Bear in mind that contributions to politicians can also be made through Political Action Committees.
