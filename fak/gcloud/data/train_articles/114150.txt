The Home Depot fires patriotic Christian, approves homosexuals

Employee wearing patriotic button is fired. Employees wearing pro-homosexual buttons praised.

August 9, 2010

The Home Depot fired a employee for refusing to remove a "One nation under God" patriotic button from his work apron. Trevor Keezor, a Christian, said he wore the button to support his country and his 27-year-old brother, who serves in the military in Iraq ( story and video here ).

Dozens of homosexual employees participated in Home Depot-sponsored gay pride parades and festivals. Many employees wore numerous buttons on their aprons promoting homosexuality. The Home Depot defended them by saying homosexual employees will not be prohibited "in any way" when it comes to what they do and wear. The picture here shows employees who decorated their aprons for a Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in Seattle, Washington.

So...if you wear a "One Nation Under God" button, you will be fired. If you wear a "gay" button, you get company praise.
