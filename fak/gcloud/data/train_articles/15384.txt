Email, Daniel P. Sullivan, director of Policy and Government Relations, United to END GENOCIDE, Sept. 4, 2014

9:41 a.m.

There have been several news accounts over the past several months alleging ISIS crucifixions in Syria. Most recently CNN interviewed a 13 year old boy who said he had witnessed it happening. But I haven’t seen any confirmed reports in either Iraq or Syria. Given the other confirmed things ISIS has done, from beheadings to torture, it would not be surprising.

Amnesty International recently released a report “Ethnic Cleansing on a Historic Scale” and the UN Human Rights Council cited war crimes in launching a new investigation into atrocities committed by ISIS. Neither mention crucifixion, but do lay out evidence of several other crimes against humanity including ethnic cleansing and war crimes.

Regards,

Dan
