California Innocence Project
In 1999, we founded the California Innocence Project with 3 goals:

1) To free innocent people from prison

2) To provide outstanding training to our law students so they will become great lawyers

3) To change laws and procedures to decrease the number of wrongful convictions and improve the justice system

I am very proud of the accomplishments we have achieved with all of these goals. We have brought home many innocent clients over the years and experienced the joy of reuniting them with their families. We have seen our law graduates go on to do great things. And, we have participated in changing many laws that assist our work and improve the lives of our clients.

Over the years it has given me great joy to see our work go global in an “innocence movement” that grows bigger and stronger every day. Our project has been deeply involved in Latin America, launching Red Inocenté, a network of innocence organizations throughout the region. We have also been involved in international cases, helping to free Jason Puracal from Nicaragua, Scott McMahon from the Philippines, and representing Grace and Matthew Huang in their wrongful incarceration case in Qatar.

There is still a great deal of work for us to do and it’s not cheap. Simple expenses like gas money for us to visit our clients in remote prisons, our phone bill so clients can call us from prison, and copies of transcripts and crime scene photos can add up. I encourage you to explore our website and consider donating. Your generous contribution is 100% tax deductible and will be used to further the work of our project.
