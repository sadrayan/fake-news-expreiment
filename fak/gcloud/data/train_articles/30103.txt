Even Al Qaeda Thought America's Gun Background Check System Was Weak
Even Al-Qaeda was arguing that America's background check system was weak and made guns easily obtainable. In a video released in 2011, Adam Gadahn an American-born spokesman for Al Qaeda argued guns could be easily obtained by buying guns at a gun shows where there would not be a background check.

Gadahn was calling on Muslims living in the United States to carry out terrorist acts similar to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks in India.

"Let's take America as an example," Gadahn said. "America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said Wednesday the bi-partisan background check bill he put together with Republican Senator Pat Toomey would close the gun show loophole by adding background checks to private purchases made at shows.

Toomey said in a 2010 Senate debate he supported a better background check system to combat terrorists getting weapons in America but added "I would not support restricting the rights of law abiding citizens, however."
