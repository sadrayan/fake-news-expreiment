Now, had this said "Diversity Training", that'd be different. But no....they had to guarantee that I will never shop there again. (Though technically I haven't since they admitted they would violate hiring laws and give preference to Refugees in the hiring process, which is preference by National origin)



I call "Bullshit"!

First clue is it appears to be stuck on the outside of the door. If they are closed it makes no sense that they would stick it that side where it can be easily removed on purpose or by wind/rain, you would stick on the inside of the door so it faces outwards. The second clue is, it's covering another piece of paper. Likely the actually sign we see elsewhere in the thread.
