Gov. Cuomo proposes decriminalizing marijuana
ALBANY, N.Y. -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo is asking state lawmakers to remove criminal penalties for those who buy and use, but don't sell, marijuana.

Cuomo said selling marijuana should still result in harsh criminal penalties, but punishing users wastes tax dollars and can ruin the lives of people who are not career criminals.

"Recreational users of marijuana pose little to no threat to public safety. The unnecessary arrest of these individuals can have devastating economic and social effects on their lives," Cuomo's office wrote in its 383-page "State of the State" book that introduced the proposal.

New York City spent $75 million in 2010 to arrest and jail those caught with "small amounts" of marijuana, but about 90 percent of them had no subsequent felonies, according to data included in the proposal.

Cuomo's office said removing criminal penalties for small infractions would be keeping with a national trend. Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized pot for recreational use, including New York's neighbor, Massachusetts.

The governor introduced wide-ranging proposals during this speeches, including ethics reform, Upstate ride-booking legalization, a statewide hiking trail and free tuition for public university students. He did not mention his marijuana proposal during the speeches, but it was included in the book released Wednesday.
