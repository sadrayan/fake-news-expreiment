Kelli Ward's Issue Positions (Political Courage Test)
One of my top priorities in the U.S. Senate will be securing the border and overhauling America's immigration system, including building the wall, ending chain migration, scrapping the diversity lottery, defunding sanctuary cities, and implementing mandatory E-Verify. Another of my top priorities will be pushing for the full repeal of Obamacare. Even though the individual mandate has been repealed, I will fight every day to ensure that Obamacare's many other burdensome taxes and invasive policies are pulled out by the roots, so the free market can be restored and Americans can get the healthcare that they want, need, and deserve.
