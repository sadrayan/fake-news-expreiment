Total and Per-Student State Funding and Public Enrollment over Time
NOTES: Enrollment figures are fall FTE enrollments for public two-year and four-year institutions, with fall 2014 estimated at fall 2013 levels. Funding is for both two-year and four-year institutions and includes tax revenues and other state funds for higher education, but excludes funding for capital expenditures. Tuition and fees reflect an FTE enrollment-weighted average of two-year and four-year prices.
