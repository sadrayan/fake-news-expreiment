Email on merit and other pay raises for state workers in 110 agencies, 2009 through 2012, R.J. DeSilva, spokesperson, Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, April 16, 2013

10:40 am

There are approximately 110 state agencies covered by the Position Classification Act. Those agencies enter pay raise information in the accounting system in three codes -- merit, promotion, equity adjustment.

Descriptions and statutory cites of those three are attached if you want. (PolitiFact Texas: Definitions pasted below.)*

Here are tables for each calendar year you asked for, showing the total number of employees at those agencies, and the number who got different types of raises.

Year Total Employees Merit Promotion Equity 2009 184,754 21,996 29,102 3,443

Year Total Employees Merit Promotion Equity 2010 187,944 13,517 25,489 3,826

Year Total Employees Merit Promotion Equity 2011 186,549 8,860 22,488 5,213

Year Total Employees Merit Promotion Equity 2012 184,141 11,942 25,826 1,242

** Note: there are 10 state agencies not covered by the Position Classification Act. When they enter payroll information in our system, they have one general salary adjustment code that covers aspects such as pay increases or decreases, change in work hours, job classification changes. So they don’t have a separate pay raise code, and those agencies are not in the in the tables above. There are about 3,500 employees in those agencies. So the vast majority of state agency employees are in the tables above.

*DEFINITIONS

Merit salary increase Government Code, Section 659.255

A merit salary increase is an addition to an employee’s base salary the employee receives each pay period.

For Schedule A employees, agencies must provide an increase of at least $30 per month. The increase in salary is limited to a salary at or below the maximum of the employee’s salary group and the agency budget.

For Schedule B employees, agencies may award employees an increase to any amount within their salary group. There is no specified minimum increase. However, the increase cannot cause the new rate to exceed the maximum of the employee’s salary group.

Promotions Government Code, Section 659.256

For an action to be a promotion, agencies must change the classified employee’s duty assignment and job classification.

The new job classification must be in a salary group with a higher minimum salary than the employee’s current position.

When moving the employee to the higher salary group for the promotion, agencies must ensure:

· Salary Schedule A employees receive an increase of at least $30 per month, and

· Salary Schedule B employees receive at least a 3.4 percent increase.

At the agency’s discretion, the promotion increase could be up to, but not exceed, the maximum of the new salary group.

Salary Schedule C employees who are promoted must receive the established higher rate for the new salary group.

Equity Adjustments General Appropriations Act, Article IX, Section 3.08

Agencies have the authority to issue equity adjustments. State agencies may use equity adjustments to maintain desirable salary relationships. Equity adjustments are intended to maintain salary equality between or among agency employees or in comparison to employees in similar positions in relevant job markets.

To be eligible for the adjustment, the employee must be in his or her current job class for six months with satisfactory job performance.

Employees who move from a line-item exempt position to a classified position must wait for six months in order to be eligible for an equity adjustment.

Agencies may only grant one equity adjustment per employee per fiscal year. Any increase to the salary through an equity adjustment must not exceed the employee’s current maximum for his or her salary group, but may increase to any amount within the group. An employee’s job class or salary group may not change with an equity adjustment.

Agencies do not have the authority to remove or rescind an equity adjustment once it has been awarded.
