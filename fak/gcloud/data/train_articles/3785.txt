New Hampshire Primary
Donald Trump has maintained the lead in the New Hampshire Primary race and most Republican primary voters think he will win the primary. But Trump remains a divisive candidate within the party as he is also the candidate that New Hampshire Republicans say they are least likely to vote for. After a third-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, Marco Rubio is currently in second place. Only forty-five percent of New Hampshire Republican Primary voters say they have firmly decided who they will vote for in the Primary. Election: NH Primary 2016
