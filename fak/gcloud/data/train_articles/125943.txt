FACT CHECK: Joel Osteen Apologizes for Using Lord’s Name in Sermon
On 29 August 2016, the fake news site Babylon Bee published an article reporting that pastor Joel Osteen had apologized for his use of the word “Jesus” during a sermon:

Calling the incident “an unfortunate choice of words” and “a momentary lapse in judgment,” pastor Joel Osteen issued a public apology Monday morning for using the Lord’s name in his Sunday morning sermon.

The mishap reportedly occurred near the end of Osteen’s message, as he had attempted to say “God wants you to be victorious,” but apparently fumbled his words and instead used the phrase “Jesus wants you to be victorious.”

The effect was instantaneous, as bewildered Lakewood Church members looked at one another in a state of mixed confusion and shock. Some church members had never heard the Lord’s name used at all, while others were angered that Osteen would use the word “Jesus” in an obviously inappropriate setting like a church service.

“We all started Googling this strange word ‘Jesus,’” one church member told reporters. “He seems like a pretty cool guy, but yeah—there’s a time and a place, and this was clearly not it.”
