Hemp American Flag To Be Flown Over U.S. Capitol

Those near the U.S. Capitol may catch a glimpse of an American flag made of an entirely different, and somewhat historic fabric.

Historians say the first American flags were made of hemp, which was grown by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom were said to be talented farmers.

Since hemp is a variety of the cannabis plant, and federal law prohibits growing it, a hemp flag hasn't flown again recently.

That changes today, as Colorado Rep. Jared Polis, who is pushing for legalized farming of the industrial, non-psycho-active variety hemp, says his request for the flying of a hemp-made flag over the Capitol will be granted on this Fourth of July.

Polis had successfully amended the federal farm bill last month to allow farmers to raise industrial hemp. But the amended farm bill failed to pass in the House.
