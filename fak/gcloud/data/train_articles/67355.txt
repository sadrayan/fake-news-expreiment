-Wants to be directed by daughter Angelina Jolie-

New York, NY—Jon Voight has had a long and storied career, stretching from making his name with a starring role in the 1969 Best PictureMidnight Cowboy, across dozens of films and television appearances, to his role as Mickey Donovan on Ray Donovan today. His filmography runs the gamut from dramatic biopics like Ali to action thrillers like 24 and wild comedies such as Zoolander. Known not only for his award-winning performances and boyish figure but his strong political views, Voight still causes a buzz in Hollywood—even at age 76.

The December cover story in Cigar Aficionado hits newsstands October 27. A selection of quotations include:

On starting his career and being inspired by British acting giant Laurence Olivier: “I realized that I wanted to be this guy. So I decided I would graduate and then I would go to New York and learn to act. Once I made that decision, the burden dropped. It was meant to be. Even though I hadn’t really done anything as an actor, I knew I wouldn’t give up.�?

On life after his starring role in 1969’s Best Picture, Midnight Cowboy: “I think it gave my family a sense of relief that I wasn’t going to be a failure. It gave me a sense of relief too.�?

On working with the 24 crew: “They told me they didn’t know where it was going to go—and that appealed to me. I decided to go for it and give it a try. We became collaborators from the first and that suited me perfectly. I’d get the script and go in with the writers and give them a couple of notes. We’d sit and smoke a cigar; that was fun.�?

David Hollander, executive producer on Ray Donovan, on Voight’s fitness: “I remember we were shooting a scene and I’m directing, and I turn around and Jon is down on the ground, doing 20 or 30 pushups behind the camera so he’d be sweating for the scene. He’s incredibly vibrant. He doesn’t seem like someone my father’s age.�?

Liev Schreiber, star of Ray Donovan, on Voight’s strengths as an actor: “Jon is a leading man with the chops of a character actor. One of Jon’s greatest strengths is comedy. What he does is walk a very thin line, pushing the character farther and farther.�?

On how he’d deal with Mickey Donovan if he were in the real world: “I’d stay the hell away from him. And I’d advise everyone else to do the same. Mickey is a mess.�?

On playing college football coaching legend Paul “Bear�? Bryant in upcoming film Woodlawn (October 2016): “I like to say that playing Bear Bryant is like climbing the Himalayas. You get as high as you can. And when you walk away, the mountain is still there.�?

On his relationship with daughter Angelina Jolie: “I love my daughter, and I’m very impressed by her directing. I thought Unbroken was brilliant….now I’d like to be directed by her. I’m crazy about her and my grandchildren.�?

On his grandchildren: “I love to play with my grandchildren, when I see them…I’m not an armchair grandfather—I’m interactive…The happiest sound for me is sitting in my house and hearing children and their laughter coming from the field.�?

On cigars: “Sitting with a cigar and talking loosens you up. The humor comes out. You became a little ribald, you let the rough edges show. And maybe that stimulates something.�?

On Hollywood’s distaste for conservatives: “There are a lot of conservatives in Hollywood, and they’re not very welcome. It’s a big surprise that we’ve come to this juncture where people with patriotic thoughts could not find a home in Hollywood.�?

On liberal politics: “I think the word ‘progressive’ is a very devious term. It was created as a substitute for ‘communist.’ What they propose is the reverse of progress. It’s some that that does taste of communism and Karl Marx’s pernicious philosophy.�?

On being a man of faith, his Catholicism: “I think when we want to do something for the good—to help other people—we get the help we need. At one point in my career, I made that commitment, and I got help…The hardest lesson is to acknowledge my own weakness and to forgive myself for my mistakes. And to overcome my meaner leanings. But self-forgiveness is a big deal.�?
