SHIRLEY, N.Y. - A 69-year-old athlete competing in a Long Island triathlon has died.

Authorities say Vincent Fleck of Mount Kisco died after a lifeguard noticed him in distress during a swimming portion of the event.

Suffolk County police say a lifeguard transported him in a canoe to a rescue boat, where he received first aid. He was later pronounced dead at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in East Patchogue.

The emergency occurred during the 500-meter swim portion of the Smith Point Spring Triathlon in Narrow Bay.

Police say it was unknown if Fleck drowned or if he suffered a medical event. The Suffolk County Medical Examiner was set to do an autopsy to determine the cause of death.
