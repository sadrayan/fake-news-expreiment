FBI chief: San Bernardino shooters did not publicly promote jihad on social media
The attacks in San Bernardino and Chattanooga both "involved people consuming poison on the Internet" and becoming radicalized, Comey said. "But in San Bernardino, as I've said before, we see in the killers Malik and Farook two people who are radicalized before the emergence of ISIL [the Islamic State], and so untangling the motivation [and] which particular terrorist propaganda motivated them and in what way remains a challenge in these investigations. And our work is ongoing there."
