LUCHA Arizona — Home
Our people have been held back and beaten down. Our friends and families are working constantly for miniscule wages, our students’ textbooks are falling apart, our teachers are working multiple jobs, our undocumented community members are forced to live in fear, and our communities are incarcerated at highly disproportionate rates.

When our communities are under attack, we must organize and fight back. Living United for Change in Arizona is a member-powered people’s organization created to end the issues that our people face every single day. If you’d like to start fighting for your freedom, check out our join page to see where LUCHA membership can take you.
