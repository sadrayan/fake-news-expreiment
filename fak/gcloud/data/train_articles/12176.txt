Russ for Wisconsin Launches New Radio Ad
Today, Russ for Wisconsin launched a new radio ad titled “Epidemic.” The 1-minute ad runs statewide and highlights Senator Johnson’s record of empty promises on Wisconsin’s opioid epidemic.

Listen to the ad below:

“Epidemic” highlights Sen. Johnson’s record of failure for Wisconsin communities ravaged by the opioid epidemic. Sen. Johnson has repeatedly voted against emergency funding that would aid afflicted communities, fund substance abuse treatment, and save lives. He’s spent the past year in Washington voting against common sense bipartisan solutions to this crisis -- instead of acting, Sen. Johnson has ignored the needs of Wisconsin’s middle-class and working families.

Russ has seen the tragedy inflicted by the opioid crisis firsthand. He knows addiction is a disease that must be approached comprehensively through treatment, prevention, and education. If elected, Russ will fight for bipartisan solutions that prioritize treatment and recovery, to expand access to naloxone, and to strengthen monitoring of prescription medications.

Rampant opioid addiction across Wisconsin is a public health crisis killing our family members, friends, and neighbors, but Sen. Johnson has stuck to his record of inaction and failure. When it comes to the opioid epidemic, Sen. Johnson is all talk. Russ will take action to help those afflicted by the epidemic and work to prevent more lives from being lost. Sen. Johnson will continue to offer nothing but empty promises.
