GALLERY: Newlands baby found in storm drain recovering
A KwaZulu-Natal rescue team descended on Baracuda Road earlier today, after residents heard faint cries coming from a manhole in the early hours of the morning.

It took rescuers almost three hours to excavate the area and reach the baby girl, found nestled seven-metres in the pipe.

The baby has since been airlifted to hospital and is being treated for mild hypothermia.
