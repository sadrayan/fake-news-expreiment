Union coming with seven-figure buy against Joe Heck
A major labor union is coming with a seven-figure buy-in Nevada starting this week hitting U.S. Senate candidate Joe Heck on an oldie but reliable goodie: Social Security privatization.



The spot from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (see below) uses regular folks to pound Rep. Heck as more loyal to Wall Street donors than seniors. This theme already has been used by a Democratic SuperPAC.



One source tells me the AFSCME buy is $1.4 million in Las Vegas and Reno through Aug. 16.
