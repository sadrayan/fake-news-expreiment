Dem rips DeWine's handling of probe
Attorney General Mike DeWine considered criminal prosecution of his Equal Employment Opportunity investigator who initially resisted divulging to him a confidential source in a sexual-harassment case.

Attorney General Mike DeWine considered criminal prosecution of his Equal Employment Opportunity investigator who initially resisted divulging to him a confidential source in a sexual-harassment case.

DeWine referred the case against the investigator to Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O�Brien, who declined to pursue charges against Kristine A. Cadek for what DeWine�s office said was improperly obtaining photographs used during her probe.

Cadek had interviewed 25 people, including DeWine, showing them photographs of Amy Garrison � the former intern who filed the complaint � and her parents.

Cadek requested and obtained the photos through the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway, a confidential database maintained by the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, a branch of DeWine�s office.

DeWine�s staff determined after the fact that it had been improper for Cadek to ask a BCI employee for the photos because the database records are for criminal law-enforcement issues, and the sexual-harassment case was an administrative matter.

�We are super careful and super protective of� the database, Mary Mertz, first assistant attorney general, told The Dispatch. She said that is why the matter was sent to O�Brien to see whether laws were broken.

O�Brien responded in a Feb. 26 email, saying it had not been a proper use of the system by Cadek to obtain the photos. However, O�Brien said that because the access was limited and there was �no actual harm,� Cadek�s action did not warrant a felony charge. He suggested that �internal counseling or administrative action� would be more appropriate. Cadek was not charged or disciplined.

Ohio Democrats see things differently. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern says that DeWine�s office punished Cadek for her reluctance to divulge the name of a confidential informant in the sexual-harassment probe.

�Instead of defending the victim, Mike DeWine tried to punish the person who was helping the victim,� Redfern said. �He should be ashamed of himself.�

Documents show that Cadek was concerned about giving DeWine the name because the informant had been promised confidentiality, and she feared the possible �retaliation factor.� However, DeWine pressed her for the name, and she eventually complied. DeWine talked to the informant; there is no record of the conversation. The case was closed a few days later.

Mertz denied that there was any intent to punish Cadek.

�No, of course not. She did a good job with the investigation,� Mertz said.

Garrison, a 2013 graduate of Case Western University School of Law, made the sexual-harassment allegations in April 2013 when she declined an offer by DeWine�s office to become a staff attorney pending her passing the bar exam.

State records show that Garrison�s allegation at the time � which she later recanted in an interview under oath with O�Brien � was that she could not accept the staff job because she had been a �possible �victim� of sexual harassment by a �high up� attorney general�s office employee,� described as an older male attorney who was �close to the attorney general.�

Garrison never identified the person she accused, but she did say he was a family friend.

DeWine spokeswoman Lisa Hackley said that DeWine, as the head of the agency, �has every right to know who that person may be who might know something about it.�
