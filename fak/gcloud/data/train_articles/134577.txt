The Disney Dogs: Every Cute Canine From the 54 Animated Classics
There’s nothing better than a Disney dog. Not only are they as cute and cuddly as the real things, but in a lot of cases they can talk. Literally the stuff of our childhood dreams. To honor the pups that have graced our screens during many a Disney movie viewing, we decided to make a chart of featuring all of them, in celebration! This chart features only the dogs you’ll find in Walt Disney Animation Studios’ 54 animated classics. Tell us which Disney dog group you’d like to see next in the comments!

Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this post noted that the chart included 54 Disney dogs, when there are actually 53. We were never great at math so let’s just leave it at that.
