Analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau

Current law provides that a federally licensed firearms dealer must request the

Department of Justice (DOJ) to conduct a background check of a prospective

purchaser before the dealer may transfer a handgun after a sale. Current law also

requires the firearms dealer to wait 48 hours after receiving notice that DOJ received

the request for a background check, without receiving notice that state or federal law

prohibits the purchaser from possessing a firearm, before transferring the handgun

to the purchaser. This bill eliminates the 48-hour waiting period. Under this bill,

the dealer may transfer the handgun immediately after receiving notice from DOJ

that the background check indicates that the purchaser is not prohibited from

possessing a firearm.

The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate and assembly, do

enact as follows:
