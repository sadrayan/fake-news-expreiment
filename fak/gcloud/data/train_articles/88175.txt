(9) Permission Form for Prescribed Medication. The Medication Permission Form is valid only for the current school year. A separate form shall be on file for each prescription medication.

Before any prescription medication shall be administered by school personnel, or self-administered by a student, the parent or legal guardian of the child shall file with the school principal a dated, signed permission form authorizing the school to assist in administration of medication and indicating:

Students name (If there is a name discrepancy, the parent/guardian must list each name used by the student).

Students requiring over-the-counter (OTC) medicine for a temporary medical condition (i.e. cough and cold medicines, pain relievers, allergy medicines, skin conditions, etc.) do not need a written health care provider order for the first five (5) days of medicine administration, although the Medication Permission Form shall be completed by the parent/guardian. If the non-prescription medicine is needed for more than five (5) days, a written health care providers order is required. Dosage shall not exceed recommended amount printed on the container and/or package without a written health care providers order.

(12) Prescription and non-prescription medications shall be transported to and from school by the parent/legal guardian in an original container and shall be properly labeled. Over the counter medicines shall be in the original container and labeled with the students name. Medications may not be transported by the student. Exceptions to this rule, due to special situations or hardships, shall be allowed only with the site administrators written permission. Alternate transportation arrangements must be obtained for each medication the student may require in school.

(13) Students shall not carry prescription or non-prescription medicine on their person, except medication deemed medically necessary by the health care provider. Medications to be carried and administered by the student shall require the health care providers written authorization and Medication Permission Form signed by the parent/guardian.
