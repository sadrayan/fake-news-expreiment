I see a whopping increase in apprehensions alone in March 2018 compared to March 2017 through the March 2017 count was way down from any other March since fiscal 2000. Why was that March 2017 number of apprehensions so low and why was the March 2018 figure the highest since March 2014?

The increase and decrease in entries during any given period is determined by “push/ pull” factors. These factors vary by country of origin (push) and by perceived policy changes in the U.S. (pull). In 2017, there was the perception by individuals wishing to enter illegally into the U.S. that there would be immediate policy changes to how the U.S. handled illegal immigration. This perception was due in large part to the newly elected President Trump’s proclamation on enforcing immigration laws.

In 2018 the previous perception illegal entrants had regarding consequences were removed as they witnessed individuals entering and being released based on refugee and credible fear claims. This led to an increase in illegal entries as this form of refugee claim was successfully exploiting loopholes in immigration laws preventing the application of an appropriate consequence for illegal entry.

If I read right, I also see that Border Patrol apprehensions in the sector in the first half of fiscal 2018 were down about 13 percent from apprehensions in the first half of fiscal 2017. Why would that be?

Ebb and flow in illegal migration is based on “push/ pull” factors, historical flow, migrant patterns and the current political environment. These fluctuations will be more predominant when smaller time comparisons are utilized.

Does CBP believe there’s been a surge of attempts to cross the border illegally from Mexico into the U.S. of late? Why or why not?

The current entry numbers are following statistical norms when compared to years 2014, 2015 and 2016. When comparing 2017 to 2018 numbers for the month of March, apprehensions have risen greater than 200%, unaccompanied alien children apprehensions have risen 299% and apprehended family units have risen 689%.
