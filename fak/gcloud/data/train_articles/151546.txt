Bromance Française

President Trump has shown a lot of affection for Emmanuel Macron during the French president’s visit to the White House this week. His handshakes seem to last a little too long, fingers get tangled, cheek-kisses flow abundantly. The late-night hosts rolled the tapes and let the jokes fly.

“Have you ever seen him touch anyone like that? He gave him the full Stormy Daniels there.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “When President Emmanuel Macron greeted President Trump, he kissed Trump on both cheeks. Then out of habit, Michael Cohen showed up and handed Macron $130,000.” — CONAN O’BRIEN

One incident was a little less affectionate, but at least as awkward: Standing next to Macron, Trump told reporters he’d found dandruff on the French leader’s jacket.
