Please take into fact that the giant sequoia is native and uses a lot of symbiosis to live so its help the environment and not killing native trees or plants at all and is very good for native birds GO THINK IT THROUGH and nature was here before us deal with it we need to respect it although I'm not with this mans vengeful ideas his heart was in the right place your brain is not in the right place either. Also it doesn't matter what it looks like this poor man had this tree as family imagine if someone walked up to your child and took a chain saw to him this tree was his child and they made him kill it!!!
