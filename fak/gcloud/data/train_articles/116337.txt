A business in Canada is offering a job and 2 free acres of land if you relocate
Two free acres of land is not a typical perk to offer to a new hire. But that's what The Farmer's Daughter Country Market is offering.

That's because, well, it needs workers, and there aren't any available in the village of Whycocomagh, located on Cape Breton, an island at the eastern end of Nova Scotia in Canada. It's stunningly gorgeous territory, but it's pretty remote.

The Facebook post advertising the job and land offer admits that you won't get rich taking the job at The Farmer's Daughter Country Market, but the rural town offers a wholesome life that it hopes will entice someone to make the big move.

"We can't give you big money, but we can give you an awesome life," the Facebook post reads. "But we can offer you a great incentive to come and try us out. One thing our business does have is LOTS of LAND."
