Leah Vukmir: Wisconsinites want options, not one-size-fits-all health care

Brookfield, Wis. – While Sen. Tammy Baldwin continues to tell Wisconsinites she knows better than them when it comes to health insurance, nurse Leah Vukmir released the following statement outlining her belief that we need to provide solutions that work for patients whose premiums continue to rise:

“Being a nurse means caring for people, listening to them and doing everything you can to help them. That’s why I am so disappointed that Sen. Baldwin isn’t listening to those who want more affordable choices. Instead, she relies on failing, top-down government solutions from Washington.

“There is no one-size-fits-all solution to fix healthcare, but I can tell you Baldwin’s ideas are exactly that, as proven by her support of a $32 trillion socialized, government takeover of healthcare. She thinks Washington knows best – even though here in Wisconsin we had solutions for those with pre-existing conditions before it was cool to take care of people with pre-existing conditions.

“Make no mistake about it: patients with pre-existing conditions should be covered. People shouldn’t buy in to Tammy Baldwin’s lie that taking care of those who need pre-existing coverage and providing all Wisconsinites with more affordable options are mutually exclusive. Tammy Baldwin and her elitist Washington friends will say this isn’t possible, but we did it here in Wisconsin, and together we can find better solutions for healthcare.”

Leah Vukmir is a nurse, military mom and the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate who is running to bring the Wisconsin Way to Washington. She currently serves as a state senator from Brookfield.
