Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: ‘Trump is a serious threat to human rights’
England’s Prince Harry is getting married, to the disappointment of aspiring princesses everywhere, and it’s looking like president Trump will not be on the guest list.

Meghan Markle is an American citizen and Donald Trump might expect an invitation to the wedding, expected to take place next spring.

However, Prince Harry is reportedly privately highly critical of Trump, with US Weekly reporting earlier this year that he “is not a fan” of Trump.

“Harry thinks the president is a serious threat to human rights,” a “close source” told the magazine.

Markle has also been highly critical of president Trump, previously describing him as “misogynistic” and threatening to leave the US if he became president.

From Newsweek:

If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.

With the level of protection that surrounds U.S President, the inclusion of Trump would give security chiefs a headache as they work to police the high-profile event.

Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama will be invited to Prince Harry’s wedding.

The Obamas appear to have a great relationship with Prince Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.
