Le Bromance: Trump and Macron, Together Again
WASHINGTON — The couple seemed happy to be together again.

When President Trump welcomed President Emmanuel Macron of France to the White House on Tuesday for the first official state visit of the Trump administration, their body language went beyond the usual respectful handshakes of two world leaders meeting for high-level talks and bordered on the intimate.

There was a mutual kiss on the cheek in the East Room, where Mr. Macron clasped hands with Mr. Trump, pulling him in for an embrace and a brief peck as Mr. Trump puckered his lips slightly to reciprocate.

“I like him a lot,” Mr. Trump explained to reporters and officials looking on.

Earlier in the Oval Office, the president had gently brushed what he said was dandruff off Mr. Macron’s shoulder.

“We have to make him perfect,” Mr. Trump, 71, said of the trimmer Mr. Macron, 40. “He is perfect.”

Moments later, as they sat side by side, Mr. Macron placed his hand on Mr. Trump’s knee.
