NAIC Consumer Alert: Sharing a Ride, But Not Insurance
Note: For the purposes of this consumer alert, 'ridesharing' is used to describe the practice of driving for hire using an online-enabled platform to connect drivers—who are using their personal vehicles—with passengers.

Driving strangers to make money for the holidays may seem like a great idea. After all, ridesharing services, such as Lyft and Uber, are becoming an increasingly popular way for people to earn money. However, you should be aware of potential gaps in insurance coverage. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) urges consumers to consider these tips before picking up their first passenger.
