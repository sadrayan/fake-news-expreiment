Report: City M.T.A. contribution lags inflation
New York City may sit at the hub of the M.T.A.'s vast mass transit system, but its investments in that system's trains, buses, bridges and tunnels have not kept up with inflation.

A new Independent Budget Office report out this morning finds that had New York City's contribution to the M.T.A.'s capital plan kept pace with inflation, it would have contributed $363 million last year, rather than the $100 million a year it's averaged since 2000.

“The City should be doing better by the riding public," said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the NYPIRG Straphangers Campaign, which asked the Independent Budget Office to study the issue.

The study is timely because the M.T.A. is seeking state support for a $32 billion, five-year capital plan, but that same plan has a $15.2 billion hole.

To advance its program, the M.T.A. has asked the city to increase its $100 million-a-year contribution to $125 million.

"We are always supportive of the M.T.A. and recognize its importance to the city and the state," said Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, in a statement. "Decisions about the City's capital program are made in the context of its Financial Plan and Ten-Year Capital Strategy, documents that will be developed in the weeks and months to come."

For the M.T.A.'s first five-year capital plan, which spanned 1982 to 1986, the city committed roughly $136 million a year, or 1.2 percent of "city-funded expenses," according to the report.

"The city’s contribution to the MTA capital plan in 2010-2014 averaged just 0.2 percent of total city-funded expenses a year," the report reads.

The report does note that city residents contribute in other ways, namely via dedicated taxes.

"IBO estimates that New York City residents alone generated around $3.1 billion in city and state tax revenue for the MTA in 2014, compared with just $235 million in 1983."
