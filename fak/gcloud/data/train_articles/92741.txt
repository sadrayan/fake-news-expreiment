David Jolly's generosity to Democrats
Only one credible Repubican, David Jolly, has announced his candidacy for the late CW Bill Young's U.S. House seat, and already we're hearing grumbing about Jolly's record of campaign contributions. Bill Young's former personal attorney and general counsel has contributed to the campaigns of Sen. Bill Nelson (and Nelson's PAC), Kathy Castor, Chris Carney, Dick Durbin, Daniel Inouye, Jesse Jackson Jr., along with numerous Republicans.

Jolly is a lobbyist, which often means working with Democrats and Republicans alike. "Mr. Jolly is candidly bi-partisan and works regularly with Members from both sides of the political aisle," says his firm's website.

Oddly enough, we see no record of him donating to Young.
