Hippo Eats Dwarf : Band Info
Band Info

Formed immediately after the 2003 Auckland Rockquest heats in June, Hippo Eats Dwarf have played at various bars and private parties around Auckland. We play alternative rock, but our songs often contain elements of other genres because we have a wide range of influences.

All of us have recently finished school at the Senior College of NZ and will be going to Auckland Uni in 2004.
