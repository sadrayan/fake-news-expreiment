Sen. Cruz said in Houston this morning that the Cruz campaign “finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field, …$13.8 million in the bank, three and a half million dollars more than the Jeb Bush campaign.” I expect to check this against the FEC filings.

How did the senator reach his comparative conclusion?

THANKS.

How does the campaign account for money raised by PACs supporting the candidates?

CRUZ: “our campaign...finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field”

I don’t see the words “PAC” anywhere in that statement, so I don’t see how that is relevant.

Ok. Do you agree the Cruz cause has or may have the second-most overall cash on hand, counting PACs and Super PACs?

I can’t speak to Super PAC COH other than what has been publicly reported. But given that, yes I’d say so.

However, to base any rating on super pac money is completely misleading because Cruz was clearly talking about campaign cash on hand.
