Any generic claim that Mike Martinez raised taxes while on Council is 100% inaccurate. Mike voted to reduce the property tax rate in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2014. (Source: https://assets.austintexas.gov/budget/14-15/downloads/fy15_approved_volume_I.pdf)

Mike also voted to keep Austin Energy rates the same from 2006-20011. Mike also voted to pass an item that reduces water rates for our lowest residential users at our last Council meeting in November (Source: http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=221926).

As for the Sunset Advisory Commission, page 16 of their final report recommends that Capital Metro "Charge a bus fare of 50 cents for groups currently riding free ($1.7 million in revenues) and charge $2 for paratransit rides" in order to stay solvent (Source: Sunset Commission Final Report).

It is also very important to note that Mike only has one vote at Capital Metro -- in other words, the Adler campaign is falsely representing Mike's record by making the claim he took unilateral action, which of course is 100% inaccurate.
