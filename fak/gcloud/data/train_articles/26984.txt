The Fake Tweet Generator
Hello friends. Unfortunately Tweeterino, the fake tweet generator, has shut down on the 4th of June 2018. After this date, no more fake tweets shall be created, and all existing tweets were deleted.

Tweeterino was created with the objective of enabling people to create parody content. We provided a tool for parody and comedy, and that was it.

However, even though it was obvious that the tweets were fake with the "Fake" watermarks and labels all over the place, some fake tweets ended up travelling the internet, making waves and fooling some people. This usually happened when the "Fake" watermark on the tweet image was removed. Of course, we were not OK with this.

We do not believe our website was responsible for promoting misinformation. People with the bad intention of creating a fake story will continue to do so. But not everyone shares that opinion, and that had caused our website maintenance to become an increasingly difficult battle.

For that reason we have closed the website.

Thank you, and have a great day!
