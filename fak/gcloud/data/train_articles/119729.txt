National Day Of Prayer Live Stream 2015: Watch Faith Leaders Speak From The Main Event In DC
The National Day of Prayer is an American tradition dating back to 1952. Many U.S. residents are expected to take part in prayer and meditation gatherings on Thursday all over the country, but the main event will be in Washington, D.C., where faith leaders will assemble to lead a series of prayers for the country’s elected leaders. A live stream of the three-hour event, which is expected to take place from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon EST, will be broadcast online from the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill.

"We carry a great burden in our hearts for America and encourage all our viewers to participate in this nationwide prayer initiative as we come into unity across the airwaves and fervently stand in the gap for this nation,” Wendy Alec of God TV, which will make a live stream of the prayer event available their website, said in a statement. The event will include prayers and remarks by Dr. Dick Eastman and Vonette Bright, co-founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, as well as Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., Rabbi Daniel Lapin, and Father Ed Hathaway, among others.

President Barack Obama is also expected to make a few remarks on the National Day of Prayer. “One of our Nation’s great strengths is the freedom we hold dear, including the freedom to exercise our faiths freely. For many Americans, prayer is an essential act of worship and a daily discipline,” the president said last year.
