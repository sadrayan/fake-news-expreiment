Get a Grip, Sen. Baldwin
Have you seen Tammy Baldwin’s “cheesy” new ad this week? If you missed it, check it out because it spectacularly shows how desperate Senator Baldwin has become to revamp her deeply unpopular image in the state – and just how endangered her seat has become for the Democrats.

In the new spot, Senator Baldwin goes on about her record “eliminating regulations” and taking on “federal bureaucrats” in the cheese industry.

Get a grip. There’s never been an industry Senator Baldwin didn’t want to tax, regulate or burden with new legislation.

Truth is, her seat’s in real danger and – by the looks of this new ad – she knows it. Why else would one of the Senate’s most liberal, unabashed progressives cut an ad feigning concern for “eliminating regulations” or stopping “federal bureaucrats”?

“Wisconsin won’t be fooled by Tammy Baldwin’s desperate attempts to deflect from her record of supporting every job-killing regulation in the book,” said NRSC Spokesman Calvin Moore. “Time and time again she’s chosen to stand with her liberal party bosses in Washington over the people of Wisconsin – and her approval ratings show it. Rather than misleading voters, Senator Baldwin should own up to the fact that her out-of-touch policies are hurting Wisconsin workers and small businesses.”
