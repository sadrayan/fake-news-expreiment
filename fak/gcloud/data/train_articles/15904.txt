Hi Phil,

Nice to meet you and happy to work with you. Here are some sources.

The source for the six to 10,000 apprehended per week: http://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/U.S.%20Border%20Patrol%20Fiscal%20Year%20Apprehension%20Statistics%201960-2013.pdf

"We think we catch one out of five..." is based on Operation Drawbridge and conversations Senator Patrick had with law enforcement in the Valley.

Number of births in Texas:

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Alejandro Garcia

Follow up question. When Patrick made that comparison, was he comparing Texas births to apprehensions from the entire US/Mexico border, or just the Texas/Mexico border?

It is the southwest border region which is the entire US/Mexico border.
