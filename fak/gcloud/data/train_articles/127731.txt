UNPRECEDENTED: Obama Forces Insurance Industry to Withhold 2015 Prices Until After Election
For the first time in modern history, the Obama administration has forced insurance companies to withhold 2015 prices until after the election.

So he can shield Democrats.

In the past, new prices were announced 60 days before the first day of the year.

Not this year.

Warner Todd Huston reported:

Barack Obama is again playing political games with our health insurance industry and has turned in another underhanded move against it by forcing insurance carriers, brokers and agents to withhold their 2015 prices until after the 2014 midterm elections are over all so that the news of higher prices won’t hurt Democrats on Election Day.

This means that customers looking to get new insurance or those wishing to scout new policies to see if they can get a better deal are not able to shop for insurance.

Before we get into that, though, millions of new cancellations will be hitting on January 1, 2015. Much of this news has gone under the radar as Democrats and their lapdog media are keeping this as quiet as possible.

There is also something different with these cancellations, something that has never happened before in the healthcare insurance industry. Past practice has always been that the next year’s new rates are released 60 days before the first day of the next year.
