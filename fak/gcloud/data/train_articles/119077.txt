Nobody's Home:



Open your eyes and look outside, find the reasons why.

You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind.

Be strong, be strong now.

Too many, too many problems.

Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.

She wants to go home, but nobody's home.

It's where she lies, broken inside.

With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.

Broken inside.



Her feelings she hides.

Her dreams she can't find.

She's losing her mind.

She's fallen behind.

She can't find her place.

She's losing her faith.

She's fallen from grace.

She's all over the place.

Yeah,oh



In the below verse her doppelganger is supposedly talking about her death:



"Slipped Away"



The day you slipped away

Was the day I found it won't be the same

Oh



I had my wake up

Won't you wake up

I keep asking why

And I can't take it

It wasn't fake

It happened, you passed by



Now you are gone, now you are gone

There you go, there you go

Somewhere I can't bring you back

Now you are gone, now you are gone

There you go, there you go,

Somewhere you're not coming back



And apparently she kept leaving more clues in this song:



"My Happy Ending"



Don't leave me hangin'

In a city so dead

Held up so high

On such a breakable thread



The supposed doppelganger has a very different nose structure, according to the OP of the article:



[link to imageupper.com]



And the cover of "Under My Skin" would be a reference to Avril Lavigne death and replacement.

"Do or do not. There is no try." (Yoda) Too bad I can't post the link here because it certainly will get me banned LOL, but it's a VERY VERY well built website, probably made by a die-hard fan of Avril Lavigne, and the author of the article scrutinized several details of her career to came to a conclusion that the Canadian singer hanged herself before the second album and was replaced by a doppelganger, who left several clues about the death of the original Avril, in the lyrics and covers of the next albums. Some lyrics are pretty blatant by the way! I quoted the verses that highlight a possible suicide! According to the article's author, she killed herself after she went home and found out that her parents abandoned her.In the below verse her doppelganger is supposedly talking about her death:And apparently she kept leaving more clues in this song:The supposed doppelganger has a very different nose structure, according to the OP of the article:And the cover of "Under My Skin" would be a reference to Avril Lavigne death and replacement.

Avril Levigne's secret record (even if faked) would make more money than her "doppelganger's" would have.



So why bother trying? Who benefits most from it?

Also, there's little chance they could keep something like Avril Lavigne hanging herself secret and completely out of the media. It would have been a shit show like Kurt Cobain. Not that Avril is as influential.



The only reall benefit would be that the doppelganger could still tour and make butt loads of money that way.

EXCEPT if the person in question was being used in a specific agenda, then there will be NO interest for her handlers, in make her death public.



For instance, when the original Paul McCartney died, the Beatles was the pinnacle of the MI-6 mind-programming apparatus for youngsters. If his death had becoming public, it would be a major setback.



Thread: Proof of Paul McCartney Doppelganger replacement in 1969 LETS MEET FAUL MCCARTNEY!



If Avril Lavigne was a tool for any agenda among fucktard teenagers, they obviously would replace her.

You're deadly wrong! By the time of her first album, Avril Lavigne was A LOT influential among 15, 16 yo skaters and free-style bikers and all that generation of useless teenagers who spent all day in urban parks watching skaters and bikers.

Hit the nail on the head.

Pursue Truth.



This hard, tangible thing we call reality: the chair you sit upon, the computer, your beverage, cigarette, the air around you, is composed of 99.99999...% Space. Contrary to popular belief, energy-mass does not define the Space, but rather is defined -by- the Space. The all-permeating Space is a vibrating, infinitely dense medium of geometric discretion; a cube octahedral vector equillibrium. This is the One existence, and the only thing that exists, simultaneously. There is nothing else.



We do not live in a "big bang" universe.

We do not live in a "created" reality.

Our reality is a perpetually -creating- model, and It is aware.

Space is aware.

I AM aware.

"God", some call it. "Probably nobody will give a fuck..."Hit the nail on the head.

I find the actual replacement of someone harder to believe than the alter re-programming, because I don't see any significant physical differences between the alleged "old Avril" and the "new one", unless the doppelganger is a clone.

Cloning is more restrict to the Hollywood apparatus.
