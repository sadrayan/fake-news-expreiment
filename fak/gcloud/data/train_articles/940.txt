WINDExchange: U.S. Installed Wind Capacity
Installed Wind Capacity

The amount of wind energy available in the United States is continuously growing bringing the nation closer, bit by bit, to the wind energy goals set out in the Wind Vision Report—35% of the nation's end-use electricity demands coming from wind energy by 2050. Use this page to track the United States' installed wind capacity by state and its progression.

On the installed capacity map, move the slider below to see the changes in wind energy availability in the states over the course of 17 years. Compare current installed capacity—which supplies nearly 5% of the nation's electric generation mix—to what is technologically possible, but not yet installed, with the potential capacity map.
