I’m originally from Upstate NY. Seattle reacts to snow like a stereotypical southern city. It happens often enough to remember they got through but not often enough to learn anything from it so drivers tend to be overcocky and businesses suck at clearing their sidewalks of snow and ice so walking anywhere is dangerous, too. (Although, I must say Hot Mama’s Pizza in Capitol Hill is an exception to this. It was the only place I walked past yesterday where the sidewalk wasn’t either solid ice or slush so I stopped in there and in the time it took to eat a couple slices, they sent someone back out to shovel again. That seemed more like what I’d expect in NY.)
