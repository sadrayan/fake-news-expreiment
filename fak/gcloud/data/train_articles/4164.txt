Citizens for Tax Justice - Working for a fair and sustainable tax system
Take Action for Tax Justice

For decades, far too many of our elected officials have put the wants of special interests, corporations and the very rich over the needs of the rest of us. Now, lawmakers seek to cut taxes for corporations and the rich while claiming such policies will benefit working people. Collectively, we can raise our voices to stop the brazen, upward redistribution of wealth.
