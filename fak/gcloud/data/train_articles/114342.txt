Format: Hardcover

If you went to the movies to see the newest Peanuts film, The Peanuts Movie, which skyrocketed to the top of the box office upon its release, you know love for Snoopy and Charles M. Schulz’s cartoon characters endure. My family who are longtime, super loyal fans of Snoopy, Charlie Brown and the gang await every TV holiday special despite owning the DVDs and drink our morning coffee out of mugs emblazoned with familiar and fond Peanuts images. In the annals of my family history, it is said that at 11 months old I stood rapt in my playpen, watching the Christmas special, transfixed by the characters and action and could not stop babbling during it.



Although as a family we consider ourselves connoisseurs, there’s always room to learn more. Do I really know everything there is to know about Snoopy even though a stuffed version resides on my bed? Remember that he’s a complex, multifaceted character with layers of personality, his thoughts merely expressed in a bubble above his renowned bulbous nose, his actions speaking louder than words.



In order to really consider myself a Snoopy expert, I read the new book, The Snoopy Treasures, written by Snoopy expert and author of several Peanuts books and AAUGH http://aaugh.com/wordpress/ , Nat Gertler, to uncover any remaining mysteries about Snoopy and solidify my knowledge of this amazing beagle. What you will learn when you read the new overview on Snoopy are his origins, his international impact on popular culture and how he is still so beloved more than 50 years from his conception.



When I received the book in the mail, it couldn’t have arrived at a better time.
