Oprah Joins the Long Line of People Waiting for Old Racists to Die
A few weeks ago Aziz Ansari brought up how great it is that old racists are dying off. If you thought 'That's awesome, but Aziz really isn't my style," you're in luck because Oprah just expressed the same sentiment!

Our Lady of FAAAVORITE THIIIIIIIINGS said this while discussing racism and The Butler with the BBC:

"As long as there are people who can be judged on the color of their skin, the problem is not solved. The whole generation â€” I said this for Apartheid in South Africa, I said this for my own community in the south. There are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism, and they just have to die."

Of course, Oprah's thoughts on the matter are a lot more nuanced than "old people dead, racism over!" and it's worth pointing out that I know some pretty racist youths and some pretty not racist olds. Regardless, I am genuinely tickled by the idea of people being amped for the natural death of a racist generation and I'm not sure what that says about me as a person. Probably that I'm horrible, but guess what? I'm okay with that and if you're not, don't worry because one day, I'll be dead, too.
