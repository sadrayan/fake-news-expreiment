Lindsay Nielson, Ph.D.
I’m a Researcher on the Public Policy Evaluation team at the Fors Marsh Group in Arlington, VA. Prior to that, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor of Political Science at Bucknell University, completed postdoctoral work at the University of San Diego, and graduated with my Ph.D. in American Politics from the University of California, San Diego in 2014.

I am an expert on voting and election administration in American elections. I’m interested in exploring why and under what conditions people participate in political life, and how politicians respond to what their constituents want. My research touches on primary elections, the changing demographics of the American electorate, representation of sub-groups, and issues of election administration.
