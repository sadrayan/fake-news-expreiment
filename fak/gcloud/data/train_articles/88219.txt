David Morgan has been re-elected for a third term as Escambia County Sheriff.

Morgan took 105,342 votes (73 percent), Rex Blackburn — a former deputy running with no party affiliation — received 36,178 votes (25 percent), and write-in James Brooks got 2,618 votes (2 percent).

Tuesday night, Morgan celebrated with friends and supporters at Sonny's BBQ on Ninth Avenue.

"It's always a humbling experience to have citizens select you," Morgan said in a phone interview. "It's a report card. Every four years, you are re-interviewing for your job. When you get results like this, you're getting affirmation that Escambia County citizens approve of the job you're doing."

Morgan said some of his administration's achievements over the past eight years include implementing a blind, merit-based promotion process, increasing the number of neighborhood watch groups more than 10-fold and improving the relationship between the community and the Sheriff's Office.

Some of Morgan's priorities for the next four years include increasing wages for officers, continuing to build on partnerships in the community and cultivating a culture of adaptive and progressive law enforcement.

Morgan was first elected in 2008, defeating then two-term sheriff Ron McNesby.

Morgan took 61 percent of the vote in the August 2016 primary election, stifling a comeback bid by McNesby and staving off political newcomers Doug Baldwin Sr. and John Johnson.
