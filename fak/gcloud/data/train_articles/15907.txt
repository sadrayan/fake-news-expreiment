Subject: RE: 110 a day?

…

I was quoting from an article in the Austin Business Journal earlier this year:

http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/at-the-watercooler/2014/02/how-many-people-move-to-austin-a-day-heres-the.html. I looked at the title last week, and although the title makes this statement on looking at now it says net population increase of 110 per day.

Good afternoon.

It looks to us right now like the city nets about 40 migrants a day. I’d be happy to share who did the calculations on this. To this moment, meantime, the city hasn’t told us how it calculated the 110 figure, which appears to apply to the five-county region.

Although it is true that this ABJ article specifically says “Austin” and not the “area, I misspoke and should have said “area” rather than “Austin”.

Attached is a headshot.

Apparently others have read the ABJ article as well:
