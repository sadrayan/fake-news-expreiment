Fast Track to Lost Jobs : Free Trade Agreements Are Bad Deals for Working Americans
President Obama is currently negotiating two massive new free trade agreements that, if enacted, are likely to result in increased outsourcing and growing job losses, especially in the manufacturing sector. He has asked Congress for “Fast Track” authority, which would allow him to submit trade agreements to Congress without giving members of Congress the opportunity to amend the deal.

Likewise, in the first two years the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) took effect, U.S. exports to Korea declined, and growing trade deficits with that country resulted in nearly 60,000 lost U.S. jobs.
