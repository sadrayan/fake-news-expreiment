Silent On Shooting Of Congressman, Obama Reemerges To Praise Former Drug Dealer
Former president Barack Obama has been shooting his mouth off about everything lately.

He doesn't like President Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, hates his new budget proposal and really can't stand the Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. On each topic, Obama has been highly vocal, seeking out media coverage.

But when a Republican congressman was shot and badly wounded last week during a practice for a bipartisan congressional baseball game — silence. Not a peep.

Yet Obama did reappear to praise former crack cocaine dealer and one-time thug Jay-Z in a video for his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Jay-Z, real name Shawn Corey Carter, has spoken often of his drug dealing days. “One person who spent time with both Jay Z and DeHaven [Irby] during the early 1990s estimates that Jay Z was moving a kilogram of cocaine (a $12,000 value before the fourfold street markup) per week,” wrote Zack Greenberg in a book titled Empire State of Mind, Daily Beast reported. “‘He was definitely involved in the narcotics game,’ says the source, who asked to remain anonymous. ‘There’s no denying that.’”

Of course, Jay-Z has made a good life since. He's settled down, become a gazillionaire and is married to Beyonce.

Still, it's just a bit odd that Obama said nothing about the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise, but makes time to praise the one-time thug.

Oh, and get a dig in at the uncool president now, Donald Trump.

“I’m pretty sure I’m still the only president to listen to Jay Z’s music in the Oval Office,” Obama said in the brief video. “That may change at some point but I’m pretty sure that’s true now.”

Typical Obama.
