Missing Children
When a child goes missing the National Center for Missing & Exploited ChildrenÂ® is ready to assist families and law enforcement agencies 24 hours a day. Each case brings its own set of unique challenges, and NCMEC is prepared to help meet those challenges.

NCMEC's case management teams work each case on an individual basis by providing coordinated support and access to analytical and technological resources. NCMEC is prepared to assist in all missing child cases, even when a child has been missing for a long period of time, was abducted internationally by a parent or has special needs.

NCMEC works closely with more than 270 corporate photo partners who disseminate photos of missing children to millions of homes across the U.S. every day. NCMEC is able to assist in the most serious child abduction cases by sending specially trained, retired law enforcement professionals to provide support and technical assistance to local law enforcement agencies.

No missing child is ever forgotten, no matter how long they have been missing. Through the Biometrics Team NCMEC coordinates the collection of DNA, dental records and other unique identifiers from family members to search for potential matches, even for long-term cases. The Case Analysis Unit provides direct analytical support to law enforcement for missing and unidentified deceased child cases.

Every day NCMEC works to find missing children and reunite them with their families.
