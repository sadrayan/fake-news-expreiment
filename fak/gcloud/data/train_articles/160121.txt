Quote of the Day: Ted Nugent Threatens Barack Obama
The washed-up rocker and Romney endorser says he'll be in jail or dead if the president is reelected.

Ted Nugent -- the proud gun-owner, poorly coiffed Michigander, and washed-up rocker -- has said some silly and offensive things in the past, and not just while performing "Cat Scratch Fever." In 2007, he said the following during a concert: "Obama, he's a piece of shit. I told him to suck on my machine gun. Hey Hillary [Clinton], you might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch."

So that's his level of political discourse. Of course, he seems to be speaking figuratively if distastefully. But he made another rather appalling statement over the weekend at the NRA convention in St. Louis:

If Barack Obama becomes the president in November, again, I will be either be dead or in jail by this time next year.

He also recommends decapitating Democrats: "We need to ride onto that battlefield and chop their heads off in November." (The folks brandishing rifles in the background of the video above add another element of surrealism to the proceeding.)

Again, it's hard to take this as a literal threat of assassination against the president, but how else would Nugent have us understand it? It goes without saying that comments like this have no place in politics. Indeed, the Secret Service tells New York that they're investigating his statement (not that they don't have other things to worry about at the moment. Nugent will likely end up with a slap on the wrist, if that).
