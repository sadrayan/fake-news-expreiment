Corporation tax rates

Federal rates

The basic rate of Part I tax is 38% of your taxable income, 28% after federal tax abatement.

After the general tax reduction, the net tax rate is 15%.

For Canadian-controlled private corporations claiming the small business deduction, the net tax rate is 10.5%.

Provincial or territorial rates

Generally, provinces and territories have two rates of income tax â€“ a lower rate and a higher rate.

Lower rate

The lower rate applies to the income eligible for the federal small business deduction. One component of the small business deduction is the business limit. Some provinces or territories choose to use the federal business limit. Others establish their own business limit.

Higher rate

The higher rate applies to all other income.
