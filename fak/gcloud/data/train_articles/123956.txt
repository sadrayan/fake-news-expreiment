Welcome to Rabbit Rescue & Rehab
Claire and her son Alex are a tightly bonded and loving pair. Both have creamy-soft fur and dark brown eyes, but you can easily tell them apart because Claire has a splattering of fawn-biege speckles running down her back. Both are spayed/neutered, and both are young — Alex is around 5 months old, and Claire is probably a year, if that. Both are extremely friendly and gentle, and enjoy being stroked and loved — especially right between the eyes — by humans. Claire is a bit more relaxed about handling than Alex, but both are ultimately cooperative. Alex and Claire are looking for a home where they can stay together and snuggle with each other for the rest of their lives. Our current bi-monthly newsletter THUMP is available for pdf file download.
