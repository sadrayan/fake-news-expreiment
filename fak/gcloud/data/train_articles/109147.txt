Trump: The Capitol a 'Living Monument to the American People'

UPDATE: A spokesperson for Rep. Gutierrez told a "Daily Mail" reporter that he was not protesting the "USA" chant, but had to leave before Trump finished in order to be on time for an interview with Univision.

Spox to Luis Gutierrez tells me that the congressman wasn't protesting when he left the chamber during "USA!" chants: "He was trying to make it to Univision. He watched the last 90 seconds on TV. It was not a protest or anything. He was just trying to get ahead of the crowd." â€” David Martosko (@dmartosko) January 31, 2018

Rep. Luis Gutierrez turned and left the State of the Union address early Tuesday.

President Donald Trump had just finished mentioning the Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building, which he then called a "monument to the American people."

Gutierrez (D-Ill.) could be seen exiting his aisle seat and walking out of the chamber a few minutes before Trump finished.

A Democratic member patted Gutierrez on the shoulder as he passed.

In a statement, Gutierrez - who announced his retirement this year - called Trump's speech "well-delivered [considering] whoever translated it from Russian did a good job."

Gutierrez also ripped Trump for what he considered the administration's mistreatment of Puerto Rico, saying that Trump is treating it like a "s***hole country."

"For the life of me, I can't figure out when democrats became so... anti-middle America," Deputy White House Press Secretary J. Hogan Gidley said.
