Donald Trump America First and Great Again: Myriam Witcher: 9781533367013: Amazon.com: Books
THE SUCCESS of Mr. Trump in the primaries is evidence that people are frustrated with the path our country is on, and are desperate for change. We have high unemployment, much higher than the government figures show. We have a porous southern border, through which illegal immigrants, terrorists, and illegal drugs can pass. We have over $19 trillion in debt, and deficit spending continues. We have problems with unaffordable health care, crime, and crowded prisons. We are losing U.S. jobs and businesses to other countries. We have potential terrorists that are being allowed into our country. The list goes on. We need a change in direction, a change in leadership that can get our country on the right path. Mr. Trump is unconventional, speaks his mind, and is not always politically correct. But, he is effective. He gets things done. He will put America first. He will negotiate good trade deals. He will build a strong military, and protect our country. He will bring jobs back to the United States.
