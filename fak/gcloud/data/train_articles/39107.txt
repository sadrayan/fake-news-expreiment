President Bush Extends 100% Funding for Debris Removal in Five Louisiana Parishes
NEW ORLEANS, La. -- Chairman Donald E. Powell, federal coordinator of Gulf Coast Rebuilding, announced today the President has made additional disaster assistance available to the State of Louisiana for 100 percent federal funding for debris removal in five Louisiana parishes. Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Tammany, Washington and Plaquemines Parishes will receive the extension through December 31, 2006.

These five parishes represent 96% of the remaining debris resulting from Hurricane Katrina. This is the fourth extension of 100 percent federal reimbursement for debris removal.

The June 30th deadline for full federal reimbursement stands for the majority of parishes in Louisiana. For these parishes, the federal government will continue to pay 90 percent of the cost of debris removal. The state will be responsible for 10 percent and can use its initial $6.2 billion in federal Community Development Block Grant funds to help local communities with these costs.

Gil Jamieson, deputy director of Gulf Coast Recovery for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said, "The extension of the deadline for 100 percent reimbursement for debris removal is a key part of our continuing effort. We remain committed to reimbursing 90 percent of debris removal costs for all other parishes as we work with the states and local communities toward recovery."

To date 42,458,607 cubic yards of wind and storm surge debris have been removed throughout Louisiana. More than 17 million cubic yards of debris remain in the five parishes being extended.

FEMA manages federal response and recovery efforts following any national incident. FEMA also initiates mitigation activities, works with state and local emergency managers, and manages the National Flood Insurance Program. FEMA became part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003.
