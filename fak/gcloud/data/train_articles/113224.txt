back Internet Hoax Be Assured, We Don't Send Unsolicited E-mails Company policy forbids sending of unsolicited e-mails Beaverton, Ore. - Internet users who are receiving and responding to e-mail messages purportedly from Nike are the unwitting victims of a hoax. Several variations are being spread across cyber-space, all claiming offers that seem too good to be true. They aren't.



"Nike never sends unsolicited e-mails over the Internet," said Scott Reames, Nike corp. communications manager. "We do not condone these e-mail hoaxes, and are dismayed that well-intentioned people are being duped into wasting their time."



"If Nike were to make any sort of offer to consumers over the Internet, it would not be via unsolicited or 'chain' e-mails," according to Reames, but through its official Web site - www.nike.com. The company recommends those who receive an e-mail that alleges to be a Nike offer should visit the Web site to verify its authenticity.



"If there is nothing on nike.com that mentions a special offer, then the visitor to the site will know he or she has received a bogus message," Reames said. One of the hoax variations gives an invalid email address at Nike. E-mails sent to this address receive an automatic response informing the sender that he/she has been the victim of a hoax. Another variation alleges Nike will send back a new pair of shoes for every old pair sent to the company for recycling. Nike reiterates that all such offers did not originate with Nike and are false.
