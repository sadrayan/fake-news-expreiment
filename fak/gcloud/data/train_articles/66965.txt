Jindal added that Clinton and Obama each practice broken liberal ideas about capitalism.

“I do worry that Secretary Clinton will continue the failed policies of President Obama,” Clinton told host Bret Baier on “Fox News Sunday.”

“There’s never enough money and power for government on the left,” said Jindal, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate.

“It’s about feeding a greedier and greedier government,” he added.

Jindal argued on Sunday that Clinton is also no different from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is also seeking the Democratic nomination next year.

“At least Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist,” he said.

The Louisiana governor then urged the U.S. not to copy the economic mistakes of Greece.

Greek leaders are currently wrestling with how they will solve their nation’s mounting debt crisis.

“Greece gave us democracy, now they’re showing us how to kill it,” Jindal said. “Let’s not go down that same path.”

Jindal additionally said Sunday that tackling college tuition debt is a key priority.

“In a lot of states tuition is going up,” he said. “This is a huge problem nationally.”

Jindal joined the crowded 2016 GOP presidential field late last month.

He urged other contenders for his party’s nomination on Sunday to embody Republican ideals on the campaign trail next year.

“Let’s embrace our principles,” he said. “We need a doer, not a talker.”

“I will do and say the things you are not supposed to be able to do and say,” Jindal added of his 2016 campaign strategy.
