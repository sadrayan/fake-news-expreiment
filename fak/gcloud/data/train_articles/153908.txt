FACT CHECK: Did a Killer Whale Snatch a Beachgoer?
A video clip passed around via social media seemingly captured an innocent beachgoer being snatched by a killer whale:

Here’s a guy walking on the beach at surf breaking on the sand and he gets snatched in an instant. No blood no struggle … just gone!

Very graphic! He happened to be waving at a friend taking a film of him, and it was his last wave!

If his friend hadn’t been filming, or even looking in that direction there would have been no proof. He was just gone in less than a heartbeat. Too scary …
