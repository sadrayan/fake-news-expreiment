﻿Spouses of U.S. citizens Children (unmarried and under 21) of U.S. citizens

Parents of U.S. citizens (The petitioning citizen must be 21 or older.) Visas are always available for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. This means your family member does not need to wait in line for a visa. Immediate relatives who are in the United States can file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status at the same time as Form I-130. For more information on how your relative can apply to adjust status (get a Green Card) while they are in the United States, see the How Do I Help My Relative Become a Permanent Resident? guide.

Preference categories apply to family members who are not immediate relatives. The visas allotted for these categories are subject to annual numerical limits. A visa becomes available to a preference category based on the priority date (the date the Form I-130 was filed). Preference categories are grouped as follows: First preference : Unmarried, adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (adult means 21 or older.)

: Unmarried, adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (adult means 21 or older.) Second Preference (2A) : Spouses of Green Card holders, unmarried children (under 21) of permanent residents
