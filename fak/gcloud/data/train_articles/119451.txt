SMS Terms and Conditions
Effective March 1, 2009:

By electing to give a donation in response to a Mobile Giving Foundation campaign, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. If you do not agree to be bound or cannot comply with any of the terms and conditions, do not continue the donation.

Terms of your gift: Thank you for contributing to a Mobile Giving Foundation campaign. Your donation is to the Mobile Giving Foundation (MGF), a 501c(3) public charity, which re-grants your donation to the charity(ies) you designated through your text message donation. Your donation will appear as Mobile Giving Foundation on your wireless statement. Per our agreement with all organizations, and in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service, the MGF has the exclusive legal control over all donation amounts. If an organization fails to comply with the MGF Standards for Participation, the MGF reserves the right to disseminate donation amounts to a complementary organization. Please consult your tax or financial advisor for specific questions about your gift. All MGF approved organizations qualify for 501c(3) status and donations should be tax deductible. Please save your wireless operator bill or print a donation receipt at www.mobilegiving.org/SMS_Donations. Your donation is immediate and irrevocable. Accordingly, the MGF cannot refund or cancel your donation. Please check with your wireless operator for operator specific refund policies.

Payment to Designated Organization: The MGF collects donations paid by you from your wireless operator. In some instances, your donation will be deducted from your pre-paid balance with your wireless operator. The wireless operators remit 100% of your donation to the MGF. Within 30 days of the MGF’s receipt of collected donations from the wireless operator, the MGF grants 100% of the donation to the designated organization. (There may be some designated organizations that have permitted the MGF to grant 5-10% of each donation to the MGF to cover administrative costs associated with the MGF’s mission.)
