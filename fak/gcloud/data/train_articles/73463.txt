HISD votes to close 4 elementary schools
HISD trustees voted late Thursday to close four small elementary schools, which each have fewer than 400 students: McDade, Rhoads, Grimes and Stevenson.

The closures are estimated to save the district more than $1.6 million next year.

Students from Rhoads and Grimes are rezoned to Woodson, a combined elementary and middle school.

McDade students will be sent to Paige, Cook and Kashmere Gardens. Stevenson students will go to Memorial and Love.
