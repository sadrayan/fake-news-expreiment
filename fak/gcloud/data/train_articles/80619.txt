The pro-life pulse on abortion policy, industry, happenings
Originally posted June 23, 2015

Dear faithful readers of JillStanek.com:

First, the exciting news: I am honored to have accepted a position at Susan B. Anthony List as itsNational Campaign Chair! Read more at WorldNetDaily.com. Also read SBA’s press release and a a blurb in Politico’s Pulse.

I have been a long-time admirer of Marjorie Dannenfelser and the SBA List team, many of whom are friends. I partnered with the group during the 2012 election cycle for a bus tour exposing Barack Obama’s abortion/infanticide extremism.

This is a new position, for which I will travel the country on behalf of SBA List, speaking to pro-life activists, donors, and voters to promote SBA List’s aggressive campaign strategy to elect a pro-life president in 2016 and advance the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.

This will be a permanent position. After the 2016 election there will be the need to conduct another national pro-life political campaign… and another… and another.

But of immediate importance to me, as you know, is passage of the Pain-Capable Act, because as an RN I witnessed the excruciating deaths of 20 week��abortion survivors who would have been saved had a 20-week abortion ban been in place.

Electing a pro-life president is the gateway to enacting this legislation into law. And, of course, a president also wields a tremendous amount of influence in other areas of importance to pro-lifers, such as funding abortion groups and the pro-death agenda, judicial nominations, and other pro-life/abortion legislation.

I witnessed firsthand how devastating pro-abortion legislators can be when I watched then-state Senator Barack Obama vote four times against the Born Alive Infants Protection Act and take a leadership role in seeing its defeat.

Now, the sad news. Because my position at SBA List will be full-time, I have made the difficult decision to grind almost all activities at JillStanek.com to a halt, after 10 years of blogging here. I will basically be keeping the blog open now for archival purposes, posting my own blogs very infrequently.

After this week we will be streamlining my blog to just those postings, which will also��be published at Live Action News. This means no more quotes of the day, pro-life videos of the day, pro-life blog buzz, or pro-life news briefs. Also, there will be no more commenting. All comments will be directed to my Facebook page.

It has been a great run. After all, were it not for my blog I would never have been named “Worst Person in the World” byKeith Olbermann!

That goofiness aside, we broke many stories of importance here, including information on late-term abortionist LeRoy Carhart’s victims in 2013.

But times online have changed. The timing of all this is good – and God’s.

In the beginning (10 years online are like dog years), pro-lifers had to check several blog and web sources a day to get all the news they needed. Now, in combination with social media, Live Action News, LifeNews.com, LifeSiteNews.com, and StanekReport.com capture everything we need to know. And there are now many great pro-life writers.

Speaking of StanekReport.com, it will soon become HarmsReport.com. Pro-lifer Monte Harms has been the strongest contributor to SR.com behind the scenes and will be ably taking the helm. (Thanks also to Carole, Susie, and Josh for their help with SR.com.)

Monte has a rich pro-life background, having volunteered for Justice for All and Protest ABQand done sidewalk counseling at abortion mills. He has also run the blogsStand for Life and Pro-Life New Mexico.

And what aboutKelli, our site’s glue? I’m happy to report she will begin working for Live Action Newsnext week, doing much of the same work she did here. This blog would not have been held together were it not for Kelli, who has poured herself into it for over six years.

Kelli is but one dear friend I have made here. I can’t begin to name all the wonderful moderators and volunteers who have dedicated themselves on this blog, although I must highlight some special people who were here from the beginning, or nearly the beginning – Bethany,Carla, LauraLoo, andMK.

Special thanks to Carder, Hans, and Susie, who have steadfastly posted great stuff here, so helpful to our cause. And I’d also like to thank our current mods: Del, Sydney, and last but not least Bobby Bambino, who has also been a mod since we began having mods!

But most of all, I want to thank YOU, pro-life readers and activists, for your support of this blog but moreso the sanctity of life.

Prayers appreciated!

For Life Together,

Jill
