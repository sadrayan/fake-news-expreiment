Vote Studies
Last year’s roll call votes point to sharp and clear divisions between the two parties in Congress, with no softening of partisanship in sight.

Party Unity Average Unity Scores Majority Victories Unanimity Presidential Success Presidential Vote Share

The number and frequency of Senate roll call votes in which a majority of Democrats opposed a majority of Republicans rose a bit in 2013 — and the frequency of these party unity votes, 69.8 percent, was the third-highest recorded since 1953. Although the frequency of unity votes fell in the House to 68.6 percent, the past three years have seen the highest degree of persistent partisanship for Congress as a whole since World War II.

House and Senate lawmakers from both parties on average voted more often with their caucus majorities in 2013 than they did in 2012. House Republicans set a record for party support, voting on average with their caucus 92 percent of the time, up from 90 percent. Likewise, Senate Democrats set a record, raising their average party unity score to 94 percent from the previous record of 92 percent.

The majority party’s success rate on votes that split the two parties rose in both chambers in 2013. House Republicans got their way on 88.6 percent of party unity votes, up from 86.0 percent in 2012 and close to a record. Senate Democrats won 84.2 percent of the time, up from 68.7 percent in 2012 though still well below their record of 92.3 percent in 2009 when the caucus held a 60-vote majority.

Senate Senate Democrats voted unanimously on 52 percent of the party unity votes in 2013 – an all-time high for either party in either chamber, up from 40 percent in 2012. The previous high was 2011’s 46 percent. Senate Republicans were unanimous on 31 percent, well above the 13 percent they recorded in 2012 and up from the 26 percent rate they had in 2011.

House House Republicans voted unanimously 35 percent of party unity votes in 2013. It was an all-time high – up from 21 percent in 2012 and beating the previous high of 34 percent set in 2010. House Democrats voted unanimously 22 percent of the party unity votes in 2013, the highest since 23 percent in 2007.

Republicans and Democrats alike voted as unanimous blocs far more frequently in 2013 on roll call votes that divided the two parties. That reversed a two-year decline in unanimous voting by the GOP, though the party fell short of setting a record. Congresswide, Democrats were unanimous more often than in any year since 1960.

Obama’s Success Rate Rebounds in 2013

Year: Fifth year in presidency: President Barack Obama’s success rate on votes on which he took a clear position rose in 2013, which has happened infrequently in the past in a president’s fifth year. Obama won on just 20.9 percent of House votes — a small fraction higher than in 2012. Obama won on 85.2 percent of Senate votes, close to his success scores for 2010 and 2011.

Presidential Success in the House When President Obama made his position known, he won the House's support only 20 percent of the time — about the same rate of success as in 2012. This was down from 2011’s rate and well below his his first two years when the Democrats held the House. Obama's level of success in the House exceeded Bush's 2007 low score of 15.4 percent, while Clinton had higher success scores with a Republican House in all of his six years. Clinton's lowest House score came in 1995 at 26.3 percent.
