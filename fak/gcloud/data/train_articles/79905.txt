WHO: Austan Goolsbee and Jason Furman, Economic Advisors

WHAT: to discuss Senator Obama's economic plan. Monday marks the beginning of Obama's "Change that Works for You" economic tour. Senator Obama will travel across the country, talking to Americans about how the economy affects their everyday lives. He'll hold events with voters where they work and where they live, discussing the challenges we face and his plans to turn the economy around.

WHEN: MONDAY, JUNE 9 12:15 pm ET

SUMMARY:

This conference contrasts the economic policies of Senators McCain and Obama, including discussions such issues as the recent jump in unemployment, rising gas, food, health care prices and foreclosure rates. It labels McCain's positions on the economy a more concentrated version of the economic philosophies and regressive tax policies of the Bush administration. It also describes Obama's positions as aimed at allaying the economic burden on the middle class (<$150,000 per year) through a specific combination of housing relief, stimulus and tax cuts. More broadly, it articulates the philosophy that strong oversight of corporations can restore public trust in free markets.

Note: Due to technical difficulties, a small portion of the question and answer session of this call is missing.
