NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth
An asteroid bigger than a football pitch is currently hurtling towards Earth, NASA has warned.

Dubbed ‘2016 NF23’, the gargantuan lump of space rock has been labelled “potentially hazardous” by the US space agency.

The asteroid is flying towards the planet at a speed of more than 20,000 miles per hour – about 15 times faster than Concorde.

Will it hit Earth?

NASA said the asteroid measures between 230 feet (70 metres) and 524 feet (160 metres) in diameter.





Mercifully, the speeding space rock is not on a collision course with Earth.

Were 2016 NF23 to slam into the planet at top speed, it would be big enough to destroy an entire city, killing millions of people upon impact.

Luckily the asteroid will skim past Earth shortly after 1am UK time on Wednesday 29 August.
