Here are the federal agencies and programs Trump wants to eliminate
President Trump's budget blueprint proposes to counterbalance a $54 billion increase in defense spending with a slew of steep cuts to discretionary spending programs, including by scrapping federal funding

Those cuts include the complete elimination of a number of agencies and programs across the federal government. They include some familiar names, like the Energy Star program and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), as well as more obscure programs that do things like fund airports in rural areas, help low-income families, fight climate change and develop clean energy technologies.

In the budget blueprint the administration asserts that many programs, like LIHEAP, are targeted for elimination because of a failure to demonstrate efficacy. Others, like the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), are being eyed for elimination due to a belief that the private sector can handle those functions better. Still others, like the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Account, are said to be duplicative with other federal functions.

A list of agencies and programs targeted for elimination is below, with one major caveat: Many other projects are likely on Trump's proposed chopping block, as the budget blueprint refers in several places to programs targeted for elimination without specifically naming them.
