Fiscal Year 2015 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill Approved by House Holds the line on spending for House offices, freezes pay for Members of Congress

Washington, May 1, 2014

The U.S. House today approved the fiscal year 2015 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill (H.R. 4487), to provide annual funding for the offices of Members of the House of Representatives, the support agencies of Congress (including security), services for visitors, and Capitol operations and maintenance. The bill was approved on a vote of 402-14.

The total provided for the House and joint operations, excluding Senate-only items, is $3.3 billion. This is the same as the fiscal year 2014 level, and it is $122.5 million below the President’s request. In all, funding for the House of Representatives has been reduced by 14% since Republicans gained its control in January 2011.

The legislation also includes a provision to freeze the pay of Members of Congress, preventing any pay increases in fiscal year 2015. A freeze on the salaries of Representatives has been in place since 2010.

“I’m pleased the House has passed this bill that allows the House of Representatives to lead by example – to tighten our belts at a time when American families and government agencies are asked to do the same thing,” Chairman Hal Rogers said. “Yet at the same time, the bill preserves and maintains this hallowed edifice that houses our great democracy, supports the services that keep the Congress working, and allows thousands of visitors to witness democracy in action in an accessible and safe way.”

“After multiple hearings and meetings with agency heads who brought a variety of concerns before our Subcommittee, I am pleased that the Legislative Branch funding bill passed the House today. For every American and hundreds of millions of others across the globe, our nation’s Capitol complex is a symbol of freedom and democracy – an image that requires creative and careful upkeep. Not only does the bill show that lawmakers can craft legislation in a bipartisan manner, but it also encourages fiscal responsibility right here on the Capitol grounds and does so while still adequately funding the agencies’ priorities and providing for their invaluable services,” said Subcommittee Chairman Tom Cole.
