Rebuilding and Replanting After Hurricane

October’s Hurricane Michael destroyed much of the 29,000-acre Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. It also offered an opportunity. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Air Force had long planned to replace much of Tyndall’s pine forests with longleaf pine, the preferred habitat for a slew of at-risk species. With 75 percent of the pines on the base sheared in half by the hurricane, the plan can now be implemented.
