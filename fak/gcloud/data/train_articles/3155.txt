School Funding Reform: House Members Talk About Dramatic Vote
It took three roll call votes Monday before an education funding measure passed in the Illinois House. In the end, there was still division on both sides of the aisle over whether education funding in Illinois is finally on the right track, or if the new law is one the state just cannot afford.

Joining us to explain why they voted as they did:

State Rep. Will Davis (D-East Hazel Crest) who chairs the Elementary and Secondary Education Appropriations Committee and worked on the governor's School Funding Reform Commission. He was a yes vote.

State Rep. Bob Pritchard (R-Sycamore), the ranking Republican on the Elementary and Secondary Education Appropriations Committee who also sat on the School Funding Reform Commission. He was a yes vote.

State Rep. David Harris (R- Arlington Heights) who voted no.

State Rep. Will Guzzardi (D-Chicago) who voted no.
