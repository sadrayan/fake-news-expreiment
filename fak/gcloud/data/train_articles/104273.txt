Versailles Oaks
The fire department in Paris followed a protocol: Save the people, save the art, save the altar, save what furniture you can, then focus on the structure, in that order. They know what can be rebuilt and what can't. This protocol has been in place since the last time the cathedral was destroyed, sacked during the French revolution. The steeple and the beams supporting it are 160 years old, and oaks for new beams awaits at Versailles, the grown replacements for oaks cut to rebuild after the revolution. https://twitter.com/_theek_/status/1117895531563372544?s=21
