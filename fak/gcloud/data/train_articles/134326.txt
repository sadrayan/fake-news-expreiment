About

Founded in 1925, The New England Council is the nation’s oldest regional business organization.

The Council is a non-partisan alliance of businesses, academic and health institutions, and public and private organizations throughout New England formed to promote economic growth and a high quality of life in the New England region.

The New England Council’s mission is to identify and support federal public policies and articulate the voice of its membership regionally and nationally on important issues facing New England. The Council works to foster positive working relationships between its members and key federal policy makers, including members of Congress and leaders of key federal agencies. As a non-partisan organization, the Council has forged strong relationships with leaders on both sides of the aisle, and has won the respect of Democrats and Republicans alike.

Members of the New England Council include businesses and organization large and small from throughout the six New England states. Members represent a wide variety of industries and sectors, including energy, financial services, health care, higher education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation.

Through a variety of events and forums throughout the six New England states and in Washington, DC, the Council provides its members with access to those policymakers, while also serving as a resource to those leaders as they work to craft policies that support economic growth.
