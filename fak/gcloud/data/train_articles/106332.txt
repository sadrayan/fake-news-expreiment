June 12, 2016

The shooter who killed 20 and wounded 42 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Omar Mir Siddique Mateen, was a registered Democrat who has voted in at least 3 recent general elections, according to voters.findthedata.com . He registered to vote on July, 19,2006, but skipped the election that November. But he voted by absentee ballot in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, presumably for his partyâ€™s candidate, Barack Obama. He even voted in the off year 2014 general election, this time showing up at the polls to vote, perhaps a sign of increasing political enthusiasm.
