NH nudity bill ignites social media firestorm

A New Hampshire state representative is upset about the actions of two colleagues after they made controversial remarks on social media about a proposed bill.

The proposed bill would allow cities and towns to outlaw women exposing their nipples, except in the case of breastfeeding.

The legislation was filed after a movement called “Free the Nipple” that made female toplessness acceptable to New Hampshire last summer.

“The bill is sexist and unconstitutional. And that's all it is at the end of the day and that should be enough to kill a bill,” said Rep. Amanda Bouldin (D). “I definitely think that in 2016 there shouldn't be any law that begins with ‘a woman may not.’”

Bouldin’s comments about the bill on Facebook were met with stinging rebuke from two of her colleagues, including the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Josh Moore.

Moore wrote, “If it’s a woman’s natural inclination to pull her nipple out in public, then you should have no problem with a man’s inclination to stare at it and grab it.”

Rep. Al Baldasaro responded with, “No disrespect, but your nipple would be the last one I would want to see.”

“What Al said was really rude. And it hurt my feelings a little,” Bouldin told FOX25.

When FOX25 asked Baldasaro about his comments, he did not back down on his comments.

“I'm not apologizing for nothing. I mean. I have no reason whatsoever to see the breast of a colleague,” Baldasaro said. “I'm a tell-it-like-it-is guy. I hold no punches I take nothing personally.”

Baldasaro told FOX25 he does not agree with all aspects of the bill, but suggests the advent of public nudity in New Hampshire makes the Moore Bill necessary.

FOX25 could not reach Moore for comments.
