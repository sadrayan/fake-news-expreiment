Gov. Perry Names Deirdre Delisi Chief of Staff

AUSTIN - Gov. Rick Perry today appointed Deirdre Delisi as his new chief of staff. Delisi, 32, has served as senior deputy chief of staff since last November and deputy chief of staff prior to that. She also was director of Perry's 2002 campaign.

"Deirdre Delisi is one of the brightest and most capable individuals to ever serve on my staff," Perry said. "She brings to the job a depth of knowledge and a boundless energy that will be important as we head into the 2005 legislative session."

Delisi, a graduate of Duke University, received a master's degree in international policy studies from Stanford University. She replaces Mike Toomey, who resigned effective Monday.

"Since the day I went to work for Governor Perry in 1997, I have been impressed by his deep commitment to providing greater opportunity for the people of this state, and I am honored he has asked me to serve in this new capacity," Delisi said.

Prior to going to work for Perry when he was lieutenant governor, Delisi worked for former state Sen. Bill Ratliff. She also was a policy adviser on President Bush's first presidential campaign.

Perry also promoted Jay Kimbrough to deputy chief of staff. Kimbrough has served as senior advisor, homeland security director and director of criminal justice for Perry.

Phil Wilson also will continue in his post as deputy chief of staff.
