U.S. Marshals Service, Operation FALCON: Federal and Local Cops Organized Nationally
Operation FALCON: Federal and Local Cops Organized Nationally Operation FALCON is a nationwide fugitive apprehension operation coordinated by the United States Marshals Service (USMS). The resources of federal, state, city and county law enforcement agencies are combined to locate and apprehend criminals wanted for crimes of violence.



Operation FALCON was conducted April 4, 2005 through April 10, 2005 across the United States and its Territories.



The emphasis centered on gang related crimes, homicides, crimes involving use of a weapon, crimes against children and the elderly, crimes involving sexual assaults, organized crime and drug related fugitives, and other crimes of violence. No single agency can solve the problem of violent crime alone. The USMS network of 88 District and Regional Fugitive Task Forces provided the infrastructure for Operation FALCON.



In the honor of the victims, Operation FALCON was conducted in conjunction with National Crime Victimâ€™s Rights Week. One fundamental objective of the criminal justice system is to vigilantly pursue offenders, creating a safer community for victims and others.
