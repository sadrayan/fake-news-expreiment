Russ for Wisconsin Raises $3.35 Million in Q1

Over 30,000 Wisconsin Contributors

96% of Contributions $100 or less, Average Contribution $49.59

Badger Pledge Remains on the Table

MIDDLETON -- Russ for Wisconsin announced today that the campaign has raised $3.35 million in the first quarter of 2016.

The figure demonstrates a strong start for Russ as the campaign season hits full stride.

Strong grassroots support continues to serve as the backbone of Russ’s campaign. Over 30,000 Wisconsinites have contributed to Russ’s bid for the U.S. Senate. Russ’s contributors hail from all 72 of Wisconsin’s counties. 96% of all Q1 contributions are $100 or less. The average contribution for Q1 is $49.59.

“Tens of thousands of Wisconsinites continue to contribute their time and their resources to building this campaign,” Russ said. “While Sen. Johnson is content with letting the three super PACs solely devoted to his bid speak on his behalf, the people of Wisconsin are making it clear that they want leaders who will fight for middle class and working families -- not just wealthy and powerful corporations. I’m very grateful to have such broad grassroots support, and I'll continue to listen to and fight for the people of Wisconsin throughout this campaign.”

Since announcing his candidacy, Russ has traveled to all 72 counties, listening to Wisconsinites in every corner of the state. In June of last year, Russ offered the Badger Pledge to Sen. Ron Johnson to limit outside spending in this campaign. As the Koch Brothers' dark-money arm, Americans for Prosperity, currently runs a million-dollar statewide TV ad backing Sen. Ron Johnson, today marks 300 days without a response from Sen. Johnson on the Badger Pledge.
