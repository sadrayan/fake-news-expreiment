Three years on, Buhari’s government has struggled to meet the target it set itself. The National Bureau of Statistics estimates some 1.21 million jobs were created from the third quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2016.

This fell short of the 3 million jobs goal.

Unemployment has also risen – from 8.2% in the second quarter of 2015 to 18.8% in the third quarter of 2017. Under the current government the number of unemployed Nigerians increased from 6 million to about 16 million as at September 2017.

The underemployment rate has also soared to 21.2% or about 18 million of Nigerians in the labour force. The underemployed are those who work between 20 and 40 hours a week. -Africa Check, May 2018
