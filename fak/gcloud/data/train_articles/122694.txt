(a) Any person operating a place of business wherein tobacco products, herbal cigarettes, liquid nicotine, shisha or electronic ciga- rettes are sold or offered for sale may perform a transaction scan as a precondition for such purchases. (b) In any instance where the information deciphered by the trans- action scan fails to match the information printed on the driver's S. 684 3 license or non-driver identification card, or if the transaction scan indicates that the information is false or fraudulent, the attempted transaction shall be denied. (c) In any proceeding pursuant to section thirteen hundred ninety- nine-ee of this article, it shall be an affirmative defense that such person had produced a driver's license or non-driver identification card apparently issued by a governmental entity, successfully completed that transaction scan, and that the tobacco product, herbal cigarettes or liquid nicotine had been sold, delivered or given to such person in reasonable reliance upon such identification and transaction scan. In evaluating the applicability of such affirmative defense the commission- er shall take into consideration any written policy adopted and imple- mented by the seller to effectuate the provisions of this chapter. Use of a transaction scan shall not excuse any person operating a place of business wherein tobacco products, herbal cigarettes, liquid nicotine, shisha or electronic cigarettes are sold, or the agent or employee of such person, from the exercise of reasonable diligence otherwise required by this chapter. Notwithstanding the above provisions, any such affirmative defense shall not be applicable in any civil or criminal proceeding, or in any other forum. [5.] 7.

No licensee or agent or employee of a licensee shall resell or disseminate the information recorded during such a scan to any third person. Such prohibited resale or dissemination includes but is not limited to any advertising, marketing or promotional activities. Notwithstanding the restrictions imposed by this subdivision, such records may be released pursuant to a court ordered subpoena or pursuant to any other statute that specifically authorizes the release of such information. Each violation of this subdivision shall be punishable by a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars. [6.] 8.

The commissioner and state commissioner of motor vehicles shall jointly promulgate any regulations necessary to govern the recording and maintenance of these records by a licensee under this chapter. The commissioner and the state liquor authority shall jointly promulgate any regulation necessary to ensure quality control in the use of the trans- action scan devices under this chapter and article five of the alcoholic beverage control law.
