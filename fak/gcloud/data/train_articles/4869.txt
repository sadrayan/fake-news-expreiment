* This table was updated on 09/28/2017. In the previous version, age was calculated by subtracting the patient's birth year from the year of the procedure (year-to-year). In this updated table, age is calculated by subtracting the patient's full date of birth from the full date of procedure (date-to-date).

** Includes both Texas residence and Texas occurrence induced terminations of pregnancy.

^ Based on the 83rd Texas Legislature requirement, starting with 2014 Induced Terminations of Pregnancy (ITOP) data, fetus age is reported in weeks post-fertilization versus the previously reported weeks of gestation. Post-Fertilization Age (PFA) is generally two weeks less than gestational age.

***Out of State ITOPs are procedures performed outside of Texas to Texas residents. Of 908 cases with Procedure Type Not Stated, 901 are Out of State procedures.

^^ Indicates all cases with Not Stated are Out of State procedures.
