Album cover of WTC blast pulled

(CNN) -- For the album cover of its new CD, "Party Music," the Oakland, California-based hip-hop group The Coup pictured its two members, "Boots" Riley and DJ Pam the Funktress, in front of the exploding twin towers of the World Trade Center.

In the picture, DJ Pam is holding two sticks while Riley holds what appears to be a detonator. The artwork was designed in July and was preliminary; the album is due to be released November 6.

Riley was shocked and expressed great regret when the image came true.

"All life is precious and this tremendous tragedy is by no means taken lightly by The Coup," he said in a statement. "This is a very unfortunate coincidence and my condolences go out to the families and friends of the victims."

The intent, he said, was to use the World Trade Center to symbolize capitalism "and was not supposed to be realistic in its depiction." The Coup is known for its political activism.

"The Coup are deeply saddened by this horrible tragedy," Toni Isabella, general manager of the group's label, 75 Ark, said in a statement. "The Coup advocates change, but change through peaceful means, never through violence."

Daria Kelly, director of sales for the label, told Reuters the artwork was pulled from the label's Web site by 9:30 p.m. PDT Tuesday. The cover will be redesigned.
