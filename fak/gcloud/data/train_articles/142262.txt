Hillary Clinton and Gold Star Mothers
To Whom It May Concern

Subject: Gold Star Mothers meeting with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton

The information you refer to is totally false.

At the time this allegation was made Senator Clinton was not even in her office. These allegations were not initiated by the Gold Star Mothers that Senator Clinton would not see them. This is a fabricated report picked up by an individual using the Gold Star Mothers as an instrument to discredit Senator Clinton.

Four Gold Star Mothers and a Vietnam veteran made an appointment with Senator Clinton at a later date and were very well received.

Photographs were made with Senator Clinton and she presented each one with a signed proclamation paying tribute to the American Gold Star Mothers.

We regret any embarrassment this may have caused Senator Clinton and her staff and would like to move beyond this issue and continue the positive volunteer work which we willingly and graciously provide for the veterans and their families and support of other Gold Star Mothers.

American Gold Star Mother are a strong group of women who have sacrificed sons or daughters in conflicts to preserve the freedom that we enjoy. We do not need mischievous gossip and unfounded lies to promote our organization. Please help stop it now.

Sincerely,

Dorothy M. Oxendine

National President

Ann Y. Sherman Wolcott

National 1st Vice President
