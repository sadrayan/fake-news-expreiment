If not, what would be correct?

No. if the federal waiver is approved, then according to HB 866, students in 3-8 will be required to take eleven tests. Those who do not pass the required tests, will have to take additional tests.

The grades 3–8 assessment system defined by HB 866

would include these assessments:

Eleven required administrations (i.e., required for all

students):

• reading: grades 3, 5, 8

• mathematics: grades 3, 5, 8

• writing: grades 4 and 7

• science: grades 5 and 8

• social studies: grade 8

Six contingent/optional administrations (i.e., required

for students who did not achieve a high enough score

on a previous grade’s subject test or administered to students in a district that chooses to administer the

tests):

• reading: grades 4, 6, 7

• mathematics: grades 4, 6, 7
