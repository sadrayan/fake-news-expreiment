Staff at B&Q have been told to read Fifty Shades of Grey to prepare themselves for “sensitive” customer questions about rope, cable ties and tape.

A memo to the 20,887 employees of the hardware store chain advises them to be prepared for a sharp increase in sales of the products, featured in the film of the book released this weekend.
