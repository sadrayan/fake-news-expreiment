Has Jamie Dornan walked away from Fifty Shades of Grey?
Despite the news that Fifty Shades of Grey is now the most successful 18-rated film in UK history, fans of the film are in turmoil. Jamie Dornan, who plays billionaire Christian Grey, is rumoured to have pulled out of the sequels.

It is understood that Dornan's wife, actress Amelia Warner, is unhappy about the explicit sex scenes. Australian magazine NW has reported that Dornan will not return for Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed.

An "insider" told NW magazine: "Jamie said the movie would skyrocket his career. He tried to assure Amelia nothing would change but women all over the world now lust after Jamie. She hasn’t seen the film and I don’t think she will to be honest."
