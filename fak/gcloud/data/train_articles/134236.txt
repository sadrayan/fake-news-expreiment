College Student Set To Cut Off Penis If Donald Trump Builds Wall
Seth Greenberg, a freshman at the University of California has announced that he will publicly remove his penis if a wall is built on the Mexico-United States border.

Since President-elect Trump’s promise to build a wall on the southern border, many on the left have feverishly fought back against the idea. However, no words or actions have been nearly as strange as Greenberg’s potential plans to cut off his penis as a way to ‘bring worldwide attention’ to the topic.

In a recent interview, the student didn’t hold back his feelings about the construction of the wall:

I’m so confident that Trump is full of [expletive],that I will cut my [expletive] off, publicly if he adds even a mile of new wall” said Greenberg.

As confident as Greenberg may be, President-elect Trump reiterated his intentions to build a wall at a press conference last Wednesday.

The President-elect corrected a reporter that brought up the plans for a ‘fence’:

On the ‘fence’—it’s not a fence. It’s a wall. You just misreported it. We’re going to build a wall, Responded Trump.

Greenberg speaking to reporters about his potential plans.

Much to Greenberg’s dismay, the President-elect even took the plans one step further:

I could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get into office. But I don’t want to wait.

Despite doubts of Greenberg’s claims, he has made it clear that he was completely serious about the promise:

I will really do this. I feel that if he does actually build any of the wall, me removing my penis publicly will bring worldwide attention to the injustice being inflicted against the Mexican people.

Expect to hear more from this story as Trump’s presidency fast approaches.
