The terror group is suffering from The terror group is suffering from crippling losses on every front of what was once a feared, deadly swath of Iraq and Syria controlled by the terror group. The fighters who have not surrendered are being bombed mercilessly by allied forces. Now, what fighters are left are scattered and getting desperate.
