Cuomo Weighs State of Emergency for New York City Public Housing
“I have been asked by the residents to declare an emergency, and I have no problem declaring this an emergency, because it is a health and safety emergency,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference after meeting with tenants.

After the visit he described the conditions as “disgusting,” and his office announced that he had directed the state health department to investigate health and safety violations at Nycha properties.

Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who served as the federal housing secretary under President Bill Clinton, was invited to tour the housing complex by a group of tenants who filed a lawsuit last month against Nycha for failing to keep tenants safe from lead and involve them in policymaking.

His foray into the troubles facing Nycha comes as the agency is still reeling from an investigation last year that found it had filed false paperwork on lead inspections. The report found that Ms. Olatoye knew of the falsifications, a disclosure that prompted calls for her to resign and that intensified tenant criticism of her agency. But Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has defended her.

Mr. Cuomo blamed Nycha’s delayed repairs of its aging buildings on years of mismanagement and a “maze of bureaucracy,” which he said could be circumvented with the appointment of an independent entity through an emergency declaration.
