FACT CHECK: Gabourey Sidibe Death Hoax
On 28 March 2016 the web site Daily Media Buzz published an article reporting that actress Gabourey Sidibe had died of a “apparent asthma attack” on a film set:

Empire actress died suddenly this afternoon from an apparent asthma attack. Gabourey Sidibe was introduced to the world for her role in the movie precious and was also known for her role as Becky on the hit tv show Empire. Sidibe was on set for another upcoming movie where she plays as a detective her role required her to run and chase a suspect during the scene Sidibe began to motion with her hands that she couldn’t breath and than instantly collapsed.

The claim spread farther when secondary web outlets framed it as a question:

The claim was news to Sidibe, who took a swipe at the quality of the article behind the rumor in a 28 March 2016 tweet:

So many people have tweeted me that I'm dead. Maybe I am. Perhaps my version of Hell is people believing poorly written articles about me. — Gabourey Sidibe (@GabbySidibe) March 28, 2016

Daily Media Buzz (the originator of the “poorly written” death hoax) is a well-known purveyor of fake news. Items published by the site prior to the Gabourey Sidibe death hoax include claims Cam Newton fixed the Super Bowl, lottery winners Lisa and John Robinson were giving away their riches, Sean Penn had died, an obese woman starved her seven kids, and baby with medically impossible deformities survived an abortion and was found in a dumpster.
