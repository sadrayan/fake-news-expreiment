Senator Bryce Reeves Files FOIA Request to Governor McAuliffe

FREDERICKSBURG, VA—Senator Bryce Reeves (R-Spotsylvania) submitted a FOIA request for all communication between the Governor’s Office and the Clinton Campaign. His statement on the matter is listed below and the request is attached.

“Today, I’m filing a request for all communication between the Governor’s Office and the Clinton Campaign regarding the restoration of voting rights for felons. Governor McAuliffe’s rushed order to give felons voting rights is motivated by his desperate attempt to help Hillary Clinton win Virginia in the fall. Sex offenders who are “too dangerous to release” should not be bused to schools and churches at taxpayer expense so they can vote for Hillary Clinton. The Governor needs to start doing what’s in the best interest of Virginians- not the Clinton campaign.”

A small business owner, former Army Ranger, and former Prince William County narcotics detective, Senator Reeves represents the 17th District in the Virginia Senate and is currently serving his second term in the General Assembly. Senator Reeves Chairs the Senate Committee on Rehabilitation and Social Services, in addition to sitting on the Committees on Courts of Justice, General Laws and Technology, Rules, and Privileges and Elections, for which he Chairs the Subcommittee on Certificate, Oath and Confirmation Review. Senator Reeves resides in Spotsylvania County with his wife Anne and their two children.
