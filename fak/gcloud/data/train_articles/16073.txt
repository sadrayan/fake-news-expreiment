I did a little more searching after talking to you and had a look at THE CITIZEN HANDBOOK: HOW THE TEXAS LEGISLATURE WORKS, pdf available on the senate.state.ux.us website. It has a brief description of the Capitol and offers this for further information: "For more information about the Capitol, contact the State Preservation Board at (512) 463-5495." I'm really interested in whether the Senate's version is correct (it makes as much sense as anything) and look forward to hearing what you find out. Another reason, pure conjecture, is that Congress Ave. was already a major thoroughfare and it made sense for the Capitol to face that direction. I just don't want to be made to look a fool for quoting yet another mistaken reason for why it faces south!

It was the massacre at Goliad, not the battle of Goliad, that was so horrific. The senate web site has been fact-checked!
