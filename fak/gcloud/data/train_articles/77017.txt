Birth Control
What is it?

Sometimes, a small piece of the tube is removed.

They also can be closed with clips, clamps, or rings.

The fallopian tubes also can be sealed using an instrument with an electrical current.

One way is by tying and cutting the tubes — this is called tubal ligation.

How does it work?

Sometimes it is possible to reverse the sterilization. Reversal involves another surgery that might not work.

It is supposed to be permanent.

The fallopian tubes are blocked so the egg and sperm can’t meet in the fallopian tube. This stops you from getting pregnant.

How do I get it?

You will need general anesthesia.

Chance of getting pregnant with typical use (Number of pregnancies expected per 100 women who use this method for one year)

Out of 100 women who use this method, less than 1 may get pregnant.

Some Risks

Infection or other complications after surgery

Because it is inserted through the vagina, you do not need an incision (cutting).

You will probably need anesthesia.

The devices are placed into the tubes using a camera placed in the uterus.

How do I get it?

You need to use another birth control method during the first 3 months. You will need a special test to make sure the device is in the right place before you can stop your birth control.

The device works by causing scar tissue to form around the coil. This blocks the fallopian tubes and stops the sperm from reaching the eggs.

How does it work?

Small flexible, metal (containing nickel) coil that is put into the fallopian tubes with a special catheter through the vagina.

Does it protect me from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? No.

Sterilization Surgery for Men (Vasectomy)

This method is for men who are sure they never want to have a child or do not want any more children. If you are thinking about reversal, vasectomy may not be right for you. Sometimes it is possible to reverse the operation, but the likelihood of reversal decreases the more time passes between vasectomy and reversal. Reversal involves complicated surgery that might not work.

What is it?

This is a surgery a man needs only once.

It is permanent.

How does it work?

The surgery blocks a man’s vas deferens (the tubes that carry sperm from the testes).

After this surgery, the semen (the fluid that comes out of a man’s penis) has no sperm in it.

It takes about three months to clear sperm out of a man’s system. You need to use another form of birth control until a test shows there are no longer any sperm in the seminal fluid.

How do I get it?

This is surgery.

Local anesthesia is used.

Chance of getting pregnant with typical use (Number of pregnancies expected per 100 women who use this method for one year)

Out of 100 women whose partner has had a vasectomy, less than 1 may get pregnant.

Some Risks

Pain

Bleeding

Infection

The success of reversal surgery depends on:

The length of time since the vasectomy was performed.

Whether or not antibodies to sperm have developed.

The method used for vasectomy

Length and location of the segments of vas deferens that were removed or blocked.

Does it protect me from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? No.

Long-acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC) These methods last for several years. If you want to get pregnant, you can stop using them at any time.
