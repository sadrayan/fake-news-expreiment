Hyperloop One Global Challenge
The Virgin Hyperloop One Global Challenge kicked off in May 2016 with a call for comprehensive proposals to build hyperloop networks connecting cities and regions around the world. More than 2600 teams registered, and we narrowed the field down to the 35 strongest proposals. The Challenge drew broad support from government leaders, and unleashed bold ideas from some of the worldâ€™s most creative companies, engineers, and urban planners. The final assessment was difficult but, along with our team of expert judges, we selected the ten routes below as winners of the Global Challenge.
