...the deduction only benefits those taxpayers who itemize, who are very disproportionately higher income. Which means they have higher tax rates and therefore greater savings for each dollar deducted, but which also means that the correct statement would have to be “the deduction kept more than $— billion in the family budgets of mainly high income Texas families.”

I now know the comptroller’s office took the average marginal tax rate, 27 percent, and multiplied that by the $4.3 billion in 2012 deductions to get to its $1.2 billion estimate of the tax reduction to deducters in 2012 in Texas. Times that by 10, you get more than $10 billion, as Brady said.

Make sense?

That’s not unreasonable, except that in 2004 the amount deducted was only $3.2 billion, so multiplying the most recent number by 10 gives you a number that is too high. Assume a slighter lower rate of 25%, multiply the 2004 number by 10, and you get $8 billion.
