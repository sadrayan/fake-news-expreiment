Michael Harrington Dinner
A Brief History of the

Debs -- Thomas -- Harrington Dinner The Dinner began as the Debs Day Dinner in 1958 under the auspices of the old Socialist Party of America (then known as the SP-SDF). For the first 13 years, the event was not an awards dinner, but generally featured one or more speakers. Norman Thomas, Bayard Rustin, James Farmer, Charles Chiakulas were among those who addressed the Dinners. The Debs Day Dinner was a part of an older tradition of celebrating Eugene V. Debs' birthday (rather like the Democratic Party once widely celebrated the birthday of Andrew Jackson). Even as the Socialist Party of America lost its hegemony on the left, Debs Day dinners typically drew a broad cross-section of the left. As a birthday celebration of Debs, the Dinner was held in November rather than May as is done today. In 1969, the Dinner became the Thomas -- Debs Dinner in honor of Norman Thomas. It became an awards dinner in 1971. In 1973, the newly formed Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) took over the Dinner's sponsorship. In 1983, DSOC and the New American Movement merged to form the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). DSA has sponsored the Dinner since then. In 1990, the Dinner became the Debs -- Thomas -- Harrington Dinner in memory of Michael Harrington. As you can probably guess, our records for 1958 through 1972 are very fragmentary. It has long been our hope that we could reconstruct at least the main outlines of the Dinners in this period. Can you help us? Copies of old programs, flyers, photographs, etc., would be greatly appreciated. Contact the Chicago DSA office at 773.384.0327 or email chiildsa@chicagodsa.org.
