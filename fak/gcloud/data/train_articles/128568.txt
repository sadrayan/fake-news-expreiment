Cast & Info | The Cromarties
The Cromarties is a comedic half-hour docu-series that follows former NFL all-star Antonio Cromartie and his wife Terricka,as they take on the everyday challenges of raising a blended family of five (soon to be six) kids. For the first time in 11 years since being drafted into the NFL, Antonio is a full-time stay-at-home dad. Terricka loves having Antonio home to help raise their kids, but his intense competitiveness and football-coach parenting style may prove to be too much for the whole house. Antonio and Terricka know that there isn’t a playbook for parenting, and we’ll join them as they make their own rules while navigating the field together.
