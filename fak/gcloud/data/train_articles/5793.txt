Floridians for Solar Choice is a grassroots citizens’ effort working to help more homes and businesses to generate electricity by harnessing the power of the sun. After Governor Deal signed Georgia’s solar law in May 2015, Florida became one of only four states that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from anyone other than a utility. This prohibition limits customer choice and blocks the growth of this abundant, clean homegrown energy source. Because we believe the choice to harness solar power should be available to everyone, our coalition is working to place a constitutional amendment on the 2016 ballot that would give Florida’s families and businesses the right to choose solar power.
