EERE: Renewable Electricity Generation
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) leads a large network of researchers and other partners to deliver innovative solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power technologies that will make solar energy cost competitive with traditional sources of energy. From 1975 to 2008, more solar energy patents were linked to DOE than to any other organization in the world. These efforts have catalyzed growth in a sector that more than doubled the U.S. supply of solar power from 2008 to 2012, reduced solar energy installation costs by more than 30%, and grown to employ more than 100,000 people in all 50 states and several territories.

The Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) drives research, manufacturing, and market solutions through its management of the DOE SunShot Initiative, which is a collaborative national initiative to make solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of energy by the end of the decade.
