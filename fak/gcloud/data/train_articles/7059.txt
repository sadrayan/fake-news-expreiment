Domestic Violence in Insurance
Although federal law offers some protection against discrimination, several states offer more comprehensive protection by enacting laws that prohibit discrimination against domestic violence survivors. States that prohibit discrimination in all four lines of insurance receive a "meets policy." States that do so in three lines of insurance receive a "limited policy," while states that cover only one or two lines receive a "weak policy." States with no protections receive a "no policy."

More current data for this indicator are not available, and the 2007 Report Card therefore uses the data from the 2004 Report Card.
