California Firm Recalls Unwholesome Meat Products Produced Without the Benefit of Full Inspection
EDITOR'S NOTE added on March 20, 2014: As of March 14, 2014, all FSIS recall effectiveness and product disposition verification checks for FSIS Recalls 002-2014 and 013-2014 regarding Rancho Feeding Corporation have been completed. FSIS has determined, based on the number of successful checks (the businesses were notified of the recall, and that they may have received the products), that the recall activities were effective (see FSIS Directive 8080.1, Attachment 1, Table 3). There will be no further additions to the distribution list. Because of widespread interest in FSIS Recalls 002-2014 and 013-2014, FSIS has made a decision to temporarily leave the recall releases and distribution lists in the “active” section of the recalls website, rather than moving it to the “archive” section, as is usual policy, in an effort to continue to make the information as accessible as possible. | Rancho Recall Explained is a plain language explanation of the recall with helpful web links. EDITOR’S NOTE added on February 18, 2014: FSIS decided to reissue the recall release first issued on Feb. 8, 2014 and updated on February 14, 2014. When the recall release was first issued on February 8, FSIS was unable to ascertain the extent of the establishments involved. As the establishments were notified, the list of States affected grew. FSIS now believes that recalled product was shipped to distribution centers and retail establishments nationwide. This update is a consequence of a properly working recall process. Retail establishments may issue their own recall statements to inform the public about products processed with meat associated with this recall. | Additional Information on the Recall

WASHINGTON, Feb. 18, 2014 – Rancho Feeding Corporation, a Petaluma, Calif. establishment, is recalling approximately 8,742,700 pounds, because it processed diseased and unsound animals and carried out these activities without the benefit or full benefit of federal inspection. Thus, the products are adulterated, because they are unsound, unwholesome or otherwise are unfit for human food and must be removed from commerce, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today.

The following Rancho Feeding Corporation products are subject to recall:

"Beef Carcasses” (wholesale and custom sales only) 2 per box "Beef (Market) Heads" (retail only) 4-gallons per box "Beef Blood" (wholesale only) 20-lb. boxes of “Beef Oxtail” 30-lb. boxes of “Beef Cheeks” 30-lb. boxes of " Beef Lips" 30-lb. boxes of "Beef Omasum" 30-lb. boxes of "Beef Tripas" 30-lb. boxes of "Mountain Oysters" 30-lb. boxes of "Sweet Breads” 30- and 60-lb. boxes of “Beef Liver” 30- and 60-lb. boxes of “Beef Tripe” 30- and 60-lb. boxes of “Beef Tongue” 30- and 60-lb. boxes of "Veal Cuts" 40-lb. boxes of "Veal Bones" 50-lb. boxes of “Beef Feet” 50-lb. boxes of “Beef Hearts” 60-lb. boxes of "Veal Trim"

Beef carcasses and boxes bear the establishment number "EST. 527" inside the USDA mark of inspection. Each box bears the case code number ending in “3” or “4.” The products were produced Jan. 1, 2013 through Jan. 7, 2014 and shipped to distribution centers and retail establishments nationwide.

FSIS has received no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that recalled product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.
