The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released the Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Calendar Year 2015 Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates and Part C and Part D Payment Policies (the 2015 Advance Notice) on February 21, 2014. This notice outlines the planned changes to Medicare Advantage (MA) capitation rates applied under Part C for CY 2015 and other regulatory changes that will affect plan reimbursement. Based on information released in the 2015 Advance notice and reductions already being implemented by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) could experience substantial payment reductions for 2015. Such reductions would have a significant impact on the sustainability of MAO program participation and the ability of MAOs to provide stable benefits and beneficiary premiums to their members.
