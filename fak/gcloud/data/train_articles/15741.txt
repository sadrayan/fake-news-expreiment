Susan Bridenstine, Deputy Spokesperson, Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, U.S. Department of State:

We understand that smugglers may sometimes offer to reduce the cost of a transaction involving unaccompanied children, when multiple families, with members already in the U.S. and home country, are involved. Anecdotal reports to U.S. officials, media reporters and others from detained or returned migrants have pointed to the role of social media as an informational source for intending migrants. We refer you to DHS for specifics on operational details related to smuggling.

The congressman said cartels are using social media to offer rebates to lure children to recruit other children to journey north. We lack factual evidence of this and experts note the cartels don’t smuggle people; Central Americans don’t widely have access to or use social media; and rebates are a foreign concept there.

Goodness. I will wait until tomorrow this time for a full reply to my already-stated questions plus this one: Did the briefer say the outreach occurs via social media?

As you know, Mo, I’ve been seeking detailed replies on this topic for about a month.

Who said this and when and where?

Did he or she say cartels?

What did he/she mean by rebates?

Rebates to whom?

What did he/she mean by positive referrals?

Gardner,

In briefings to CODEL Granger, including Representative Cuellar, Embassy Guatemala staff noted that smugglers are known to provide rebates for positive referrals. This information is from Guatemalan government sources.
