Buckeye Firearms Association PAC Endorses Mike DeWine for Governor
COLUMBUS - Buckeye Firearms Association PAC has announced its endorsement of Mike DeWine for Governor and Jon Husted for Lt. Governor in the 2018 Ohio Republican Primary.

Buckeye Firearms Association (BFA) is a nonpartisan, single-issue nonprofit organization that represents over 4 million Ohio gun owners and works to defend and advance the right to keep and bear arms.
