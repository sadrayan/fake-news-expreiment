Delivering Moral Support in a Steady Stream of Pizzas

MADISON, Wis. — Someday the ruckus here might be remembered as the Pizza-Powered People’s Uprising.

Every day for the past week, the two Ian’s Pizza shops in town have fed the hungry masses, delivering hundreds of free pies to the Capitol.

On Wednesday alone, nearly 800 Ian’s pizzas were delivered to the Capitol, often 30 at a time, with police officers and legislative aides, Republican and Democrat alike, also partaking.
