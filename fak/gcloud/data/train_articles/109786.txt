President Obama and Michelle Obama will deliver SXSW keynotes
The White House is going to Austin, Texas.

President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will be the keynote speakers at this year's SXSW festival. They will be the first president and first lady to participate in SXSW.

President Obama will speak on March 11 at SXSW Interactive, sitting down for a Q&A with Evan Smith, the CEO and editor-in-chief of The Texas Tribune. They'll discuss civic engagement in the 21st century.

Meanwhile, First Lady Michelle will speak on March 16 at SXSW Music to discuss her initiative Let Girls Learn, which focuses on the 62 million girls around the world who aren't able to receive an education.

“I can’t imagine a better way to celebrate our event’s 30th year than to welcome both the President and First Lady to SXSW,” co-founder Roland Swenson says in a statement. “As each new generation comes up at SXSW they look for ways they can be of service, and it’s important to reflect and support that message. President and Mrs. Obama’s visit here will inspire attendees to that purpose.”
