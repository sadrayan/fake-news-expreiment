Voting by Nonresidents
Throughout the nation, citizens can only register and vote in one jurisdiction for federal elections.

Local elections can be a different matter. Eleven states have statutes that permit nonresidents, such as second-home owners or business owners, to vote in local, municipal, and/or special district elections such as irrigation, water, sewer and conservancy districts.

Nonresident Voting

Three states allow nonresident voting in municipal or town elections:

Ten states allow nonresident voting in certain special district elections. New Mexico and Delaware have provisions allowing nonresidents to vote in special district elections in addition to municipal elections.
