With the financial mandate imposed by SB 6 on top of other budget pressures, Pinellas board member Carol Cook said she can’t rule out that the district might go back on its contract with the teachers union and revisit the small "step" raises it agreed to give teachers in 2010-11.

“Am I willing to say now we would impose a contract? No. But is that off the table? Nothing is off the table," Cook told The Gradebook during a discussion about the financial implications of SB 6. “I’d like to turn over every stone before we do that. But there aren’t many stones left to turn over.”

SB 6 would create a "performance fund," paid for with 5 percent of district, state and federal funds, that would be used to develop new standardized tests and pay some teachers more for squeezing bigger learning gains out of their students. The first hit from the fund (assuming SB passes and is signed into law) is expected to cost Pinellas about $40 million in 2011-12. That’s on top of the $51 million funding “cliff" - created by the absence of stimulus dollars - that the district faces at the end of 2010-11; on top of class-size costs for the final stage of implementation; and on top of the historic budget cuts of the past few years.

With salaries and benefits eating up 80-85 percent of most district budgets - and no additional money coming from the state - some are predicting that districts will have no choice but to cut base salaries before they can begin to fulfill SB 6's performance-pay goals.
