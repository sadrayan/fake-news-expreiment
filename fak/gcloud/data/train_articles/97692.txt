Important information about ID

Your voter information card is not a piece of ID.

a piece of ID. We accept pieces of ID in their original format. If your document was issued electronically, like an e-statement or an e-invoice, bring a printout or show it on a mobile device.

We accept different pieces of ID from the same source if the documents serve different purposes. For example, we accept an invoice and a transcript from the same school.

Your name and address must be printed on the ID. They can't be added by hand, unless they are added by the issuer of the document, like a residence administrator or a guardian.

We accept expired ID, as long as it has your name and current address.

The pieces of ID listed above are authorized by the Chief Electoral Officer. No other pieces will be accepted.

The pieces of ID required for a federal election are not the same as for provincial, territorial or municipal elections.

Frequently asked questions

Can I use ID with a mailing address  PO box, rural route or general delivery?

Yes, if your mailing address appears in your voter registration file. If you're not sure what address we have on file, check your voter registration here or call your local Elections Canada Office.

Can I use my passport to vote?

Yes. You can use your passport to prove your identity (name). But you also need to show a second piece of ID with your name and address. Why can't my passport count as proof of my name and address? Passport holders write their own address into their passport. For a piece of ID to count as proof of address, the address must be added by the issuer of the document. That's why we accept a passport as proof of identity (name), but not as proof of address.

What is a letter of confirmation of residence? How can I get one?

You can use this letter as your proof of address  along with a second piece of ID  if you live in or receive services from a: student residence

seniors' residence

long-term care facility

shelter

soup kitchen

First Nations' band or reserve

Inuit local authority. This proof of address will be valid only if it is signed by the administrator of one of the facilities listed above. How can I get one? Print the letter of confirmation of residence form and ask the administrator of your facility to complete and sign it. You can ask the administrator to print it for you.

We will also accept a letter from the administrator that is printed on the letterhead of the establishment.

The administrator should contact the local returning officer to make sure the facility is listed with Elections Canada. Facilities can be added to the list once the election has been called.

If the name of the facility is not on our list, your letter will not be accepted at the polls.

When you go to register and vote, bring this letter and a second piece of ID with your name.
