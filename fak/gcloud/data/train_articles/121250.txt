Fox News Reacts to Report About Michelle Fields Being Dropped from Bolling Show
Regular Fox News viewers may be aware that before being thrust into the media spotlight a few weeks ago, former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was a regular panelist on the Fox News weekend program Cashin’ In. The program is hosted by Eric Bolling, co-host of The Five, who’s considered one of Trump’s biggest cable news defenders.

Earlier today, The Daily Beast reported that Bolling’s producer informed Fields that she will not be appearing on Cashin’ In anymore because she can no longer be “impartial” about Trump.

The reason for that would be, in case you need a reminder, that Fields has filed a police report alleging that Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski assaulted her.

But Fox News has provided this statement to Mediaite clarifying and refuting parts of the report:

There was never any discussion or directive to remove Michelle Fields from the program and certainly not by Eric Bolling. The only recent conversation about her appearances on Cashin In was with a show producer last night and they mutually agreed to take her role as a guest panelist on a week to week basis.

We will update this post with any new information as it becomes available.

UPDATE –– 3/19, 12:50 pm EST: Bolling briefly addressed it on Cashin’ In Saturday, and he publicly said she might be back on the show, and it would be odd if he said that after she was permanently let go.
