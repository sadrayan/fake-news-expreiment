WEBVTT MIKE: WELCOME BACK TO "UPFRONT." HE'S BEEN FAIRLY LOW PROFILE SINCE ENDING HIS BID FOR PRESIDENT. BUT GOVERNOR WALKER MAY HAVE JUST OFFERED US A HINT AT WHAT HIS FUTURE HOLDS. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID LAST WEEK AT THE FUTURE WISCONSIN ECONOMIC SUMMIT. GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER: SO WE'RE COMMITTED, NOT JUST OVER THE COUPLE YEARS, FOR THE THREE YEARS THAT I'M GOVERNOR - IF, GOD WILLING, IN THE FUTURE IF VOTERS -- YOU ASK ME TO STAY ON FOR FOUR MORE YEARS AFTER THAT, THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY INTO THE FUTURE EVEN BEYOND THAT TERM, THAT FOCUS THAT WE NEED TO BE PLANNING FOR. MIKE: SO, IS WALKER SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR A THIRD TERM? WE'RE ASKING POLITICAL INSIDERS, SCOT ROSS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LIBERAL ADVOCACY GROUP ONE WISCONSIN NOW, AND CONSERVATIVE BRIAN FRALEY, PRESIDENT OF EDGE MESSAGING. GENTLEMEN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE PROGRAM. BRIAN, WE WILL BEGIN WITH YOU. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD TO SAY. WE ASSUME THIS IS NO ACCIDENT. WHY DID HE FEEL THE NEED TO DROP THAT HINT? BRIAN: IF YOU ARE THE LAME-DUCK AND PEOPLE THINK YOU WON'T RUN AGAIN, WON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR OPINION -- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT HE LAYS THAT OUT THERE. MIKE: ARE PEOPLE NOT LOOKING TO HIM RIGHT NOW? BRIAN: THAT'S NOT THE CASE. IT IS AN IMPORTANT SHOCK TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT I'M STILL THE GOVERNOR HERE. MIKE: DID IT SURPRISE YOU? SCOT: NOT AT ALL. THE GOVERNOR HAS TO DO IT COUPLE OF THINGS. REASSERT HIS POWER. SECOND, HE HAD TO REMIND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT HE HAS A SEVEN-FIGURE CAMPAIGN AND HE CAN SIGN SPECIAL-INTEREST LEGISLATION INTO LAW. IT IS THE ONLY THING HE KNOWS HOW TO DO. THIS GUY IS A CAREER POLITICIAN WHO RAN FOR A STATE OFFICE TWICE BEFORE HE COULD LEGALLY RENT A CAR. HE IS NOT VERY GOOD AT BEING GOVERNOR. OUR INCOME IS DOWN, WE'VE GOT 10,000 LAYOFF NOTICES OUT SO FAR THIS YEAR. WE ARE LAST IN THE MIDWEST AND JOB CREATION. OUR EDUCATION HAS BEEN CUT BY THE BIGGEST IN STATE HISTORY. WE'VE MOVED FROM 16TH TO 30 IN PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND OUR TRANSPORTATION BUDGET IS ALL SCREWED UP. MIKE: THE ARGUMENT WHY SCOTT WALKER CANNOT BE ELECTED YET AGAIN. BRIAN: YOUR DATA IS REALLY OLD. LOOK AT THE DIVERGENT PATHS WE ARE SEEING NOW BETWEEN WISCONSIN AND MINNESOTA, JOB CREATION IS ON THE UPTAKE IN WISCONSIN. OUR LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE IS LOT BETTER THAN IT IS NATIONALLY. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY SCOTT WALKER SHOULD BE REELECTED. THIS IS THREE YEARS AWAY. THERE'S A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER. IF PEOPLE'S MOOD AND ATTITUDE THREE YEARS BEFORE ELECTION MATTERED, RUSS FEINGOLD WOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FOURTH TERM IN THE U.S. SENATE. THREE YEARS AS AN ETERNITY. MIKE: WOULD IT BE BETTER. IF GOVERNOR WALKER DID RUN AGAIN? SCOT: WALKER HAS BEEN DOING THREE THINGS. SIGNING WHATEVER THE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE SENDS THEM, DOING HIS EFFORT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND KEEPING HIS HEAD LOW. I KNOW BRIAN WILL AGREE WITH ME ON THIS ONE THING. THE GOVERNOR NEEDS TO GET OUT THERE AND DO SOME WORK AND RESTORE THAT TRUST AND FAITH LOST WITH THE PUBLIC. BRIAN: THERE IS A BUDGET THAT WILL BE INTRODUCED COMING UP IN A YEAR. THERE IS THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS, SPLITTING LEGISLATIVE SESSION -- SPRING LEGISLATIVE SESSION. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO CONTINUE TO KEEP DELIVERING. YOU CANNOT REST ON WHAT WAS DONE. THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO MOVING FORWARD LIKE SELF-INSURE FOR STATE EMPLOYEES. I HOPE YOU WILL EMBRACE THE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN AGENDA AS IT LAYS OUT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT JUST GOING TO STAND ON WHAT THEY'VE DONE. SCOT: IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE NEXT BUDGET, IF DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO BE YOUR PARTY'S NOMINEE, GOVERNOR WALKER WILL BE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POSITION COME 2017 NEGOTIATING WITH SPEAKER PETER BARCA. BRIAN: THE GOVERNOR RUNNING IN THREE YEARS, IT IS NOT JUST A REFERENDUM ON THE INCUMBENT, HE HAS TO RUN AGAINST SOMEBODY AND YOU'VE GOT NOBODY. YOU HAVE NOBODY UNDER THE AGE OF 60 WHO IS LEADING AND RUNNING FOR ANYTHING. WHO WOULD HE RUN AGAINST? THE GOVERNOR HAS TO RUN AGAINST SOMEBODY AND THE DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE ANYBODY. SCOT: THE DEMOCRATS HAVE COUNTY EXECUTIVE'S, STATE LEGISLATORS AND CONGRESSPEOPLE WHO CAN ABSOLUTELY STEP UP TO THE PLATE. MIKE: DOES HE RUN FOR ANOTHER TERM IN 2018? BRIAN: ASK ME IN A YEAR. ELECTIONS ARE WON IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE TERM. WHAT YOU DO THAT 30 YEAR POSITIONS YOU FOR THE REELECTION. WE ARE YOUR AWAY FROM THE 30 YEAR -- THIRD YEAR. SCOT: THAT IS ALL THE GOVERNOR HAS DONE IN HIS ADULT LIFE APPEARED I EXPECT THE GOVERNOR TO RUN FOR A THIRD TERM. IF YOU WERE TO WIN, HE WOULD HAVE SPENT HALF HIS LIFE IN ELECTED OFFICE. MIKE: HAS HE BEEN DAMAGED BY PRESIDENTIAL BID IN A WAY THAT WILL ALWAYS HAUNT HIM? BRIAN: I DON'T THINK IT IS PERMANENT OR DISQUALIFYING. YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR SELF OUT THERE AND EXERT THAT MUCH EFFORT AND ENERGY TOWARD SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT IMPACTING YOU. CAN HE LEARN FROM THAT, CAN HIS OPERATION GROW FROM THAT, LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES THAT THEY'VE MADE, WHETHER IT'S THE OVERSPENDING OR MISCALCULATION OF WHERE TO SPEND TIME? HE'S A SMART GUY, HE IS IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN. DAMAGED A BIT, BUT IT IS NOT PERMANENT. SCOT: THE ELECTION WILL BE A REFERENDUM ON THE SECRECY, CRONYISM, INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. MIKE: SCOTT ROSS AND BRIAN FRALEY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE PROGRAM. NEXT ON "UPFRONT," THE CANDIDATE MAKING A SECOND RUN FOR STATE SUPREME COURT. JUDGE JOANNE KLOPPENBURG ON WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM HER CONTENTIOUS 2011 COURT RACE. FOR POLITICAL NEWS THROUGHOUT
