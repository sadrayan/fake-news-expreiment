Returning nonprescription items in store or online

We reserve the right to limit or refuse any refund or exchange. All returns or exchanges are subject to a third-party verification process.

Return in Store

Most unopened items in new condition purchased from a CVS Pharmacy� store or on CVS.com� can be returned to any CVS Pharmacy store within 60 days of purchase for exchange or refund subject to the restrictions and requirements below. For faster return processing, please bring your receipt or packing slip, the credit card used to make your purchase, and a valid photo ID.

For any return or exchange, you may be asked for valid photo identification.

Items that are opened or damaged, do not have a receipt, or do not pass our third-party verification process may be denied a refund or exchange.

Items presented for return with the original receipt may receive a refund or store credit in the amount of the original purchase price. If you paid for the item using a credit card or debit/cash card, your refund will be made to the card you used to make your purchase.

Items presented for return without the original receipt may be exchanged for the same item or a refund in the form of a store credit. A refund for a return without a receipt may be limited to the lowest advertised price in the 60-day period prior to the return.
