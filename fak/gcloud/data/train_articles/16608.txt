We draw the referenced figures from Census data, and the fact check you linked uses the most recent data. Texas has the sixth highest, not lowest, mean effective property tax rate on owner-occupied housing.

Of course, this does not make Texas a high tax state. Texas has chosen to rely more heavily on property taxes, and less heavily on other taxes, than many peer states, foregoing some altogether. The state's tax structure is an important part of its economic success, and it is inevitable that, when a state foregoes an individual income tax, some other tax will be somewhat higher than it might otherwise have been. Nevertheless, Texas's effective property tax rate on owner-occupied housing is among the nation's highest, not the lowest.
