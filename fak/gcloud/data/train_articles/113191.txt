Giant Discovered! (themepost) by IronKite

[ view full ] [ e-mail this ] [ comments ]



Contest Directions In this contest you will create a hoax archaeological discovery (i.e. Atlantis, a 2,000 year-old Coca-Cola can or a giant's skull, as in IronKite's themepost). Be open minded, there are many mysteries buried beneath the earth.



The rules of this game are thus:

You are to create an archaeological hoax. Your job is to show a picture of an archaeological discovery that looks so real, had it not appeared at Worth1000, people might have done a double take. As always, quality is a must. We will remove poor entries no matter how much we like you. You'll have 48 hours for this contest, so make your submission count. See the first contest for an idea of what this one is about.
