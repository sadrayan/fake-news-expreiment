Country analysis, industry analysis
We are the research and analysis division of The Economist Group, the sister company to The Economist newspaper. Created in 1946, we have nearly 70 years' experience in helping businesses, financial firms and governments to understand how the world is changing and how that creates opportunities to be seized and risks to be managed. A British company, we are intensely global. We service clients across the world from our 24 offices, our staff speak over 25 languages and we embrace foreign cultures with a passion.

We believe that deep insight comes from bringing together the best data with the best methodologies and the best people. We deploy huge resources to acquiring and checking our economic and market data, including the use of primary research techniques and fieldwork when necessary. Some of our methodologies, frameworks and analytical tools are quantitative, others qualitative. But all are cutting edge. And our people are all experienced country or industry experts, opinionated and well qualified to inform your decision-making.

We are outspoken in our views. Unlike our sister company, The Economist newspaper, much of our work is bespoke for clients and remains confidential. But we share the same fierce passion for independence and integrity. Clients work with us because we are not afraid to tell them what we really think. We never pander to internal agendas or work to buttress some preconceived strategy. We have no vested interest in any specific recommendationâ€”we do not undertake follow-on work to help clients to implement strategies or plan M&A. We just analyse the facts and present our conclusions. We believe that our clients execute better strategies as a result.
