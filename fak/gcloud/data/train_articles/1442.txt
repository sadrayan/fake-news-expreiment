Bush Signs $51 Billion State Budget
TALLAHASSEE â€” Gov. Jeb Bush on Tuesday signed into law a record-breaking $51 billion state budget, but not before hacking out $313.7 million worth of legislators' special projects -- including almost $7 million in Broward County.

"My responsibility is to protect the taxpayers and to advocate limited government," the Republican governor said. "I didn't come up here to be a big-spending liberal, and I'm not. No one should be surprised by that."

Projects he cut range from new high schools and civic centers to parking lots and parks and are liberally scattered across the state. The cuts account for less than 1 percent of the new budget, which also provides for record increases in school spending and $105 million to help restore the Everglades.

Since his 1998 election, Bush has warned legislators that he will not tolerate "turkeys" -- special-interest projects that usually benefit only one legislator's district, have not had a thorough state review and do not meet a statewide need.

"By and large most of these were worthy projects, perhaps, but they didn't meet our criteria. Occasionally there were some put in without any hearing at all. Some of this relates to policy, some to procedures that were not followed."

The governor also vetoed a bill limiting the ability of 15 counties, among them Broward and Palm Beach, to levy school impact fees on new construction. Legislators had set aside $50 million to offset the loss of the fees. But Bush said they were wrong to provide new state dollars to only a handful of counties to build schools.

"If a county has not levied a school-impact fee, it will receive no additional state dollars regardless of growth in student population," Bush said in his veto message. "Fifty-two counties will be locked out of this new program altogether, and nothing in the bill accounts for changing patterns of population growth and school need. Therein lies the unfairness."
