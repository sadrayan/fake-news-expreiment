2018 Midterm Election Wave Watcher Methodology
On a daily basis, Morning Consult surveys registered voters across all 50 states on their elected officials, voting preferences, and more. The results for the 2018 Midterm Wave Watcher were generated by compiling those daily surveys into three month rolling averages for each data set. For example, the most recent data set (July) comes from the results of surveys taken between May 1, 2018 to July 31, 2018.

The data were weighted to approximate a target sample of registered voters based on age, race/ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, and region. Respondents in each state answered questions specific to their senators.

The margin of error for the national averages are +/- 1%. At the state level, the margin of error varies from +/- 1% to +/- 6%. The majority of states have a margin of error below 2%.
