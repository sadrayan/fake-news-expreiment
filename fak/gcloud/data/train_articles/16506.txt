Subject: Urgent inquiry for PolitiFact Texas story

Good afternoon. For a fact-check, could you connect us with Commissioner Sitton?

We are curious about how he reached the figure cited here: “Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left more than 12 million people in Texas and Louisiana without homes.”

Thanks,

Thanks for reaching out. For reference, due to deadlines this article was written shortly after Hurricane Harvey while damages were still being assessed. The sentence below appears to have a typo and will be corrected as follows:

Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left more than 1 million people in Texas and Louisiana without homes.

Commissioner Sitton referenced articles such as www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-harvey-recovery/index.html

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

Katie

When did the article publish? When did the correction run? How did the typo happen? Do you have Sitton’s original version, perhaps time-stamped?

The article originally published Nov. 7, 2017. I was in a rush to submit it mid-September after returning from a trip out of the country and missed the typo when cleaning up the copy, but I’m working with Drilling Contractor to get the correction done.
