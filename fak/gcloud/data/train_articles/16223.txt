David green forwarded your request for backup, background information on the proposed restaurant smoke emission code amendment sponsored by Council Member Renteria and Mayor Pro-Tem Tovo.

You can listen to the April 2nd Council meeting discussion on the item and view the draft of the proposed amendment at the links below.

I do not believe we have a comprehensive list of barbecue restaurants in the City but I will check with a few departments to be sure.
