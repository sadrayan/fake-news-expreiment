Due to its clandestine nature and the lack of uniform and disaggregated data, making accurate calculations on the scale of commercial sexual exploitation of children can be difficult and misleading. These are some related statistics:

Globally, profits obtained from the use of forced labor are estimated at $150 billion per year; about $99 billion from commercial sexual exploitation. Source: “Profits and Poverty: The economics of forced labour,” International Labour Organization, 2014

The most common form of human trafficking (79%) is sexual exploitation. The victims of sexual exploitation are predominantly women and girls.

Worldwide, almost 20% of all trafficking victims are children. However, in some parts of Africa and the Mekong region, children are the majority (up to 100% in parts of West Africa).
