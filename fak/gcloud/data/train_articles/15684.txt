4 p.m.

The mail piece you sent my staff member was sent by our PAC. It was a piece sent to a group of our members living in the district and we made the mistake of not clarifying that Commissioner Daugherty was endorsed by the Statesman in the Primary. We recognize that no endorsement was made by the Statesman for the general election in this district. The piece was developed and mailed as an independent expenditure and the campaign had no knowledge of it. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to speak about this further.

Best,

Emily Chenevert
