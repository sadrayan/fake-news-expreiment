Monsters that roam the night are a myth, right? Demons only exist in Harry Potter books, don't they?

So explain this terrifying footage of a mysterious creature terrorising a neighbourhood.

The giant animal has so far butchered two dogs - a German Shepherd and a Pitbull.

Now neighbours in the town of Santa Fe, Argentina, have been left spooked.

A bizarre photo snapped by a local shows a creature with four, tall and thin legs.

It has a hunchback similar to a camel, a long neck and a face which resembles a horse or a rabbit.

The creature is walking on all-fours and looks to be a humongous 7ft.

But so far, there is only one photo of the beast.

It was posted onto YouTube by UFOmania and has had nearly 30,000 views.

One user commented: "I saw one of these things in 2005,it was crossing a bridge and we came upon it.

"It blew my mind because it looked at us and turned and began moving just like a kangaroo would and cleared the concrete bridge wall easily and dropped at least 15 to 20 feet."

Another said: "Here in the Philippines it is called ASWANG - a man transforms into a monster dog.

"It is a demon it can even shift into a cat or a big bird."



Creepy.
