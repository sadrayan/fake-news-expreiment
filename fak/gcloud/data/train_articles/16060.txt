Please keep in mind the City is only one taxing jurisdiction. There’s also the County, School District, Health District, and then more depending on where exactly someone lives. Appraisals are a factor for taxes, not just the tax rate. We do not track other jurisdictions. You may refer to page 19 of Volume I of the proposed budget that shows a 20-year history of the adopted property tax rates for the City only. The approved budget isn’t available online yet, but the 2015 adopted tax rate is the same as the proposed.
