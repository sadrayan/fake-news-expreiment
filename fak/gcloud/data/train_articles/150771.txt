Draft genome sequence of Pseudomonas oleovorans strain MGY01 isolated from deep sea water.
Pseudomonas oleovorans MGY01 isolated from the deep-sea water of the South China Sea could effectively degrade malachite green. The draft genome of P. oleovorans MGY01 was sequenced and analyzed to gain insights into its efficient metabolic pathway for degrading malachite green. The data obtained revealed 109 Contigs (N50; 128,269 bp) with whole genome size of 5,201,892 bp. The draft genome sequence of strain MGY01 will be helpful in studying the genetic pathways involved in the degradation of malachite green.
