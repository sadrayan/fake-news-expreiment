Macaulay Culkin: 'Satanic' Hollywood Execs Wear Shoes Made From Dead …
Hollywood is controlled by Satanic pedophiles according to Macaulay Culkin, who opened up in a radio interview, describing how one Hollywood executive tried to get him hooked on crack at the age of 11 and boasted that his tailor-made leather shoes were made from the skin of dead child star Heather O’Rourke.

Speaking on radio in France, Macauley Culkin claims he only got out of the industry alive because he was a “smart, suspicious kid” and he “got too famous to be killed… unlike some of the other kids in the industry.”

The explosive claims made by Culkin were reported by French media including Les Echos, a newspaper, however all reports were quickly deleted within an hour of appearing online.

Les Echos reported on the Culkin interview; the headline translates into English as “Macaulay Culkin speaks about Hollywood child abuse live on radio.”

Les Echos have not responded to questions regarding why they deleted the article within an hour of publication, and if they were pressured to do so.

Translated into English: “Macauley Culkin claims Hollywood studio executives rape and murder child stars and use their skin to make boots, belts and wallets that they use as “skin trophies.”’

During the interview, Culkin claimed that children in the entertainment industry “learn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes,” explaining that some of the Hollywood executives wear “skin trophies”.

SKIN TROPHIES

Asked to explain what that phrase means, Culkin said “They wear shoes, belts, and wallets made out of the skin of children that have been ritually murdered.”

Have you seen leather products made from human skin? It has a very unusual, distinctive look. I learned at a very young age to identify it,” said 37-year-old Culkin, who has been living in Paris since 2003.

“I was 11 the first time I saw it. I was filming Home Alone 2 in New York,” Culkin said. “I was ushered into a back room on the set. There was a guy in there, a powerful executive suit type, you know what I mean?”

“He tried to make me relax. Gave me a can of Coke. Started telling me about the nature of the industry. Basically he wanted me to cut my parents out. He wanted to be my guardian. He said he would make me into the biggest teen star in history. He said I had it all. He said I had to get rid of my parents. I was like ‘Dude, I’m 11!’ and he said ‘You’re a man now.”

Macaulay Culkin then explained that the man “began to make his intentions clear as day.“

“He started breathing real shallow. My experience with perverts kicked in. I could tell he was interested in me.”

“He licked his lips and told me I was very handsome. I think I managed to say ‘thank you’ and started thinking about how I could get the f*ck out of there.”

“DUDE, I’M 11”

“Then he reached into his case and took out a crack pipe. He put it in his lap, took out this huge lighter, and continued to gaze at me with this overpowering sexual desire.”

“I was just staring at him. I think I said something like ‘Dude, I’m 11’ again.”

“I remember he said to me, it is a celebration, little man. To celebrate your upcoming success. Your many successes. Come. Sit back down.”

“He was tapping the pipe on his crotch, smiling this total creepazoid smile. I ran out of the room, but I ran straight into this other guy who was outside the room and he grabbed my by the arm and threw me back inside.”

“He lit the pipe and blew the smoke in my face. He told me to look at his shoes. He said they were made from the skin of children he and his friends had murdered. He said leather made from human skin is the finest leather known to man.”

DEATH OF A CHILD STAR

Macaulay Culkin said the Hollywood executive then dropped a heavy hint about where the skin came from that was used to make his patent leather shoes.

“He asked me if I knew Heather O’Rourke.”

“Yeah, I remembered her. I grew up watching Poltergeist. I remembered her in Happy Days. She was so cute.”

“I vomited all over his shoes.”

They’re here!” Heather O’Rourke was an American child actress, discovered by director Steven Spielberg when she was visiting MGM’s studios and later cast as Carol Anne Freeling in the horror film Poltergeist. SheÂ had the movie’s most recognizable line: “

After years in the Hollywood system, Heather O’Rourke died suddenly and unexpectedly at the age of 12 of “heart attack and septic shock” caused by a “misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis” in 1988.

“Let’s just say I went off the rails after my experiences filming Home Alone 2. I’m 37 now and I’m still processing everything. The things I have seen…” Culkin said, before trailing off and abruptly changing the topic.

CULKIN’S LEGACY

There are a fair few things Macaulay Culkin is remembered for.

People like to talk about his years of reported heroin addiction, which snowballed into rumours that he spent an obscene amount of money on drugs. Others chat about his friendship with pop star Michael Jackson, as well as him fronting a pizza-themed comedy rock band.

But Culkin no longer has the rail thin, sickly appearance of a junkie. Carrying some weight around the midriff, Culkin is looking happier now, and is filming the lead role for friend Seth Green’s vehicle Changeland.

Speaking about the future, Culkin said “I’ve come out the other side. I’m alive. That is more than can be said for many. I’m not finished yet.”

“Hollywood is going to burn in my lifetime. You watch.“
