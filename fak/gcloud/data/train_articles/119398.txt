A controversial cleric identified as Prophet Alph N Lukau, founder and General Overseer of Alleluia Ministries International, South Africa, is reported to have brought back to life a dead man during the Sunday service.

Reports suggest that in the past, the Pastor has come under fire for allegedly claiming to heal fake, dying patients. On his social media, he posted images of “dead” clients laying in hospital beds and then him bring them “back to life.”

“There is NO sickness that Jehovah Rapha cannot heal. Is it HIV, is it cancer? Diabetes, arthritis, high/low blood, paralysis or back pains? There is nothing He cannot do. He lifted this woman from her bed of death as doctors had sent her home with no solution. Your solution is found in Jesus,” he boasted.
