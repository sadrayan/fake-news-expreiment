Recycled oil field wastewater is clean, Chevron test results show
Samples collected by the water advocacy group, Water Defense, raised concern that methylene chloride, which is a toxic chemical, was present in water used on thousands of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. The group's tests detected significant levels of methylene chloride in samples collected both in 2014 and last March from the water district's distribution canal. Acetone, also a solvent, was also detected in samples taken in 2014.
