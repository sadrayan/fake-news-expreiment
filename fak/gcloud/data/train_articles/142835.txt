MILEY CYRUS SAYS WORSHIP SATAN IF YOU WANT TO BE RICH & FAMOUS LIKE ME
Miley Cyrus left her followers shocked and confused after advising her young fans to “worship Satan” if they want to become “rich & famous” like their heroes.The former Hannah Montana star left a group of fans bewildered after passing on the “pearls of wisdom” when asked for tips on how to gain success in the entertainment industry.

Following filming the NBC TV talent show, The Voice, on which Cyrus is one of the judges, a flock of young admirers had gathered outside the backstage exit, hoping to catch a glimpse of their idol.As the Wrecking Ball singer made her way out of the exit with her security team, one of her star-struck fans asked her: “Hey Miley, do you have any advice for any of your fans that might want to follow in your footsteps and become a star?”

To which she responded: “Yeah: If you wanna be famous, and rich, it’s easy…”But don’t ask me, you need to ask Satan.”You can have it all.”As a nervous laugh spread through the crowd, Cyrus stopped her bodyguards, seemingly annoyed by the response, and turned back to the crowd saying: “You think I’m joking?”

You asked me how to make it as a pop star and I just told you everything you need to do.”If you want everything that I have, then all you have to do is ask Satan for it and you can have it.”You need to stop asking Santa for Christmas presents and praying to Jesus because none of them exist.”Satan is our Lord, and when you let him into your heart and worship him instead of your make-believe God, then you can have it all.”

Cyrus then stormed off with her entourage and jumped into the back of a Range Rover before speeding away.The group of her supporters was left shocked by her comments, with some visibly upset.

The mother of one of the young fans said she was “disgusted” by the singer’s rant, saying: “My Daughter’s only 6 and has been really looking forward to Christmas.”Now she’s asking me why I lied to her about Santa.”We’re a good Christian family but now I’m getting asked how we can please Satan, and I don’t know what to tell her.”This isn’t the first time Miley Cyrus has dealt a devastating blow to her fans since joining the panel of The Voice.Just last week, she told one of the contestants that she “doesn’t like” pop music, and only makes that type of music because it’s what “they” tell her to sing.When the audience gasped in amazement at the admission, she scrambled to pull it back by adding: “And I don’t even like my own pop music most of the time, but you take a song that’s on the radio, that I can’t even relate to, and…make it about you.” Just recently, hip-hop star Jay-Z also opened up about his devotion to Lucifer, by telling fans that “God created Lucifer to be the bearer of truth and light,” before declaring that “only idiots believe in Jesus.”

This statement indicates that followers, known as Thelemites, should seek out their true path in life, and follow their “True Will.”Jay-Z’s Satanic preaching is just the latest in a long line of public glimpses into the dark side that the rapper has shared.He recreated his image as a dark lord, after starting his career as an aspirational rapper, flashing Illuminati hand gestures and promoting Satanic symbolism as he rose to the top of the music industry.Jay-Z has since attempted to tone down his dark image since establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer.
