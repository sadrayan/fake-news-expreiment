Zimmerman argues against evidence that humans cause climate change
Council Member Don Zimmerman didn’t take kindly to a climate scientist’s suggestion, at a Monday workshop for the Austin City Council, that humans – through carbon dioxide emissions – are a key contributor to climate change.

“The primary reason why we’re getting warmer, and why our weather extremes are changing, is because of human activities,” said climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who works for Texas Tech University.

Zimmerman scolded Hayhoe from the dais, saying that any kind of weather pattern now, whether it’s hot and dry, or cool and wet, is now linked to human-caused “climate change.”

“I have a really visceral reaction against the climate change argument, for the simple reason that when you look back in time there have been dramatic climate changes before humanity ever existed,” Zimmerman said in a dustup first reported Tuesday by the Austin Monitor.

He added that satellite data from 30 years ago has shown “troposheric lower stratosphere” temperatures declining with some ground temperatures increasing. “There’s a lot of confusion in this.” (PolitiFact rated a similar claim from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as “mostly false.”)

Zimmerman said that the “worst thing” for humanity was to put “government bureaucrats in charge of carbon dioxide emissions” and that there was “no way to have definitive science on something as nebulous or foolish as climate change.”

He concluded by saying he was “really, really upset” about Hayhoe’s arguments.

Zimmerman’s critical comments came in the midst of a City Council policy briefing on how the city might respond to various potential disasters, such as extreme weather events and economic downturns. Hayhoe’s presentation focused on how climate change might impact Austin’s temperatures and the likelihood of more extremely hot summers. She applauded Austin’s efforts, through its locally-owned utility, to embrace renewable energy sources versus carbon-based energy sources.

Hayhoe said Zimmerman raised good questions, and she pointed him to the website www.skepticalscience.com, which addresses many of the arguments raised over climate change and provides links to the supporting data and reports.

“I love this website,” Hayhoe said, “because it’s gone through and taken every single major question that we hear about climate change — you know, hasn’t climate changed in the past? It certainly has. Isn’t the sun the main factor controlling the Earth’s temperature? Absolutely. Aren’t there natural cycles? Yes, there are. Wasn’t there some satellite data back in the ’80s that showed that the atmosphere was cooling? There was, until they found that they’d switched out a plus and a minus sign in their code.�?

She added that Earth’s rising temperatures can’t be explained by the energy from the sun (which has been going down over the past 40 years, she said) or by the natural changes in the Earth’s orbit. “Our temperature peaked 8,000 years ago, and we were actually in a long, slow slide into the next ice age until the Industrial Revolution,” she said.

Hayhoe said much of the criticism around climate change comes from the fact that “the solutions that have been presented are big government solutions.” She said it’s important to provide space for “free market solutions.”
