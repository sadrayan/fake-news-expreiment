Andrew Gillum for Governor
This is it, Florida — you have until 7pm tonight to go vote for Mayor Gillum to bring it home for everyday Floridians. Our campaign has been in every corner of the state talking about Mayor Gillum’s bold, progressive plans to move our state forward — and it all comes down to who turns out to vote today.

Now is the time to get this done. As long as you’re in line by 7pm you’ll be able to cast your ballot. So find your polling place right now, and then make sure any friends or family members who haven’t voted yet do the same.
