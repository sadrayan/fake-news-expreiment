Ad Fact Check: Senate Majority PAC ad against Kevin Cramer rated as inaccurate
UPDATE 6/18/18: Senate Majority PAC issued a response to our requests for comment regarding our story. SMP communication director Chris Hayden wrote in his response "Yes, you included the first part of the interview that brings up SS and Medicare, but later he is asked about entitlement reform. As we know SS and Medicare are entitlements and Cramer says “we have to go after entitlement reform” to deal with debt and deficit."

Original story:

With the North Dakota primary behind us, we can expect to be inundated with political ads from now until the general election. Along the way, Valley News Live will be fact checking the claims in the ads and we start with an attack ad against North Dakota Congressman Kevin Cramer who is running against incumbant Democrat Heidi Heitkamp for the U.S. Senate.

The ad comes from Senate Majority PAC, a group that defines itself as being quote "solely dedicated to building a Democratic majority in the senate."

One of the claims in the ad made us take notice because it deals with an appearance Cramer made on "Point of View" with Chris Berg on December 19th of 2017. The ad makes the claim that Kevin Cramer said on our broadcast that congress will need to cut social security and Medicare to pay for the Republican tax plan. Cramer didn't make that claim during our broadcast. You can see the relevant clip in the video above. Based on that, Valley News Live would have to rate the claim by Senate Majority PAC as inaccurate.

According to politifact.com, Senate Majority PAC has a history of playing fast and loose with the truth in their claims.

A quick scan of politifact.com shows claims they have made in ads across the country were rated as half-true.. to flat out false.. with only one rated as mostly true.

We reached out to Senate Majority Pac for a comment on this story however they have not responded to our requests.
