Stomach Worms in Pigs
Five genera of nematodes are found within the stomach of pigs. The trichostrongylid Hyostrongylus is relatively common, whereas the other four spirurids (Ascarops, Gnathostoma, Physocephalus, Simondsia) are less common or geographically limited. Although some (eg, Ascarops strongylina, Physocephalus sexalatus) are more obvious grossly, only Hyostrongylus rubidus is considered to be pathologically significant. H rubidus (the red stomach worm) is ~6 mm long, quite slender, and has a direct life cycle, features similar to those of Ostertagia ostertagi of cattle. The prepatent period is ~3 wk unless larval inhibition occurs; this may be induced by seasonal changes or repeated infections, explaining why hypobiotic larvae are usually found in older animals. As with Haemonchus contortus of sheep, relaxation of immunity associated with parturition allows inhibited larvae to resume development, leading to a periparturient rise in fecal egg counts. A strongylina and P sexalatus, the thick stomach worms, are 10–20 mm long, are much stouter than H rubidus, and have coprophagous beetles as intermediate hosts. The prepatent periods for the spirurids are in the range of 4–6 wk. Because of the free-living larval requirements (H rubidus) or the need for an intermediate host (all others), infections are confined to animals with pasture access or those kept in straw yards.
