Florida picks FCAT replacement for 2015
Most of the FCAT will be replaced next year by exams that will rely less on multiple-choice questions and require students to write, show their work and display "higher-order thinking skills," the Florida Department of Education announced recently.

The new, unnamed test will be aligned to new Common Core academic standards. Its exams are meant to be tougher than FCAT.

They will rely less on multiple-choice questions — the backbone of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test — and more on "authentic" work, with students asked to create graphs and compare texts, the state Education Department said.

The tests also could take more time for students to complete. Fifth-graders, for example, would spend 240 minutes on the new language-arts exams, compared with 140 minutes on FCAT reading, according to the state's test proposal.

And, based on experiences in other states, the tests could be much harder for students to pass. When New York introduced its new tests aligned to Common Core — benchmarks for what students should learn in language arts and math — passing scores plummeted. The percentage of New York third-to-eighth-graders proficient in language arts fell from about 55 percent to 31 percent.

Many school superintendents in Florida have urged the state to delay using the new tests for A-to-F school grades next year, fearful that timetable gives educators no time to adjust. That is not, however, a plan state leaders have embraced.

"We will work to be as successful as we can," said Margaret Smith, superintendent of Volusia County schools in Orlando, but "we absolutely expect scores to go way down, for students, for schools."

The American Institutes for Research, a social-science research organization based in Washington, D.C., will create a new series of standardized exams for Florida. The language-arts and math tests are to be taken by nearly 2 million public-school students.
