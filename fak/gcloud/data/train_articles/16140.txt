Hello.

Jacob Cottingham in Rep. Howard’s office replied to my query by recommending we reach out to you about more detail, see below.

It looks to me like the LBB made a projection at some time; when? Is there lately up-to-date real-dollar data showing the districts in, say, fiscal 2016 getting less aid than those districts each did in fiscal 2011?

I realize there may be a reply to my direct inquiry about this claim in the works.

G.

Mr. Selby,

Here is the information from the LBB regarding the 31% number in the op/ed.

" Jacob,

You recently requested confirmation of some information our office previously provided regarding the percentage of districts with less maintenance and operations (M&O) revenue per weighted student (WADA) in the current biennium than in fiscal year 2011.

In fiscal year 2016, 31.3 percent of districts were projected to have a lower M&O revenue per WADA than they did in fiscal year 2011, while in fiscal year 2017, 23.8 percent of districts were projected to have a lower M&O revenue per WADA than in fiscal year 2011. However, please note that these figures are based on the model the LBB has used since the end of last session; this fall we'll be updating the model with new student counts and property value estimates which are likely to change these percentages.

Please let us know if you have any other questions.

Below is information for you on your questions.

List of districts comparing fiscal year 2011 Foundation School Program revenue to fiscal years 2016 and 2017:

Attached are two documents that include a comparison of each district's maintenance and operations (M&O) revenue per weighted student (WADA) in fiscal year 2011 to fiscal years 2016 and 2017 that had been provided to Representative Howard’s office. The 2016 and 2017 information was compiled in May 2015 based on Foundation School Program as appropriated (the Foundation School Program is the primary mechanism for distributing state funding for public education). Our office is currently receiving updates of many Foundation School Program budget drivers, including student population counts, property values and local tax rates, and we are in the process of updating information for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 to be ready in time for the upcoming legislative session in January.

Note the following caveats related to the attached documents:

• This list is limited to traditional school districts (charter schools are excluded) that were operational in fiscal year 2016.

• Some school districts have been consolidated since fiscal year 2011. For school districts that were party to consolidations and received other districts since fiscal year 2011, the lists reflect pre-consolidated M&O revenue per WADA for fiscal year 2011 and post-consolidated estimates for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The receiving districts include: Petrolia, Coleman, Wellington, Houston, and Goldthwaite. Also, when the attached estimates were generated in May 2015 both Texas City and LaMarque ISDs appear in the fiscal year 2017 list. However, LaMarque has since been consolidated with Texas City effective fiscal year 2017.

• Totals, averages, and other statewide figures calculated from the excerpts contained in these lists may not match other published statewide figures that were calculated using all entities in operation during that fiscal year.

Related Analysis:

On a statewide basis, the average M&O revenue per WADA in fiscal year 2011 was $5,734; in fiscal year 2016 it was projected to be $6,149; and in fiscal year 2017 it was projected to be $6,098. As you can see from the totals at the bottom of each document, 68.7 percent of districts are anticipated to have a higher M&O revenue per WADA in fiscal year 2016 than in fiscal year 2011, and 76.2 percent of districts in fiscal year 2017 are anticipated to have a higher M&O revenue per WADA than in fiscal year 2011.

In analyzing data from fiscal year 2016, the average M&O revenue per WADA for districts that had surpassed fiscal year 2011 levels had grown from $5,627 per WADA in fiscal year 2011 to $6,166 per WADA in fiscal year 2016, an increase of $539 per WADA. Districts that did not surpass fiscal year 2011 M&O revenue per WADA had gone from an average M&O revenue per WADA of $6,366 in fiscal year 2011 to $6,123 per WADA in fiscal year 2016, a loss of $243 per WADA.

In analyzing data from fiscal year 2017, the average M&O revenue per WADA for districts that had surpassed fiscal year 2011 levels had grown from $5,588 per WADA in fiscal year 2011 to $6,105 per WADA in fiscal year 2017, an increase of $517 per WADA. Districts that did not surpass fiscal year 2011 M&O revenue per WADA had gone from an average M&O revenue per WADA of $6,270 in fiscal year 2011 to $6,099 per WADA in fiscal year 2017, a loss of $171 per WADA.

How was this information developed?

This information was developed using the Legislative Budget Board's Foundation School Program model.

Why are some districts receiving less revenue than they were in fiscal year 2011 while others are receiving more?

The manner in which the 82nd Legislature reduced Foundation School Program entitlement in 2011 is different than the manner in which the subsequent two Legislatures have increased Foundation School Program entitlement. In 2011, the Legislature reduced Foundation School Program entitlement through the Regular Program Adjustment Factor (which has since been restored) and the Hold Harmless Reduction Percentage (which remains in effect). The Hold Harmless Reduction Percentage applies to districts that receive Additional State Aid for Tax Reduction (or ASATR). Subsequent Legislatures have primarily increased Foundation School Program entitlement through increases in the Basic Allotment, which applies to all districts, and is generally considered to be one of the best ways to increase equity through an entitlement increase. Additionally, other factors that could affect revenue per WADA include property values, student population counts and school district tax rates.
