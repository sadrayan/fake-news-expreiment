Trump Has Diarrhea During Golf Game
President Trump had a little accident on the golf course today, and no, and wasn’t politically. After a large brunch of eggs, bacon, ham, pheasant, roast beef, elk, and a variety of sausage, Trump had a case of diarrhea while playing the 5th hole of his back nine.

A golden color cart drove up and escorted Trump back to the side entrance of Mar-a-lago.

“It wasn’t pretty,” said one golfer.

“It was pretty funny,” said another.

The White House said the incident worked out well because “the president needed to catch up on some reading” and “it definitely wasn’t from any Chinese food”.

Many political insiders were happy it wasn’t coming from his mouth.
