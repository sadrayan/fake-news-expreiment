George Alexander Nader Gallery – Nader Enterprises
For over six decades and three generations, art has been the driving force of the Nader Family. Starting in Haiti with George S. Nader and continuing with Ivonne Nader and Roberto Nicolás Nader in both Haiti and Santo Domingo, the Nader Gallery represents and markets extraordinary works by some of the most important and sought-after artists in the world.

The George Alexander Nader Gallery in Santo Domingo is dedicated exclusively to the promotion of many Latin American artists such as Darío Ortíz, Heriberto Cogollo, Iván Tovar and Herán Sosa, among others. Today the gallery owns an impressive inventory of Latin American art located in Santo Domingo and Miami.

The gallery represents a new representation of this heritage. To pay tribute George Alexander Nader chose to revamp the space his family had their original gallery in the 1970s, in the up-and-coming Colonial Zone of Santo Domingo. This new space will open with the purpose of continuing this legacy, and contribute to the promotion of Latin American art.

With this gallery, Nader Enterprises will contribute to the growth and exposure of local artists by endorsing their work and providing a platform for exhibits, the exchange of ideas and an opportunity to learn from other masters of the trade.
