Obama visits grandmother and enjoys night out with his family
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama briefly stopped by his grandmother’s Punahou-area apartment with his two daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, tonight before they headed to dinner at Alan Wong’s restaurant. Obama carried a gift basket, and Malia Obama carried a few books, up to the apartment.

The visit came after Obama played golf this afternoon at the Olomana Golf Course and jogged barefoot on Kailua Beach this morning.

Next door to the residence where Obama is staying, Charlotte Farrell was throwing a party tonight for about 35 people.

Ged Marshall, 54, who is visiting from England and celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary at Farrell’s house, said Obama waived at the party.

“It made it brilliant,” Marshall said. “It’s a tale to tell someone in England. It’s ideal, it’s great.

“He gave a smile and a waive it’s wonderful.”

Farrell said she invited the Obama family to the party through the Secret Service, but late in the night, it appeared the family wouldn’t show.

“They really missed out,” she said.
