Opinion | Mr. Trump’s ‘Gag Rule’ Will Harm Global Health
Federal funding for abortions abroad has been banned since 1973, except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s life. Mr. Trump’s gag rule goes far beyond the 1973 ban to bar funding to all organizations that provide abortion or abortion referrals, even if they do so with their own funds and even if abortion is not the focus of their work.

By cutting off family-planning funds to reproductive health care providers, the gag rule eliminated contraceptive and maternal health services to countless women around the world. After losing funding during the Bush administration, a group known as Family Health Options Kenya had to close six clinics, leaving 9,000 people with little access to health care.

Perversely, the gag rule appears to have led to an increase in abortions, which its proponents obviously did not intend, and would be likely to do so in the future. In one 2011 study, African countries that relied heavily on aid from the United States experienced increased abortion rates when the policy was in effect, relative to countries that got less funding from the United States.

The policy will also limit access to providers of safe abortions. Under the Bush-era policy, the International Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana reported a 50 percent increase in the number of women needing treatment following unsafe abortions.
