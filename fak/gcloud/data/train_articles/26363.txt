"Character Counts"
Congressman Reyes released the following statement on this Ad:

I would prefer to be talking about creating jobs, protecting social security, safeguarding veterans, and ensuring that Ft. Bliss is protected from another round of BRAC.

Unfortunately, once Mr. O’Rourke launched his personal attacks against me and my family, it is clear that he placed his character into the public domain.

While his attacks, and the attacks of the Super PAC supporting him, are based on falsehoods and misleading innuendos, my response is based on facts and his record. The facts and his record make it clear that he does not possess the necessary character to represent this community.

Mr. O'Rourke might argue that his encounters with the law are in the past and the result of an earlier immaturity. It is his current activities, however, both socially and as a public official that, demonstrate his unfitness to hold a Congressional seat. Beyond his recent public intoxication, it is his positions on legalizing drug-use, the use of eminent domain, and his insensitivity to American’s with disabilities that reflect a current lack of maturity.

I am a Vietnam combat Veteran, a dedicated lifelong civil servant and a devoted family man. My integrity and character have never been questioned until Mr. O’Rourke and the Super PAC that supports him launched baseless attacks against me and my family.

El Pasoans can fairly ask: is this a man that we can trust to represent El Paso? The facts say they cannot.

--Congressman Silvestre Reyes
