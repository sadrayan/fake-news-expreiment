Rubio on Bible tweets: 'I'll continue to do it'
“Fools take no delight in understanding, but only in displaying what they think. Proverbs 18:2”

Fools take no delight in understanding,

but only in displaying what they think. Proverbs 18:2 — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 18, 2017

That was a tweet Wednesday from Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the near-daily Bible verses he has been sending out for some time. Quickly, people on Twitter saw it as a sly reference to President Donald Trump — which has been said about a number of Rubio’s messages.

But there was also criticism that the Florida Republican even displayed religion.

“Just do your job please,” one man wrote. “STOP with this religious crap already! ENOUGH!” wrote a woman.

Rubio won’t give up the habit. “I’ll continue to do it,” he said in an interview with CBN News. “Twitter is voluntary. People sign up to follow me on Twitter. If they don’t like it, they don’t have to follow me.”

Rubio was asked about the bipartisan deal to shore up Obamacare, which initially looked as though it had Trump’s support.

“I haven‘t looked at it carefully. I’m just cynical in nature about anything that’s designed to ‘fix’ Obamacare. I think it’s so broken it needs to repealed and replaced. But we’ll be opened minded and look at it and see if it makes sense.”

He was also asked about Steve Bannon’s supposed plans to take out incumbent Republicans. Rubio, not facing re-election, said he understood the motivating forces.



“People are frustrated and that’s what he’s plugging into,” Rubio said. Noting the GOP hasn’t done much of what it promised, including replacing Obamacare, he added: “None of it’s happened and people are upset and they have right to be.”
