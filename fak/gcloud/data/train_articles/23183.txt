Trump told attendees at the large conservative gathering that they are “reclaiming our nation’s priceless heritage, reversing decades of blunders and betrayals by the failed ruling class. America is respected again, and the world knows it.”

The conference, which entered its third day Saturday, showed little daylight between the White House and the Republican base, with several attendees showing off red “Make America Great Again” hats and other paraphernalia.

Reflecting support among a wider swath of the party beyond the annual summit, a Gallup poll released last month found that Trump has an 89 percent approval rating among Republicans.
