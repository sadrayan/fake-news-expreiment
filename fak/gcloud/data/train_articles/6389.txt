HOUSE ACTS TO PERMANENTLY REPEAL DEATH TAX

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act, by a vote of 240-179. Congressman Bob Goodlatte, a cosponsor H.R. 1105, released the following statement:

“As many have said during today’s debate, death should not be a taxable event. That’s why I voted in support of the Death Tax Repeal Act to permanently repeal the burdensome tax that penalizes many families in America. Hardworking men and women spend a lifetime saving and providing for their children and grandchildren, paying taxes all the while. They want to leave behind a business or a farm as well as greater opportunities for the next generation. However, when they pass away these earnings are taxed yet again. While these businesses or farms may show significant assets on paper, it can be in the form of equipment, buildings, or land – not the cash needed to pay the IRS. Oftentimes, these costs can lead to the family business or farm having to be sold altogether, instead of being passed on to the next generation. In the Sixth District, it is these family farms and small businesses that are at the very foundation of our local economy.

“Repealing the death tax is part of a much-needed overhaul of our tax system that will help keep America competitive in the global economy and protect families in Virginia from facing this unwelcome burden. Instead of taxing businesses and farms out of existence, repealing the death tax will help to create and maintain jobs.”
