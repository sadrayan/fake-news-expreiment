A child was killed during the ongoing NATO exercise in Lithuania
Disproof

On June 7th during military exercise “Saber Strike 2018” in Lithuania four U.S. vehicles “Stryker”, in a road between Lithuania’s cities Kaunas and Prienai, got into an accident. 13 U.S. soldiers suffered injuries. According to a primary information, an obstacle was the cause of an accident. It suddenly appeared on the road and one of four vehicles began to brake quickly. After that, vehicles crashed one into another.

After the incident, in a blog Gelezinisvilkassite an article appeared claiming that a child had been killed in the exercise. The information was specially fabricated to look as it was announced from the real (and very popular) Lithuanian news portal. What is more, the headline and an image were photoshopped.

During the meeting of NATO Defence Ministers in Belgium (on June 8th) the Minister of National Defence of Lithuania Raimundas Karoblis stated:

"This is a very typical example of the hostile information, and proves we are already being watched and are at informational war. We have no doubt that this was a deliberate and coordinated attempt aiming to raise general society’s condemnation to our allies, as well as discredit the exercises and our joint efforts on defence strengthening."
