ACA Signups
I'm neither an attorney nor a Constitutional expert, so this may not have any legal significance beyond confirming what everyone already knew about the Trump Administration. Then again, perhaps it will.

Just a little over two weeks from now, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit will be hearing oral arguments in the Texas vs. Azar case, otherwise known as #TexasFoldEm. As a reminder:

If the entire ACA were to be repealed:

16 million people would lose Medicaid

9 million people would lose subsidized private ACA exchange coverage

850,000 would lose BHP coverage in Minnesota & New York

Medicare Part D donut hole? Reopened.

Children being allowed to stay on their parents plans until age 26? Gone.

Discrimination against those with preexisting conditions? Back.

Annual & lifetime limits on coverage? Back.

Caps on out of pocket expenses? Gone.

...and much, much more.
