EU referendum: How the results compare to the UK's educated, old and immigrant populations
Before the referendum, much was made about how different demographic groups had vastly different opinions on Brexit.

Now that Britain has voted to leave the European Union, we can see how this was proven true. Regional results have been influenced by different concerns and backgrounds, showing a country strongly divided by class, age and education.

From age and class, to immigrant population and Ukip vote, certain patterns kept indicating how each part of the UK were going to vote in the EU referendum.
