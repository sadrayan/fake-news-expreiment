hi, I'm John Fetterman — Mayor of Braddock, PA & candidate for U.S. Senate. ask me anything! : Pennsylvania
EDIT: And that's a wrap! I have to head to State College for a meet and greet. but know that I'd still like to get back to as many questions as possible -- I'm beyond humbled that you folks cared enough about this race to show up. thank you.

For ten years, I've been the Mayor of Braddock — an old steel town outside Pittsburgh. but I'm running up against the limits of what I can achieve in this position for my community — that's why I'm running for the Senate to unseat Pat Toomey.

We'll start answering questions at 2:30PM EST. AMA!
