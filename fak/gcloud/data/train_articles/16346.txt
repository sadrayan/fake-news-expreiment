It's easy to check contributions from the candidate committees to Trump. Trying to find personal individual contributions would be harder. I did do a quick scan through of individual contributions and didn't see anything.

For candidate cmtes and leadership PACs, Smith was the first member to contribute back on May 27, 2016. $2000 from his candidate cmte and $3000 from his leadership PAC.

However, Paul Mitchell (newly elected to MI10), reported an in kind contribution of $292 back in February of this year.
