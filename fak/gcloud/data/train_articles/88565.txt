President Obama’s bipartisan blunder - Jonathan Allen
There’s only one problem with President Barack Obama’s characterization of the Senate’s Friday vote to fund the government past Oct. 1 as bipartisan: It wasn’t.

As Obama sought to isolate House Republicans in a statement delivered from the podium in the White House briefing room, he praised the Senate for dumping a House provision that would gut Obamacare and passing the bill back to the House.

“If Congress chooses not to pass a budget by Monday — the end of the fiscal year — they will shut down the government, along with many vital services that the American people depend on,” Obama said. “The good news is, within the past couple of hours, the United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open and delivering the services the American people expect.”

But not a single Republican cast an “aye.”

The bill passed 54-44, with 52 Democrats and two Democratic-leaning independents in favor and all 44 Republicans who voted opposed.

“Now it’s up to Republicans in the House of Representatives to do the same,” Obama said. “I say that because obviously Democrats have a great interest in making sure that these vital services continue to help the American people.”
