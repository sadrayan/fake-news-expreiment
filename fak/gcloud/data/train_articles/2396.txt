A Q&A; with Gov. Charlie Crist
Legislators are not just consumed by Gov. Charlie Crist these days, they're obsessed with him and whether he will bolt the party and run for the U.S. Senate as an independent. Witness the decision today to indefinitely postpone the insurance reform bill because they don't want to give the gov another something to veto.

So, since so many seem to be hanging on every word. Here's the latest Q and A between Crist and reporters:

Q: What did you make of the Tallahassee Democrat editorial urging you to run as an independent. "It was a very nice editorial.''

Q: What would you say to John McCain, George LeMieux or Tom Grady if they were considering a run as an independent? "We live in America and in this country, people have the right and opportunity to do what in their heart is right. I would encourage every American to do that every day."

Q: Did you remove any references to the Republican Party from your web site, as alleged by Rep. Tom Grady and other Republicans who have withdrawn their support" No.

Q: What's your reaction to Grady’s repeal of his endorsement: “So be it.”

Q: Has your relationship changed with the legislature this session. “The founders set it up pretty well with three branches of equal authority and it’s appropriate form time to time to exercise that authority when you deem it appropriate."

Q: Did legislators take you for granted? “Maybe they did. Maybe they were surprised that I take the job of governor very, very seriously and when there’s a time to exercise the authority and trust the people put in you you need to do it. I’m going to keep doing it."

Q: When will you make your decision? "By April 30."
