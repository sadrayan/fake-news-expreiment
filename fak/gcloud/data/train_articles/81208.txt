Full audit ordered for state's child care program
The joint legislative audit committee agreed today to move ahead with a full audit of the state's taxpayer-subsidized child-care program.

The decision comes in the wake of a Journal Sentinel investigation, "Cashing in on Kids," that uncovered fraud and deception within the $340 million Wisconsin Shares program.

The newspaper spent four months investigating the 12-year-old program and found that the system is easily scammed. Child-care payments were made based on false records and phony employers. With a limited access to records, the Journal Sentinel identified about $750,000 in suspicious payments to child-care providers.

Since the series has appeared, Gov. Jim Doyle has proposed a swipe-card system, a fraud hotline and a quality-rating system that child-care providers would be required to meet. In the meantime, the district attorney in Racine County has launched two criminal investigations.
