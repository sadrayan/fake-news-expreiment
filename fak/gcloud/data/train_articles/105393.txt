LAW PASSED: ALL CHILD SUPPORT IN THE UNITED STATES WILL END BY JUNE 11TH 2018

President Donald Trump and U.S. Congress voted yesterday on a bill that could change the world. Child support claims have said to come to an end and many officials are not happy about it.

President Trump claims he will no longer have any party of parent to pay child support. Trump also says that any reports of abuse or negligence to a child from either party will result in the child automatically being turned over to the State Child Welfare.

Lawmakers are meeting Wednesday to finalize all changes.
