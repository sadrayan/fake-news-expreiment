April 19, 2018 - Texas Voters Say Yes To The Guard, No To The Wall, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Voters Back Legal Marijuana Almost 2-1

Texas voters support 60 - 37 percent using the National Guard to patrol the border with Mexico, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released today. Hispanic voters are divided 51 - 48 percent on deploying the Guard, as white voters support it 68 - 28 percent and black voters oppose it 59 - 38 percent.





Voters say 73 - 25 percent that undocumented immigrants illegally crossing the border with Mexico is an important problem, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University Poll finds. Black, white and Hispanic voters all agree this is an important problem.





But Texas voters oppose 53 - 43 percent building a wall along the border with Mexico. White voters support the wall 54 - 43 percent. Opposition is 72 - 24 percent among black voters and 72 - 25 percent among Hispanic voters.





Texas voters say 79 - 15 percent that undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children - so-called Dreamers - should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship. This compares to the 77 - 18 percent support for Dreamers measured in an April 11 Quinnipiac University National Poll of all American voters.





Undocumented immigrants do not take jobs from U.S. citizens, Texas voters say 65 - 32 percent. These immigrants are not more likely than American citizens to commit crimes, voters say 67 - 24 percent.





"Texas voters think immigration is the most important issue to their U.S. Senate vote, but their views don't fit exactly in either party's corner. They agree with Democrats in their opposition to President Donald Trump's wall. But, by a wide margin, they support the Republican president's plan to send the National Guard to that border to stop illegal immigration," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll.





Looking at illegal immigrants in general:

64 percent of Texas voters say they should be allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for citizenship;

10 percent say they should be allowed to stay, but not apply for citizenship;

20 percent say illegal immigrants should be required to leave the U.S.

Gun Laws





Texas voters support 55 - 41 percent stricter gun laws in the U.S. and support 94 - 5 percent requiring background checks to all gun buyers.





Voters also support 53 - 42 percent a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons.





"Throw away the stereotypes. Texas voters are in favor of tighter gun laws by a solid 14-point margin, and fully 94 percent favor background checks for all gun buyers," Brown said.





Legalized Marijuana, Abortion





Texas voters support 61 - 34 percent allowing adults to legally possess small amounts of marijuana for personal use. Republicans oppose legalized marijuana 51 - 43 percent and voters over 65 years old oppose it 51 - 40 percent. Every other listed party, gender, education, age and racial group support it.





"Texans are not much different than voters in other parts of the country. They support almost 2-1 the idea of allowing small amounts of marijuana for personal use," Brown added.





On another divisive issue, 20 percent of Texas voters say abortion should be legal in all cases, as 37 percent say it should be legal in most cases. Another 26 percent say abortion should be illegal in most cases and 12 percent say it should be illegal in all cases.





Texas voters are divided on the 2017 tax law as 43 percent approve and 45 percent disapprove of the tax law.





Voters also are divided on the Affordable Care Act as 45 percent want to keep Obamacare in place and 49 percent want to repeal it.





From April 12 - 17, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,029 Texas voters with a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points, including the design effect. Live interviewers call landlines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts nationwide public opinion surveys, and statewide polls in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa and Colorado as a public service and for research.
