Rail Project Phase 2 Cost Estimate Released

90 Day Clock Begins for Counties to Commit to Project

Today the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority released the Preliminary Engineering cost estimate to Fairfax and Loudoun County officials for Phase 2 of the Dulles Rail Project to build 11.4 miles of rail through the Dulles Corridor to Dulles International Airport and Loudoun County.

“A year ago, the projected cost for Phase 2 of the Dulles Rail Project was $3.8 billion. Today, we have confirmed a project cost of $2.7 billion as a result of the elimination of the underground station at Dulles Airport, value engineering savings and the counties’ agreement to build the parking garages and the Route 28 Metrorail Station,” said Jack Potter, President and CEO of the Airports Authority. “This has been accomplished due to the hard work done in negotiations initiated by US Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood with the MWAA Board of Directors, Loudoun County, Fairfax County, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.

“With this release, the 90 day review period for Fairfax and Loudoun Counties begins. We look forward to the outcome of their deliberations as another important step toward moving forward on construction.”

The Airports Authority will begin the procurement process for the design and construction of the 11.4 mile line, including the six stations, upon Fairfax and Loudoun Counties confirmation of their commitment to the project.

The 90 day period begins on March 7, 2012 and ends on June 4, 2012.
