Superfund Site Reuse/Redevelopment
Related Information Visit Superfund Redevelopment Policy, Guidance and Resources to learn more about returning sites to beneficial use.

EPA's goal is to make sure that at every cleanup site, the Agency and its partners have an effective process and the necessary tools and information needed to fully explore future uses, before the cleanup remedy is implemented. This gives the Agency the best chance of making its remedies consistent with the likely future use of a site. In turn, EPA gives communities the best opportunity to productively use sites following cleanup.

Learn about Superfund redevelopment where EPA works with communities and other partners to help return hazardous waste sites to safe and productive use without adversely affecting the remedy.
