Sanctions
What are sanctions?

Sanctions are “policies of an economic nature adopted by one government to induce policy changes by another government,” including “boycotts, embargos, subsidies, imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other import and export controls, denial of licenses, most-favored-nation treatment, national treatment, membership in a trade agreement, suspension of aid or loans, freezing or seizure of assets, and blacklisting.” (Globalization: Encyclopedia of Trade, Labor, and Politics)

What is the history of sanctions against Iran?

The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Iran since the 1979 hostage crisis and completely banned the import of Iranian goods in 1987.

The U.S., EU, and UN have been imposing escalating rounds of sanctions against Iran since the mid-2000s to coerce the Iranian government to live up to its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, IAEA safeguards agreements, and UN Security Council Resolutions—and to prevent the country from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

Sanctions imposed since 2010 target Iran’s ability to sell crude oil on the world market, to import refined petroleum products, and make it more difficult for Iran’s Central Bank and other financial institutions to engage in transactions abroad.

What impact have sanctions had?

Sanctions have caused significant harm to Iran’s economy. In particular: They contributed to a significant drop in Iranian oil exports, from 2.5 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1 million barrels per day in 2013. As a result, Iran’s revenue from oil exports has declined 55% from its peak in 2011. They played a role in the steep drop in the value of Iran’s currency against the dollar and in the steep increase in consumer prices. However, since the election of President Rouhani in June, the Iranian rial has strengthened by 20% against the dollar and Tehran’s stock market is up 65%.



What sanctions relief did the P5+1 agree to provide in the Nov. 24 interim agreement?

According to U.S. estimates, the P5+1 agreed to provide $6­–7 billion in total sanctions relief—$4.2 billion by giving Iran access to oil revenue frozen in foreign banks, plus $1.8–2.8 billion by temporarily pausing other sanctions measures.

Specifically, over the next six months the P5+1 has agreed to:

Pause efforts to further reduce Iran’s crude oil sales, enabling Iran’s current customers to purchase their current average amounts of crude oil;

Suspend sanctions on Iran’s petrochemical exports, auto industry, gold and precious metals, and on associated services;

License the supply and installation of spare parts for the Iranian civil aviation industry;

Impose no new nuclear-related UN Security Council, EU, or U.S. sanctions (provided the U.S. Congress does not override a presidential veto);

Give Iran access to oil revenues held in foreign bank accounts if those funds are used to pay the UN, to pay tuition fees for Iranian students studying abroad, or to facilitate humanitarian trade in food and medicine for the Iranian people.

Has Rouhani's election made an impact on the Iranian economy?

Yes. While the most stringent sanctions remain in place, Rouhani's election and subsequent actions have generally provided a new sense of optimism in Iran. As economist Djavad Salehi-Isfahani notes, Iran's new economic team in Rouhani's government is "much more competent" than its predecessors. This new team has already pursued an ambitious agenda, including addressing the country's ballooning deficit and extensive subsidies. The impact, perhaps best demonstrated in the graph below, has been significant--the value of Iran's stock exchange has nearly doubled since Rouhani's election.

What do the Iranian people think about sanctions?

Over 85% of Iranians say that sanctions have hurt their personal livelihoods, including 50% who say that sanctions have hurt them personally great deal. (Gallup, 11/6/13).

Nonetheless, 68% of Iranians still believe that Iran should develop nuclear power; 56% say for non-military purposes, while 34% say for military purposes. (Gallup, 10/14/13)

46% of Iranians blame the U.S. for the sanctions, while 13% believe that their own government is primarily responsible. (Gallup, 11/6/13).

Half of Iranians have not had enough money to pay for adequate food or shelter within the past year; 34% say that their standard of living is deteriorating. (Gallup, 7/1/13)
