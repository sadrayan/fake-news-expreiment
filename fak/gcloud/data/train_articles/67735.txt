Tillis: We Must Defund Obamacare Now



Many have asked where I stand in the battle to defund Obamacare and the House/Senate vote on the Continuing Resolution (CR).

I believe Obamacare is a mortal threat to our economy. It will decrease healthcare quality and raise healthcare premiums and Republicans should do everything in our power to undo it. That means we must use every tool available to us, including this CR fight.

The President has acknowledged that Obamacare is not working by his decision to delay the business mandate. Itâ€™s time to stop the rest of Obamacare as well. This is not a complicated decision. I believe Republicans should stand on our principles.
