Donald Trump: These Are His TIME Cover Stories
Since launching his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has appeared on more than a dozen TIME magazine covers.

He has been depicted in multiple stages of meltdown, standing beside his election opponent and an unstable Washington monument, speaking behind a podium on the campaign trail and at his inauguration. (He was also shown on the cover once before his campaign began, in the 1980s.) Trump has boasted — incorrectly — about setting a record with his frequent cover appearances, but he has yet to do that. No one has been featured as many times as Richard Nixon, who appeared on the cover 55 times.
