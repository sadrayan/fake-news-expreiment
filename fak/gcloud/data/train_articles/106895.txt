In April 2014, Berkeley Earth began a major new effort to collect and analyze the world’s air pollution data. In August 2015 our first scientific paper on air pollution in China, was accepted for publication by PLOS ONE.

Berkeley Earth was created to address potential biases in the land surface temperature record. We are now expanding scientific investigations, educating and communicating about climate change, and evaluating mitigation efforts in developing and developed economies.

Berkeley Earth is pleased to announce that we’ve merged an oceans temperature analysis to our existing land data, and have a new global data set: Land + Ocean

Independent Berkeley Earth is independently operated, funded primarily by unrestricted educational grants. We pursue objectivity without concern for policies of government, industry or philanthropic ventures.

Transparent We continue to lower the barriers to entry into climate science by posting all our raw data and our analysis code online to provide an open platform for further analysis. We also post all our Berkeley Earth papers, memos, graphics and analysis code.

Complete Berkeley Earth took a data-driven approach to temperature analysis (using five times more data than other groups), and we are now taking a data-driven approach to of energy and climate science.
