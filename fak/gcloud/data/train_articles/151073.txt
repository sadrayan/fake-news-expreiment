Here is a list of every organization to which Colin Kaepernick donated money
Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has spent the past year and a half working with organizations across the country as part of his $1 million pledge. On January 31, 2018, he announced the last of the donations. The final $100,000 was part of a program in which he announced ten donations of $10,000 to ten different organizations, with matching donations from different celebrities.

Plenty of people long ago moved on from Kap and don’t care about any of this. Some folks do still have interest in the work he is doing. With that in mind, I wanted to list out every organization that has received money from Kaepernick and his friends as part of this process. 40 different organizations received some kind of donation from Colin Kaepernick this year, and ten of them received some additional funding from his friends.

This does not include the money he has put into running his Know Your Rights Camps. Additionally, his donation to Somalia Famine Relief was part of broader work with Ben Stiller that raised $3 million and helped get a plane to deliver supplies to Somalia.

I’ve included links to the organizational websites in case you want to learn more and/or potentially donate to them. SI also had a great article in December in which they spoke with people from several of these organizations about how the donations happened.
