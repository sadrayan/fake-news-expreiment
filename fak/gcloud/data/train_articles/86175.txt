Negative Population Growth
Most politicians, big business and its supporting economists call for growth as a solution to all our problems. Apparently, they believe in perpetual growth, which is a mathematical absurdity on a finite planet. There must be limits. Science is demonstrating that human population and consumption in the United States and the world are already too large and are destroying the natural systems that support us. We must not simply stop population growth; we must turn it around. Since 1972, NPG has been making that case. We publish scholarly studies, call attention to valuable papers, support the distribution of books that make the case, support population student education, issue periodic newsletters and the monthly NPG Journal. We do not simply identify the problems, we propose solutions. NPG’s Solution

Completely halt all illegal immigration into the U.S. through increased border security, strong enforcement of immigration laws, and mandatory employment verification – as well as apprehending and deporting the estimated 11-20 million illegal immigrants currently residing within our nation. Drastically reduce legal immigration rates from the current 1,000,000 arrivals per year to no more than 200,000 – including relatives, refugees, and asylees. Replace the existing federal income tax deduction for dependent children with a tax credit for parents who have – at most – 2 children. Give an annual cash grant to parents who pay little or no income tax and have only 1-2 dependent children.

That’s it. A reasonable, common-sense program to reduce legal immigration by 80%, discourage illegal immigration, and provide non-coercive financial incentives to all Americans – regardless of income – to encourage a smaller family size.
