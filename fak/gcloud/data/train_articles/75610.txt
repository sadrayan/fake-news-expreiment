Mother of theater shooting victim calling for tougher gun laws
Sandy Phillips remains the politically conservative gun owner she was before her daughter, Jessica Ghawi, died in the theater shooting.

But the loss and heartache led her and and Lonnie Phillips, Ghawi's stepfather, into the fight for stricter gun regulations.

They have appeared in public service announcements, one released by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, another promoting the message of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

An appearance on CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight" drew a hostile response from one man, who blasted Phillips on her Facebook page, accusing her of trying to take his guns away and followed up with a personal message calling her names.

"Every time I put out something that is sensible, I get attacked by the lunatic fringe and you just learn to toughen up," she said. "Anytime you have magazines that can hold a drum full of bullets, there is no purpose for that. I am a hunter. Anytime it takes you more than three bullets to hit something, you need to find another

hobby, because you are no good at it."

Ghawi's death led the couple to friendships with others who lost family in the Aurora massacre. "We rely heavily on one another because we know each other's pain," Phillips said. "We are all in a very unfortunate club together."
