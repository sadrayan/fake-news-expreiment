Celine Dion’s 16-year-old son Rene-Charles Angelil‘s was among the 58 victims who were killed when a gunman opened fire late Sunday at a Las Vegas concert that left at least 58 people dead and 515 injured.

Rene-Charles Angelil was at the concert when a gunman aiming from the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas hotel-casino unleashed a hail of bullets on an outdoor country music festival below, family spokesperson told local news.

“At this point, I’m in complete disbelief and despair,” Celine Dion, the Canadian singer and businesswoman, told the media in a statement Monday.

“I don’t know what to say. René-Charles was the most kind-hearted, loving son I have ever seen,” Celine Dion said.

A “crazed lunatic” turned an outdoor concert into a bloodbath, killing 58 people in what is now the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.

Thousands of country music fans ran for cover Sunday night as a gunman fired hundreds of bullets at them from a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, officials said.

Another 515 people were hurt in the gunfire and ensuing stampede at a Jason Aldean concert, police said.

“About five feet from me, you could see a guy with a bullet wound right in his neck, motionless,” witness Taylor Benge said. “From there on … people just started dropping like flies.”

The gunman, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, unleashed a hail of bullets from the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Monday.

“Prayers barely seem enough but it is all we have to offer at this time,” wrote one person.

“May you rest in peace, René-Charles. Thoughts and prayers are with your loved ones,” wrote another.
