The DAC Newsletter: ...

June 2018

Welcome to the DAC Enterprises June 2018 Newsletter!

It’s been a busy month in politics. From moving the U.S Embassy to Jerusalem, cutting through the fake news about the Mueller investigation, and confirming Gina Haspel as the CIA Director, President Donald Trump has been busy fulfilling his promises.

Trump continues to accomplish his agenda to Make America Great Again in spite of the massive resistance from Democrats and progressives. I’ll have more to say about progressives later in this newsletter, and I’m sure you’ll find it interesting.

Topics covered in June newsletter:

U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem

Mueller Investigation

Gina Haspel & The CIA

The Progressive Movement’s Sordid Past

But before we start, I'd like to announce the official launch of the DAC Enterprises t-shirt line! Now you can show your support for an America First agenda by proudly wearing your own DAC Enterprises shirt. Buy one now!
