By Huseyn Hasanov â€“ Trend:

Total natural gas reserves of Turkmenistan are estimated at 50 trillion cubic meters, head of the country's Turkmengas state concern Myrat Archayev said in a report at an international gas congress underway in Turkmenistan's Avaza.

Turkmenistan's proven natural gas reserves account for about 10 percent of the world gas reserves, despite that the current level of gas production in the country accounts for only 2 percent of the world gas production.

According to an audit held by the UK's Gaffney, Cline & Associates, reserves of the Turkmen Galkynysh field, together with reserves of the Yashlar field, are estimated at 26.2 trillion cubic meters of gas and reaches 27.4 trillion cubic meters together with reserves of the reopened Garakel field.

'Turkmenistan seeks to contribute to global sustainable human development by ensuring stable and reliable supplies of the most environmentally friendly hydrocarbons to consumers, promote energy efficiency and help reduce the impact on the environment,' Archayev said in his report.

Turkmenistan is among the main suppliers of natural gas in Central Asia, currently being the largest supplier of gas to China.

The report said that Turkmenistan, thanks to its favorable geopolitical position and rich hydrocarbon deposits, has vast potential to further increase export of gas to various destinations, including European and Asian markets.
