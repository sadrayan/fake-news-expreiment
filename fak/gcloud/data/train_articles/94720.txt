Exclusive Poll: Majority of Voters Approve of Overturning Charlotte Anti-Discrimination Ordinance
The emotional and spiritual tug-of-war in North Carolina over just how to treat fairly those who are transgender is on full display in this latest SurveyUSA poll conducted exclusively for Time Warner Cable News North Carolina. Voters by 5:4 say the new state law that requires individuals to use the public restroom of their birth gender as opposed to their chosen gender is a good idea. But by 2:1, voters say the state will be harmed because of it.



Let's take it a step at a time:



* 51% of North Carolinians think the new state law, which overwrites the Charlotte Bathroom Ordinance, is a good idea. 40% say the new state law is a bad idea. Republicans, conservatives, evangelicals, pro-life voters and regular church goers are more likely to like the new state law. Democrats, liberals, pro-choice voters and those who almost never attend religious services are more likely to think the state law is a bad idea. Voters in all 4 regions of the state support the state law -- especially so in greater Greensboro.



* 40% say that transgender individuals should be able to choose which public bathroom to use (the exact same number as who oppose the new state law); 51% say transgender individuals should not be able to choose which public restroom to use (the exact same number as who support the new law).



* Republican Governor Pat McCrory, who is running for re-election in 2016 and who signed the state ordinance into law, has a Minus 2 Net Job Approval. 44% of voters approve of the job that McCrory is doing, 46% disapprove. 35% say that McCrory's handling of the bathroom law makes them have a more positive view of the Governor, 39% say McCrory's handling of the bathroom law makes them have a more negative view of the Governor. 24% say McCrory's handling of the issue makes no difference. 33% say they are now more likely to vote to re-elect McCrory as Governor; 35% say they are less likely to vote to re-elect McCrory as Governor; 26% say the bathroom will not influence how they vote in the 11/08/16 general election. Should, hypothetically, McCrory lose his re-election battle by 1 percentage point or less, analysts can point to this very small negative bathroom backlash as a possible reason why. Should McCrory win, or should McCrory lose by more than 1 percentage point, the bathroom law will likely not be the only reason why.



* 21% say the new state law will make it easier for North Carolina businesses to attract talent, keep customers and win contracts, but twice as many, 45%, say the new state law will have a negative effect on NC businesses.



* 23% say North Carolina's overall image will be helped by the new state law, but twice as many, 46%, say the state's overall image will be harmed by the new state law. The concern is shared by both men and women, voters in every age group, by whites and minorities, by rich and poor, and in every region of the state.



About: 600 state of North Carolina adults were interviewed by SurveyUSA 04/01/16 through 04/03/16. Of the adults, 540 were registered to vote and were asked the questions included in this survey. This research was conducted using blended sample, mixed mode. Respondents reachable on a home telephone (70% of registered voters) were interviewed on their home telephone in the recorded voice of a professional announcer. Respondents not reachable on a home telephone (30% of registered voters) were shown a questionnaire on their smartphone, tablet or other electronic device.

With the strong emotions and political commentary on both sides of this issue, the poll results don't necessarily show that this particular issue will influence how too many voters will cast their ballots for this fall.
