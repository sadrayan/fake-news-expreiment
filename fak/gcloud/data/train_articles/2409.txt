Rivals pounce on Quinnipiac poll results
In an interview on today's Quinnipiac poll showing self-funded candidates with high poll numbers, polling director Peter Brown noted, "You don’t run negative ads against people you’re not worried about." If reaction to the poll is any guide, people are very worried about Rick Scott and Jeff Greene.

Kendrick Meek's campaign released a hard-hitting statement noting that Greene "brags that he has no budget" and is trying to "buy Florida's Senate seat."

The Florida Democratic Party released a two-minute web video hitting Scott's involvement in Columbia/HCA's record Medicare fraud fine.

And Bill McCollum's spokeswoman Kristy Campbell e-mailed this over: "Rick Scott has spent $15 million in half as many weeks to fund his public image repair squad’s pricey and misleading paid media campaign. It’s no surprise he has skyrocketed in the polls since Floridians are just beginning to learn about his questionable past. His lead will evaporate when Floridians learn Rick Scott oversaw the most massive Medicare fraud scheme in American history."
