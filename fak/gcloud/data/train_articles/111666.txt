#SPFPA STRONG - HONORING OUR HEROS
On October 10, 2017, SPFPA member Jesus Campos proudly accepts his "SPFPA Hero Award" for bravery in the line of duty. Brother Campos continued to assist Metro Officers after being wounded in the leg. He joins all of our member Heroes working as Security Officers at Mandalay Bay.

We are proud of ALL of our SPFPA members and recognize the important role they play in the protection of our Nation.
