FACTCHECK:

Duckworth has been a staunch supporter of expanding the spending, size and reach of the IRS.

“It’s disappointing to see Congresswoman Duckworth cares more about protecting the troubled IRS bureaucracy from public scrutiny than she does about reforming the agency to better serve taxpayers,” said Rep. Peter Roskam.

“The record shows Duckworth joined most Democrats in opposing four GOP efforts to restrict the agency’s information collection and boost congressional oversight.” (PolitiFact, 7/21/16)

Duckworth Supported Increasing Spending on the IRS:

Loyola Political Science Professor John Frendreis: “It’s technically true.” (PolitiFact, 7/21/16)

“Duckworth’s opposition to a bill that would restrict bonuses could be seen as a vote to increase IRS spending.” (PolitiFact, 7/21/16)

HR 4885: Duckworth Voted Against The IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending (OWES) Act of 2016. (HR 4885, House Vote #161, Passed 245-179: R 244-0; D 1-179, 4/20/16, Duckworth Voted Nay)

Summary: The IRS collects user fees for a variety of programs and services. Under current law, the IRS has authority to allocate money from its user-fee account as the agency sees fit, without Congressional approval or appropriation. The Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight investigation found that in fiscal year 2015 the IRS deliberately diverted resources away from taxpayer services and towards other agency functions, including implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The bill repeals the provision of current law that allows the IRS to spend user fees collected by the agency without Congressional approval or appropriation. The bill requires that all IRS user fees collected be deposited into the general fund of the Department of the Treasury, and therefore be subject to Congressional appropriations.

Duckworth Supported Expanding the size of the IRS:

HR 1206: Duckworth Voted Against The No Hires For The Delinquent IRS Act. (HR 1206, House Vote #160, Passed 254-170: R 243-1; D 11-169, 4/20/16 Duckworth Voted Nay)

In April 2015, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reported that of the 1,580 IRS employees found to be willfully noncompliant with tax laws between 2004 and 2013, only 39 percent were terminated, resigned, or retired. This is despite current law which requires the IRS to terminate an employee who willfully fails to file a Federal tax return or willfully understates federal tax liability. The bill suspends the hiring of new IRS employees unless the Treasury Secretary certifies that no IRS employees have serious tax delinquencies with respect to their own tax obligations. If the Secretary cannot make such certification, the Secretary must submit a report explaining why it cannot certify, outlining the remedial actions that would be necessary to make such certification, and indicating the time that would be required to complete those actions.

Duckworth Supported Expanding the reach:

HR 5053: Tammy Duckworth Voted Against The Preventing IRS Abuse And Protecting Free Speech Act. (HR 5053, House Vote #303: Passed 240-182: R 239-1; D 1-181, 6/14/16, Duckworth Voted No)

H.R. 5053 would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from collecting the identity of donors who contribute to tax-exempt organizations. Under this legislation, a tax-exempt organization would be required to report only information on donors who contribute $5,000 or more during a single tax year and who are either an officer or director of the organization or one of its five highest paid employees. This information would be excluded from public disclosure.

HR 4890: Duckworth Voted Against HR 4890 Which Would Ban IRS Employee Bonuses Until They Established A Customer Service Strategy. (HR 4890, CQ Vote #162: Passed 260-158: R 238-0; D 22-158, 4/21/16, Duckworth Voted Nay)

The bill prohibits the IRS from paying bonuses to any employee until it creates and submits to Congress a comprehensive strategy to improve customer service. It also requires the IRS to submit semiannual reports to Congress on its progress in implementing the strategy. Since Federal tax administration relies on voluntary compliance, it is extremely important that people have access to competent assistance from the IRS. Yet, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has reported that the IRS does not have a comprehensive customer-service strategy. As a result, the GAO reported that the IRS’ level of telephone service in fiscal year 2015 was the lowest in years, with only 38 percent of callers wanting to speak to an IRS representative able to reach one. In the GAO’s report, it recommended that the IRS create a comprehensive customer-service strategy to determine appropriate levels of service.

Roskam Says Duckworth Puts Politics First

Cong. Duckworth voted against efforts to limit the reach and invasiveness of the IRS yesterday. The legislation, sponsored by Cong. Peter Roskam, is designed to rein in the IRS overreach by prohibiting them from requiring the identity of most contributors to non-profit organizations. Duckworth has been a staunch supporter of expanding the spending, size and reach of the IRS.

Roskam has sought to reform the IRS and provide greater protection to taxpayers, including measures to end unwarranted bonuses paid to IRS employees. Roskam’s current legislation would protect taxpayers from IRS reach into their religious beliefs and other forms of potential discrimination.

“My IRS bill eliminates a needless form the IRS itself says it doesn’t need,” said Cong. Roskam. “It’s disappointing but not surprising to see Tammy Duckworth once again place party loyalty above protecting her constituents from IRS abuse.”

In April, Duckworth voted against a series of measures which would enforce oversight and accountability of the IRS. These measures included tough reforms to prevent IRS from misusing taxpayer dollars, requiring the IRS to determine if current employees have serious tax delinquencies before hiring new employees, and preventing IRS employees from receiving bonuses until a comprehensive customer service strategy and system was put in place.
