We compiled and analyzed publicly available data for all 50 states to compile a definitive ranking of the best states to start a business in 2018 to help you decide where to start your business.

Methodology

We based the ranking of the best states to start a business on 13 metrics across seven categories. For each metric, the top state based on the rankings from our data sources was given 100 points and the bottom state was given two points. States between these were indexed proportionally. We multiplied the weight for each metric by each state’s index score to come up with the weighted subtotal, multiplying the subtotals by weighted percentages for each category.

Each of the seven categories was given a weight based on its importance to starting a business. For example, factors such as taxes and access to quality employees were given more weight than access to capital and amount of startup activity. We then added the product of all categories to come up with an overall score, which was used to rank each state.

We analyzed data for seven categories:

Cost of Starting a Business : 15 Percent

The cost of starting a business in each state is represented by two factors:

Per capita income

Median annual commercial rent per square foot

Per capita income for each state was obtained from a Bureau of Economic Analysis report on state’s personal income for 2017. Commercial real estate data was obtained from 42floors.com, which provides the median cost to rent commercial real estate per square foot per year based on real-time and historical data on commercial real estate listings.

Taxes : 20 Percent

States were ranked by several tax rates that include:

Corporate tax rate

Individual income tax rate

Sales tax rate

Unemployment insurance tax rate

Property tax rate

TaxFoundation.org, the nation’s leading independent tax policy nonprofit, was our data source for the business tax climate in each state. They ranked states based on an index that compares states on variables in major areas of taxation such as corporate taxes, individual income taxes, sales taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, and property taxes.

Labor Market : 20 Percent

Each state’s labor market was evaluated based on two factors:

Location desirability

Percentage of bachelor’s degree attainment

To evaluate location desirability, we ranked the states based on unemployment rate data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which represents seasonally adjusted unemployment rates for May 2018.

Degree attainment data represent the percentage of adults age 25 to 34 with a bachelor’s degree or higher for the year 2015 and were obtained from the American Community Survey performed by the NCHEMS Information Center for Higher Education Policymaking and Analysis.

Cost of Living : 15 Percent

The cost of living in each state was determined based on six major factors:

Grocery

Housing

Utilities

Transportation

Health

Miscellaneous

Data were derived from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC). To determine a composite cost of living for each state for 2018, MERIC averaged the indices of cities and metropolitan areas that voluntarily participated in the Council for Community & Economic Research (C2ER) survey.

Startup Activity : 10 Percent

Startup activity in each state was evaluated based on:

Rate of new entrepreneurs

Survivability of business

Fit Small Business relied on data compiled by the State Science and Technology Institute (SSTI), which used data from the Kauffman Foundation and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to track the number of business births in 2007 and the survival rate of businesses from 2007 to 2013.

Access to Capital : 5 Percent

Access to capital was determined based on the availability of two kinds of funding:

Venture capital investments

Small business loans

State-specific venture capital investment data were gathered from SSTI’s report on total VC investments in 2016 and 2017, which reflects the intensity of venture capital investments as the percentage of each state’s gross state product according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, and the NVCA-Pitchbook Venture Capital Monitor.

To determine the best states for getting small business loans, Fit Small Business used data obtained directly from the Small Business Administration (SBA) and divided the total amount of loans under $100,000 granted in each state by the total number of loans made in each state.

Quality of Life : 15 Percent

Quality of life was evaluated based on three metrics:

Healthcare – Healthcare access was determined based on six metrics: child wellness visits, health insurance enrollment, adult wellness visits, adult dental visits, child dental visits, and healthcare affordability.

Healthcare access was determined based on six metrics: child wellness visits, health insurance enrollment, adult wellness visits, adult dental visits, child dental visits, and healthcare affordability. Education – Access to education was ranked on performance in higher education, primary and secondary schooling, and pre-K education.

Access to education was ranked on performance in higher education, primary and secondary schooling, and pre-K education. Public Safety – Public safety was measured based on the rate of property crimes and violent crimes in each state.

To determine the overall quality of life in each state, we relied on data provided by U.S. News, a leading provider of service news and information.

Bottom Line

Each state is characterized by different tax climates, qualities and costs of living, labor market, cost of starting a business, access to capital, and startup activity. We ranked all 50 states based on publicly available data from the Kauffman Foundation, Bureau of Labor Statistics, SBA, and more. We then assigned a weight to each category, analyzed the data, and ranked the best states to start a business in 2018. Now, where will you start yours?
