Welcome to TRUMP Headquarters!
TrumpHQ.com , formerly ShouldTrumpRun.com, is the new home for the Donald Trump supporters. Are you one of the many frustrated Americans sick and tired of hearing the same old mundane political campaign promises? Empty promises echo across the nation every four years; stringing us along as we wait for something good to finally happen. Well it is finally here, and it is real. It is DONALD J. TRUMP. We need to convince Donald Trump to go to Washington.





We fully respect Mr. Trump's decision to endorse Mitt Romney, but firmly believe that we need Trump in DC. Imagine Donald Trump as Secretary of State "negotiating" with the China or OPEC! Help us keep up the pressure and send Trump to DC. This campaign will sweep a nation ready for “real” change and improve the lives of each and every American citizen.





Trump has the knowledge, the resources, the power and the experience needed to re-shape our ailing nation; restoring our hope. Under his guidance, The United States of America will once again be the land of opportunity, prosperity and strength! Join me in creating a grass roots movement designed to save the greatest democracy in the world. Our country is heading down a dangerous path. I ask you to help me urge Donald Trump to throw his hat into the political ring.

Our elected officials are mortgaging away our future by spending money that we do not have and in the process, creating unsustainable deficits. We need to stop the bleeding now and Donald Trump will help to heal our economic wounds. We cannot afford to allow foreign countries to take advantage of us, improve their economies and leave our citizens without jobs. Donald Trump will even out the playing field and develop a legitimate plan to reign in our massive trade deficits.
