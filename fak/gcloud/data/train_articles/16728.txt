I wrap up that fact check soon so if your experts have thoughts or data to share, fire at me?

Otherwise, and for a different fact check, I write to seek James Quintero’s factual backup for his statement at SXSW Eco on Oct. 10 about San Francisco’s ban on plastic bags. Quintero said then: “There are health consequences. I believe this is in San Francisco: When they enacted their bag ban, you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses—you saw that number spike.”

Thanks again,

Caroline:

Hello again.

I have had a chance to read the cited paper and the memo of response issued by a San Francisco County official, which basically says the paper’s conclusions were unwarranted. I haven’t heard back from the professors who wrote that paper. Separately, Dr. Philip Huang, a Travis County medical official, told me by phone the Penn paper didn’t have sufficient data to reach the declared conclusions.

Anything else for us to consider as we work on this fact check? I hope to wrap up today.
