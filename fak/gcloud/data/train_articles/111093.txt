Abd al Rahim al Nashiri

Abd al Rahim al Nashiri is a 52-year-old citizen of Saudi Arabia. He is one of 17 high-value detainees. As of January 2010, the Guantánamo Review Task Force had recommended him for prosecution. As of Jan. 31, 2017, he has been held at Guantánamo for 10 years four months. He has been charged with war crimes.

Five high-value detainees were held by the CIA in a secret site at Guantánamo from September 2003 until March 2004, according to the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's detention and interrogation program. They were Abd al-Nashiri, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Muhammad Abdul Aziz al Fakhri (Ibn al Shaykh al-Libi) and two unidentified captives.

In February 2008, Central Intelligence Agency director Gen. Michael V. Hayden confirmed publicly that waterboarding was used on three Qaeda prisoners, Abu Zubaydah, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.
