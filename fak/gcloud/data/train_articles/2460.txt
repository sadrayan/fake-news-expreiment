Top CEOs Downgrade Outlook As Washington Threats Loom
The nation’s top business executives view political gridlock in Washington as a bigger threat to the U.S. economy than higher interest rates, at least in the short run, leaders of the Business Roundtable said Wednesday.

The group, a lobbying organization for large-company CEOs, said business executives have scaled back expectations for economic growth since the summer. One main reason is the growing prospect that Congress and the White House will struggle to reach a deal this fall to raise the government’s borrowing limit, a development that could rattle financial markets even if the U.S. ultimately avoids defaulting on its debt.

The business group’s CEO Economic Outlook Index fell to 79.1 in the third quarter from 84.3 in the summer. That’s still in line with an economy expected to grow by roughly 2.2% in 2013. But CEOs increasingly have a “downside bias,” the group said, a posture that could affect hiring and investment plans.
