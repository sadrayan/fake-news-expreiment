Florida county hit by hurricane accepted votes by email and fax, contrary to state rules
Washington (CNN) Some voters in a North Florida county hit hard by Hurricane Michael submitted their ballots by fax and email -- a practice that runs afoul of guidance issued by Florida election officials in October.

Bay County Supervisor of Elections Mark Andersen told CNN that he and his staff had worked with 158 voters displaced by Michael to allow them to cast ballots by email and fax, despite the Florida Department of State saying that voting by fax or email "is not an option."

Andersen said, "That was the only method available to voters that were displaced from the hurricane."

"We would send them a ballot via email just like we would to the extent with our overseas voters. They would get it, they would vote it; 147 of them actually faxed it back to us after they voted it," he said. Eleven were sent back over email, he said.

"No one cast a ballot that shouldn't have cast a ballot," Andersen said.
