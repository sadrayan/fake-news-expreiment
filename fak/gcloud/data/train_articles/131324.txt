Anheuser-Busch: Budweiser Is Pulling their Ads from the NFL

In a statement released yesterday, Anheuser-Busch announced:

“We are disappointed and increasingly concerned by the recent incidents that have overshadowed this NFL season. We are not yet satisfied with the league’s handling of behaviors that so clearly go against our own company culture and moral code. We have shared our concerns and expectations with the league.”

According to USAToday, Anheuser Busch has three years left on a 6-year, 1.2 billion dollar deal witht he NFL. If they pulled their sponsorship, it could possibly mean disaster for the NFL.

This is not the first time Anheuser-Busch has warned companies about pulling their ads. In 2012, the major beer company warned UFC for their use of homophobic and sexist language.

“We’ve communicated to the UFC our displeasure with certain remarks made by some of its fighters, and they have promised to address this. If the incidents continue, we will act,” the brewer said in a statement. A-B, which did not elaborate on potential actions, also stated that it “embraces diversity and does not condone insensitive and derogatory comments rooted in ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, etc.”

The beer company is doing more to address the issues of violence in the NFL than the NFL itself.
