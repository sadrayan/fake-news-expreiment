The New £10 Note was issued on 14 September 2017. Full details of the design and security features are available along with free training materials for retailers and businesses. You can find out more about the new polymer £10 note at www.thenewten.co.uk.

The new polymer £20 note will be issued in 2020.



Polymer banknotes are cleaner, more secure, and more durable than paper banknotes. They will provide enhanced counterfeit resilience, and increase the quality of banknotes in circulation.
