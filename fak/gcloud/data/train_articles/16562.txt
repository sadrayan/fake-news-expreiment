Subject: Status of sex education in Texas schools?

Dan:

Good afternoon.

I write afresh on behalf of the Austin American-Statesman and the PolitiFact Texas fact-checking project because we’re trying to learn which Texas public schools offer sex education to students and/or how many schools do so. Has the mix of schools doing so (and the count) changed a lot year to year? We’re asking you because we spotted this 2011 web post suggesting the network was tracking such detail.

To be specific, we’re fact-checking this recent claim by a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Andrew White: “There’s a large number of schools in Texas that don’t even offer sex education.”

Is that accurate? Why or why not?

Other recommended research resources?

As ever, we count on attributable on-the-record information for our stories. We’d be happy to hear back soon by phone or email.

Thanks,

g.

White is correct. We published a report on this topic from the Texas Freedom Network Education Fund in February 2017. Our research showed that about 25 percent of Texas school districts did not teach sex education in their secondary schools during the 2015-16 school year. That represents a big increase from 2.3 percent during the 2007-08 school year, which we reported in our first study on this topic in 2009. A key factor in the increase in the percentage of school districts not offering sex education appears to be the Legislature’s decision in 2009 to drop health class as a high school graduation requirement. Health class is often where students get sex ed. Many school districts either continue to offer health as an elective or make it a local graduation requirement, but a substantial number of school districts appear to have dropped health classes since 2009.

Our report last year also showed that about 58 percent of Texas districts taught abstinence-only when it came to sex education in 2015-16. Less than 17 percent took an abstinence-plus approach to sex ed, which means they included medically accurate information on condoms and other forms of contraception. Just 3.6 percent of school districts took an abstinence-plus approach in 2007-08.

We’re unaware of other research of this scope in Texas.

Thanks.

I see that the survey sampled about 150 of the state’s 1,000-plus districts. This might be a repetitious question, but here goes: Any idea if there’s other research of any kind on practices in more or all districts?

Which districts were surveyed? My apology if the list is in the report. I didn’t spot it.

I’m back at this Monday.

Our 2009 study succeeded in getting survey results from nearly all of the state’s school districts. But that was such a Herculean task that we commissioned an expert in the field to build a representative sample of the state’s school districts for last year’s report. That sample is, as we note in the report, representative of the diversity in geography, enrollment, racial demographics and district type (rural, urban, or non-metropolitan/smaller cities) of the state’s non-charter school districts with high schools. We succeeded in getting a response rate of 100% from that sample. Of course, it helped that they were required by law to respond to our public information request, but we still had to do a lot of follow-up and other work over the course of several months to get all of the responses. So we’re confident that the survey results provide an accurate reflection of what all of the state’s school districts do as a whole. (The research methodology in Appendix A, pages 45-48 of the report, identifies the expert we worked with and the way the sample was created.) If anyone else has surveyed all of the state’s school districts on this topic (or even a representative sample), we’re unaware of it. I can pull the full list of districts in our sample if you still need it.

​Thanks, again.

If you can pull that full list, it'd be appreciated.

I’ve listed the districts in our sample below. Note that the sample automatically included the 10 largest districts by enrollment — they collectively include lots of students, and we wanted to see how they stood out from the rest of the state. All of the other districts were chosen using systematic random sampling. The statistical expert we worked with then weighted the survey results appropriately (taking into consideration that the 10 largest districts were automatically included) to calculate the final percentages for what all districts teach when it comes to sex education.

Here’s the list of 35 schools in our sample that we categorized as not teaching sex education. Of this total, 27 districts returned an affirmation stating that they do not teach sex education. For the other eight, we confirmed that they do not teach sex education either by email, phone or analysis (working with Dr. David Wiley at Texas State University in San Marcos) of the materials they sent us. (Neither here nor there, but on this list is Elysian Fields. Never been there and know next to nothing about it, but I’ve always thought it has one of the coolest school/town names ever. Go Yellowjackets!)

Would you possibly have a break-out of the surveyed districts comprising the 17 percent of districts found to have abstinence-plus materials?

Here you go. There are 30 districts on this list, but eight of those came from the 10 largest districts that were automatically included in the sample. The other 22 districts on this list make up about 15.9 percent of the sample of 138 districts (beyond the top 10). Once we included the top 10 districts, the stats guy had to weight the percentages. So that’s why the final percentage for this category ended up being 16.6%. How he calculated that is beyond my abilities, but of the nearly 1,000 noncharter districts, it would be reasonable to assume only one or two of those top 10 districts might have ended up in the sample if they were included only through systematic random sampling. (You’ll also notice a number of rural and small-town districts are on this ab-plus list. So it’s not just urban and suburban districts.)

Districts got on this list if they meet at least one of the following criteria:

They reported using a third-party program that is ab-plus, such as Big Decisions and It’s Your Game… Keep It Real.

They reported using the optional contraception module provided with the Scott and White Wellness and Sexual Health program (formerly Worth the Wait). Not all districts with the Scott and White program use that optional module.

They reported using any other ab-plus materials, such as optional materials on contraception provided by textbook publishers (whose core textbooks are otherwise ab-only).

Confirming that information often required phone and email follow ups with districts. Determining how those ab-plus materials are used in classrooms — whether teachers use them as suggested, skip portions, or whatever — was beyond the scope of this project. But we decided to err on the side of giving districts the benefit of the doubt. If they said they had obtained these materials for use in classrooms, we counted the district as ab-plus.
