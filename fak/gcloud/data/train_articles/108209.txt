Cheap Parking: Easy-to-Understand Jokes at English-Zone.Com
A businessman walked into a New York City bank and asked for the loan officer. He said he was going to Europe on business for two weeks and needed to borrow $5,000. The loan officer said the bank would need some security for such a loan. The business man gave him the keys to his Rolls Royce car that was parked on the street in front of the bank. All of the paperwork was finished and the loan officer accepted the car as collateral for the loan. An employee then drove the Rolls Royce into the bank's underground garage and parked it there. Two weeks later the businessman returnedto the bank. He repaid the $5,000 and the interest which came to $15.41. The loan officer said, 'We sure appreciate your business and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a bit puzzled. While you were away we checked and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is why you would want to borrow $5,000..." The business man replied: 'Where else in New York City can I park my car for 2 weeks for $15 dollars?!" I don't understand this joke!
