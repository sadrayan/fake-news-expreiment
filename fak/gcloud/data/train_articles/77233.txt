Class Size Reduction Amendment

Florida's Class Size Reduction Amendment History

In 2002, citizens approved an amendment to the Florida Constitution that set limits on the number of students in core classes (Math, English, Science, etc.) in the state's public schools. Beginning with the 2010-2011 school year, the maximum number of students in each core class would be:

18 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;

22 students in grades 4 through 8; and

25 students in grades 9 through 12.

In 2003, the Florida Legislature enacted Chapter 2003-391, Laws of Florida which implemented the amendment by requiring the number of students in each classroom to be reduced by at least two students per year beginning in the 2003-04 school year, until the maximum number of students per classroom did not exceed the requirements in law. Compliance with the amendment would be determined as follows:

2003-2004, 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 at the district level

2006-2007 and 2008-2009 at the school level The 2009 Legislature extended the calculation at the school level for an additional year to include 2009-2010.

2010-2011 and subsequent years at the classroom level
