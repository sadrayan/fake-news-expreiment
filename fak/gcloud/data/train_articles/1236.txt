Gilmore's Tuition Plan

Governor Releases Details Of Savings In Student Costs

The governor's plan would send $75 million to Virginia's four-year and two-year public colleges to cut tuition and certain required fees by 20 percent, he announced. The cuts would apply only to Virginia's 220,000 in-state undergraduates, he said, and to both full-time and part-time students.

RICHMOND â€” Gov. Jim Gilmore on Monday released the details of his proposal to slash tuition and fees at Virginia's public colleges, promising average savings of about $450 per year for full-time students.

"Our tuition has risen where it's 30 percent over the national average," Gilmore said. "A lot of people are being frozen out of college. They're having to take big loans out to go to school. So this is going to help the people across Virginia."

Gilmore's proposal is not unlike one offered last month by Del. Alan A. Diamonstein, a Newport News Democrat. But while Diamonstein's proposal would apply to some but not all public colleges, Gilmore hopes for an across-the-board cut for all in-state undergraduates at all public schools.

The governor's plan would slash annual tuition and fees at the College of William and Mary by $588; at Christopher Newport University by $488; and at community colleges, including Thomas Nelson, by $285.

Also Monday, Gilmore proposed a massive infusion of operating cash for George Mason University. The governor hopes to spend $6.5 million in additional state funds for technology instruction, $2.1 million to hire new faculty and fund academic scholarships, and $1.5 million for law school programs.

Gilmore also proposed $2 million for Old Dominion University's work-force training initiative, $2.5 million for the medical library of the Medical College of Hampton Roads, and $1 million for the Virginia Marine Science Museum.

Finally, Gilmore proposed spending $3.6 million in additional funding for the Roanoke Higher Education Center, to provide space for training and educational activities, among other items.

Gilmore will present his full slate of budget amendments to the money committees of the General Assembly on Friday. He has hundreds of millions of dollars in unforeseen state revenue to spread around the state. But ultimately, it will be up to the legislature, when it reconvenes next month, to decide how to amend the current biennial budget.
