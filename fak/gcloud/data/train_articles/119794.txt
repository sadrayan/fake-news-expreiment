Notes

I-95 has some very weird spur routes in New England. In any other part of the country I-495 in MA would probably be a two digit highway.

I 95 was originally supposed to go through Boston instead of around it, but locals nixed the idea. Apparently you still can find small stretches of that road if you know where to look.

If you were wondering what happens to I-95 through New Jersey, the following post from misc.transport.road might explain things:

One of my favorite subjects...

The large freeway which was supposed to carry I-95 through central New Jersey was cancelled after fierce opposition from wealthy folks in western Somerset and northern Mercer Counties... especially in Hopewell Township in northern Mercer County, which was directly in I-95's projected path.

I-95 southbound was supposed to leave the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 10 (I-287), share I-287 west until (roughly) South Plainfield, then split off and run parallel to and a few miles south of I-287 until about Somerset (I-695 was supposed to connect I-287 and I-95 around there), then go directly southwest through the rich areas (crossing US 206 near Hopewell) to the current intersection of I-95 northbound and I-295 southbound.

Instead, I-95 southbound goes to NJTP Exit 10 and vanishes into thin air (from there, the NJTP southbound calls itself "To I-95"... the NJTP ends at I-295, which crosses the Delaware Memorial Bridge and meets I-95 in suburban Wilmington, DE). I-95 northbound goes to its intersection with I-295 and vanishes into grassy oblivion about ten miles southwest of where it would have intersected US 206 (a few hundred yards of I-95, now overgrown, are visible beyond the I-95/I-295 intersection). (Note: since this post was sent out, the I-95/I-295 intersection has been moved a few miles to coincide with the US 1 exit.)

In my opinion, this part of central New Jersey could have become one of the USA's most important "edge cities", but its development was stunted by the cancellation of I-95 and the concomitant overcrowding of the nearby US 1 corridor... which leads to a good trivia question:

Is there a direct all-freeway route between New York and Philadelphia?

No!

I-95 would have been such a route (though the part on the NJTP would have been toll... I meant limited-access, not free of toll)... but, after it was cancelled, both the NJ and PA Turnpike authorities were asked at various times (and declined, due to expense and/or projected loss of toll revenue) to add exits (e.g., NJTP south to I-76 west, I-276 west to I-95 south, I-276 west to I-295 south) to create such a route.

The standard route is to take I-95 north to downtown Baltimore through the Fort McHenry Tunnel (if the electronic warning signs tell you the tunnel is closed by accidents, take the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, which is normally worse).

At the edge of the Baltimore metro area, I-95 north becomes a toll highway (called the JFK highway in Maryland and the Delaware Turnpike in Delaware). Stay on I-95 north until you get to suburban Wilmington, Delaware, where you take I-295 east (north?) across the Delaware Memorial Bridge to New Jersey. From there, you can take the New Jersey Turnpike (which has a steadily increasing rate of toll per mile once you pass I-195) all the way to the George Washington Bridge, or you can take it part way towards NYC (specific directions available on request).

This route is relatively expensive, and the scenery isn't wonderful... especially the oil refinery and shipping district north of the Raritan River.

However, there is a reasonable alternate route (on a day without ice or snow) for the part through Maryland and Delaware... take US 50 east to the eastern shore of Maryland, then take US 301 through Maryland and Delaware to US 13 north to I-295.

In really nice weather (and with extra time), one can also drive over to Lewes, Delaware, take the ferry to Cape May, NJ and drive up the Jersey shore on the Garden State Parkway (don't do this until spring).

Dan Tasman has sent me jpg's from old road maps showing the original I-95 routes through NJ. Warning: these are large files (about 150 k)

UPDATE

Ok many people wrote in to point out that this would only tie the record. I-275 goes through Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.
