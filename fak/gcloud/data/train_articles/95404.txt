Save the Second Amendment. Stop Judge Garland.
With the nomination of Judge Garland for the U.S Supreme Court President Obama is working to strip Americans of their individual right to keep and bear arms. The Second Amendment is hanging by a thread.

Add your name to our petition and tell Sen. Tim Kaine and Sen. Mark Warner that Second Amendment rights arenâ€™t negotiable. Judge Garland must not be confirmed to the Supreme Court!
