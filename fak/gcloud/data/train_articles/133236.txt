Religion in the United Arab Emirates
Islam is both the official and majority religion in the United Arab Emirates followed by approximately 76% of the population.[2] The Al Nahayan and Al Maktoum ruling families adhere to Sunni Islam of Maliki school of jurisprudence. Many followers of the Hanbali school of Sunni Islam are found in Sharjah, Umm al-Quwain, Ras al-Khaimah and Ajman.[3] Their followers include the Al Qasimi ruling family. Other religions represented in the country including Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism and Sikhism are practiced by non-nationals.[4]

Islam [ edit ]

There are more Sunni than Shiite Muslims among the residents. There are also a smaller number of Ismaili Shias and Ahmadi Muslims.[2] The UAE's judicial system is derived from the civil law system and Sharia law. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. According to Human Rights Watch, UAE's criminal and civil courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law, in a way which discriminates against women.[5]

Sharia courts in the UAE have a significant amount of authority. Flogging is a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex and alcohol consumption.[6][7][8] Due to Sharia courts, flogging is legal with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes.[9][10] Between 2007 and 2013, many people in the UAE were sentenced to 100 lashes.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public.[19] Several Muslims in Abu Dhabi and Ajman were sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption.[20][21] An Estonian soldier in 2006 was sentenced to 40 lashes for being drunk.[22] Several people have been sentenced to 60 lashes for illicit sex.[23][24][25] Sharia courts have penalized domestic workers with floggings.[26] Under UAE law, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes.[27]

Stoning is a legal punishment in the UAE. In 2006, an expatriate was sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery.[28] Between 2009 and 2013, several people were sentenced to death by stoning.[14][29][30] In May 2014, an Asian housemaid was sentenced to death by stoning in Abu Dhabi.[31][32][33]

Sharia law dictates the personal status law, which regulate matters such as marriage, divorce and child custody. The Sharia-based personal status law is applied to Muslims and sometimes non-Muslims.[34] Non-Muslim expatriates can be liable to Sharia rulings on marriage, divorce and child custody.[34] Sharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction over family law cases and also have jurisdiction over some criminal cases including adultery, premarital sex, robbery and related crimes.

Apostasy is a crime punishable by death in the UAE.[35][36] UAE incorporates hudud crimes of Sharia into its Penal Code â€“ apostasy being one of them.[37] Article 1 and Article 66 of UAE's Penal Code requires hudud crimes to be punished with the death penalty,[37][38] therefore apostasy is punishable by death in the UAE.

Kissing in public is illegal and can result in deportation.[39] Expats in Dubai have been deported for kissing in public.[40][41][42] In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public.[43]

Homosexuality is illegal: homosexuality is a capital offense in the UAE.[44][45] In 2013, an Emirati man was on trial for being accused of a "gay handshake".[45] Article 80 of the Abu Dhabi Penal Code makes sodomy punishable with imprisonment of up to 14 years, while article 177 of the Penal Code of Dubai imposes imprisonment of up to 10 years on consensual sodomy.[46]

Amputation is a legal punishment in the UAE due to the Sharia courts.[47][48][49][50][51] Crucifixion is a legal punishment in the UAE.[52][53][54] Article 1 of the Federal Penal Code states that "provisions of the Islamic Law shall apply to the crimes of doctrinal punishment, punitive punishment and blood money."[55] The Federal Penal Code repealed only those provisions within the penal codes of individual emirates which are contradictory to the Federal Penal Code. Hence, both are enforceable simultaneously.[56]

During the month of Ramadan, it is illegal to publicly eat, drink, or smoke between sunrise and sunset.[57] Exceptions are made for pregnant women and children. The law applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims,[57] and failure to comply may result in arrest.[58] Dancing in public is illegal in the UAE.[59][60][61]

Christianity [ edit ]

Protestants and Roman Catholics form significant proportions of the Christian minority. The country has at least 33 churches.[4] The schools in public ownership have no Christian religious education.[62] Many Christians in the United Arab Emirates are of Asian, African, and European origin, along with Arabic speakers from Lebanon, Syria, and other countries.[63]

Hinduism, Sikhism and Jainism [ edit ]

Hinduism and Jainism are practiced by a large percentage of the community of Indians and Sindhis living in the UAE. To acknowledge the contribution of the Indian business community towards the early development of Dubai as a trade port, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum granted the permission and the land to build a temple complex in Bur Dubai. There is also a Sikh temple south of Dubai, in Jebel Ali.[citation needed]

Buddhism [ edit ]

Judaism [ edit ]

Irreligion [ edit ]

Up to 4% of people reported irreligious beliefs according to a Gallup poll. It is illegal for Muslims,[64] with apostates from Islam facing a maximum sentence of the death penalty under the country's anti-blasphemy law.[65] As such, there have been questions regarding freedom of religion in the United Arab Emirates.

Atheism in the region is mainly present among foreign expatriates and a very small number of local youth.[66][67] According to Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, due to Islam being founded in the Arabian Peninsula over 1,400 years ago, the Persian Gulf region enjoys a long Islamic history and tradition, and it is strongly associated with national identity; thus, any distancing or criticism of religion "equates to distancing oneself from national identity".[68] Al-Qassemi notes that the use of social media via the internet remains the strongest medium of expression for Gulf atheists, while providing anonymity; a pioneering Gulf blogger is the Emirati atheist Ahmed Ben Kerishan, who is known in the Arabic blogosphere for advocating atheist and secular views.[68][69]
