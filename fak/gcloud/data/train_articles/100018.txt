The facts about an inheritance tax

The facts are clear: Labor has no policy or secret deal to introduce an inheritance tax.

Fake news is circulating on social media platforms alleging that Labor has done a secret deal to introduce a “death tax” or inheritance tax. This fake news is completely without merit and just a desperate and pathetic lie.

The Liberals and their supporters are lying about Labor’s position on an inheritance tax.

Labor will not do this.

In fact, Scott Morrison has previously indicated that he was open to an inheritance tax.

When he was treasurer, Mr Morrison was asked about death duties and said, “We are not ruling anything in or anything out.”

The Liberals will do and say anything to distract from their shameful record of cuts and chaos.

The Liberals and their supporters need to be ashamed of themselves using low rent, American-style fake news that is actually a lie. They’re trying to scare communities across Australia into believing something which is entirely false.

Don’t believe the fake news. Labor has no policy or secret deal to introduce an inheritance tax.
