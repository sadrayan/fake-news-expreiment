The White House has not released official photos of President Obama's visit with Newtown, Conn., families Sunday, but several pictures have been posted on social media.

The family of 6-year-old Emilie Parker, one of the 20 children killed in the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, shared an image of a smiling Obama with several children.

Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung's daughter Cristina Hassinger posted an image on Twitter with the caption: "My mom would be SO proud to see President Obama holding her granddaughter. But not as proud as I am of her."
