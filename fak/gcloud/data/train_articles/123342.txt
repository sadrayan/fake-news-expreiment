Patriot Guard Riders

Founded in 2005 to shield families of fallen heroes from those that would disrupt the services of their loved ones, the Patriot Guard Riders has grown to include thousands of members across all 50 states in the US. We are a 100% volunteer 501(c)(3) organization.

As our membership has grown, so has the scope of our mission. We also honor first responders as well as our military veterans. Additionally we have an active Help On The Homefront (HOTH) program, which provides assistance to our veterans and their families.

We commonly get asked “How do I join, and what is required”.

Joining the PGR is pretty simple, click on the Login/Join link in the upper menu, or follow this link and register.

As for requirements, anyone and everyone can join and stand with us. You don’t need to be a veteran, and you don’t need to ride a bike. All you need is respect for our military, veterans, and first responders; and desire to show that respect to them and their families.



These are donors that contributed $500 or more to the PGR “I Support the PGR” campaign.
