Joni Ernst: GOP members concerned about Donald Trump’s Florida visits
Sen. Joni Ernst said Tuesday that she feels President Trump should conduct government business in D.C., not Florida.

“I do wish that he would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That’s what we have the White House for,” The Iowa Republican said at a town hall in Wall Lake, Iowa. “I do wish that we would see more of those State Department visits in Washington, D.C. I think it’s smart that he does business in Washington, D.C.”

Ms. Ernst said that Vice President Pence comes to the Republican caucus’ policy luncheon every week and that she expected the issue of Mr. Trump’s travels to Florida would be addressed.

“That is something I think that has been bothering not just me, but some other members of our caucus,” she said. “So I think that is going to be a topic of discussion that we have when we get back to Washington, D.C.”

Mr. Trump has held policy meetings and visits with foreign leaders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, including Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month.
