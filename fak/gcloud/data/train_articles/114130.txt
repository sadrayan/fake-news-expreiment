But Did He Friend Her?
Towering over most of them in platform heels, ubiquitous pop star Katy Perry made a strange and awkward visit to Facebook’s Palo Alto headquarters this week to announce her 2011 North American tour dates and pretend Mark Zuckerberg is cool.

Business Insider made note of the visit in this plethora of odd photos of Perry with slobbery Facebook employees, and it was also reported that Perry assisted Twitter with some PR as well, tweeting about her meeting with Zuckerberg afterward:

“Ya know just hangin’ @ “the” facebook with “the” CEO. Baller style. I like him!”

As weird as the stunt was, it worked, getting hundreds of news stories to announce Perry’s tour dates and report that the Facebook CEO was a smiling, likeable guy.
