Bill White for Texas: Bill responds to Gov. Perry's announced budget cuts
Here's Bill's response to Governor Perry's 5% across the board budget cuts (PDF):

The State of Texas has been affected by a global economic recession. The Legislature passed a budget using the Comptroller's assumptions that sales tax revenues would increase in the two years beginning Oct 1, 2009 compared to the prior two years. At least two months ago it became obvious that sales tax revenues would drop rather than go up. I wrote about this on December 12th. Sales tax revenues for the last three months have dropped by 12% rather than going up.



Governor Perry is the head of the Executive Branch of state government. For months, he should have been identifying efficiencies and productivity improvements that would allow a reduction in spending without a compromise in services delivered. This exercise has occurred among well-run businesses in Texas and cities such as Houston. Any well-run organization can find these kind of deficiencies, but it takes attention to detail and strong management skills to implement them. This job is not the responsibility of legislative leadership. Governor Perry has had information about these declines in sales tax revenues for almost two months. At least the first two or three percent in cuts should have been identified by now and presented by Governor Perry for public comment and discussion.



I have no doubt that the State of Texas will balance its budget, as required by the Texas Constitution. As Lt. Governor Dewhurst has pointed out, this is and has been the law in our State for decades. The task of the Governor is to manage reduced spending without compromising basic services. The later the Governor starts the more difficult this will be.
