Marco Rubio Slams Lilly Ledbetter Act, Says It Helps "Trial Lawyers Collect Their Fees"
Marco Rubio went on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, and did that thing that GOPers do when they don't like what Obama did, but instead of offering their own solution, they just bitch and whine and say dumb things.

This time around, Charisma Boy! decided the best way to defend Mitt Romney's opposition/non-opposition of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was to say it's really just all about the lawyers doing evil lawyery things.

"Just because they call a piece of legislation an equal pay bill doesn't make it so," Rubio said. "In fact, much of this legislation is, in many respects, nothing but an effort to help trial lawyers collect their fees and file lawsuits, which may not contribute at all whatsoever to increasing pay equity in the workplace."
