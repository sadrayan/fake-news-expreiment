Isabelle Duterte’s Palace photoshoot gives birth to hilarious internet meme
MANILA, Philippines — Searching for a place to hold an event? Look no more.

Not every 18-year-old gets to have Malacañang as backdrop for her coming-out party, but Isabelle is not just any debutante. She just held her pre-debut pictorial at the country’s seat of power.
