Pamela Oliver is a Conway-Bascom Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, where she has worked since 1980. Her research has two main branches: collective action and social movements, and racial disparities in criminal justice. She is bringing these two lines of work together in a current project on the relation between Black protest and policing and mass incarceration.
