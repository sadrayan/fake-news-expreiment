POLICY STATEMENT ON HEALTH CARE LAW REPEAL. It is the policy of this resolution that-- (1) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152) should be repealed; and (2) in its place, health care reform that empowers patients should be enacted. SEC. 502. POLICY STATEMENT ON BAILOUTS OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. It is the policy of this resolution that the Federal Government should not bailout State and local governments, including State and local government employee pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. SEC. 503. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEANS TESTED WELFARE PROGRAMS. (a) Findings.--The House finds that: (1) In 1996, President Bill Clinton and congressional Republicans enacted reforms that have moved families off of Federal programs and enabled them to provide for themselves. (2) According to the most recent projections, over the next 10 years we will spend approximately $10 trillion on means- tested welfare programs. (3) Today, there are currently 77 Federal programs that provide benefits specifically to poor and low-income Americans. (4) Taxpayers deserve clear and transparent information on how well these programs are working, and how much the Federal Government is spending on means-tested welfare. (b) Policy on Means Tested Welfare Programs.--It is the policy of this resolution that the President's budget should disclose, in a clear and transparent manner, the aggregate amount of Federal welfare expenditures, as well as an estimate of State and local spending for this purpose, over the next ten years. SEC. 504. POLICY STATEMENT ON REFORMING THE FEDERAL BUDGET PROCESS. It is the policy of this resolution that the Federal budget process should be reformed so that it is easier to reduce Federal spending than it is to increase it by enacting reforms included in the Spending, Deficit, and Debt Control Act of 2009 (H.R. 3964, 111th Congress). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 223, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) and a Member opposed each will control 15 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. {time} 1030 Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Republican Study Committee's substitute that is now on the floor. This substitute amends and builds upon the great work of Chairman Ryan and the entire House Budget Committee. And while I do come to the floor and support Chairman Ryan's proposal, the RSC wanted to put forth a proposal on the floor today that went even a step further. We named our budget today the Honest Solutions budget because we know that what we are proposing will not be easy. Why? Because real solutions are not necessarily easy solutions. But given the dangerous conditions of our Nation's fiscal situation, we must recognize that tough choices must be made and must be made now. The RSC believes that we can do better than any of the budgets on the floor today. So we have a budget that will, first of all, ensure that our Nation spends responsibly by freezing total discretionary spending at 2008 levels. The RSC budget further ensures that our Nation's security will be met by meeting Defense Secretary Gates's defense request. The RSC budget puts nondefense discretionary spending on a sustainable path. In addition, the RSC budget strengthens Medicare's long-term finances. And most importantly, our budget, unlike any other budget on the floor today, will balance within our lifetime. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 15 minutes. Mr. PASCRELL. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the chairman of the Republican Study Committee. Mr. JORDAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I want to thank all the members of the Republican Study Committee, Mr. Chairman, for their work on this budget. I also want to thank Chairman [[Page H2878]] Ryan for the work on his budget and the committee's work there too, and in particular, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), and the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) for their work in putting this together. The RSC budget, as the gentleman from New Jersey has mentioned, keeps tax rates low because we believe in economic growth; starts the process of saving Medicare and Social Security; protects national defense, which, after all, is that area we are supposed to constitutionally spend taxpayer dollars on. But most importantly, what the Republican Study Committee budget does is it balances. It does what every single family, ever single small business owner, every single State government and local government has to do: it actually puts forth a budget that balances, lives within your means, doesn't spend more than you take in, gets to balance within a definable period of time. That is why we think this is appropriate, particularly when you think about the fiscal situation our Nation is in. So I stand here in support of the budget and commend the gentleman from New Jersey for the great work that he has done. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. If the Republican budget is a doubling down on the policies that brought us to the brink, which is contained in this budget, my brother from New Jersey presents a budget which I think quadruples down on the economic policies and lack of optimism in the American people. The budget believes we cannot, as President Kennedy said a little over 50 years ago, ``bear any burden and meet any hardship'' in order to better our Nation. That's what America is all about, regardless of your party persuasion. This budget gives trillions in income tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, we both agree on that--you think it's a good policy, we think it's a horrible policy--and at the same time cuts $18 billion. Let me just take one example, the SCHIP program: $18 billion cut to our children--our own children, our grandchildren. You must be kidding me. This budget gives trillions in estate breaks to the wealthiest Americans. Many people having estates pay no taxes, yet this slashes funding for Pell Grants for our kids, our grandchildren to go to college. This budget gives trillions in tax breaks to corporations that have been shipping jobs overseas, but ask our constituents, in your district and my district and everybody's district, to take a 20 percent cut in the scheduled benefits to Social Security. It's easy to sit here as a Congressman waiting until you turn 70--why are you smiling?--to retire with benefits you've earned, but you're asking this of our asphalt layers, our secretaries, and our teachers. It comes down to a clear set of priorities, Mr. Chairman. If your priorities are to cut taxes for the wealthy on the backs of the retirees, then I think this second budget is the budget for you. But if you believe in an America that protects our seniors, our children, the disabled, our veterans, levels the playing field and invests in future generations, then I urge you to stand with us. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), who recognizes the fact that we must live within our means now and, unlike the gentleman from New Jersey, does not want to put additional burdens on future generations. Mr. MULVANEY. To the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Chairman, I would say that it's not easy to do. Why are we here? We're here for a single purpose: we take what the Republican Committee has done and simply lay out for the American people how hard it is to balance the budget within 10 years. It is not easy to do. But to sit and hear these onslaughts about how we're giving tax breaks--from a group of people that promised they would not raise taxes on folks who make less than $250,000 and then repeatedly violated that promise over the course of the last 2 years--is simply hard to take. This is the only budget that we will get a chance to vote on this week that both balances the budget within 10 years and does not raise taxes. We take what the Republican Committee has done, we build on it to show exactly how deep the hole is that we have dug for ourselves and how hard it is to get out. But to suggest that we do it on the backs of the poor is simply disingenuous. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who is absolutely on target on most of these issues dealing with the budget as we move forward. Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate my colleague's courtesy. The words ringing in my ears for a moment about the Democrats having increased taxes, there is this collective amnesia on the side of our Republican friends who forget that a critical part of President Obama's Recovery Act that was passed by the last Congress--42 percent of which was tax cuts or relief--included a tax cut for every working American. The kind of forgot about that. As a practical matter, Mr. Chairman, what we have done is to move forward under our initiative with something that will enable us to rebuild and renew America. What we have been given from our friends here with this alternative budget from my good friend from New Jersey which I do appreciate, this is where the Republican Party wants to go. The Ryan budget is bad enough. It will be dead on arrival in the Senate, and will be resoundingly rejected as Americans see what is happening, taking away the retirement, health care security of Americans--230 million Americans will be returned to the tender mercies of the private insurance market. Remember, the private insurance market didn't want to insure senior citizens in an affordable fashion with comprehensive coverage; that's why we had to have Medicaid in the first place. And now the trick is to provide a voucher to insurance companies, hoping that they will step up and fill the gap. When you look at how private insurance premiums have more than doubled in the last 10 years, you see what a hollow promise this is and what a serious problem it is going to be for American families trying to plan for their future. This is the vision that we have from our Republican friends, not only take the Republican Budget Committee, go beyond it in terms of more benefits for those who need it the least. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) will control the time. There was no objection. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), who has no amnesia but recognizes the fact that we do no favor for this generation by putting the burden for future constraints on our children and our grandchildren. {time} 1040 Mr. McCLINTOCK. This Nation is on a collision course with a sovereign debt crisis the magnitude of which has never been known to this country. This is not some moonless night on the Atlantic. We are barreling full speed toward that iceberg of debt in the full light of day, and we can all see it dead ahead. The Ryan budget turns the ship around just enough to avoid hitting that iceberg. The RSC budget does it with an added safety margin by incorporating more of the debt commission's recommendations and implementing them faster. Mr. Chairman, we know the challenge. We see the American dream at risk, and we know that we have but a fleeting moment in history to avoid the hardest times our Nation has ever known. We can act now, place our retirement systems on sound financial footings, arrest the debilitating spiral of debt that threatens the very survival of our Nation, and return our economy to the prosperity that it has known when it enjoyed what Jefferson called a wise and frugal government. Or we can continue on our present course until we crash into the ice cold and hard reality that we can all see dead ahead. [[Page H2879]] Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I yield 3 minutes to the vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, the gentleman from California (Mr. Becerra). Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Chairman, budgets are a reflection of our values and our priorities: jobs, economic growth, fiscal discipline, fairness, shared sacrifice. Most Americans talk about this all the time when they're at their kitchen table. It's not that difficult. So quite honestly the question before us is not whether to reduce the deficit, but how. Budgets involve tradeoffs. The Republican budget that is presented to us today along with this Republican Study Committee alternative would say that we must continue the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans in this country. We must continue to give a millionaire about $130,000 in tax cuts in this budget even though we are facing the largest deficits our country has experienced. At the same time, the choice that this Republican budget makes is to say to seniors, We must end Medicare as we know it; we must eliminate the guarantee that you, as a senior, have had for more than 35 years under Medicare to choose your doctor and your hospital; and we must impose upon you an additional $6,000 in health care costs because these deficits are so big. So as the President said a couple of days ago, under the Republican budget, you would need to take 22 seniors paying 6,000 additional dollars to cover the costs of giving one millionaire in this country the $130,000 tax cut. We must do that under the Republican budget. Democrats have said we must not do that. We must do this differently. And we must invest again in our people. On health care, we don't believe that Americans who are seniors should be given a coupon instead of a guarantee. But that's what the Republican budget does. It says, You're going to get a voucher, a coupon, essentially. Once you've used it, the extent of the value of that coupon, the rest of the money to pay for your health care, comes out of your pocket. That's why the President said 6,000 additional dollars for each senior under Medicare under the Republican plan. Coupon care instead of Medicare. That's what you must have under the Republican budget. Democrats say we must invest in Medicare and find the cuts to get rid of the waste in Medicaid that we know exists. The duplication of services that seniors don't need. We can do this without denying seniors guaranteed benefits. And finally, we must create jobs, but the Republican budget, most of the leading economists tell us, will cost us 1.7 million jobs. Not create. Cost us 1.7 million jobs. Under the Bush recession, 8 million Americans lost their job. The month that George Bush handed the keys to Barack Obama, we hemorrhaged nearly 800,000 jobs. We must do this right. Reject the Republicans' budget proposal. Mr. GARRETT. At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves), who, just like the gentleman from California, understands that we must not sink the ship of state, as the other side of the aisle would do, by excessive tax burdens and debt. Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. You know what's great about being here today and talking about the Ryan plan is it's a blueprint. And blueprints you can do a couple things to. You can add to, and you can take away from. And what we've heard from the progressives a minute ago is, plunder the people's plan rips the pages out of the future of this Nation for our children and our grandchildren. But the Republican Study Committee, it adds to it. It actually takes it a step further. It saves the taxpayers more money by providing savings starting with 2006 levels and going to 2008 levels. But what we have to recognize is the debt and the deficit problems we have here today are not because we are taxed too little; it's because we have spent too much. And it is a result of 2 failed years of more government, more taxes, and more spending that we've seen. It's time to put that in history. Let's put it in the drawer. Let's move on, and let's pass the Republican Study Committee plan because I can assure you this: It doesn't go where the President and the liberals of this House want to go, and that's into the wallets of the taxpayers of this Nation. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, the bipartisan fiscal commission--no fringe group--said that the Republican plan was unbalanced because it doesn't ask for shared sacrifice. It's a lopsided approach. This budget takes us farther off the deep end. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews.) (Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ANDREWS. There is no question that the country has to reduce the deficit by restraining spending. That's why we favor having Medicare get the same deal on prescription drugs the VA does--which would save $24 billion a year. But there is a question about the future of Medicare. And today we're going to take a vote. Will Medicare prosper or perish? Will Medicare survive or die? That's the issue before the House today. The fact is the Republican plan puts an insurance company between our seniors and their doctors--and that is wrong. The fact is that the Republican plan does not reduce health care costs. Hospitals will not charge less. Doctors will not charge less. The government will pay less, and seniors will pay more--$6,000 per senior per year. The fact is that this is all being done not to reduce the deficit, but to reduce taxes of the wealthiest people in America. The fact is we should not have this. And the fact is this: We can have an America that doesn't have red ink in its budget but does have Medicare for its seniors. Let's make the choice that our constituents sent us here to make. Yes, let's sensibly reduce spending--as we did yesterday on a bipartisan basis. But this is the wrong time to end Medicare. We will fight this effort, and we will prevail. Mr. GARRETT. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp). Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the RSC budget because we cannot wait, as the other side seems to indicate, to get our fiscal house in order. And the RSC budget will put us on that path even faster. Mr. Chairman, the American people are tired of their tax dollars going to Washington, D.C., with nothing in return but empty promises and Federal strings. They are tired of adding to the National debt with none of the promised jobs. People across my State of Kansas, indeed all across the country, want their power back from Washington. Our Founding Fathers got this concept of federalism right, and it's time we return government power from Washington bureaucrats and politicians back to the American people. Block grants of Federal Medicaid dollars to the States will do just that by allowing States and those closest to the people to use their ingenuity and creativity to make Medicaid dollars work more effectively. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. GARRETT. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds. Mr. HUELSKAMP. If we really care about the people, Mr. Chairman, there are currently 455 Medicaid waivers, and I ask that we allow the flexibility in the Medicaid system through a block grant system that returns the powers of federalism back to the States. And the RSC budget will do just that, Mr. Chairman. It's the right thing to do. It's the right time now to balance our budget in this way. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel). (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) {time} 1050 Mr. RANGEL. Thank you for this opportunity. Unlike so many of my colleagues, I don't have any charts or anything to point out the direction in which I would want my great country to go, but I do have 40 young minds that come from the Frederick Douglass Academy, come from my alma mater on Lenox Avenue, come from Harlem. And in these minds are the dreams and the aspirations of all the young people that want to be a part of the progress that this Nation has made. Most of them, their parents have never had an opportunity to go to college, but have been the recipients of [[Page H2880]] Pell Grants and other kinds of educational benefits. Most of their parents and grandparents have depended on Medicaid and Medicare. Most of these kids have dreams that most of your kids have today. It just seems to me that when they go home they should not be able to say that they witnessed the protection of the wealthiest people in the United States; but they should go home to say their dreams can be acquired, our Nation can be stronger, and they want to be partners in making certain that America can be all that she can be. So as we welcome them, they are only symbolic, they are only representative of the young people of our great country, and I hope we can see clear to support them. Thank you for the opportunity. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), who realizes that the young people would do best if we not put additional tax burdens of over $40,000 or $50,000 on their birth coming into this country by the actions of not living responsibly. Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in support of the RSC budget. With a deficit of $1.6 trillion, a debt of $14 trillion, it's no surprise that we've got to do something. We have to do something dramatic. This budget actually balances over a 9-year period, and it reforms the programs that are important to many Americans, to make them solvent and sustainable over time. The proposals from the other side of the aisle simply don't do that. They ignore the time bomb that we have in these programs. So I commend the RSC staff and Members for putting this together. This is a good budget. We ought to support it to put our Nation on a path of financial stability and security. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, the time bomb that's ticking is the time bomb on the Medicare guarantee. With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Chairman, I can't express my concern with greater alarm about this budget. It is a budget that's going to inflict terrible harm on Americans from all walks of life, while protecting the wealthiest taxpayers in America, both individuals and Republicans. Now, if I give the benefit of the doubt to the Republican sponsors of their budget proposal that they're sincere, they are speaking from an ideological point of view, they want to try a social experiment in this country. But if they fail to live up to what they say they're going to accomplish, there is going to be tremendous harm. We have a social contract with seniors to provide affordable, accessible, comprehensive health care under Medicare. And they want to take Medicare and end it, and tell those people to go to private insurance companies. We have estimates that the average senior will face cost increases of $6,000 when the program begins, and it could be over $11,000 per beneficiary in later years. But right away, to add insult to injury, they would reopen the doughnut hole under the part D prescription drug benefit, meaning people still have to pay all of the cost of their drugs, reversing what the Affordable Care Act provided. But most of their cuts are coming from the Medicaid program. They want to take Medicaid and turn it into a block grant. Medicaid accounts for 43 percent of total long-term care spending in the U.S. Most of it goes to seniors and disabled people who are in nursing homes. If the States don't have enough money in their block grants, are they going to dump these people? These are human beings, and you are playing with their lives. This means real harm will be inflicted where Medicaid spending is the greatest. By cutting reimbursement rates, Medicaid will lose providers. Nursing home quality and staffing levels will decline. Reject this budget. Don't experiment on the most vulnerable of our population. Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose the Republican Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2012. Their budget inflicts terrible harm on Americans from all walks of life--while protecting the wealthiest taxpayers in America, both individuals and corporations. I am particularly disturbed by what the Republican budget does to Medicare and Medicaid. There is no other way to put it: the Republican budget is the end of Medicare as we know it, and it is devastating for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare is a social contract with our seniors to provide affordable, accessible, comprehensive health care. The Republicans want to turn Medicare over to the private insurance industry, with payments to seniors that will fall far short of what they need to get the health care they deserve. The Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Republican budget shows that, over the next decade, it will more than double beneficiary cost for new enrollees. The average senior will face increased costs of over $6,000 annually when the program begins. And all of that extra spending by seniors and people with disabilities will go to private health insurance plans. The transfer of seniors into private plans will raise costs by over $11,000 per beneficiary by 2030. To add insult to injury, the Republican budget reopens the donut hole under the Part D prescription drug benefit, increasing the burden on seniors starting today. For Medicaid, the Republican budget is even worse. Medicaid covers 60 million of the country's most vulnerable people, one in 3 low income children, 5 million seniors, and 10 million disabled individuals. It accounts for 43 percent of total long term care spending in the U.S. But the Republican budget cuts Medicaid in half by 2022, and turns it into a block grant for the states right away. And since the Medicaid block grant would grow by only 1 percent per year, while inflation is over 2 percent and health inflation and enrollment growth is even higher. This means real harm will be inflicted where Medicaid spending is the greatest: on seniors and individuals with disabilities in nursing homes and those receiving benefits to live independently in their home. By cutting reimbursement rates, Medicaid will lose health providers. Nursing home quality and staffing levels will inevitably decline. Medicaid cuts will mean job losses in the health professions. The Republican budget utterly fails the basic test of humane government. It is extreme, it is mean, and it must be defeated. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan), who does not believe it's a social experiment to do what all families have to do: live within our means. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, folks, no prepared remarks, no fancy speeches. I brought with me a financial calculator. And regardless of how you calculate the numbers, America is spending too much money. You know, for 3 years in a row we spent over a trillion dollars more than we were bringing in as a Nation. We are over $14 trillion in debt. This budget puts us on a very clear path to paying back the national debt, to reducing and ending deficits in a very timely manner, to protecting the future for our children and our grandchildren, our most precious resource as Americans. I urge my colleagues to get behind this budget, vote for it, and let's put the American spending in priority. Let's stop the spending insanity here in Washington, D.C., and let's do what we tell the folks back home we are going to do, and let's get our fiscal house in order. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. We can get our fiscal house in order and do this in a balanced way without ending the Medicare guarantee. With that, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel). Mr. ISRAEL. I thank my friend from Maryland for yielding. Mr. Chairman, every budget is about the bottom line, and here is the Ryan budget bottom line: If you are making over a million dollars, you get a $100,000 tax cut. If you are a senior on Medicare, you get an extra $12,000 medical bill. If you make over a million dollars, you win the lottery. If you are a senior citizen, you lose your Medicare. Mr. Chairman, they say this is about balancing the budget, but they are trying to balance the budget by giving tax cuts to people earning over a million dollars and taking Medicare away from our seniors. That is no way to balance the budget. Mr. GARRETT. May I ask the Chair how much time remains. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 7 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Maryland has 2 minutes remaining. [[Page H2881]] Mr. GARRETT. At this time I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), who recognizes the fact that the solutions to all the problems in the world, as the other side may think, is not raising taxes on anyone and certainly not raising the taxes on those who produce the jobs in this country. Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong support of the Republican Study Committee budget alternative. The fact of the matter is we're broke. The Federal budget deficit is projected to exceed $1 trillion for the next 2 fiscal years and exceed $800 billion annually for at least the next decade. We cannot sustain this path without bankrupting our country. Congressman Ryan's budget proposal is a great start and sets us on a path to bringing the budget into balance. However, that proposal takes 28 years to do so. I support and will vote for his budget, but I am concerned about what will happen to it if future Congresses are not as willing to make the tough choices that are necessary to see this budget path to completion. That's why I strongly support the RSC budget, which balances the Federal budget within 9 years. Ultimately, we need a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget to force all future Congresses to make these tough decisions, but the RSC budget does the best job of getting our fiscal house in order as quickly as possible. And now I urge all Members to support it. The RSC Budget Proposal: Puts forward commonsense reforms to improve Medicare and Medicaid by offering increased choices and improved services, and takes steps to save Social Security. Repeals ObamaCare to eliminate $677 billion in additional spending over 10 years. Freezes total discretionary spending at 2008 levels ($933 billion) beginning in 2013. Prevents any new tax increases, repeals the unaffordable $813 billion tax increase included in ObamaCare, and proposes a smarter tax code that would lower rates while broadening the tax base. Reduces unnecessary mandatory spending--other than Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--by $1.9 trillion between 2012 and 2021. Mr. GARRETT. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence). (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) {time} 1100 Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Republican Study Committee budget alternative. Today I want to commend the gentleman from New Jersey for his courageous leadership on this issue. You know, they say that the first step in dealing with addiction is recognize that you have got a problem. After 10 years of fighting runaway Federal spending by both political parties here in Washington, DC, I am convinced Washington, DC is addicted to spending, and it's time that we got serious. I am a strong supporter of the Republican budget authored by Paul Ryan, and I am a strong supporter of the Republican Study Committee alternative offered by Mr. Garrett. The legislation before us today would actually put us on a pathway to achieve a balanced Federal budget by the year 2020. There are hard choices in this budget, but it's time the American people broke this addiction. It's a time that people in both political parties came together and played it straight with the American people and said there are tough choices ahead, we can do them in a way that's humane, we can do them in a way that represents fiscal discipline and reform. But we have to act; we have to act now. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita). Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this budget amendment. As a member of the Budget Committee, I also support the Ryan budget. Both these budget proposals are steps in the right direction. They make reforms that are needed. They are honest proposals. They are not trying to demagog, they are not trying to fear-monger, they are not trying to fib to the American people. We have got to address, Mr. Chairman, the drivers of our debt. We could have no Defense Department. I could work for free; our staffs can work for free. We can get rid of 167 agencies, and we still wouldn't get rid of this debt. Our debt is driven by these programs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. And the reason is because reckless politicians who came before this new Member made promises that can't possibly be kept. We are here to tell the truth, Mr. Chairman. These budgets do this job gradually, they do it humanely, and they allow people to prepare so that these programs can be saved for my kids and our grandkids. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time remains on each side. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland has 2 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from New Jersey has 3\3/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Southerland), who recognizes we must keep our promises, especially to the youth of tomorrow. (Mr. SOUTHERLAND asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SOUTHERLAND. I would like to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for the time this morning. I rise today in support of the RSC budget, as well as the Ryan budget. You know, my friends on the other side of the aisle make quick talk about the very most wealthy. Well, unfortunately, most of those file as individuals because they own LLCs and they own S corporations, as my family does. So you file those on your individual tax return. I think the American people deserve the truth regarding that number. The second thing, I will tell you something, as a new freshman to this body, it's amazing that we want to talk about how the Republicans want to harm Medicare on the heels of a health care bill that cut $500 billion out of Medicare. I have little patience, little patience with such talk. I will tell you the American people deserve the truth. They need this body, rather than to propose and push forth debt, doubt and despair, they must, they require us to give them certainty, safety, and security. I rise in support of the Ryan budget as well as RSC budget. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would remind the body that the $500 million in Medicare reform savings, which we got from ending some of the big breaks to the insurance industry, are kept in the Republican budget. You keep those savings. What you do not do is what we did: use some of those savings to close the prescription drug doughnut hole. So you took the savings, but you left the seniors with the doughnut hole. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro). Ms. DeLAURO. I strongly oppose this budget proposal. The choices the majority is making are ill considered and wrong. Instead of working to reduce the deficit in a commonsense way, this budget ends Medicare--it ends Medicare--throws seniors to the wolves. Instead of working to control health care costs, this budget shifts them on to seniors and families. The proposal repeals health care reform, dismantles Medicaid, throwing seniors out of nursing homes while providing giveaways to the insurance industry. It gives tax breaks to corporations that shift jobs overseas, cuts critical investments in education, research, job training and infrastructure. It provides subsidies to big oil companies, while cutting services to the most vulnerable Americans, including $350 billion in food stamps. Programs such as Medicaid, Pell Grants, WIC would be gutted. It cuts taxes for the wealthiest while raising taxes on the middle class. Millionaires, billionaires get a lower top tax rate and extended estate tax giveaway. Everyone else sees deductions and credits, like the child tax credit, eliminated. This budget is Robin Hood in reverse. It takes from seniors, the middle class, working families and gives all [[Page H2882]] that money to the rich and to corporate special interests. I urge my colleagues, stand up for the middle class today and for America's seniors and oppose this budget. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks), who actually read this amendment and understands that it makes absolutely no changes whatsoever for seniors 60 years of age and over and actually strengthens health care for seniors in generations to come. Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Chairman, by way of background, for the listeners and the people in this House, I graduated from Duke University with highest honors with distinction in economics. I say that to give you an idea, to have a little bit of insight as to what I am talking about when I talk about the two principal economic theories of our day. One is free enterprise and the other is socialism. Let's talk about socialism for a moment. It's greater and greater government micromanaging our lives. It's higher taxes to pay for it. Let's talk about free enterprise. Free enterprise is belief in the individual, in freedom and opportunity. It's what has helped make America one of the greatest nations this world has ever seen. This Republican budget, the two of them--you can go with the RSC or you can go with the Ryan one--they are premised on free enterprise solutions. They will create real jobs and wealth for all Americans. I urge this body to go with what our Founding Fathers went with, free enterprise. That's the ticket to success. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I have no further requests for time, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. So we stand before you, as I said before, with clear distinctions on the course that this country will lead in the future. Shall we continue to make the same bad policy that we have made in the past which sets us on a fiscal crisis, which not only this side of the aisle but the President of the United States recently stated as well? Or should we change the direction of the ship of State? Should we direct ourselves on a path towards fiscal sanity? Should we go in the direction that every single family in this country has to go in, that is to say, that we will live within our means, that we will not put an additional burden on our children and our grandchildren? Shall we go in a direction that we can say to the seniors 60 years of age or older that we will not change your entitlements, we will not change your health care but, rather, that we will put in place today's programs that will make sure that they are here for you and for your children and future generations as well? Shall we go on a path that says to our children of today and of tomorrow that we w
