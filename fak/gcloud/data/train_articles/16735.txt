I just checked the totals of the enumerated offenses in the first paragraph with their total of 650,000 crimes: the enumerated offenses account for 44.8% (291,306) of the total.

I believe that it's important to mention that the slide presentation that Hannity referred to has the heading of 'offenses' committed, not necessarily criminal offenses. According to the data that I viewed that could include such low level acts as being a runaway, public intoxication and minor drug use charges. I also recall sending you an email that the enumerated offenses that either "criminal aliens" and those here illegally only account for 48% of the total.

Do you find a factual basis to Hannity’s claim?

To the statement that illegal immigrants have been charged with 645,000 crimes no.

Because you’d change the word to offenses, correct, and point out that it covers lifetime arrests not arrests over a recent time period and that not all the individuals were living here illegally at t their latest arrest? Anything else leap out?

What do you consider the authoritative posted or published delineation of the difference between “offenses” and “crimes?”

The distinction between a crime or felony and lower level offenses is that the punishment for committing felony/crime is over 6 months imprisonment where a lesser offense/misdemeanor has a lesser penalty.

By the way, offenses was in the title of the slide being shown. Hannity is conflating crimes and lesser offenses into his 645k total but terming it all as "criminal behavior".
