Gummy Candy Manufacturing
Flat boxes, filled to the brim with a fine, smoothly levelled corn starch powder are transported along a conveyor belt and stamped by hundreds of plaster stamps that come down from above. The impressions made by the stamps leave impressions in the corn starch powder.

These boxes continue along the conveyor belt to the next stage of production, where nozzles inject a hot, liquid gummi mixture into the impressions, taking just a fraction of a second. Before you know it, several hundred gummies have been created.
