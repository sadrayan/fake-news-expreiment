Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-4) joined her Democratic colleagues to stand up for American families by opposing H.R. 2767, the PATH (to Nowhere) Act. The bill passed the Financial Services Committee this morning on a party line vote.

“Instead of working across party lines, Republican Members on the Financial Services Committee – led by Chairman Hensarling – insisted on pursuing a hyper-partisan housing reform bill that has no chance of becoming law. This radical bill would push the dream of home ownership further and further out of reach for Wisconsin families. The so-called PATH Act is, in actuality, the PATH to Nowhere.

“I am pleased that Chairman Hensarling has decided to tackle housing reform; however H.R. 2767 would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15 and 30-year mortgages – the cornerstone of our housing finance system.

“I stand with Democrats in our resolve to improve our housing market. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to put partisanship aside and work to strengthen this vital aspect of our economy in a bipartisan manner.”
