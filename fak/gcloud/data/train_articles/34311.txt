WASHINGTON – Congressional Leadership Fund (@CLFSuperPAC), the super PAC endorsed by House Republican leadership, today announced a record-breaking $132 million raised to date in the 2018 cycle, with $40 million raised since July 1, 2018. In 2016, CLF raised $51 million in the entire cycle.

“With Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s leadership in Congress, CLF has more than doubled what CLF raised the entire 2016 cycle. Our donors are energized to prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker,” said Corry Bliss, CLF Executive Director. “CLF is following through on our promise to raise and spend over $100 million this election cycle. CLF’s record-breaking fundraising, along with our unprecedented field program which has made over 24 million voter contacts in 40 key congressional districts to date, proves CLF will continue to be a major player defending the House Republican majority this November.”

In February 2017 CLF launched an unparalleled field program contacting voters in 40 congressional districts across the country, making over 24 million voter contacts to date. Additionally, CLF recently announced another round of fall advertising reservations totaling over $80 million to date, including an unprecedented $20 million digital investment.
