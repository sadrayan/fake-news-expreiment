My friend found this in a textbook
"He may have been able to get out of prison time but in my Criminal Justice 101 textbook, Brock Turner is the definition of rape, so he's got that goin for him." -- Friend's comment FP edit: If you feel like sending me something, send me uplifting stuff. Be kind to each other, let the people who matter to you know you love them. And if you're going through a hard time, know you're not alone and if you need to talk to someone, I'm always here for y'all. Edit 2: source - Introduction to Criminal Justice, 2nd edition.
