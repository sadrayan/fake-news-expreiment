Billabong Team Rider Manoa Drollet Scores Huge Teahupoo, Tahiti : Surfing Waves News
With balls bigger than the coconuts washed up on the beach, Billabong team rider Manoa Drollet has been slung into what many are calling the biggest wave ever to be ridden at ‘Chopes in Tahiti.

Already laying claim to the title of Teahupoo’s biggest mad dog, Manoa joined Billabong Adventure Division crew Shane Dorian, Dylan Longbottom and Laurie Towner to tame the giant swell last week, the biggest in over a year.

“I compare it to driving fast in a car through a corner and making it around,” joked the quietly spoken Tahitian. “When you have got your Sh@t together and you are going good, then you feel great.”

“I haven’t seen all the shots and it’s hard to tell because when you are on it, you just want to make the wave,” hey said. “I want to see the pictures, and then I’ll judge from there, but I’d be stoked if it is the biggest one.”

Manoa and Shane hooked up as tow partners while Dylan and Lozza grabbed the other Billabong Yamaha and gave it a crack.

It was the first time Lozza had slung anyone in, and he literally had zero pull out option because Dylan was frothing to get some bombs.

“It was pretty intimidating being out there and towing with those guys, I was more or less the last in line for a wave,” joked Lozza. “It the first time I had ever used a Jetski and I had to tow Dylan into some big ones, it was the scariest thing I have ever done.”

In any case, Lozza nailed it and Dylan was fed his quota of evil caves.

Tim McKenna fired off this shot of Manoa on the glory ride, we will float out some more images of the boys getting piped shortly.

Adventure Division boss Margo is stoked how the lads went and has his beady eyes on a new right slab somewhere in the southern ocean over the next few months.

Stay tuned….
