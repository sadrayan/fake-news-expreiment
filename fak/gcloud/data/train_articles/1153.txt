Gift triples U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy's personal wealth
SHARE U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy

The month before he took office, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy boosted his personal wealth with $1 million to $5 million in family company stock from his construction executive father, according to federal financial disclosures.

Murphy, D-Jupiter, said that last December he received the shares of his family's privately owned company in Miami, Coastal Construction Group. The gift at least tripled Murphy's 2011 net worth as a Congressional District 18 candidate, when he listed no shares in the family business.

U.S. House candidates and congressional members have to disclose a range of values for their assets and liabilities. Murphy's 2011 form puts his net worth between $136,000 and $320,700. With the stock, Murphy's 2012 worth registered between about $1.1 million and $5.4 million.

"My dad is the primary shareholder, along with my brothers and some other family members, so (it's) a family business," Murphy said. "And, like many family businesses, my dad's getting older and gifting some of that to his children and relatives."

Murphy's father, Thomas Murphy Jr., and Coastal Construction played prominent roles in his son's win over ex-Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West. Murphy's dad fueled a combined $550,000 into super PACs that bashed West in ads. His family members and Coastal Construction employees donated almost $94,000 to Murphy's 2012 campaign.

Murphy also made a $98,050 salary with Coastal Construction in both 2011 and 2012, the disclosure states.

Coastal Construction ranks among the 100 biggest construction contractors in the county. The group has worked on Donald Trump's South Florida high-rises, college buildings, resorts and more. Murphy also helped found a spinoff subsidiary, Coastal Environmental Services, which helped clean up after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill for eight months.

Even with stock valued in seven figures, Murphy isn't the wealthiest member running in District 18, which includes St. Lucie, Martin and northern Palm Beach counties.

Former state Rep. Carl Domino, a Jupiter Republican running for Murphy's seat, was once the richest member in the Legislature. Before his failed 2012 bid to return to the Florida House, the wealth adviser listed his 2011 net worth at $24.3 million. Florida legislative and statewide candidates have to report their exact net worth.

Calvin Turnquest, another District 18 Republican contender and former council member in Tequesta, also unsuccessfully ran alongside Domino for the Florida House in 2012. His financial disclosure for 2011 lists his net worth at $10,500.

They lost to state Rep. MaryLynn Magar, a Tequesta Republican who represents parts of Martin and northern Palm Beach counties in Florida House District 82.
