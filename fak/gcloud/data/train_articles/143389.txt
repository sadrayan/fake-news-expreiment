Kindle edition by Kamala Harris, Joan O'C. Hamilton. Professional & Technical Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com.
After reading this book I can see that Kamala is ready to reform the National Gov't as President or Vice President. She recalls her exciting 'Judge-Judy-esq' courtroom drama to illustrate her personal outlook on politics and philosophy. There are lots of surprises in here (like Obama's book). Read this before the 2020 Presidential campaign and you might be an expert on juicy background of this iconoclastic lawmaker before it gets rehashed by the News Feed. I'm convinced now that Kamala can not only take on Bernie and incumbent Mike Pence but hold her own on the world stage. You simply can't fit intelligent leadership and law commentary into a Tweet.
