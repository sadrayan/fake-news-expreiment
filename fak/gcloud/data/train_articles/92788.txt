Mitch McConnell says "we're doing everything we can" to get Rubio to run for Senate again
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell left no doubt that he is trying to convince Sen. Marco Rubio to run for another term.

During an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Tuesday, McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, told host Joe Scarborough that “we’re trying to draft Marco to run again.”

Scarborough asked if McConnell thinks Rubio will do it.

“I hope so,” McConnell said. “We’re doing everything we can to encourage him to run.”

McConnell’s comments come five days after U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said “strongly encouraged” Rubio to reconsider his decision and seek re-election.

"I understand the argument and the people who are coming forward and asking me to reconsider are people I respect and enjoy serving with," Rubio said last week. "But I have a really good friend running for the Senate who I think is a good candidate, who I think gives us a real good chance to win if he were to be nominated."

Rubio was referring to Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a Miami Republican who is one of five Republicans running in the Aug. 30 GOP primary.
