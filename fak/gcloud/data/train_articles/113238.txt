I Ran Over The Taco Bell Dog
Title: I Ran Over The Taco Bell Dog

Artist: Adam Sandler Lyrics: I was driving around in old Mexico,

I got lost and didn't know which way to go,

I was confused, it was late and I was in a fog,

I ran over the Taco Bell dog.



I felt that smush and I said, "Oh mama"

My low rider crushed that little Chihuahua.

I prayed for forgiveness in a Synagogue,

I ran over the Taco Bell dog.



If I am caught they will put me in a cell with 20 locks,

Unless I can pin it on Jack in the Box.

I'll be whipped, then beaten and then I'll be flogged,

I ran over the Taco Bell dog.



His last words were, "Yo quiero el m√©dico",

I flattened that pup, to Hell I would go.

I should of skipped driving and gone for a jog,

I ran over the Taco Bell dog.



I ran over the Taco Bell dog.



I ran over the Taco Bell dog.
