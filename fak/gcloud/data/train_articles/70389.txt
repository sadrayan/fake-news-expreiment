Alaska Republican Party Hails Stevens Inocence

by Randy Ruedrich



Anchorage, Alaska - The Alaska Republican Party has supported Senator Ted Stevens for more than 40 years and the party hailed the news today that the federal Department of Justice is dropping all charges against our former Senator.

"I am delighted to see justice moving forward. The position that the

Alaska Republican Party took after the trial was that Alaskans needed to

support the senator, and now we have further information to support our

position," Randy Ruedrich, ARP Chairman, said.

The Alaska Republican Party further believes that current Senator Mark Begich should resign his position to allow for a new, special election, so Alaskans may have the chance to vote for a Senator without the improper influence of the corrupt Department of Justice.



The only reason Mark Begich won the election in November is because a few thousand Alaskans thought that Senator Ted Stevens was guilty of seven felonies. Senator Stevens has maintained his innocence and now, even the Department of Justice acknowedges it's wrong doing.



A special election will allow Alaskans to have a real, non-biased, credible process where the most qualified person could win, without the manipulation of the Department of Justice.



"We'll look forward to the complete story presenting itself and clearing Senator Stevens name.," Ruedrich said.
