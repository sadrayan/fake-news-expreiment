Georgetown Preparatory School
All of us at Georgetown Prep are part of something unique. We are part of something that has been around since the founding of the nation.

We are members of a very diverse community: Men from different neighborhoods, other states, countries, and continents. Men with different talents and interests. Men from other races, ethnicities, socio-economic, and religious backgrounds.

But, somehow, some way, we form an unbreakable brotherhood.
