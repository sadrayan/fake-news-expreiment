ABOUT THE BOOK

In May of 2015 a video was released of a young woman reading a copy of Do You Want To Play With My Balls?, a hilarious, childrenâ€™s book parody for adults. In one day her Facebook video received over 1 million views, and over 50 million by months end. This prompted an Internet explosion that not only put Do You Want To Play With My Balls? on the map, but on the entire globe. Once this book is in your hands you will have no choice but to show it to all your friends and family, and, like the video gone viral, the laughter will grow and grow!
