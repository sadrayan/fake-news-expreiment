PENCE SOFTENS STANCE ON PORTER ABUSE ALLEGATIONS

What do you think about Vice President Mike Pence’s recent comments on abuse allegations leveled against White House aide Rob Porter?

Previously, Pence said he was “appalled” when he first learned about the domestic abuse allegations against now-former White House staff secretary Rob Porter and is “going to look into the matter” of what the White House and chief of staff John Kelly knew.

Pence, who just returned from South Korea for the Olympics,he is concerned about what White House chief of staff John Kelly may have known about the allegations and didn’t take action against Porter. Porter is accused of kicking and punching his first wife, Colbie Holderness, and his second wife, Jennie Willoughby, filed an emergency protective order against him.

Pence has softened his comments about Porter saying his actions if true were “in accordance with Biblical principles” and that women should “submit to their husbands as their husbands are their heads just as Jesus is head of the church.”

Pence had previously said that he found out about the Porter situation when he awoke Wednesday on the way to South Korea. Asked why he sometimes seems so unaware of happenings in the White House, Pence simply said it is an honor to serve in the Trump administration and has been using his time in public office to get closer to the Lord.

He did not directly answer a question as to whether he believes the president’s staff is serving him well and said that he really has no time for such trivialities as staffing.

“Jesus didn’t worry about what his Apostles were doing all the time”, Pence told Fox News, “I’ll let the President worry about what his staff are doing.”
