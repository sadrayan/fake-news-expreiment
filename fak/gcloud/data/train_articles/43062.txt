DEAN LORICH Obituary - New York, NY
LORICH--Dean, M.D.



The Board of Trustees and the entire Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) community extend our deepest sympathy at the passing of Dean Lorich, M.D., associate director of the orthopaedic trauma service at HSS. Dr. Lorich was a respected surgeon, teacher and friend to many not only at HSS, but also at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine. Throughout his 18 year career, he helped thousands of patients including those who were impacted by crises abroad. He operated on soldiers who were injured in combat in Germany and led a relief effort in Haiti for victims of the 2010 earthquake. While at HSS, Dr. Lorich served as a mentor in the Orthopaedic Trauma Residency Program. Throughout his distinguished career, he received numerous prestigious awards including the Roger E. Joseph Prize for Humanitarian Medical Rescue Work in 2010 and the Philip D. Wilson Resident Teacher of the Year Award in 2006. On behalf of the entire HSS family, we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and patients.
