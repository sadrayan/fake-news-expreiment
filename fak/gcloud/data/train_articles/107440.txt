How Much is Inside Shaving Cream?
How much is inside got started with Shaving Cream.

Mark, Leif and I shot the photos in December, 1998, and I pasted them into a webpage a few days later. Now, there is no easy way to say this...

The sad truth is that the episode was faked.

When we emptied that can of shaving cream, only a tiny, pitiful pile of shaving cream came out. We were very disappointed.

At that moment, that night in my kitchen, it seemed like a good idea to fabricate a new result: We introduced an inverted saucepan to the pile, coated it with a second can of shaving cream, and called it science.

The fraud was complete.
