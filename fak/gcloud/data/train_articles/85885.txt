Homicides dropped by 7 percent in 2017. Here's how many each county had.
Driven by a historically low homicide total in Newark and a drop in violence in Camden County, homicides in New Jersey fell by about 7 percent in 2017 over the prior year, according to an NJ Advance Media analysis.

An informal survey of county prosecutors found there were 335 homicides in the state in 2017, compared with 362 killings in 2016.

"Though final numbers are still not available, we know that there has been a significant reduction in violent crime overall in New Jersey, including a very significant reduction in the total number of homicides, with certain cities seeing dramatic reductions," Attorney General Christopher Porrino said in a statement.
