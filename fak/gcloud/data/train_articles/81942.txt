Campaign 2016 updates: Trump supporters say he's a 'genius' for avoiding taxes
A day after Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of mocking supporters of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator said Sunday that she was “absolutely correct” to tell donors that many of his young supporters were stuck living with their parents and working low-wage jobs after college.

“You've got millions of young people, many of whom took out loans in order to go to college, hoping to go out and get decent-paying, good jobs," Sanders told ABC's "This Week." "And you know what? They're unable to do that.”

In an audio recording made public last week, Clinton is heard telling campaign donors during her Democratic primary race against Sanders that some of his supporters were “children of the Great Recession, and they are living in their parents' basement.”
