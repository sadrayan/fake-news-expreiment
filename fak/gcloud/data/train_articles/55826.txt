Warriors visit with Barack Obama instead of Donald Trump during DC trip

The Golden State Warriors shared a private visit with former US president Barack Obama on Thursday before beating the Washington Wizards 126-118 in the nation’s capital.

A photo of the meeting was posted on Instagram by Tony Banks, a member of the Warriors’ staff, who later deleted the image. San Jose Mercury News reporter Logan Murdock captured the photo and tweeted it.

The Warriors have avoided the traditional trip for a championship team to the White House under sitting president Donald Trump.

Trump publicly revoked the standing invitation after Golden State’s 2017 NBA title after guard Stephen Curry had previously said he would not want to attend.

The team also did not visit after their 2018 championship.

Warriors players declined to elaborate on who set up the meeting with Obama. A team official told ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne that Curry was key in arranging it, but it was meant to remain private and not intended as a political statement.

Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, chatted with Curry after the game for a couple of moments before getting a photo with the two-time MVP.

Pelosi, who represents California’s 12th congressional district not far from the team’s Oakland headquarters, had previously invited the Warriors to visit the Capitol following their 2017 championship.
