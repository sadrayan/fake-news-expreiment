CBP, National Guard, Mexican Authorities Team to Seize Catapult, Drugs
Tucson, Ariz. - Border Patrol agents and members of the National Guard coordinated with Mexican authorities to prevent a drug smuggling attempt Friday evening near Naco, Ariz. Mexican officials responded and seized approximately 45 pounds of marijuana, a sport utility vehicle, and a catapult capable of launching contraband into the U.S.

The catapult and drugs that were seized by Mexican authorities.

As part of the Sept. 8 deployment of 504 National Guard personnel to the Tucson Sector, National Guard troops assigned to operate the remote video surveillance system at the Naco station observed several individuals just south of the international boundary fence preparing a catapult. Border Patrol agents assigned to the International Liaison Unit contacted Mexican authorities who responded to the area and disrupted the catapult operation. Camera operators observed individuals fleeing the area, presumably to avoid apprehension.

"The Border Patrol's partnerships with Mexican authorities, the National Guard and the public enhance our efforts to address and disrupt the organized drug trafficking threat at the border and serves to degrade the capabilities of transnational criminal organizations. With their continued support and that of the public, we will continue to more effectively address threats before they cross the International Boundary," stated Associate Chief Jose Cruz.
