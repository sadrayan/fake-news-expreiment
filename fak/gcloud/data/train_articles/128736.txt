Kellyanne Conway Won’t Apologize for Her Inauguration Outfit
Update (January 26, 2017, 1:15 P.M.): Kellyanne Conway took time to respond to haters of her red, white, and blue Inauguration Day coat in a new Hollywood Reporter profile. She’s reportedly “sorry to offend the black-stretch-pants women of America with a little color.”

While most eyes in the fashion community of late have been focused on the dressing credits of First Lady Melania Trump and First Daughter Ivanka, Donald Trump’s campaign manager turned “counselor to the president,” Kellyanne Conway, arrived for the inauguration on Friday in an unmissable red, white, and blue coat that set Fashion Twitter afire.

The Gucci coat is adorned with “feline” appliqué buttons and costs $3,600. The coat was made in Italy, and designer Alessandro Michele was “inspired by the city of London,” according to Net-a-Porter’s editors’ note. Conway, a longtime Republican strategist and Trump‘s go-to mouthpiece on the campaign trail, told NBC’s Bay Area affiliate that she considered it “Trump revolutionary wear.”

Though Conway’s many detractors say that her spin on the president’s words or tweets often contradicts him, in this instance, her red, white, and blue militaristic nod is right on message. Trump told The Washington Post to expect an increasingly visible military during his term. Trump explained that the “military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military.” The inauguration itself is expected to have five flyovers for each branch.
