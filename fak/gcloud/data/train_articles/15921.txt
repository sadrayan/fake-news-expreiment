Subject: Texas reporter inquiry for a fact check

Citing IDEA, a Texas elected official, Bruce Elfant, has said the US ranks about 100th in voter turnout among industrial nations.

Is he right? Why or why not?

THANKS.

Dear Gardner Selby,

Thanks for your inquiry. In order to best answer your question, can you provide us with a bit more context about the citation? Is this regarding recent legislative elections? Also, how are you defining and/or classifying industrial nations?

Kind regards,

Lynn

Elfant is an official advocating more voter registration and participation. Heâ€™s offering your research as backup for his claim about the U.S. ranking. I am attaching what he sent us.

Thoughts?

International IDEA finds that yes, he is right. But please see the ranking in the attached file, if you are interested in a more exact ranking.

Please note that the label industrial nations may cause confusion and therefore, we would say among all countries.

Best,

Lynn
