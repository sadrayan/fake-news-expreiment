Statement by Business Council President Heather C. Briccetti on 2016-17 Budget Agreement
For Release — March 31, 2016 Statement by Business Council President Heather C. Briccetti on 2016-17 Budget Agreement

ALBANY, N.Y.—“We are disappointed with the multi-billion dollar increase in the minimum wage. This increase – at $8000 per job upstate and $13,000 downstate when fully implemented - is still too much for many businesses. The last thing employers need is higher state-imposed costs. We are further discouraged that the budget deal includes the most expansive Paid Family Leave law in the nation, while leaving out meaningful business cost reductions, such as workers’ compensation reform, and targeted small business tax cuts. The middle class tax reductions are welcome, but the final budget agreement fails to improve the overall economic climate of the state. The Business Council has consistently and repeatedly laid out reasonable, necessary and overdue reforms that would spur economic growth and benefit the entire state. New York needs to do better.”

– Heather C. Briccetti, president and CEO of The Business Council of New York State, Inc.
