The Gold Star Mothers of America, Inc.
American Gold Star Mothers was incorporated in Washington, DC and granted

a Federal Charter by the ninety-eighth Congress. That was in 1929, and in the years

since, through times of war and times of peace, this organization of American mothers

has changed, grown, and always been there when needed. Click here for information about our National President

and our National Board. ______________________________________________







With regard to the NewsMax article concerning our organization,

the American Gold Star Mothers, Inc., deeply regret the misunderst anding

about Senator Hillary Clinton. The two mothers who visited Washington

did not have an appointment with the Senator and she was not in her office

on that day. We would appreciate it if the e-mails and negative comments

about Senator Clinton would cease.

Dorothy Oxendine, National President
