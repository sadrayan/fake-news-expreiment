Congressman Joe Heck Statement on Continuing Resolution Vote
WASHINGTON -- Congressman Joe Heck (NV-03) today issued the following statement after voting in favor of H. J. Res. 59.

"During the August work period, I heard from constituents throughout the district who made their wishes clear: keep the government open and alleviate the burdens placed on them, their families, and their businesses by the flawed health care law. The CR passed today by the House reflects those priorities â€“ it keeps the government open, controls spending, and defunds an unworkable law. The House has heard the voice of the American public and it is now time for the Senate to act."
