BRITISH waterpark bans bikinis and DEMANDS visitors wear ‘Islamically appropriate’ clothes
Only female lifeguards will patrol the park during the event, which has triggered a flood of complaints.

Staff will also “guard�? the front entrance to “make sure that no males enter the facility�?.

In a statement on its Facebook page, a spokesman for WaterWorld said the Sisters Only event would “attract ladies of all religions/beliefs as we invite you to visit our facility and enjoy its features whilst having the option of wearing attire that our normal operating procedures prevent�?.

Conservative MP Philip Hollobone said: “I imagine there would be a lot of outrage if the boot was on the other foot and swimmers were told they had to dress appropriately in respect of Christians. I don’t see how this is different.�?

One invitation to the “Sisters Only Funday�? advises attendees to cover their “awrah�? (nudity) by wearing full-length jogging bottoms and a dark-coloured t-shirt.
