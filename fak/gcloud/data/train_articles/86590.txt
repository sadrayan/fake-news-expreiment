Women in Congress

When the 113th United States Congress convenes in January 2013 there will be:

99 female members of Congress overall, out of 535 members. That’s only 18.5% of Congress.

20 female senators, or 20% (16 Democrats, 4 Republicans).

79 female Representatives, or 18.2% (60 Democrats, 19 Republicans).

In addition, there are three female delegates, representing Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Washington DC.

The 113th Congress has a record number of females in the U.S. Senate and in the U.S. House of Representatives.

In the 113th Congress, New Hampshire became the first state in U.S. history to have an all-female Congressional delegation and a female governor.

Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi, and Vermont have never sent a woman to either the US Senate or US House.

In 2002, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) was chosen to be Democratic Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives. With this selection, she became the first woman to lead the Democrats in the U.S. House. In 2007, she became the first female speaker of the House. In 2011, she began serving as the U.S. House Minority Leader and will continue to serve in that role in the 113th Congress beginning in 2013.

Jeannette Rankin was the first woman elected to the House of Representatives, serving from 1917-1919 and again from 1941-1942.

Rebecca Latimer Felton was the first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, though she only served temporarily. In 1922, she was appointed to fill a seat for two days and then gave it up to the man who had been elected to it.

The first woman ever elected to the Senate was Hattie Wyatt Caraway in 1933. She was appointed to fill her late husband’s seats, but she later served two full terms. She also became the first woman to chair a Senate committee.

1992 was dubbed the “Year of the Women” due to a surge in the number of female candidates running for elected office.

29 female candidates filed for the U.S Senate elections.

4 of 11 Senatorial candidates won elected office, as well as one incumbent, making this the largest number of female victories in major-party nominations. The victors were: Diane Feinstein (D-CA); Barbara Boxer (D-CA); Carol Moseley- Braun (D- IL); Patty Murray (D-WA); Barbara Mikulski (Incumbent, D- MD).

24 female members were elected to the House: Corrine Brown (D-FL); Leslie Byrne (D-VA); Maria Cantwell (D-WA); Eva Clayton (D-NC); Pat Danner (D-MO); Jennifer Dunn (R-WA); Karan English (D-AR); Anna Eshoo (D-CA); Tillie Fowler (R-FL); Elizabeth Furse (D-OR); Jane Harman (D-CA); Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX); Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-AR); Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-PA); Cynthia McKinney (D-GA); Carrie Meek (D-FL); Deborah Pryce (R-OH); Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA); Lynn Schenk (D-CA); Karen Shepherd (D-UT); Karen Thurman (D-FL); Nydia Velazquez (D-NY); Lynn Woolsey (D-CA); Carolyn Maloney (D-NY).

22% of the freshman members of the House in 1992 were women.

The 1992 election increased the percentage of women in the House from 6% to 11%.

As of 2010, a total of 260 women have served in Congress, 170 Democrats and 90 Republicans. Of these women, 222 (145 Democrats, 77 Republicans) have served only in the House of Representatives; 30 (19 Democrats, 11 Republicans) have served only in the Senate; and 8 (6 Democrats, 2 Republicans) have served in both houses.

In 2013, 71 women hold statewide elective executive offices across the country; women hold 22.4% of the 315 available positions.

To date, women have been elected statewide to executive offices in 49 of the nation’s 50 states (the exception is the state of Maine).

As a result of the 2012 elections, there are five female women governors (1D, 4R). One new woman was elected Governor: Maggie Hassan (D-NH).

Hassan joins four holdover incumbents who were not up for re-election: Jan Brewer (R-AZ), Susanna Martinez (R-NM), Mary Fallin (R-OK) and Nikki Haley (R-SC).

The largest number of women to serve simultaneously as governors was nine, which occurred in 2004 and again in 2007.

Since the founding of our country, only 32 women have been elected state governor.

The first female governor was Nellie Taloe Ross (D-WY) in 1925. She was picked by the Democrats to run after her husband died.

Twenty-four states have never had a female governor. The relatively new governors in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and South Carolina are the first women to head the government in those states.

The first woman to be nominated for President of the United States by a major party was Margaret Chase Smith in 1964. She received Republican primary votes multiple states, including New Hampshire, Illinois, and Massachusetts. However, she removed herself from contention after the first ballot.

Ellen McCormack was the first woman to qualify for federal campaign matching funds and qualified for Secret Service Protection in 1976. She entered 20 state primaries for the Democratic presidential nomination. She ran again in 1980 as the candidate for the Right to Life party.

Women in the Court

Sandra Day O’Connor was the first female Member of the Supreme Court. President Reagan nominated to the court, and then, the U.S. Senate confirmed her.

Female Voters

Since 1980, in every presidential election, the proportion of eligible female adults who have voted has exceeded the proportion of eligible male adults who have voted. Prior to 1980, the voter turnout rate was lower for women than for men.

Female voters have outnumbered male voters in every presidential election since 1964.
