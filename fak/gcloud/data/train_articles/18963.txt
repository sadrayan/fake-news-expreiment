Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement after the Senate of Virginia and Virginia House of Delegates’ votes on a budget amendment to use Virginians’ federal tax dollars to offer hundreds of thousands of people who fall into the Medicaid coverage gap access to a private health insurance plan:

“I commend the bipartisan group of legislators from both chambers of the General Assembly who voted today to put their constituents and Virginia’s economy ahead of partisan politics. Because of those votes, the Senate budget contains a smart, market-based path forward to covering more Virginians and growing our economy in the process. While I am disappointed that House Republicans chose ideology ahead of what’s best for the Commonwealth on this preliminary vote, I remain optimistic that members of both parties can find common ground to accept this good deal for Virginia.

“Passing the Marketplace Virginia proposal will expand coverage for up to 400,000 Virginians, create as many as 30,000 jobs and save the state budget $1 billion dollars between now and 2022. That is why Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House of Delegates, the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, and a number of other business and health care organizations support the language in the Senate budget establishing Marketplace Virginia. As the budget process moves forward, I hope the House Republican leadership will join the broad bipartisan consensus that Virginia families and our economy are more important than rigid partisan ideology.”
