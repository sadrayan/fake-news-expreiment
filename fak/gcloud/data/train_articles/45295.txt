Fairfax, VA - The National Rifle Association`s Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) has announced its endorsement of Joe Manchin, III for Governor of West Virginia. Manchin has also earned an "A+" rating from the Association.

Randy Kozuch, NRA Director of State and Local Affairs, emphasized Manchin`s commitment to the Second Amendment cause stating, "As a member of the West Virginia Legislature and as Secretary of State, Joe Manchin has been a supporter of Second Amendment rights. He knows that to effectively fight crime you get tough on criminals, not law-abiding citizens."
