* Erika Harold was on WLS Radio today and had this to say about her alleged claim in 2000 that she’d place a foster child in an abusive home with heterosexual parents rather than putting the kid in a house with gay parents…

Harold, who was 19 years old at the time, told “The Big John and Ramblin’ Ray Show” Friday morning on WLS that she does not remember making the comments, but if she did she is sorry.

“As I’ve stated, I don’t recall the specific exchanges alleged by those sources” said Harold. “If I said it, it was absolutely wrong. But what I’m happy to make perfectly clear, is that I support same-sex adoption, and same-sex foster parenting because we need more loving homes and places for children to be loved and cared for.”

Harold also admitted during the WLS interview that she most likely would not have supported gay adoption when she was 19.

“I have changed. Certainly at the time I would not have supported same sex adoption, same-sex foster parenting and that was wrong. Like many people during that time it was a different era. And there were a lot of people who held that position, and I think there are a lot of people who have evolved like me”, said Harold. […]

“There is a consensus that we need to provide children with more safe and loving homes and I think it’s important that people be able to evolve” said Harold. “In politics it’s important that you change your position if you realize that it was wrong. There’s no point in defending positions that you may have held just because you may have held them. I think we need to be a place where people can evaluate, and pay attention to changing norms and new evidence and have humility and say ‘I was wrong.’”
