Health Care
Senator Warner is committed to providing access to quality, affordable care for Virginians. Warner has consistently said that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is not perfect, but our previous system was unsustainable and would eventually bankrupt our economy. Senator Warner knows that we cannot go back to a time when insurers denied coverage because of pre-existing health conditions, charged women more than men, or dropped someone's coverage when they got sick. Instead of repealing the ACA, Democrats and Republicans should work together to improve the law, and he has been at the forefront of providing bipartisan, commonsense solutions to fix the ACA. He will continue to work with his colleagues on targeted improvements to help Virginians secure affordable health care coverage â€“ and fight efforts to take us backwards.
