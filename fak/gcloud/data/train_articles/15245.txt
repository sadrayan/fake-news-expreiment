Hello again; it has been a good long while.

I write afresh because weâ€™re checking a claim by U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, that up to six federal department budget bills have been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops.

I have spotted several July news stories along such lines and, I see, the House has yet to send six 2016 appropriations bills to the Senate.

So, does all of this hold up? Anything left out, in your analysis? Other recommended resources?

Thanks.

I have seen the same reports as you: the House has passed 7 of the 13 regular approps bills and the process came to a screeching halt when a confederate flag amendment was thrown into the mix. However, in past years the House got through about the same number and then stopped because the Senate was not taking up any of the 13 and it seemed fruitless to send them more bills they vowed not to take up (as Senate Democrats have done this year until a more generous budget accord is reached. So, I cannot attest to the rumor that the threat of confederate flag amendments would even be germane to all of the remaining bills.
