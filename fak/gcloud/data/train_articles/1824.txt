Senator Joe Biden: The War in Iraq
Sen. Biden favored holding Saddam Hussein accountable for a decade of violating United Nations resolutions. But he believes the Administration went to war too soon, without a real coalition, without enough troops and without a plan to win the peace. As a longtime member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden knows that no foreign policy can be sustained without the informed consent of the American people. And of all the mistakes the Bush Administration made in Iraq, perhaps the biggest was that it never leveled with the American people about the lack of an imminent threat, the human and material cost of securing the peace and the need to plan not just for the “day after” but for the “decade after.”
