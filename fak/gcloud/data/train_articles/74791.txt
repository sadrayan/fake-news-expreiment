CBO Finds Budget Deal Will Cost $320 Billion
The Congressional Budget Office has released a series of estimates for the budget deal announced yesterday. The deal would add $320 billion to deficits over the next decade, or almost $420 billion with interest. The bill increases discretionary spending levels by $296 billion over the next two years, includes $89 billion in disaster spending, modest health care changes that roughly net out, and $15 billion in tax cuts from renewing tax breaks that expired at the end of 2016.

As a result of the spending deal and the fact that we already projected deficits to reach $1 trillion next year, the fiscal year 2019 deficit would climb to almost $1.2 trillion.

Because not all money budgeted would be projected to be spent in the 10-year window, the total outlays for discretionary and disaster spending are slightly lower than the increase in the caps.

2018-2027 Costs/ Savings (-) Net Revenue Decreases $9 billion Net Mandatory Spending Cuts -$47 billion Increase in Discretionary Spending Caps $290 billion Disaster Relief Spending $68 billion Subtotal $320 billion Interest Costs $98 billion Total Cost $418 billion
