M&C; Saatchi launches Optus Whale Song
Optus has a long association with nature so M&C Saatchi, Sydney set about exploring communication between humans and animals, specifically Humpback whales.“Whale song is a form of communication,” says Ben Welsh, executive creative director, M&C Saatchi Sydney. “It’s a form of communication that the scientists at The University of Queensland have been able to decipher and learn. I was intrigued by this fact and so we asked ourselves whether it would be possible to emulate a male humpback: to write our own love song and then play it, using the instruments of an orchestra? Could we serenade a humpback ourselves? Then imagine what could happened if the whales were to hear our song. We thought that would prove that when it comes to communication, anything is possible.”Creative Director: Ben WelshCopywriters: Ben Welsh and Andy FlemmingArt Director: Paul CarpenterAgency Producers: Jenny Lee-Archer, Rod James and Loren AugustDirector: David DenneenEditor: Sue SchweikertMusic & Sound Design : Bruce Heald - Noise
