10 Roots -Bareroot-Pineapple/Strawberry Flavor : Patio, Lawn & Garden
I ordered ten plants but they sent me eleven; whether the extra was an oversight or was included in case any of the ten died, I don't know. Whatever the reason, all eleven are growing like gangbusters in individual pots on my deck.



Two notes:



1. The nursery includes illustrated instructions that say to refrigerate the plants if there will be a delay in planting. I didn't realize this until I was ready to pot them five days after they arrived (they'd been sitting in their shipping box on a kitchen counter all this time). So be aware that you should refrigerate them if you're not going to plant them right away, but keeping them at room temperature for several days won't kill them.



2. The instructions also say to cut the roots to a length of six inches. At least half the plants I received had roots less than six inches long to begin with, so I only trimmed perhaps a quarter of an inch off the bottoms of these. All of the plants are thriving regardless of original root length.



Bottom line: the plants arrived quickly and have done better than I hoped they would, even though I didn't follow the instructions to the letter. Very happy!
