This is the end of John McCain: Why the Arizona senator could finally be facing retirement
Obviously, this could change with one presidential election where someone from the anti-establishment wing gets roundly rebuked by the electorate, but the truth is that the current incarnation of the Republican Party simply doesn’t have room for people like McCain and Graham anymore. Graham and McCain are not moderate politicians; to be sure, their love of war outpaces nearly anyone else in the Senate. They’re seen, however, as remnants of the neocon years, a period that the Republican Party of today would like to pretend didn’t exist.

Enter former state senator Kelli Ward, who’s challenging McCain in the primary and lines up perfectly with the way Ted Cruz and Mike Lee see the world. In the three years Ward was a state senator (she resigned to run in this race), she: indulged her constituents’ worries about chemtrails; defended Donald Sterling; hung out with Cliven Bundy; and tried to repeal liberal, gun-grabbing Arizona’s ban on silencers and sawed-off shotguns. If there’s any remaining doubt that Ward wouldn’t immediately align herself with the Cruz and Lee wing of the party, she was also the only member of Arizona’s entire legislature to vote against a boost in funding for the Arizona Department of Child Safety.
