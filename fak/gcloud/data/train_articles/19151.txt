The Constitution gives the House of Representatives “the sole Power of Impeachment” (Article I, Section 2) of federal officers and gives the Senate “the sole Power to try all Impeachments” (Article I, Section 3). In the constitutional procedure of impeachment and removal, the House serves in the role of a grand jury bringing charges against an officer suspected of “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors” (Article II, Section 4).

Since the House initiates this procedure, it also appoints impeachment managers to conduct the case against the officer in the Senate proceeding. From the early 20th century forward, the preferred method of selecting managers has been by a House Resolution naming the number and the persons of the committee of managers. In some instances, the House has, by resolution, fixed the number of managers and authorized the Speaker to appoint them. Managers also have been elected by ballot of the full House with a majority vote for each candidate.1

Contemporary practice has given the Judiciary Committee jurisdiction over possible impeachments. Recent impeachments have included articles of impeachment in the resolution sent to the Senate, and impeachment managers have tended to be from the Committee.
