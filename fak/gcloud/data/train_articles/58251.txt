It’s not just the Cabinet: Trump’s transition team may need to find about 4,100 appointees
When President Obama leaves office on Jan. 20, so will his appointees, which means President-elect Donald Trump can fill more than 4,000 vacancies by presidential appointment in his new administration.

Positions range from high-profile advisers and Cabinet posts to ambassadors, small agency directors and special assistants. Team Trump has already received more than 65,000 résumés from job seekers.

These are the positions listed in the Office of Personnel Management’s newly released Plum Book . Trump has said he will trim the bureaucracy, so some may not be filled. (The book actually lists about 9,000 jobs, but about 5,000 of those are nonpolitical and filled with civil servants who don’t usually leave when the president does.)

Appointees come in four categories as defined by OPM:

1,242 presidential appointees who need Senate approval: These are many of the bigwigs, including Cabinet secretaries, agency directors and ambassadors, who have to be formally confirmed by the Senate.

472 presidential appointees who don’t need Senate approval: Most White House staff fall in this category, including senior advisors such as the chief of staff and press secretary, along with heads of smaller agencies.

761 non-career Senior Executive Service positions: About 7,000 people fall under the Senior Executive Service banner, and they oversee nearly every government activity. About 10 percent are designated “non-career” and change with the incoming president.

1,538 Schedule C appointments: These folks report directly to presidential appointees but are not in senior leadership roles. For instance, the OPM press secretary who helped us with this graphic is a Schedule C appointee.

Here’s where those positions will need to be filled:
