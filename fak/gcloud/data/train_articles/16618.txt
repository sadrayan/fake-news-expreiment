Regarding your questions you need to check with USDOT/FMCSA regarding the program for allowing Mexican trucks to travel to the interior of the U.S.

All commercial trucks entering the U.S. from Mexico are subject to CBP inspection. CBP also receives advance cargo manifest information on all shipments arriving at ports of entry. Some shipment will receive expedited processing if they have successfully enrolled in the CBP FAST trusted trader program.

After leaving the federal facility at many locations trucks then enter a state DOT facility for processing. You would need to check with the individual states regarding the nature/frequency of those exams.

Do a lot of trucks from Mexico get through without inspection? Why or why not?

Thanks.

All arriving trucks are met and processed by a CBP officer. Some go gate to gate if they are FAST and there are no issues. Others face some form of physical or non-intrusive exams. All manifests are reviewed in advance. Please see links for more.
