HOW TO DEFEAT PLANNED PARENTHOODâ€™S FUNDING

Planned Parenthood receives millions of dollars in government funding annually. The amount escalates every year.

If we are to make a serious attempt to lessen Planned Parenthood’s influence on our communities or country, we must put a stop to the flow of government money into its coffers. You can be instrumental in achieving that goal in your community. Read The Plan and click on Government to learn how to do just that.
