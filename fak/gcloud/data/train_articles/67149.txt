When does the Electoral College vote?
Electoral college meetings kick off at 10 a.m. Eastern Time in Indiana, with the other 49 states and the District of Columbia following throughout the day.

Despite a furious push from liberals calling for the Electoral College to block Trump, electors are expected to follow the will of their states.

The long-shot hope of the so-called “Hamilton Electors” leading the push to dump Trump is that 37 Republican electors across the country buck Trump and deprive him of the 270 electoral vote majority.

But only one Republican — Texas’s Christopher Suprun — has publicly agreed to cast his vote for an alternative candidate. The rest of the would-be “faithless electors” are Democrats, and only publicly number as a small handful.

Suprun and the rest of the Texas electors will vote at 3 p.m. at the statehouse in Austin.

Colorado and Washington, two Democratic states home to five vocal “Hamilton Electors,” will vote at 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. Eastern Time respectively, according to 270toWin.com.

California, home to another Democratic "faithless elector," will vote at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.

Those rogue electors have pledged to vote for an alternative candidate who they view as a compromise. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been floated as their choice, but the former Republican presidential candidate has disavowed the push.

270toWin has a full breakdown of the times that each state’s electors will vote.
