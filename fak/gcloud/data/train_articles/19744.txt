Sinema for Arizona
Kyrsten knows how important it is to keep our promises to seniors. She understands that Medicare and Social Security aren’t line items in a budget for politicians to cut – they’re benefits Arizonans have earned through a lifetime of hard work. Kyrsten is committed to protecting benefits for current seniors and future generations, and she refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age.

Kyrsten is working to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in the system to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. She’s also protected seniors’ hard-earned savings from financial fraud by introducing bills like the Senior Safe Act, which was signed into law in 2018.

After a lifetime of hard work, Arizonans deserve to retire with dignity. Kyrsten is committed to making sure our seniors get the respect and security they deserve.
