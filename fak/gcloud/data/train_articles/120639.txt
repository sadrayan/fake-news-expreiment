Human trafficking and selling products to your door?
NIXA, Mo. -

Human trafficking and selling products straight to your door. That's what one company is being accused of and it has parents on edge. KSPR investigated and found out the company, Southwestern Advantage, is legitimate.

"I ended up buying, I think it was a pack of 10 to 12 books for my seven-year-old," says Sara Hall.



Hall says it was a young woman who sold her the books -- totaling $182.00. But that quickly changed.



"I went on Facebook. It said something about beware, this girl is coming door to door, asking your children's ages, school gender and it was something concerning human trafficking," says Hall.



The girl in the picture wasn't the saleswoman Hall came in contact with and the car wasn't what she drove, but what the picture warned sent hall into a panic.



"My kids play outside, they were outside when I was talking to the girl. That's why I called you guys to investigate."



Here's what we found out. Southwestern Advantage is a legitimate educational company out of Nashville. They hire college students who travel to small towns across the county every summer.



"We sit down with families, talk about education and we have a wide array of products that we sell," says Jessica Zeni.



Southwestern Advantage says the picture circulating on Facebook isn't true and the company is looking into legal action against it.



"We have our badges, kind of goes over who we are. We check in with local law enforcement and the county and city we sell so we have our permits and law enforcement knows what we are doing," says Zeni.



Hall says this experience will make her think twice what she sees or reads on social media.



"It was somebody just stirring up trouble or something kind of made me aware of what to look for and what to take with a grain of salt."



Southwestern Advantage is accredited by the Better Business Bureau.
