What is an alien inmate?

An alien inmate is one who does not have U.S. citizenship. Newly admitted inmates are referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE, formerly part of INS) agents who identify and investigate those who may be aliens.

What happens once alien inmates finish their prison sentences?

As with other inmates, alien inmates are released from prison when their sentences are completed. If ICE has notified the Department that they want to take an alien inmate into custody, the inmate is released only into ICE custody. Some alien inmates cannot be deported. However, the vast majority of alien inmates who complete their sentences in Florida prisons are released to ICE for further immigration processing, including possible deportation.

Under what circumstances would an alien inmate be deported?

Alien inmates are deported promptly after release from prison, if they have been ordered out of the country, have no further appeals of their final deportation order, and are from a country to which the United States can deport them. Other alien inmates are transferred to ICE for further deportation proceedings when their sentences expire, unless ICE refuses to receive and detain them (for example, in some cases when the alien is from a country to which they can not be deported).
