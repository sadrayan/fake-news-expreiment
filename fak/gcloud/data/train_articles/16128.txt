“Right now, here in Texas,” Obama said, “wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels.”

Well that may be true. And dog meat in China is cheaper than Kobi beef in NYC, but it isn't the same thing, is it? Nor is wind electricity the same thing as fossil fueled electricity. Wind energy has no real capacity which means it doesn't replace the need to built, maintain and operatre capacity resource plants like coal, natural gas and nuclear. But wind DOES force those plants to be utilized less annually and paid less for every MWh they are still able to produce.
