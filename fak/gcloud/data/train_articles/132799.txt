Bug Pictures: Velvet Ant, Cow Killer (Dasymutilla occidentalis) by DebinSC
in Robert, LA (rural property) - at my back door

Found exiting a nest (probably ground bees) in late August in Tennessee

These insects are wasps, not ants. Females are wingless and covered with dense hair, superficially resembling ants.

Running away from me in the lawn. July, coastal S.C.

Never seen these in my life. Then saw two in Cookeville TN -two days apart-one at my home the other my neighbors, two blocks away.Cool looking insect!

The female cow killer has been described as a hairy, antlike, wingless wasp. It is the largest species of velvet ant in North America. She has a painful bite but it not lethal.

Found on Aug. 20, 2011 in my back yard. Found Dave's Garden by searching what kind it was after posting a pic on FB.
