Ocasio-Cortez flubs FDR history, Constitution change
Mick Jagger to have a stent placed in his heart

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may be getting A’s in social media — but she’s getting an F in basic history.

The Bronx-Queens Democrat flunked 20th century world events last week when she claimed during a town-hall meting that the Constitution was changed to keep President Franklin D. Roosevelt from being re-elected. In fact, he died two years before the amendment to which she was referring was passed and six years before it was ratified by the requisite number of states.

“They had to amend the Constitution of the United States to make sure Roosevelt did not get re-elected,” she said during a MSNBC event Friday night , as she touted the positive effects of Roosevelt’s New Deal.

But the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms, was passed by a Republican-controlled Congress in March 1947 and ratified in February 1951. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, shortly after beginning his fourth term. He ran for an unprecedented third term in 1940 while World War II was raging in Europe.

Thus, while the amendment was a response to FDR holding the office for more than the traditional two terms, it could not have been intended to prevent his re-election.

“Croissants at La Guardia are going for SEVEN DOLLARS A PIECE,” she tweeted. “Yet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??”

After getting some pushback for that statement, she said, “It’s not an argument against the price of the croissant — it’s about the value of human worth.”
