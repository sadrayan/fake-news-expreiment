WASHINGTON – The White House announced that Michelle Obama is pregnant with the couple’s third child.

“Michelle Obama is pregnant,” White House sources said. White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, told WWN he would not confirm or deny the rumor. But WWN has confirmed that Michelle Obama is about two months into her pregnancy and the President and First Lady expect to have the baby sometime in late May, 2012.

There was a great deal of mystery about the whereabouts of the President and First Lady this summer. There were many rumors about where they might be (Martha’s Vineyard, Chicago, Kenya)- but now we know. The happy couple was spending quality time together in the White House, making a new baby.

The last time a baby was born in the White House was Patrick Bouvier Kennedy. He was born on August 7, 1963 and only lived two days. Patrick was the youngest child of President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy and brother to Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr.

The President and First Lady are “ecstatic” about the news of a new baby. Michelle Obama, 48, and Barack Obama, 50, waited almost seven years before having children. Their first daughter, Malia Ann Obama was born on July 4, 1999 and Natasha (often called “Sasha”)was born two years later on June 10, 2001.

It is too early to determine if the baby is a boy or a girl, but William Daley, the President’s Chief of Staff, reportedly said that the President is hoping they have a boy. “I’d love to see Barack Jr. in the White House some day,” he reportedly said.

President Obama is hoping the baby will spend it’s first four years of life in the White House. He has also created a Baby Czar to handle the preparations for the Baby Shower and Baby Party.
