Many Americans dream of starting a business and — despite recent economic downturns — they continue to pursue this dream more than ever.

In fact, the number of new business establishments in the U.S. has reached levels not seen since before the financial crisis. So, it seems now might be a great time to launch a company.

But, starting a business is a daunting pursuit, and doing it successfully means you need an idea of how well your state caters to new businesses and startups. In other words: You need to understand your state's business ecosystem.

"Ecosystem is a useful metaphor for evaluating areas of business," said Stewart Thornhill, executive director of the Zell Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Michigan. "For instance, it's hard to say any one factor makes a rain forest a rain forest. But if you take away one critical factor, it can undo the whole thing — in much the same way business systems work."
