One day after being called out for comments he made about Alicia Machado, Donald Trump appeared on Tuesday's Fox and Friends and said the former Miss Universe winner was "the absolute worst."

During Monday night's presidential debate, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton slammed Trump for his negative remarks about women, including Machado. "And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest," Clinton said. "He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman 'Miss Piggy.' Then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping,' because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name... her name is Alicia Machado."

Speaking Tuesday, Trump didn't mention Machado's name but did discuss the 1996 Miss Universe winner, who gained a purported 42 pounds after being crowned. "She was the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst," Trump, who was an owner of the pageant, said. "She was impossible. She was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner, who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe." © YouTube
