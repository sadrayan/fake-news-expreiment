Good morning. Can you share or point me to the latest information showing Texas high-school graduation rates? Historically, how has the Texas rate changed? If the rate is a record high, is that true at all high schools statewide?

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories. I am trying to complete this story today.

Thanks,

g.

The last class for which we have graduation rate data available online is the class of 2016. Statewide, the four-year longitudinal graduation rate was 89.1 percent, which is an all-time high.

You’ll find historic data for four-year longitudinal graduation rates in tables within the 2015-2016 Secondary School Completion and Dropouts in Texas Public Schools report. You’ll find these tables on page 75 (Table 22 – includes classes of 2012-2016), page 153 (Table C5 – includes classes of 1996-2005), and page 156 (Table C6 – includes classes 2006-2011). (Please note that, per the footnotes associated with Table C6, the definition of dropout changed in 2005-06 and was phased into rates over the course of the next three graduation classes, so rates from 2008-2009 to 2015-2016 are comparable to one another.)

It is unlikely that rates are at a record high for all high schools statewide. However, due to the fact that we have more than 1,500 high schools within the state of Texas and more than ten years of available data online, we aren’t able to answer with any more certainty on such short notice. We do have data available online for four-year longitudinal rates dating back to the class of 2002-2003 should you need it.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Lauren

Lauren:

I had a couple of questions to resolve before we finalize our story, which is due today.

How long has the state tracked statewide high school graduation rates? Is it impossible to say the latest rate is a record if rates haven’t always been tracked?

Thanks,

The state has calculated high school graduation rates since the class of 1996. Of all the years in which graduation rates have been calculated, the 89.1 percent graduation rate for the class of 2016 is an all-time high.

Thanks,

Lauren
