Former Congresswoman Gwen Graham has a net worth of $14.4 million, the vast majority of which is tied up in stock with her family business, The Graham Companies.

Graham, who filed her disclosure Friday, reported having $13.7 million in stock in The Graham Companies, which developed Miami Lakes and owns land in Miami-Dade County where the American Dream mega-mall is slated to be built, according to media reports.

The Graham Companies is not directly involved in the construction of the mall, though it is building a mixed use development on 300 acres just south of it, said Matt Harringer, spokesman for the Graham campaign.

The mall, which got the green light to move forward last month, has sparked criticism from some environmentalists. Beyond real estate, the Graham Companies has interest in dairy, beef and pecan orchard farming, according to the companyâ€™s website.

Graham reported earning $829,625 from The Graham Companies last year. Harringer said that after she became a congresswoman in early 2015, she stepped down from the company's board of directors and placed all her holdings and investments in a trust.

Her assets include her residence on Whitman Way, valued at $263,510, her accounts at SunTrust bank, which total $171,963, and mutual funds in the Florida Retirement System valued at $116,499. Her FRS investments stem from her days as labor counsel for Leon County Schools.

Graham also has another $63,725 in the federal retirement system. Also among her assets are rental property in Gainesville, valued at $89,300, and roughly $1,000 in stock in the Walt Disney Company.
