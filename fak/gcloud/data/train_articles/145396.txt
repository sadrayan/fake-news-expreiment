State Attorney General Takes Up The Cross Issue; ECU To Focus On Education, Students
East Central University President Katricia Pierson released the following statement in regard to the Oklahoma State Attorney General Mike Hunter’s office taking on the issue regarding the Kathryn P. Boswell Chapel:

“Religious liberty is an issue that is clearly bigger than just an ECU issue and one that requires legal expertise that can best be provided by the Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office. We welcome the attorney general’s involvement in this matter and offer our complete cooperation,” Pierson said.

"With that being said, moving forward, ECU wants to focus its time and energy on the university’s mission of providing a quality education to our students in order to make a difference in their lives and in the future of Oklahoma. While the legal experts review this issue, our emphasis will continue to be on our professors teaching and our students learning.”
