FACT CHECK: Is Rapper Meek Mill the Grandson of Martin Luther King, Jr.?
In August 2015, the web site NotAllowedTo.com published an article reporting that a DNA test had proved that rapper Meek Mill was the biological grandson of 1960’s civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr.:

Reports have surfaced revealing that rapper Meek Mill, whose real name is Robert Rahmeek Williams, is the biological grandson of the world’s most revered civil rights activists Martin Luther King Jr. This makes Meek Mill not only the heir to the proverbial rap game, but also next in line to become the next great leader of black America. Some are even speculating that with his lineage, Meek Mill could someday become the first rapper to become President of the United States, as long as Jay Z doesn’t get their first.

There is no truth to the above-quoted story.
