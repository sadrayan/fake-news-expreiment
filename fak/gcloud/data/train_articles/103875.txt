Chain Letters
Have you ever received a chain letter or e-mail message guaranteeing you’ll “earn big $$$$” with one small investment? All you have to do is send $10 to everyone on the list, place your name at the bottom of the list, and mail it to 10 friends. Then just sit back and watch the checks fill your mailbox.

Don’t waste your money. Chain letters don’t work. What’s more, if you mail chain letters, you could be committing a federal crime. The same law that prohibits lotteries applies to chain letters as well.

Look at the chart. You can see that more participants are required than there are people in the entire world! The first investor in the chain may receive some money, but later participants rarely get even their original investments back.
