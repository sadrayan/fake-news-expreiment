"After the Bailey Wringing Machine Co. sold their plane division to the Stanley Rule & Level Co. (January 26, 1880) it is believed that the remainder of the Defiance plane inventory was sold off and no additional planes completely matching the Defiance design were subsequently manufactured. Curiously, none of the Bailey Tool Company spokeshaves were included in the supplement, or updated edition, of the 1879 Stanley Rule & Level Catalog but Stanley did offer a variety of the Defiance planes in that updated catalog."

"The acceptance of Robert Wooding as the first professional English planemaker rests on the number of surviving planes that bear his name. The smaller number of Thomas Granford planes found to date are enough to qualify him as England's first, under the broader definition. And recently, several other English candidates have arisen based on a few planes and some historical data." (pg. 86).

This article contains important information about all the early New England and New York City rulemakers including William Belcher, Lemuel Hedge, William Rook and Lawrence Watts.

"By the early 1820s... William and Thomas Belcher, who had emigrated from Sheffield, were establishing in New York what was to become one of the larger American rulemaking firms of the period." (pg. 46).

"Undoubtedly the single most important influence on rulemaking in this country was American inventor Lemuel Hedge of Windsor, Vermont. ...Hedge patented his rule-graduating machine in 1827, beginning the machine stamping of wood rules in this country; the British did not use machines for marking rules until decades later." (pg. 46).

"By the late 1840s the Boston rule trade was beginning to diminish, and Gifford must have been aware of the growing success of the Connecticut firms of Stephens, Chapin, and the Middletown shops, as well as E.A. Stearns in Brattleboro, Vermont, and Belcher in New York. How could he hope to compete with them from the little coastal town of Westport? And yet, the Gifford factory appears to have been reasonably successful for a number of years." (pg. 48).

"The very fact that Mortimer Hedge had joined the army is an indication that the Westport rule business was extinct by 1862. The small Boston rule factories were mostly finished as well, while Stanley, Chapin, and Stephens in Connecticut were burgeoning. The era of the small rule shop had ended." (pg. 51).
