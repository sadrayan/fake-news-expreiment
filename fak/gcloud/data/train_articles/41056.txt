Campus sexual assault

Note: This page is a reproduction of the Hillary for America policy proposal on campus sexual assault.

An estimated one in five women reports being sexually assaulted while in college. Hillary Clinton will fight to bring an end to sexual assault on America’s campuses—because every student deserves a safe environment where they can learn and thrive, not live in fear.

Thanks to the efforts of advocates and survivors, we are seeing the beginnings of good work around the country. President Obama’s administration has worked hard to shine a light on campus sexual assault.

Hillary’s plan to end campus sexual assault is guided by three core principles:

Provide comprehensive support to survivors. Every campus should offer survivors the support they need—no matter their gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or race. Those services, from counseling to critical health care, should be confidential, comprehensive, and coordinated. Ensure a fair process for all. Too often, the process of addressing a sexual assault on campus is confusing and convoluted. Many who choose to report sexual assault in the criminal justice system fear that their voices will be dismissed instead of heard. We need a fair process for all involved, whether that’s in campus disciplinary proceedings or in the criminal justice system. All parties involved should have notice and transparency in campus disciplinary proceedings, and complaints filed in the criminal justice system must be treated seriously. Increasing prevention efforts. It’s not enough to address this problem by responding only once sexual assault occurs—we need to redouble our prevention efforts and start them earlier. We should increase sexual violence prevention education programs that cover issues like consent and bystander intervention and make sure we have programs not only in college but also in secondary school.

Hillary has led efforts to address violence against women her entire career:
