Study Says Drinking Wine At Night Might Help You Lose Weight
Just in case anybody needed an excuse to drink wine, here’s a good one: according to The Daily Mail, drinking wine could actually help you lose weight.

Citing scientific findings and conversations with multiple scientists and nutritionists, The Daily Mail presents a pretty good case for their cause.

A Harvard University study that reportedly took place over 13 years and included 20,000 women (and a whole lot of vino) concluded that those who drank half a bottle of wine a day had a 70% reduced risk of obesity. In addition, they cite another study that was presented at the European Conference on Obesity in Prague earlier this month that suggests people who drink a glass of red wine every night have higher levels of the “good” cholesterol HDL, which, among other things, lowers the risk for heart disease, and could help improve type 2 diabetes.

Red wine, valued more for its antioxidants, also includes resveratrol (found in grape skins). Resveratrol is useful for its ability to break down and process fats.

We’ll report back after we’ve had a glass — this study could use some, um, investigating.
