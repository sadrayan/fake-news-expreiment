Barrow Statement on Health Care Legislation Before Congress
Washington, D.C. - Congressman John Barrow released the following statement today in advance of this weekend’s planned vote on health care legislation:

“I am strongly in favor of reforming the health care system, but I don’t think this bill is going to do it, and therefore I can’t support it. It puts too much of the burden of paying for it on working folks who are already being overcharged, and that’s not fair. It threatens to overwhelm Medicaid in Georgia, and that's not right. And it barely touches the insurance companies, and that's not smart. We can do better and I’m ready to start.”
