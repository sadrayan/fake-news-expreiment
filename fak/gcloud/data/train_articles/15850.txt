Following is an ICE website showing ICE removed 368,644 people in fiscal year 2013. Of these, 216,810 (59%) had been previously convicted of a crime.

Itâ€™s inappropriate to compare Border Patrol apprehension statistics and ICE deportation statistics to come up with an accurate statistic on criminal aliens apprehended.

Contact Customs and Border Protection to see if it has available stats.
