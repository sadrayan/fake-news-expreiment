Beto O’Rourke Wants To Increase Texans’ Gas Taxes - Ted Cruz for Senate
Cruz Campaign Purchases Billboard Ads Highlighting O’Rourke’s Support for Increased Gas Taxes

HOUSTON, Texas – The Ted Cruz for Senate campaign today released billboard ads that are posted in Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas highlighting Beto O’Rourke’s support for increasing gas taxes.

The billboard graphic may be viewed here.

In 2016, O’Rourke voted against a resolution that would have opposed President Obama’s proposed $10-per-barrel tax on oil. It also expressed the sense of Congress that in the future, lawmakers should review the potential damages that new taxes would have on industries that have been subject to job, revenue, and production cuts.

The resolution stated:

Whereas this tax could translate into as much as an additional 25 cents on a gallon of gas, when the Federal tax on gasoline is currently 18.40 cents per gallon; It is the sense of Congress that— (1) a new tax should not be placed on oil, and (2) in considering future policy, Congress should carefully review the detrimental impacts of placing any new taxes on any industry that has seen a slash in jobs, revenue, and production.

Beto O’Rourke has a troubling record of voting against Texas energy interests, including:

Voted to increase regulations on fracking and ban certain exports of natural gas;

Voted against Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) exports;

Voted in favor of a Carbon Tax;

Voted against the Keystone XL pipeline.

The San Antonio, Austin, Houston, and Dallas billboards include the following text:

“Beto O’Rourke Wants You to Pay 24 More Cents Per Gallon of Gas”
