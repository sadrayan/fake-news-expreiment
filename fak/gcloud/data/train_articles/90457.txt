THE MAJOR PARTIES

United Russia (Edinaya Rossiya ). Party list headed by President Putin during the 2007 election campaign, and endorsed by him in 2003. The party was created in December 2001 by the merger of Unity (Edinstvo), founded by government leaders in October 1999, with Fatherland-All Russia (Otechestvo-Vsya Rossiya, OVR), a rival in the 1999 elections. United Russia is formally led by Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov. Sergei Shoigu, minister for emergency situations and civil defence, Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov and Tatarstan president Mintimer Shaimiev, former OVR leaders, are co-chairs.

Communist Party, KPRF (Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Rossiiskoi Federatsii). Founded 1993. Leader: Gennady Zyuganov. Successor to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Won the most seats in the 1995 and 1999 Duma elections. .

Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, LDPR (Liberalno-Demokraticheskaya Partiya Rossiskoi Federatsii). Founded 1990. Led by maverick nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.

Fair Russia. (Spravedivya Rossiya). Formed 2006 by the merger of Motherland People's Patriotic Union (Rodina Narodno-patriotichesky soyuz) with the Party of Pensioners and the Party of Life. Fair Russia is led by the Speaker of the Federation Council Sergei Mironov. Motherland had its origins in late August 2003 when more than 30 organizations came together under the leadership of academician Sergei Glazyev and journalist Dmitry Rogozin. Glazyev and Rogozin quarrelled over whether to contest the 2004 presidential election. Subsequently the Duma fraction split into two groups, the People's Patriotic Union giving rise to Fair Russia, and the People's Will faction, which did not contest the 2007 election.

Two liberal parties which formed separate blocs in previous Duma elections failed to clear the 7.0% barrier in 2007, just as they failed to clear to 5.0% barrier in 2003. They remain extra-parliamentary parties:
