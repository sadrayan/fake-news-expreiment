Everything on Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate Vote and the Fallout
Updated Oct. 6

The divisive fight in the Senate over President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, reached an end Saturday afternoon, with senators voting 50 to 48 to elevate the judge to the nation’s highest court despite the allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against him.

Judge Kavanaugh was sworn in during a private ceremony Saturday evening.

The confirmation has dominated headlines for weeks, mirroring a country gripped by partisan distrust, inspiring fervent protests among liberals, eliciting angry pushback from conservatives and encouraging women to share personal stories of rape, assault and harassment.

Here’s a guide to coverage of the confirmation from The New York Times.

The Senate vote

The vote, which was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, broke almost entirely along party lines. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the only Republican opposed to Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation, voted present instead of no to accommodate a colleague who could not attend and would have voted yes. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia was the only Democrat to vote to confirm. (See how each senator voted with our vote tally.)

The final result was expected; by Friday afternoon, two key undecided senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Mr. Manchin, had announced that they would vote for Judge Kavanaugh, ensuring his confirmation. Their remarks came after the Senate voted narrowly to limit debate on his nomination and to push to a final vote on Saturday.
