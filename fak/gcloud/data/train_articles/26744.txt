Labor force participation rates
Labor Force Participation

Fact Sheet Prototype

Basic concepts

The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the population that is either employed or unemployed (that is, either working or actively seeking work)

People with jobs are employed.

People who are jobless, looking for a job, and available for work are unemployed.

The labor force is made up of the employed and the unemployed.

People who are neither employed nor unemployed are not in the labor force.

Resources for further exploration

The data in the table above are from the Current Population Survey (CPS), which has much more information on the labor force status of the population at the national level . See http://www.bls.gov/cps/#data and http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsflowstab.htm for a variety of tools to access CPS data.

Information on the labor force status of the population at the division and state level can be found here: http://www.bls.gov/lau/lalfprderr.xlsx ). Additional subnational information can be found in the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program. See http://www.bls.gov/lau/#data for tools to access LAUS data.

Other BLS data sets that can be analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of labor force participation include the National Longitudinal Surveys and the American Time Use Survey.
