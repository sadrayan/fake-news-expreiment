Organic, Citizen-Led Disaster Relief
What is Cajun Relief?

The Cajun Relief Foundation is a 501c3 organic and innovative citizen-led non-profit charity. Our mission is to create a new model for engagement everywhere, driven by good citizens using technology. Our motto is “When you’re hungry, there is no waste.” We are learning by scaling fast, adjusting on the fly, meeting specific needs and eliminating waste.

We might be Cajun but we are not just a Louisiana organization. We performed rescues and are rebuilding homes in SE Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. We have been in Florida since two days before hurricane Irma struck and we currently remain engaged in south Florida and the Florida Keys. Cajun Relief continues to provide rebuild, supply, media coverage, ground and logistical support in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.

Our journey began after disasterous flooding ravaged Louisiana in 2016 and ever since then we’ve been helping our fellow citizens find innovative ways to bring relief to those who need it. Anywhere there are people that are hungry or in need, good citizens are hungry to help them and Cajun Relief Foundation wants to bring them together. Learn more here.
