Florida’s high school graduation rate among lowest
MIAMI — Florida’s high school graduation rate is among the lowest in the nation.

A report released Monday at the Building a GradNation Summit in Washington found Florida’s 75 percent graduation rate is about five percentage points lower than the nationwide average.

Across the U.S., about 80 percent of high school students graduate, a new milestone.

The report was based on U.S. Department of Education statistics from 2012. Researchers say the nationwide progress means the national graduation rate could reach 90 percent by 2020.

Florida is tied with four others states for having the fifth lowest graduation rate. Six other states have graduation rates that are even lower.

While toward the bottom of the chart, Florida has been making progress. About 60 percent of students graduated in 2006, 15 points lower.
