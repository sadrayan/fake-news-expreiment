Archived Consumer Price Index Detailed Report Information

IMPORTANT The CPI Detailed Report will cease publication after June 2017. The June 2017 version of the report, which will be published in July 2017, will be the final publication of this document. Customers are encouraged to obtain CPI data from the CPI databases or the Supplemental Files.

Effective with May 2007 CPI data, the full version of the monthly CPI Detailed Report has been made available to the public in PDF format. From October 2000 through April 2007, only the tables of this publication were provided as PDF files. Note that, each month on the day of release, a PDF file containing only the tables will initially be posted on the BLS website; the full version of the Detailed Report, including any articles, will be posted shortly afterwards.

Caution: data in archived CPI Detailed Reports may have been revised in subsequent editions. In particular, seasonally adjusted indexes and percent changes are revised with the release of January data each year for the preceding five years.
