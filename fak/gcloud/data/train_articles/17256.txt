Comparative Cost Per Member
Comparable Cost Measures

Cost can differ from one district to another and from one year to another. There may be several reasons for this variance such as educational programming, pupil transportation requirements, increases or decreases in debt service expenditures or having food and community service operations. Reliance on a single cost determination, which may not be representative for all school districts, can lead to erroneous conclusions. The following "comparable" cost measures were developed to limit or identify the effects of various factors that contribute to cost variances.

Total Current Educational Cost (TCEC)

This measure attempts to identify overall instructional and instructional support service costs attributable to district resident students. It can generally be described as the cost of the district's General and Special Project funds, excluding transportation and facility acquisition expenditures, less interfund transfers and revenues for instructional services the district provides to nonresident pupils such as tuition receipts, CESA and cooperative agreements and state interdistrict integration aid.

Total Education Cost (TEC)

This is the TCEC plus transportation, expenditures for facility acquisitions charged to the General, Special Project and Capital Expansion (Tax Levy Financed "Sinking") funds and debt service principal and interest.

Total District Cost (TDC)

This is TEC plus food and community service costs. It should be noted that food and community service activities are funded with a combination of fees, other program revenue, and property taxes.
