How to Use WEN速 Cleansing Conditioner & Products
Wen速 Cleansing Conditioner

CLEANSING YOUR HAIR IN 3 EASY STEPS:

Step 1: Rinse hair thoroughly. Apply WEN 速 into your palms and rub together. Use 10-16 pumps for short hair, 16-24 for medium length hair and 24-32 pumps for long hair. If your hair is longer/thicker you may need to increase the amount of pumps.





Step 2: Apply to scalp and hair, adding a splash of water to evenly distribute. WEN 速 has no harsh sulfates like sodium lauryl sulfate, so it won't lather. Massage thoroughly into hair and leave on for the remainder of your shower.





Step 3: Rinse thoroughly and completely, massaging scalp and running fingers through to the ends.





ADDITIONAL USAGE TIPS:

After you have finished rinsing, while your hair is still soaking wet, apply a small amount of the Cleansing Conditioner to the ends of your hair as a leave-in conditioner.

For best results, we highly suggest you cleanse, rinse and repeat, using half the recommended pumps for the first cleanse, and the remaining half for the second cleanse.
