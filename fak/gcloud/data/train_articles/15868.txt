Thank you for your inquiry. To my knowledge there were no claims of fraud made by Mr. Trump's campaign. In fact, we enjoyed working with Mr. Trump's campaign and the other Presidential campaigns for our caucus. Our process was fair, secure and each campaign had access to exactly the same information and opportunities.

Individual people may have voiced complaints from one side or another, but none of the Presidential campaigns raised concerns over fraud. In fact, I believe each of the campaigns praised our team's work and process in written or verbal form in the days following the caucus.

I hope this answers your questions for Maine!

Sincerely,

Jason Savage

Executive Director

Good afternoon.

For a fact check, I write to ask if the agency is aware of any allegations by Donald Trump or Trump supporters of Ted Cruz committing fraud in any way in connection with the Maine presidential caucuses. Also, are there other voter fraud allegations pertaining to the Republican caucuses?

We are checking this claim by Frank Luntz: “Team Trump has accused Ted Cruz of fraud” in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin.

I hope to complete our review midday Thursday. I would be happy to hear back by email or phone for our story.

THANKS.
