Thanks for reaching out about my statement about the hottest years on record.

This one is pretty straightforward. I'm citing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:

Sure: first, global temperatures are more relevant to the total impacts we will face than state or even continental numbers. For example, focusing on the Texas-only data actually obscures rather than illuminates if you are trying to help Texans gauge the risk. Two of the big dangers to us are sea level rise and Gulf hurricanes. Those risks are going to be driven by polar region warming (ice melt) and ocean surface temperatures (thermal expansion of ocean water and hurricane-fueling hot ocean surfaces) vs. average land temps in Texas. Flooding in Central Texas would also be affected by ocean temps and the regional weather dynamics they set up.

In short: the fact that we may not set a record in a given year here in Texas won't protect us from the impacts of a record-setting year globally, so the global temps should get our attention.
