Lopez erroneously says she's lifelong Toledoan
The first half of the first sentence on the "Welcome" page of Anita Lopez's mayoral campaign Web site is not a true statement:

I’ve lived in Toledo my whole life and am proud to call it home. But over the past several years I’ve seen this city I love fall behind other Ohio cities, and some of our City leaders have lost touch with the citizens. - See more at: http://www.anitalopezformayor.com/index.php/homepage#sthash.YXtbT23E.dpuf

"I've lived in Toledo my whole life and I'm proud to call it home."

I'll take her word for it on the second half.

The first half is disproved by records in the Lucas County Board of Elections which show that Ms. Lopez lived in Springfield Township from 2005 to 2009. At that time she was married to Roman Arce.

She changed her registration from 1603 Glenbrook Dr., Toledo, to 6847 Morningdew Blvd., Maumee, on Nov. 8, 2005.

Four years later, on July 29, 2009, she changed back from Maumee (in Springfield Township) to her current address, 2009 Belvedere Dr., in South Toledo.

Ms Lopez doesn't dispute these facts:

"I lived in Springfield Township four years. It should be 'the majority of my life since 1969.' Thirty-eight years I have lived in Toledo. It was an oversight. I was born here, educated here. There is no intent to misrepresent. I am a lifelong Toledoan. I am 42 and 38 years I have lived in Toledo."

The second sentence in Lopez's Web page welcome is "But over the past several years I've seen this city I love fall behind other Ohio cities, and some of our City leaders have lost touch with the citizens."

I wonder what Lopez means by "fall behind other Ohio cities." I wonder what her metric is: population? property values? school district performance? city tax revenue? crime? unemployment? Will she be able to substantiate that claim better than the one about where she lived all her life?

Those are the kinds of issues that will matter in the election for mayor this year.
