Bomb Discovered At Bill and Hillary Clinton’s Home – Potential Bomb Found Addressed to Barack Obama
A bomb has been discovered at the New York City suburban home of Bill and Hillary Clinton.

The New York Times reports that the bomb was discovered near the couple’s home on Wednesday morning.

Federal and local investigators are investigating the explosive device which was discovered in Chappaqua, New York, the main residence of Bill and Hillary.

Investigators with the FBI, Secret Service, and New Castle police department discovered the package around 1 a.m. Wednesday and the investigations are ongoing.

The bomb at Bill and Hillary Clinton’s home was discovered just two days after billionaire George Soros came under a similar attack when an explosive device was discovered in his mail.

NY1 Investigative Reporter Myles Miller sent out a tweet that described the device as an IED (improvised explosive device).
