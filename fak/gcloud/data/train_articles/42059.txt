The New Seminole Compact - Jobs for Florida
For centuries, the Seminole Tribe has been a part of Florida history. Today they are an important part of Florida’s future with the Seminole Compact. The Compact has already delivered on its promise of creating jobs and has provided over $1 billion in revenues to the State of Florida. The new Seminole Compact represents a partnership that works between the sovereign nation of the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the people of Florida. The Compact allows the Seminole Tribe to be self-sustaining and provide revenue for the welfare, education and development of its members. Further, the dollars the Tribe earns from its gambling operations stay in Florida and are spent here.

Now we have a new compact agreement that guarantees more revenue and creates more jobs in Florida. Let’s keep the compact going. It’s a good deal for Florida.
