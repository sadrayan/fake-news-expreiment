Liberty Island | island, New York, United States
Liberty Island, formerly (until 1956) Bedloe’s Island, island, off the southern tip of Manhattan Island, New York, New York, U.S., in Upper New York Bay. It has an area of about 12 acres (5 hectares) and is the site of French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi’s “Liberty Enlightening the World” (the Statue of Liberty). The island and nearby Ellis Island constitute Statue of Liberty National Monument. Although the monument is within New Jersey waters, Liberty Island and a portion of Ellis Island are within the territorial jurisdiction of New York state.

Known to the Delaware Indians as Minnissais (“Lesser Island”) and to early colonists as Great Oyster, the island was renamed for Isaac Bedloe (or Isaack Bedloo), a merchant who bought it in the 1660s. The city of New York acquired the island in 1758, and it was ceded to the state of New York in 1796 and to the federal government in 1800. Fort Wood was built there for the War of 1812, and the statue was erected within the fort in 1885–86. The statue was declared a national monument in 1924; in 1933 the National Park Service gained jurisdiction over the monument, acquiring the entire island when Fort Wood was decommissioned in 1937.
