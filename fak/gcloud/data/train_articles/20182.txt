U.S. Rep. McSally’s Statement on the Passage of the American Health Care Act
WASHINGTON, D.C.— U.S. Representative Martha McSally (AZ-02) today released the following statement upon passage of the American Health Care Act (AHCA):

“Today I had a binary decision: to support the ACA or to begin moving towards an improved system that works. I voted yes to the AHCA in order to start that process.

“This is not a perfect bill, but it is better than a failed system. As this legislation has taken shape, I have tirelessly advocated for my constituents. I have voiced concerns, identified constructive improvements, prevented destructive additions, and ultimately secured victories for the vulnerable in our communities totaling $165 billion. I authored a measure preventing members of Congress from exempting themselves or their staff from the AHCA. Lawmakers are not above the law.

“I will continue to work with state and local stakeholders and closely monitor this bill throughout the legislative and implementation process to ensure that my constituents have access to the care they need, that the most vulnerable are protected, and that Southern Arizona is better off in the future.”

Rep. McSally successfully negotiated to include $60 billion in Medicaid for the elderly and disabled, $90 billion for tax credits for individuals aged 50 to 64, and $15 billion for expecting and new mothers, newborns, those who struggle with mental illness and those who wrestle with substance abuse.

Rep. McSally has also worked to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions, including cosponsoring the Upton Amendment which provides an additional $8 billion to allow people with pre-existing conditions who have not maintained continuous coverage to acquire affordable care.

H.R. 2192, her bill to strike exemptions for members of Congress and their staff in the AHCA, passed out of the House today.
