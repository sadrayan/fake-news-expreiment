3. Overview of crime

Figure 1: Crime estimated by the survey has fallen considerably from the peak levels seen in 1995, but crime dealt with by the police has begun to rise in recent years England and Wales, year ending December 1981 to year ending June 2017 Source: Crime Survey for England and Wales, Office for National Statistics and Police recorded crime, Home Office Notes: Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics. Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) data on this chart refer to different time periods: a) 1981 to 1999 refer to crimes experienced in the calendar year (January to December) b) from year ending March 2002 onwards the estimates relate to crimes experienced in the 12 months before interview, based on interviews carried out in that financial year (April to March). From the year ending March 2012 onwards, police recorded crime data have included offences from additional sources of fraud data. CSEW data relate to adults aged 16 and over or to households. Some forces have revised their data and police recorded crime totals may not agree with those previously published. CSEW data on fraud and computer misuse are published as Experimental Statistics, which are in the testing phase and not yet fully developed. They are published to involve users and stakeholders in their development, and as a means to build in quality at an early stage. New victimisation questions on fraud and computer misuse were incorporated into the CSEW from October 2015. The questions are currently asked of half the survey sample to test for detrimental effects on the survey as a whole and help ensure that the historical time series is protected.

Crime trends over time

Crime, by its nature, is inherently difficult to measure in its entirety and neither of the two main sources provides a complete picture. The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides a consistent measure over time of a broad set of crimes experienced by the population resident in households. It shows the likelihood of being a victim of CSEW crime has fallen considerably over time; around 14 in 100 adults were victims in the latest survey year compared with around 24 in 100 adults a decade ago (in the survey year ending March 2007) and around 40 in 100 adults in 1995 (the peak survey year).

The latest CSEW estimate is 5.8 million incidents of crime in the year ending June 2017, a 9% reduction compared with the previous year. However, these headline estimates do not yet include fraud and computer misuse offences as these have not been included in the survey for the full two years needed to make annual comparisons. Including fraud and computer misuse, there were an estimated 10.8 million incidents of crime in the year ending June 2017.

The main strength of the CSEW is that it provides a good measure of long-term trends for a selected range of crimes, including those not reported to the police. However, it is less able to provide a good indication of changes in low volume crimes or emerging trends. This is in part due to the time lag arising from the 12-month recall period1, the fact that CSEW sample sizes for individual crime types are relatively small and the natural variability in estimates arising from any sample survey.

The police recorded crime series covers a wider range of offences than the CSEW but is restricted to those crimes that have been reported to and recorded by the police. From the 1980s until the late 1990s, trends in police recorded crime broadly followed those shown by the CSEW, but changes to recording rules and processes resulted in rises between 1998 and 2004 that did not reflect changes in crime as estimated by the CSEW. The two sources then both showed a downward trend until the early 2010s, when a renewed focus on improving crime recording resulted in further increases in the police series each year. The size of year-on-year increases has grown, with police recorded crime increasing by 5% in the year ending June 2015, by 7% in the year ending June 2016, and by 13% in the latest year.

This increase reflects a range of factors which vary for different individual crime types and which is explained in the other sections of the bulletin. The factors can include continuing improvements to recording processes and practices, more victims reporting crime, or genuine increases in crime. Information on why the two data sources are showing differing trends was previously published in the methodological note, Why do the two data sources show differing trends? and more information is available in the User Guide to Crime Statistics for England and Wales.

Changes in specific types of crime

Overall, in the year to June 2017, the number of offences recorded by the police in the majority of crime categories has increased, while CSEW estimates have either fallen or shown no statistically significant difference.

The police recorded 583,782 more offences in the year ending June 2017 than in the previous year. All main categories of police recorded crime increased. This section provides a brief overview of recent trends in selected main crime types where the number of offences recorded by the police has been increasing.

More detailed analysis by crime type is provided in sections 5 to 10 of this bulletin.

Violence

Figure 2: The volume of violent crime being dealt with by the police has increased over the last few years England and Wales, year ending March 2003 to year ending June 2017 Source: Police recorded crime, Home Office Notes: Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics. Download this chart Image .csv .xls

Continuing the trend seen in recent years, the volume of violence against the person offences being dealt with by the police increased in the year ending June 2017; up by 19% compared with the previous year (from 1,033,719 to 1,229,260). This was driven largely by increases in the subcategories of “violence without injury” (21%) and “stalking and harassment” (36%) as well as a smaller increase in “violence with injury” (10%). Most of this volume increase was thought to result from improved recording practices but it is likely that rises in the most serious categories reflect genuine rises in violent crime. These lower volume but serious offences are thought to be generally well-recorded by the police.

The CSEW estimated that there were 1.2 million incidents of violence experienced by adults aged 16 and over in the latest survey year ending June 2017; no change from the previous survey year (the apparent 4% decrease was not statistically significant). Part of the explanation for the differing trend lies in the different crime mix between the survey and recorded crime series. The survey estimates tend to be dominated by higher volume but less serious violent crime whereas the police series tends to be skewed more towards the higher-harm types of violent crimes that come to their attention.

Police recorded crime figures cover a wider range of offences than the CSEW, including homicide, death by dangerous driving, threats, stalking and harassment, while the CSEW includes offences not reported to the police. Around 20% of the rise in police recorded violence against the person in the last year is in categories not covered by the CSEW.

Knife crime

Figure 3: Selected offences involving a knife or sharp instrument have increased again in the last year following previous reductions England and Wales, year ending March 2011 to year ending June 2017 Source: Police recorded crime, Home Office Notes: Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics. Download this chart Image .csv .xls

Some categories of police recorded crime relating to more serious violent and sexual offences can be broken down further by whether or not a knife or sharp instrument was involved. This information is collected separately by the Home Office from police forces and comparable data is only available from the year ending March 2011 onwards. As offences involving the use of weapons are relatively low in volume, the CSEW is not able to provide reliable trends for such incidents.

The police recorded 36,998 of these offences that involved a knife or sharp instrument in the latest year ending June 2017, a 26% increase compared with the previous year (29,476) and the highest figure recorded since the year ending March 2011. This continues the increasing trend in knife crime offences seen in recent years, but follows a period when knife crime offences were declining in the early 2010s.

The police force area that showed the largest volume increase was the Metropolitan Police, which accounted for 47% of the increase across England and Wales. While some of the rise in offences involving knives may reflect improvements in recording practices, it is thought that the main driver has been a genuine rise in knife crime in areas such as London, as this is reflected by other data sources. It is also possible that more targeted police action to tackle knife crime may have led to more offences coming to the attention of the police than might otherwise have done so.

Sexual offences

Figure 4: Police recorded sexual offences have been rising since inspections in 2014 highlighted significant under-recording England and Wales, year ending March 2003 to year ending June 2017 Source: Police recorded crime, Home Office Notes: Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, introduced in May 2004, altered the definition and coverage of sexual offences. Download this chart Image .csv .xls

There was an increase of 19% in the number of sexual offences recorded by the police in the latest year ending June 2017 compared with the previous year (up to 129,700). This is likely to have resulted from both more victims reporting offences to the police and improved recording by police forces in response to ongoing inspections by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) carried out since 2014. The national inspection in 2014 identified significant under-recording of these offences by police forces.

This latest rise is larger than that recorded for the previous year (14%) and reflects an increase in the number of sexual offences being recorded by the police in recent months. This marks a change from the recent trend, which had indicated that the rise in sexual offences had been slowing down compared with the rate of increases recorded in 2014 and 2015.

Latest estimates from the CSEW self-completion module2 for the survey year ending March 2017 showed that 2.0% of adults aged 16 to 59 years had been victims of sexual assaults in the last year (including attempted offences). There was no significant change from the previous year’s estimate (2.0%) but it forms part of the underlying downward trend seen since the survey year ending March 2009.

Theft

Figure 5: Following a long-term decline, police recorded theft has increased England and Wales, year ending December 1981 to year ending June 2017 Source: Crime Survey for England and Wales, Office for National Statistics and Police recorded crime, Home Office Notes: Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics. Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) data on this chart refer to different time periods: a) 1981 to 1999 refer to crimes experienced in the calendar year (January to December) b) from year ending March 2002 onwards the estimates relate to crimes experienced in the 12 months before interview, based on interviews carried out in that financial year (April to March).

Since the mid-1990s, both the CSEW and police recorded crime have shown long-term reductions in most categories of theft. However, police recorded theft increased by 11% in the year ending June 2017 compared with the previous year and continues the recent upward rise seen in the last two years. This includes rises in all main categories of theft, including burglary (6%), vehicle-related theft offences (17%), theft from the person (11%) and shoplifting (11%); of which the latter is not covered by the CSEW.

CSEW estimates have shown a significant reduction in theft offences of 11% in the last year, in line with the long-term trend. However, while the CSEW provides a robust measure of long-term trends, it is less useful at providing an indication of emerging trends. It is thought that some sub-categories of theft such as burglary and vehicle theft are well-recorded by police. Therefore in these categories the increases are likely to reflect a genuine rise in these types of crime. The picture is less clear for other types of theft offences, which may be more prone to changes in recording practices.

Fraud

Figure 6: Fraud offences reported to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) have been increasing since comparable records started in 2012 England and Wales, year ending March 2012 to year ending June 2017 Source: Action Fraud, National Fraud Intelligence Bureau Notes: Fraud data are not designated as National Statistics. Download this chart Image .csv .xls

There have been significant changes to the arrangements for the recording and investigating of fraud by the police between 2011 and 2013. Action Fraud took over responsibility from territorial forces for such recording and new feeds from industry associations to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) came on stream. Such changes make it difficult to compare levels of recorded fraud over the longer-term.

The latest comparable figures show that fraud offences collated by the NFIB from Action Fraud, Cifas and UK Finance3 indicated that there was a 4% increase in the number of fraud offences recorded in England and Wales (up to 653,468 offences4) in the year ending June 2017 compared with the previous year. This follows similar rises in each of the last five years.

Experimental Statistics from the CSEW estimated that there were 3.3 million incidents of fraud in the survey year ending June 2017, with over half of these (57%; 1.9 million incidents) being cyber-related. The main difference between CSEW and NFIB fraud data arises from the fact that most fraud offences do not come to the attention of the police. As a result, police recorded crime data give a very partial picture of the extent of fraud, while CSEW estimates provide a more complete picture of the threat.

The first estimates of trends in fraud from the CSEW will be published in January 2018.
