In the bizarre snap, Arnold takes a “snooze” in a sleeping bag purposely posed underneath a bronze statue of himself. The bust in question was first erected in 2014 and depicts the athlete at the height of his body building career.

The father captioned the silly pic:

“How times have changed.”

Ha! Looks like an understatement, Arnold!

While we see what the former governor of California was going for, we also see how this photo might be offensive to some people. It’s sorta seems like A.S. is making an allusion to the homeless community.

In fact, one commenter asked:

“Are you homeless?”

Kind of ironic since Los Angeles’ homelessness situation has been declared a state of emergency!

Still, it’s nice to see the actor is able to poke fun at himself.

What do YOU think of the pic?
