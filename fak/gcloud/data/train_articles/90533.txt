NRA fail: More than 2,000 people on terror watch list have legally purchased guns in the last 10 years
The federal government currently has no authority to block firearm sales to international or domestic terror suspects but according to the gun control group Everytown USA, nearly all terrorism-related incidents in the U.S. have involved guns.

The Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, a bipartisan bill cosponsored by California Senator Dianne Feinstein and New York Rep. Peter King, looks to be a nonstarter in Congress as a majority of Republicans oppose the law originally proposed by the Bush administration in 2007.

“The National Rifle Association is strongly opposed to it and the fact is we have only a handful of Republican co-sponsors," King told the New York Daily News on Tuesday. “I think that right now it’d be tough to get through,” Kind said in the aftermath of Friday's terror attacks. "It’s not going to move right now ... [there’s] just too much opposition.”

In 2011, American-born senior al Qaeda operative, Adam Gadahn, released a video message rallying Muslims in the West to fight with everything at their disposal.
