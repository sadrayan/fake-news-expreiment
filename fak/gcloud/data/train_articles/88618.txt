Hillary Clinton: ‘Fees have been donated’
Hillary Clinton on Friday said that she has donated all the money she has earned from her public speaking appearances at colleges and universities in the past year and a half to the Clinton Foundation.

“All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work,” she told ABC News. “So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation.” The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is a nonprofit focusing on global issues that was founded by former President Bill Clinton in 2001.

The former secretary of State reportedly charges about $200,000 for a speaking engagement, though recent reports suggest that she may have charged more from some universities. The Wall Street Journal reported that she was paid $300,000 for her appearance at UCLA in March.

The revelations about her speaking fees have sparked some outrage, particularly on the right. Students at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas are threatening to demonstrate against Clinton’s upcoming appearance at the school in October unless she returns the $225,000 the school is paying for her speech.

Last month, when responding to a question from Diane Sawyer about her speaking fees, Clinton said that she and Bill Clinton were “dead broke” after his presidency ended in 2000. She has backtracked from the “dead broke” comment, saying that it was “inartful.”

Clinton also told The Guardian, in a discussion about income inequality, that U.S. voters “don’t see me as part of the problem because we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names.”
