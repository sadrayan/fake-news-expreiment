odessa ukraine "chernobyl heart" surgery mission completed . . . 15 young lives saved (Chernobyl Children's Project International)
Two weeks ago a volunteer surgical team completed our second successful children's cardiac surgery mission to Ukraine, this time to Odessa. Fifteen young lives were saved. You can see some of the young patients in the Odessa Cardiac Kids photo gallery. Our first Ukrainian trip, to Kharkiv, was completed in June.

Chernobyl Children's Project International will sponsor two more surgical trips to Ukraine this year investing over $300,000 for surgeries and training of local physicians in 2008. The next teams will travel to Donetsk and Kyiv. Your support is very much needed -- you can Donate Now or follow this link for our postal address.

Every year in Ukraine, 6,000 children are born with heart defects that will kill them in 3 to 5 years without surgery. Few cardiac surgery programs in Ukraine perform surgery on children, and none routinely operate on the smallest or those with the most complicated defects. Thank you for the support that has made continuing this program possible!
