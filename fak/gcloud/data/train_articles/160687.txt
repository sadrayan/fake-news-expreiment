Where to watch 4th of July fireworks in Chicago
When it comes to 4th of July fireworks, Chicago has no shortage of unsanctioned displays. From a rooftop bar, you can get a nonstop show—particularly, we've found, if the building is in Pilsen or Humboldt Park. The downside: You might get a bottle rocket in the eye. Lower-risk fun can be had at scores of authorized fireworks displays—Navy Pier will host a display on the fourth. Nearby suburbs, though, offer lots of bang for your travel buck. Whether you want to hang out in your nieghborhood or take a weekend getaway, here are the displays worth checking out.
