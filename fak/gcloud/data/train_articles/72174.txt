TRUMP UNLOADS: Hillary Clinton was 'the worst' and is 'extremely bad'
Donald Trump. AP/Charlie Neibergall Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shot back after Democrat Hillary Clinton said in a CNN interview that she was "disappointed" with the real-estate mogul's comments about Mexican immigrants.

In a statement sent to Business Insider on Wednesday, the day after Clinton's interview aired, Trump slammed his rival for her record and immigration policy.

"Hillary Clinton â€Žwas the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States. On top of that, she is extremely bad on illegal immigration," Trump said. "Despite anything you may hear to the contrary, I do not think she is electable."

In the interview, Clinton, who is leading the Democratic field, criticized remarks Trump made in his campaign announcement in which he described some Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists.

"I've very disappointed in those comments," Clinton said. "And I feel very bad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying, 'Enough. Stop it.'"

Trump's comments on Mexican immigrants sparked a backlash last week, with several businesses severing ties with him. Trump, however, has stood by the remarks in subsequent statements and suggested the Mexican government was behind a deliberate effort to send criminal elements to the US.
