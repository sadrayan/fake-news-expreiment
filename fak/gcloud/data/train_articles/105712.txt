PLEASE READ IF YOU'RE IN A SMOKE AFFECTED AREA.

*copied and reposted from another source* figured I should make that clear.

1)Smoke will be clearing out as a storm system comes in and it rains.

2) THIS RAIN WILL BE EXTREMELY TOXIC!!!

3) DO NOT ALLOW YOUR ANIMALS AND PETS TO GO OUT IN THE RAIN!

4) Remove all standing water to prevent your pets or other animals from drinking toxic rain water.

5) If your animals need to go outside, immediately wash their paws or, if they are covered in water from rolling in the ground or getting rained on, immediately give them a bath and wash it off.

6) HAVE A SET OF OUTSIDE CLOTHES AND CHANGE AS SOON AS YOU GET HOME.
