Rampage Nation: Securing America from Mass Shootings: Louis Klarevas: 9781633880665: Amazon.com: Books
Regardless of your political affiliation or preconceived notions about guns, this book is a MUST read! Through the extensive use of facts and analysis critical of “research” used by both sides of the aisle, this book gave me an excellent understanding of the issue of guns with specific context for solutions to mass shootings that are grounded firmly in precedent and empirical analysis.



Upon finishing this book, you will have an in-depth understanding of the typical perpetrator, the role of mental illness, why shooters choose their locations, and how, yes, guns kill but some more than others. Most importantly, you will be introduced to solutions that may challenge any notions you had in mind before the book.



During this process, you will also learn about who key voices in the gun debate are and why you may or may not want to consider them credible, if or how more guns = more safety, research behind gun-free zones, and how studies can and do cherry-pick when and how they define a mass-shooting to support a predetermined outcome.



My greatest hesitation in reading this book was a fear of sensationalized or painful delves into the horrific moments of the actual crimes. I’m so glad I did not let that unfounded fear keep me from reading this book. Yes, you do read about several mass shootings, but it is handled respectfully in such a way so as to provide you with enough information to give you a constructive understanding so as to prevent future recurrences.



If everyone weighing in on the gun debate read this book before they opened their mouth, I’m confident we would be capable of a much more constructive, much less decisive dialogue.
