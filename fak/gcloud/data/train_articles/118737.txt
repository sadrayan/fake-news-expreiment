Mitt Romney: I Can Relate To Black People, My Ancestors Once Owned Slaves
In yet another seemingly faux pas moment for the former governor and presidential candidate, Mitt Romney tells a crowd of supporters in Alabama that he can relate to the plight of black individuals because his ancestors were slave owners in the 1800’s.

Mitt Romney was addressing a crowd in Prattville, Alabama this past Monday when he stated:

I understand how difficult it can be for an African-American in today’s society. In fact, I can relate to black people very well indeed. My ancestors once owned slaves, and it is in my lineage to work closely with the black community. However, just because they were freed over a century ago doesn’t mean they can now be freeloaders. They need to be told to work hard, and the incentives just aren’t there for them anymore. When I’m president I plan to work closely with the black community to bring a sense of pride and work ethic back into view for them.

Even though this latest statement by Mitt Romney will undoubtedly be spun so that it will be seen as being taken out of context, someone needs to tell this man to just keep his mouth shut and smile. So far, he has told citizens that he is friends with NASCAR owners, NFL owners, and now that he is related to slave owners. Stick to economic policy Mitt, that’s your strong point. Your history at Bain Capital speaks for itself.

The Romney campaign has yet to release its version of the speech made in Prattville.
