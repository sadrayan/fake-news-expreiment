SACRAMENTO—Assemblymember Evan Low (D-Silicon Valley), introduced an amendment to the state constitution today that would lower the voting age from 18 to 17 in California.

“Lowering the voting age will give a voice to young people and provide a tool to hold politicians accountable to the issues they care about,” said Assemblymember Evan Low. “Young people are our future, and when we ignore that we do so at our own peril.”
