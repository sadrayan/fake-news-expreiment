Chris Christie: 93 percent of Melania Trump's speech differed from Michelle Obama's
Melania Trump, in an interview taped hours before her address, told TODAY she had written the speech herself, “with as little help as possible,” but it immediately came under scrutiny after she delivered it Monday night because of striking similarities between it and the one delivered by Michelle Obama at the 2008 Democratic convention.

Christie blamed the attention on her speech on the public build up everyone gives to the opening of the Republican convention, saying “the worst day of the convention is the first day” and insisted that the story won’t even be mentioned after the second day’s events.

“What’s important is the American people gets a picture about what she feels about her husband and what their relationship is like,” he said.

Christie also dismissed reports he was angry about not being picked as Donald Trump's running mate.

"I never expected to be chosen," he said, although he admitted he did feel let down.

"Of course you’re disappointed. If you compete for something like I did, you’d like to be picked. I wasn’t. So you take a deep breath, and you go to bed and wake up the next morning and get on with your day," Christie said.
