Chuck Donovan sent along these thoughts:

It is not a very precise statistic and of course it evolves as women age and as the abortion rate and repeat abortion rates change (the former is moving downward sharply and repeat abortions remain in the 45-50 percent range. I dealt with the issue here in the NYT and linked to a calculation from physicist William Johnston that found the lifetime percentage as a range (the best statistical approach) as 25-28% of women over a lifetime. Note that Johnston’s calculation is based on abortion data from 1967 to September 2008. There are a lot of assumptions embedded in these numbers because of what we don’t know (e.g., we do not know for 10 percent or more of abortions according to the CDC whether the abortion was a repeat or not). My overall opinion is that 30.0 is high and the number at present rates of abortion returning to 1973 levels makes a figure of 25%, as I wrote in The Times, more likely. There may be some general agreement on this as you find this Washington Post fact check concluding the higher number is “half true” and Guttmacher’s analyst admitting (“reluctantly,” she says) it may be trending downward: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/09/30/the-stale-claim-that-one-in-three-women-will-have-an-abortion-by-age-45/.
