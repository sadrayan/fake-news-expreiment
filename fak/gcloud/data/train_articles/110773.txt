Running before the storm: blacktip sharks respond to falling barometric pressure associated with Tropical Storm Gabrielle
Abstract

A small population of juvenile (<1 year old) blacktip sharks Carcharhinus limbatus responded to the approach of a tropical storm by moving to deeper water. Examination of meterological variables suggested that the movement of the blacktip sharks was triggered by a drop in barometric pressure associated with the approach of the storm. This response was consistent for all the fish being studied, and all blacktip sharks returned to the shallow nursery area after the storm's passage, suggesting that this was an innate behaviour.
