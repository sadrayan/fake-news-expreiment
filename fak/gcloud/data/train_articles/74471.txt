Welcome to Cover Florida Health Care, a website that is dedicated to providing the best information on Florida health care options for drug and alcohol addiction.

Unfortunately, there is a stigma associated with drug and alcohol addiction in this country. However, we know that addiction is a disease, just like cancer or Alzheimerâ€™s. And as a disease, it requires treatment.

Treating addiction is not as straightforward as treating other diseases. The treatment of addiction involves a holistic approach including psychological, mental, emotional, and physical components.

There are many different types of recovery programs. The most important aspect of a good rehabilitation facility or recovery program is that they will help each patient find the most effective treatment for their addiction.
