The Great American Movement
Well, I think the military goes without saying. I know what he meant, people are just trying to make it out to mean something else. He's talking about sitting in a classroom, or being in a nightclub, or somewhere in your normal daily life, not the batt

lefield. People are so paranoid about losing their guns, and that's not even on the table. Nobody wants to take away anybodys right to own a gun, but that's what a lot of them keep trying to say, that someone is coming for their guns. They aren't. No matter how much people love their guns, or are genuinely worried about their second amendment rights, they should not be trying to vilify these kids. I've seen countless fake articles and pictures about some of these students, from some of the really far right extremist types, and I think it's a new low, to make these kids out to be the bad guys, or try to make their message mean something it doesn't.
