As ‘Inferior Officers,’ Czars Pass Constitutional Muster
Nomaan Merchant reports on politics.

Is the Obama administration’s use of policy “czars” unconstitutional? Five experts who testified before Congress today say no.

President Barack Obama has “czars” on Afghanistan, faith-based initiatives, climate change, and about 30 other foreign and domestic issues. Many of these advisers hold a couple job titles and have been confirmed by the Senate. Intelligence czar Dennis Blair, for example, is also the director of national intelligence. But other czars have not gone through Senate confirmation, drawing accusations that Obama is violating his pledge to make government more transparent.

One such adviser, green jobs czar Van Jones, was forced to resign last month after controversial statements of his came to light. Jones had worked for the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality.

A liberal Democrat, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, scheduled today’s hearing – on the “history and legality of executive branch ‘czars’” – before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution. “I want to be clear that I have no objection either to the people serving as advisers to the president, or to the policy issues they are addressing,” Feingold said in his opening statement.
