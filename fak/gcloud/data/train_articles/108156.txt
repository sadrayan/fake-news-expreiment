Phi (;[1] uppercase Œ¶, lowercase œÜ or œï; Ancient Greek: œïŒµ·øñ phe√Æ [p ∞√©Õúe]; Modern Greek œÜŒπ fi [fi]) is the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet.

In Archaic and Classical Greek, it represented an aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive ([p ∞]), which was the origin of its usual romanization as ‚ü®ph‚ü©. During the later part of Classical Antiquity, in Koine Greek (final centuries BC), its pronunciation shifted to that of a voiceless labiodental fricative ([f]). The romanization of the Modern Greek phoneme is therefore usually ‚ü®f‚ü©.

It may be that phi originated as the letter qoppa and initially represented the sound /k ∑ ∞/ before shifting to Classical Greek [p ∞].[2] In traditional Greek numerals, phi has a value of 500 (œÜ π) or 500,000 (ÕµœÜ). The Cyrillic letter Ef (–§, —Ñ) descends from phi.

As with other Greek letters, lowercase phi is used as a mathematical or scientific symbol. Some uses, such as the golden ratio, require the old-fashioned 'closed' glyph, which is separately encoded as the Unicode character U+03D5 œï GREEK PHI SYMBOL.

Use as a symbol

The lowercase letter œÜ (or often its variant, œï) is often used to represent the following:

The uppercase letter Œ¶ is used as a symbol for:

The diameter symbol in engineering, ‚åÄ, is often erroneously referred to as "phi". This symbol is used to indicate the diameter of a circular section; for example, "‚åÄ14" means the diameter of the circle is 14 units.

Computing

In Unicode, there are multiple forms of the phi letter:

Character Name Correct appearance Your browser Usage U+03A6 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI Œ¶ {\displaystyle \Phi \,\!} Œ¶ Used in Greek texts U+03C6 GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI or œÜ Used in Greek texts U+03D5 GREEK PHI SYMBOL œï {\displaystyle \phi \,\!} œï (œï) Used in mathematical and technical contexts.[4] (Italicized.) U+0278 LATIN SMALL LETTER PHI …∏ Used in IPA to symbolise a voiceless bilabial fricative

In ordinary Greek text, the character U+03C6 œÜ is used exclusively, although this character has considerable glyphic variation, sometimes represented with a glyph more like the representative glyph shown for U+03C6 (œÜ, the "loopy" or "open" form) and less often with a glyph more like the representative glyph shown for U+03D5 (œï, the "stroked" or "closed" form). Unicode makes an effort to distinguish the two by generally calling the loopy form "small letter phi" or "small phi", and by calling the stroked form "phi symbol", but this isn't exclusively true on all variants.

Because Unicode represents a character in an abstract way, the choice between glyphs is purely a matter of font design. While some Greek typefaces, most notably in the Porson family (used widely in editions of classical Greek texts), have a "stroked" glyph in this position ( ), most other typefaces have "loopy" glyphs. This goes for the "Didot" (or "apla") typefaces employed in most Greek book printing ( ), as well as for the "Neohellenic" typeface often used for ancient texts ( ).

It is necessary to have the stroked glyph available for some mathematical uses, and U+03D5 GREEK PHI SYMBOL is designed for this function. Prior to Unicode version 3.0 (1998), the glyph assignments in the Unicode code charts were the reverse, and thus older fonts may still show a loopy form œÜ {\displaystyle \varphi } at U+03D5.[4]

For use as a phonetic symbol in IPA, Unicode has a separate code point U+0278, LATIN SMALL LETTER PHI, because in this use only the stroked glyph is considered correct. It typically appears in a form adapted to a Latin typographic environment, with a more upright shape than normal Greek letters and with serifs at the top and bottom.

In HTML/XHTML, the upper- and lowercase phi character entity references are Œ¶ (Œ¶) and œÜ (œÜ), respectively.

In LaTeX, the math symbols are \Phi ( Œ¶ {\displaystyle \Phi \,\!} ), \phi ( œï {\displaystyle \phi \,\!} ), and \varphi ( œÜ {\displaystyle \varphi \,\!} ).

The Unicode standard also includes the following variants of phi and phi-like characters:
