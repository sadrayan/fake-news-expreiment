Additional Trend Information



American voters oppose 69 - 23 percent, including 56 - 36 percent among Republicans, shutting down the federal government in the dispute over funding Planned Parenthood, according to a Quinnipiac University National poll released today.





By a smaller 52 - 41 percent, voters oppose cutting off federal funding to Planned Parenthood, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University Poll finds. There is a large gender gap as men support a fund cutoff 49 - 44 percent, while women oppose the cutoff 60 - 34 percent. Opposition to the cutoff is 82 - 12 percent among Democrats and 56 - 37 percent among independent voters. Republicans support the cutoff 71 - 25 percent.





By a small 44 - 39 percent, with another large gender gap, American voters have a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood. Women have a favorable opinion 50 - 35 percent, while men have an unfavorable opinion 43 - 38 percent.





Offered four options on abortion, American voter opinion is:

22 percent say abortion should be legal in all cases;

35 percent say abortion should be legal in most cases;

28 percent say abortion should be illegal in most cases;

12 percent say abortion should be illegal in all cases.

"While voter support for Planned Parenthood is tepid, most American voters, especially women and Democrats, don't want to cut off federal funding," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





"And voters say 3-1, 'Don't shut down the federal government over this issue.' Most Republicans oppose a shutdown."





American voters oppose 53 - 41 percent admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees to the U.S. over the next year. Democrats support admitting refugees 60 - 33 percent, with Republicans opposed 71 - 24 percent and independent voters divided with 45 percent supporting the extra refugees and 48 percent opposed.





Voters say 58 - 36 percent the refugees would pose a threat to U.S. security. Gun Control





American voters are divided on the broad term "gun control," as 45 percent support "stricter gun control laws," while 48 percent are opposed.





There are wide gender and partisan gaps:

Women support stricter gun control 53 - 38 percent, with men opposed 58 - 37 percent;

Democrats support stricter gun control 76 - 16 percent, with Republicans opposed 73 - 23 percent and independent voters divided, with 45 percent in favor and 49 percent opposed.

But voters support 93 - 6 percent, including 93 - 7 percent in households with legal guns, "requiring background checks for all gun buyers." Same-Sex Marriage





Voters support same-sex marriage 55 - 38 percent and say 62 - 32 percent that government officials should be required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.





Even government officials who say homosexuality violates their religious beliefs should be required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, voters say 55 - 39 percent.





"The message is loud and clear. Voters support same-sex marriage, and when it comes to government officials refusing to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples, voters say, 'It's your job. Do it,'" Malloy said.





American voters disapprove 53 - 44 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing. Voters disapprove 76 - 16 percent of the job Republicans in Congress are doing and disapprove 67 - 27 percent of the job Democrats in Congress are doing.





From September 17 - 21, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,574 registered voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and the nation as a public service and for research.
