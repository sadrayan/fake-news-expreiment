WisPolitics.com: Sen. Hansen: Sale of state property provision should be repealed
7/19/2013Contact: Sen. Hansen608-266-5670(Madison)State Senator Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay) said a provision in the recently passed state budget that allows the Governor to sell state properties to his friends and donors without going through the established bidding process should be repealed.Nearly anyone who took an objective look at this scheme said it would open the door to cronyism and mixing the selling of state assets with campaign contributions. This provision removes these sales from the competitive bidding process which is designed to protect the interests of Wisconsin taxpayers, said Hansen. It flies in the face of our tradition of open and transparent government and it should be repealed as soon as possible.Senator Hansens comments came in response to recent news reports that showed Terrence Wall, a Madison developer who donated over $85,000 to Governor Walker and mostly Republican candidates, sent a letter and his private cell phone number to Walker outlining a number of state buildings he wanted to buy. Included among the properties are the State Crime Lab, the main office building for the Department of Transportation and the Department of Administration building which was constructed in the 1990s during Tommy Thompsons administration.The ink on the budget wasnt even dry before one of these wealthy Republican donors was angling for a sweetheart deal from a political party that appears all too eager to reward their friendseither by giving them yet another tax break, making taxpayers fund a separate, unaccountable voucher school system or by forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4000 per year.Senate Republicans should have stopped this special interest give away but they chose instead to follow the money and go along with it.Sale of government property in other states has also been controversial. In Arizona, Governor Jan Brewer and the Republican-held legislature sold the states capitol building for $81 million and then rented the building from its private owner. In 2012 Brewer reversed course and asked the legislature for $105 million to buy it backa move that would cost Arizona taxpayers well over $24 million.People really need to pay attention to this issue or they may find that, like Arizona, they may find themselves paying rent the state capitol building to Terrence Wall.
