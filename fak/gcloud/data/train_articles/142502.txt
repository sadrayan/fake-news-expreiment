Cheerleader Poops At Football Game
Talk about a shitty situation.

The phrase “shit the bed” refers to a team performing below expectations. For example, “the Patriots really shit the bed against Kansas City on Monday Night Football.”

I’m not sure what phrase describes when the top of the pyramid cheerleader poops on her teammates down below . Umm, gross.

I hope the actual football game wasn’t as shitty as…. well, you get where I’m going with that.
