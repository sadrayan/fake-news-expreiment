BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Killed In Monster Truck Mishap
Hillary Clinton was sitting with friends and her daughter, Chelsea, at the Chappaqua Motor Speedway in upstate New York earlier this evening when 11 tons of American steel and irony jumped the rails, injuring thirty-five people and killing Clinton.

The machine, the Big Blue Bernie Or Buster, is a modified Jeep CJ-7. The right rear shock, with a diameter of 40 inches and weighing 403 pounds, imploded Clinton’s head at approximately 14 miles per hour. The coroner said it would have been a solid minute of excruciating pain combined with a cognitive awareness that your head was about to be crushed like a grape.

The driver of the Monster machine said when he realized he was going to lose it he headed straight for where he knew Clinton was sitting:

“I had a decision to make. I could either steer into random people or try to minimize the damage by localizing it to the woman who is guilty of 218 murders, 40 DACA violations, Benghazi and the Russia scandal, not to mention Monica Lewinski. I did what i thought was tight. I’d do it again.”

The local police are calling the incident a “tragic and yet unavoidable accident.” They went on to applaud driver Greg Page for his quick actions that saved the lives of regular people.
