Antiperspirant use as a risk factor for breast cancer in Iraq.
Some internet communications have addressed the link between antiperspirant use and breast cancer. We studied the possible association between the use of antiperspirants and some other factors with the development of breast cancer in Al-Kadhmia teaching hospital. Thus, 54 cases of breast cancer and 50 controls were interviewed. We found 82.0% of the controls used antiperspirants compared with 51.8% of cases (P< 0.05). The use of antiperspirants had no association with the risk of breast cancer, while family history and oral contraceptives use were found to be associated.
