Their First Fight! Meghan Markle 'Insulted' Prince Harry Wants Her To Sign Prenup
An insider told InTouch that Meghan is “insulted” that she’s been ask to sign a financial agreement as part of her prenup before her May wedding. “She loves Harry, and money is the last thing on her mind,” the source said.

While Meghan has hit it off with The Queen, the royal matriarch has seen too many royal marriages end in divorce (like her own son Prince Charles’ to Princess Diana) and doesn’t want Harry taking any chances with his reported $40 million fortune.

“Meghan can see where the queen is coming from, but at the same time, Meghan’s insulted that it would even cross the queen’s mind that Meghan would have an ulterior motive for marrying Harry,” the insider said.

Plus, the normally independent Meghan is struggling to adjust to royal life. “She’s beginning to feel claustrophobic being trapped in Nottingham Cottage,” the source told IT.

“Meghan can no longer decide to go shopping or meet pals at the last minute like she used to. She’s begging Harry to allow her out without bodyguards, but he fears for her safety. She’s been feeling stir-crazy and homesick,” the insider explained.

At the beginning of December, just months after they announced their engagement, “Meghan finally let out her frustrations,” the source revealed. According to the insider, Harry was quick to apologize! “Harry won’t take her for granted again and will make a special effort to be more sympathetic and understanding,” the source said.
