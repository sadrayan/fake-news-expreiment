Lawlessness
View this email in your browser Dear friend,



Earlier this week, the Supreme Court of the United States had some harsh words for President Obama. In one ruling, the Supreme Court found President Obama overstepped his bounds with unconstitutional appointments of government bureaucrats to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Similarly, in another case the Supreme Court concluded President Obama’s environmental extremists at the EPA grossly expanded their authority in an attempt to regulate Wisconsin’s energy providers, which could put thousands of families out of work and raise their utility bills.



Like President Obama, my Democrat opponents have no respect for the Constitution or rule of law. In fact, one of my opponents went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed.



We’re quickly approaching our June 30th finance deadline and I need your help to spread my positive message about enforcing the rule of law and making public safety a top priority at the Wisconsin Department of Justice.



Will you consider a donation of $25 to keep politics out of the Department of Justice and help keep Wisconsin moving forward?



Unlike my opponents, I am prepared to lead the fight against heroin and opiate abuse and make sure our young people grow up in a Wisconsin that is safer, stronger, and more prosperous.



Thank you for your continued support of my campaign to be Wisconsin’s next Attorney General.



Very truly yours, Brad Schimel
