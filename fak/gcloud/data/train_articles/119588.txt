Report Of Dentist Removing All Of Ex's Teeth Turns Out To Be Hoax
RETRACTION: MSNBC reported today, May 9, that the dentist accused of drugging up her boyfriend and pulling his teeth out doesn't exist. Cops in Wroclaw, Poland told the station that they hadn't received word of such a crime, and a legal adviser for Poland's Chamber of Physicians and Dentists said there is no dental practitioner named Anna Mackowiak.

A handful of respectable publications ran the story before it was aggregated. Still, we strive to make sure all the articles we publish are 100-percent accurate. We regret the error.
