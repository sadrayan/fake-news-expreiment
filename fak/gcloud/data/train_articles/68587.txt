On Congress not being in session to go on record about the U.S. military operation in Syria:



"To the extent that there's some culpability here, it probably is more on Congress's shoulders."

***FULL TRANSCRIPT BELOW***



BOB SCHIEFFER: And joining us now from Richmond is Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Senator Kaine, thank you for coming.



TIM KAINE: Good morning, Bob--



BOB SCHIEFFER: As I understand it, it's not that you disagree with what the President is doing now, but you think Congress should go on record, and vote on this, and put some end date to this operation, however it turns out. Am I summarizing your view correctly?



TIM KAINE: You stated it correctly. I think the President's definition of the mission has been careful. And that's why I've introduced an authorization to essentially authorize the mission as he described it with some key limitations. And I also think the administration has done a great job of bringing together the multinational coalition.



But we're not supposed to start a war without Congress. I'm sitting in the capitol that Thomas Jefferson designed here in Virginia. He, James Madison, George Mason, and others who participated in the drafting of the Constitution made a critical break from previous history where war was a matter for the monarch or the executive and said that war should not be started without Congress.



The reason they did it? We shouldn't be putting our servicemen and women in harm's way if there's not a political consensus that the mission is worth it. So I think the President's assertion that he can do this, I think he does not have the article two constitutional authority to do this entire mission without Congress. And neither of the authorizations passed by Congress in 2001 or 2002 cover it. We should be debating and voting on this entire mission.



BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, how detailed and what exactly do you want the Congress to vote on? What would be included in this resolution to be what you want?



TIM KAINE: Bob, the resolution that I've introduced, and some other members have introduced similar resolutions, basically tracks the President's four-point plan. Humanitarian aid, of course, that's not controversial. And the U.S. is the biggest provider of humanitarian aid in the world to Syrian refugees.



Air strikes in Iraq and Syria. Counter-terrorism operations to go after I.S.I.L. leadership wherever they are. And in addition, the training and assisting of ground forces, whether it's the Iraqi security force, the Peshmerga in the Kurdish area, or vetted opposition in Syria. So that is what we proposed.



And then there are some key limitations. I include a sunset where the President would have to come back and keep Congress informed to extend the mission beyond a year, a limitation on ground forces, a repeal of the 2002 Iraq authorization so we don't have dueling authorizations out there, and a careful definition of who the target is. The notion of kinda we can go after people who perpetrated 9/11 and it's now being used to go after groups that didn't even exist when 9/11 happened suggests we've gotta be very careful in how we define who we are at war with.



BOB SCHIEFFER: You know, so far at least, you are sort of a lone voice. I know there are some others that agree with you. But the majority of Congress seem just delighted to be able to get out of town and not have to go on record on this. What do you think about that?



TIM KAINE: Bob, it really concerns me that the President would assert he has the ability to do this unilaterally when as a candidate for president, he made very plain that the President cannot unilaterally start a war without Congress. He was very clear about that. But you're right.



To the extent that there's some culpability here, it probably is more on Congress's shoulders. We adjourned on the 18th on September. That's the second earliest recess before a midterm since 1960. And you know what? If the President had asked us to stay like David Cameron asked parliament to come back, we would have.



And the vote that Congress passed on the one piece of it that we voted on, the training of Syrian opposition, showed strong bipartisan support in both houses. We could've given the President and more importantly we could've given our servicemen and women the strong backing of our political class before we ask them to risk their lives in what could be a very extended mission.



BOB SCHIEFFER: All right. Well, Senator, we wanna thank you very much for being with us this morning. We'll be back in one minute to talk to our panel of experts.
