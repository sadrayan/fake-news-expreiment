Davis Voted To Amend The State Law That Prohibits The Attorney General From Settling The School Finance Lawsuit: In 2011 Sen. Davis Voted For S.B. 899. (S.B. 899, Third Reading, 30-1, 4/4/11, Davis Voted Yea) S.B. 899 Was Signed By Governor Perry On June 17, 2011. ( S.B. 899 , Filed 2/23/11) S.B. 899 Prohibits “The Attorney General … From Entering Into A Settlement” That Costs The State Over $10 Million Or A Settlement That “Commits The State To A Continuing Increased Expenditure Of State Funds Over Subsequent Biennia” Unless The Legislature Approves. “S.B. 899 amends the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, in a provision prohibiting the attorney general or other attorney representing the state from entering into a settlement of a claim or action against the state without the legislature's consent or approval if the settlement requires the state to pay total monetary damages in an amount that exceeds a specified threshold amount in a state fiscal biennium or that commits the state to a continuing increased expenditure of state funds over subsequent biennia, to decrease that threshold amount from $25 million to $10 million.” (“S.B. 899 Bill Analysis,” House Research Organization, Accessed 9/19/14) NOTE: S.B. 899 Amended Legislation Passed In 2007 That Set A Cap Of $25 Million For A Settlement Without Legislative Approval. “In 2007, the 80th Legislature passed S.B. 2031. That bill amended the Civil Practice and Remedies Code to ensure that the legislature determines the extent to which the state waives its sovereign immunity with regard to a settlement of a claim or action against the state that requires an expenditure of state funds exceeding $25 million, or that commits the state to a course of action that in reasonable probability will entail a continuing increased expenditure of state funds over subsequent state fiscal bienniums.” (“S.B. 899 Bill Analysis,” Senate Research Center , 3/15/11)
