The Washington Dispatch
President Bush: Compassionate Conservative

In a moment captured in time with one click of a camera, it’s easy to see why President Bush is revered in many circles. As he campaigned working the line and signing autographs on Tuesday at the Golden Lamb Inn in Lebanon, Ohio the president was stopped by a 15-year old teen’s friend who told Mr. Bush as he walked by, "This girl lost her mom in the World Trade Center on 9-11."

The president turned around returned to the girl, and hugged her to his chest.



The teen was Ashley Faulkner, and she lost her mother on 9/11 in the World Trade Center. While the president comforted Ashley, her father snapped one telling frame.

"He changed from being the leader of the free world to being a father, a husband and a man," Mr. Faulkner said. "He looked right at her and said, 'How are you doing?' He reached out with his hand and pulled her into his chest."

Ashley Faulkner was also impressed that the leader of the free world would take the time to show her such compassion. “The way he was holding me, with my head against his chest, it felt like he was trying to protect me," Ashley said. "I thought, 'here is the most powerful guy in the world, and he wants to make sure I'm safe.' I definitely had a couple of tears in my eyes, which is pretty unusual for me.”

A beautiful moment. Bush may not be the “apologist-in-chief” his opponents want him to be, but he has proved again that he can be the “healer-in-chief” when need be.
