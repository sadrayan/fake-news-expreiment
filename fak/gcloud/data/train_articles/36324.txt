State Revolving Fund American Iron and Steel (AIS) Requirement
The American Iron and Steel (AIS) provision requires Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) assistance recipients to use iron and steel products that are produced in the United States. This requirement applies to projects for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public water system or treatment works.



The AIS provision is a permanent requirement for all CWSRF projects. The America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 extends the AIS provision for DWSRF projects through Fiscal Year 2023. For details, see Legal Authority below.

The appropriation language sets forth certain circumstances under which EPA may waive American Iron and Steel requirements. For details, see Waiver Process.

AIS Legal Authority

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-76) includes an American Iron and Steel (AIS) requirement. Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) assistance recipients are required to use iron and steel products that are produced in the United States for projects for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public water system or treatment works and if the project is funded through an assistance agreement executed beginning January 17, 2014 (enactment of the Act), through the end of Fiscal Year 2014.

The appropriation language sets forth certain circumstances under which EPA may waive AIS requirements. Furthermore, the act exempts projects where engineering specifications and plans were approved by a state agency prior to January 17, 2014.

On June 10 2014, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act amended the Clean Water Act (CWA) to include permanent requirements for the use of AIS in CWSRF projects. Section 608 of the CWA now contains requirements for AIS that repeat those of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY 2014. As such, all CWSRF projects must comply with Section 608 of the CWA for implementation of the permanent AIS requirements. Therefore, all guidances adopted for FY 2014 apply for the permanent AIS requirements for the CWSRF.
