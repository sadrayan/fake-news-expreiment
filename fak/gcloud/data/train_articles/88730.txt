CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Marco Rubio, under attack from his opponents for missing votes and intelligence briefings, came up with a new defense at a town hall here on Tuesday: “We’re not going to fix America with senators and congressmen.”

The issue of Rubio missing Senate business, which is being broadcast by a super PAC supporting rival Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, was raised by the first woman to ask Rubio a question at a town-hall stop at a Cedar Rapids Marriott. “They like to bring up that you missed votes,” she told Rubio, and asked for his advice on how to defend his record.

“First of all, my record in the Senate is close to 90 percent in my five years there,” Rubio began.

“I have missed votes this year,” the Florida senator acknowledged. “You know why? Because while as a senator I can help shape the agenda. Only a president can set the agenda. We’re not going to fix America with senators and congressmen.”

Rubio went on. “So yes, I’m out there trying to turn this country, running for president, and being here with you and in other early states to try to win. Because this country is at a tipping point.”

Rubio’s opponents pounced. "He certainly proved one thing, he can't — or is unwilling to — make change in the Senate," said Bush spokesman Tim Miller.

The town hall is the first of three that Rubio is holding across Iowa on Tuesday.
