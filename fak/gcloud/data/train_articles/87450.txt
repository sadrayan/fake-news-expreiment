TALLAHASSEE â€” Employers and business owners can no longer bar workers and shoppers from bringing guns onto their property and leaving the weapons locked inside their vehicles under a bill signed into law today by Gov. Charlie Crist.

The new law allows employees and visitors who have concealed weapons licenses to leave their weapons locked in or to vehicles. But concealed weapons license records are not available for public inspection so businesses would have no way of verifying if employees actually have the licenses.

The business community objected to the bill, backed by the National Rifle Association, saying property owners should be able to have control over whether people can bring guns to work.

The NRA and gun-rights advocates argued that business rights do not trump the right to bear arms.
