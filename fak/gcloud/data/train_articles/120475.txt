Police scanner audio
A KARE 11 viewer, who gave us audio clips of police radio traffic, claims they captured the moments just before Philando Castile and his girlfriend were stopped by St. Anthony police – which ended in police shooting that killed Castile.

KARE 11 has attempted to confirm the authenticity of the recording with police officials, but so far they have not responded.

We have verified that the license plate mentioned by police in the recording matches the plate of the car Castile was driving. The location the officer gives also corresponds to the locations of the traffic stop.

“I’m going to stop a car,” the officer says on the recording. “I’m going to check IDs. I have reason to pull it over.”

“The two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery,” the officer says. “The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just ‘cause of the wide set nose,” the officer continues.

A minute and a half later, the recording captures the first report that there was a shooting.

Officer: “Shots fired Larpenteur and Fry.”

Dispatch: “Copy you just heard it? … You just heard the shots fired?”

Officer: (screaming) “Code 3! Shots fired.”

Dispatch: “Copy shots fired Larpenteur and Fry. Do you need medics?”

Officer: “Code 3!”

Dispatch: “Copy. Medics -- code 3 to Larpenteur and Fry.”

Officer: “One adult female taken into custody. Driver at gunpoint.”

It’s unclear which robbery the officer was referring to when he said Mr. Castile looked like a suspect. But the BCA had sent out a press release earlier this week saying St. Anthony police were investigating a gas station robbery that occurred in nearby Lauderdale on July 2.
