People of Lancaster is a mix of news, opinion, and satire about the people, places and interests of Lancaster County, PA.

Much of the content on this site is satire inspired by real people or events that we love to coat with a heavy layer of snark and sarcasm.

How can you tell what is real and what is satire?

Well, if ‘obvious’ escapes you and you lack the intellectual curiosity to discover the truth for yourself you can view the tags assigned to every story published on the website. Stories that are satire are assigned the ‘satire’ tag as shown in the image below and displayed at the bottom of every article published.

Have fun. Enjoy the site. And don’t take yourself too seriously – because we don’t take you seriously.
