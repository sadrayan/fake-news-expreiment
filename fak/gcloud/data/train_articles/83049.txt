Trump Chief Economic Adviser Contradicts Campaign Promise: Coal ‘Doesn’t Even Make That Much Sense Anymore’
President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Gary Cohn minimized the significance of coal in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday, according to the pool report.

“Coal doesn’t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock,” Cohn said.

The comment is remarkably at odds with the rhetoric Trump campaigned on, specifically his promise to revive the coal industry. Trump’s pledge to “put miners back to work” has often been credited with the president’s electoral success in the Rust Belt, once home to a booming coal industry.

As many have pointed out, Trump is unlikely to be able to put people back to work in the coal mines, and it looks like Cohn is aware with that reality, pointing to other more viable sources of energy.

“Natural gas, which we have become an abundant producer, which we’re going to became a major exporter of, is such a cleaner fuel,” Cohn said.

“If you think about how solar and how much wind power we’re created in the United States, we can be a manufacturing powerhouse and still be environmentally friendly,” he added.
