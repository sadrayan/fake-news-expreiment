Dozens of N.J. malls to open on Thanksgiving despite Black Friday backlash
WOODBRIDGE â€” Two-dozen malls and outlets in New Jersey will be open on Thanksgiving.

In some cases, mall doors will open on Nov. 27 but stores aren't mandated to open at the scheduled time. That is the case with Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, which will open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving but stores aren't required to open until midnight, a spokesperson confirmed.

Opening on Thanksgiving isn't a recent phenomenon. Black Friday marks the unofficial start to the holiday shopping season, and a crippled economy over the past six years has led retailers to capitalize on it.

Last year, a memo from Simon and Rockaway Townsquare sparked an Internet backlash when Gawker published a leaked memo stating the mall would be open from 8 p.m. on Thanksgiving through 10 p.m. Friday. Others have created online petitions demanding malls stay closed on the holiday.

Still, an overwhelming number of New Jersey malls will be open by 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, including most Simon malls, though they will not stay open through the night.
