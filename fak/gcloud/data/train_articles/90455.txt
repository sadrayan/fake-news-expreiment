LegitAction
Why LegitAction?

Our democracy is facing its biggest legitimacy crisis in a generation or more. Over the past seven plus years, the GOP and their billion-dollar corporate backers have led an assault on four of the most important pillars of our democracy, and as a result the legitimacy of our system of government is in peril.

The Right to Vote: The GOP has pursued systematic voter suppression at the state level, intentionally making it harder for minorities and low-income citizens to vote. The Popular Vote: Two of our last three presidents have won the White House while losing the national popular vote because of the esoteric system known as the Electoral College. Campaign Finance Reform: Since the Citizens United ruling, we have seen a rise in electoral bribery and corruption. The Supreme Court: The GOP torched the legitimacy of our highest court last year when they abandoned their constitutional responsibilities by blocking Judge Merrick Garlandâ€™s nomination.

These are four real threats to our democratic legitimacy, and together, they resulted in Donald Trump.

I want to continue to do my part to fight for our democracy, which is why I launched LegitAction to help restore our democratic legitimacy. Together, we will fight to undo Citizens United, protect voting rights, end the Electoral College, and protect the Supreme Court.

I hope you will join me in this fight.
