Alan McConnachieâ€™s Homepage
I am a Research Officer / Instrument Scientist at NRC Herzberg (Dominion Astrophysical Observatory) in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.







I also hold an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Victoria.







My current research interests centre around galaxies, their formation, evolution, stellar content, and the tools we need to understand them.
