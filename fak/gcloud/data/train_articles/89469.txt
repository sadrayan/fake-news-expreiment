Ed Fitzpatrick: How did Healey get 22% in R.I. governor’s race with just $36?/ Poll
In 2010, Frank T. Caprio ran as the endorsed Democratic candidate for governor. He outspent his opponents, pouring $2.6 million into the race. And he finished third with 23 percent of the vote, taking three cities and towns: Johnston, North Providence and Central Falls.

On Tuesday, Robert J. Healey Jr. ran as the Moderate Party’s last-minute substitute candidate. He spent $36.29 (including two stamps), while his opponents spent millions. And he finished third with 22 percent of the vote, taking two towns: Warren and Bristol.

So what in the name of the Cool Moose is going on here? I mean, Healey ran for governor three times before this year, but the best he ever did was 9 percent in 1994. So what catapulted him into the Caprio-sphere this year?

For one thing, Healey appealed to retired public employees ticked off about the state pension overhaul led by Democrat Gina M. Raimondo (who won the governor’s race). “We have moral obligations to people on Wall Street,�? he said in one debate, “and yet we have no problem saying we have no moral obligation to the people that actually worked for our state, taught our children, gave nursing services and other services to the people of our state?�?

On Wednesday, Healey said, “I think I was being used to send a message to the Democratic Party — that you can’t play around with people’s lives and pensions. Public employees who retired wanted to show their disgust with Gina.�?

Now, you might expect a libertarian candidate such as Healey to draw more votes from the Republican in the race. But he said, “I think we pulled more from Gina. The problem was Fung wasn’t strong enough to pull those people into his camp.�? He said he did receive some support from Republicans “antagonized by the Fung campaign,�? but his “beautiful coalition�? included “Democrats, not so many Republicans, just a lot of people who felt disenfranchised.�?

Healey believes he tapped into disgust with politicians, with talking points and with the relentless attack ads (often funded by outside groups) seen in the governor’s race. “My 22 percent shows people are dissatisfied with government, with negative ads, with the 24-hour bombardment,�? he said. That theory dovetails with a recent Politico headline: “Exit polls 2014: Voters hate everyone.�?

Pollster Joseph Fleming said Healey drew votes from both Raimondo and Fung, but he suspects he took a bit more from Fung. Polls had Healey no higher than 12 percent. But Fleming believes Healey shot up to 22 percent because many voters think the state is heading in the wrong direction, they grew sick of all the negative ads and they wanted to send a message to the major parties.

In Rhode Island, Healey is established as anti-establishment — as the perfect vehicle for that message. He ran for lieutenant governor three times, vowing to eliminate the job. And he derides political fundraising as a self-perpetuating outrage that does not serve the public.

So it’s not like Caprio would have coasted if he’d just spent $36 rather than $2.6 million. And it’s not like Healey would have won if he’d just spent $72 instead of $36. For him, less is more because more would undermine his message. “Raising money would have destroyed the integrity of it,�? he said.

This year, his message was amplified by those who wanted to deliver a message to Raimondo, to Fung or to the political system as a whole.
