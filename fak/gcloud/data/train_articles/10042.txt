The public has a right to know
Last year, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill giving Florida’s public officials and candidates an easy way to avoid financial disclosure of their assets. Since then, Gov. Scott has been the only elected official to take advantage of this.

The law goes against nearly four decades of financial disclosure by Florida officials -- and now it’s being challenged in court.
