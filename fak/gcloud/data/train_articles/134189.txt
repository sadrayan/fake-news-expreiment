Spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry went on national TV and promoted an easily refuted conspiracy theory, accusing London of ‘God-level trolling’ — Meduza
Following the British government’s announcement on Wednesday that it has identified two Russian suspects in the attack on Sergey Skripal, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova went on state television and ridiculed the published evidence, calling it “God-level trolling.”

Zakharova even promoted an easily refuted conspiracy theory claiming that security camera footage of the two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on March 2, 2018, supposedly shows them in the same place at the same time. “Have a look. The same place, the same corridor, and the same time. So either they just superimposed the same date and exact time on these photos, or Russian Military Intelligence agents have learned to walk in tandem while appearing separately in two different photos,” Zakharova said incredulously, eliciting the audience’s thunderous applause.

A closer inspection of the camera footage, however, reveals that the suspects (identified as Russian citizens Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov) were clearly filmed in different corridors. (In the bottom-right corner of the images, a red sign that appears in each photo isn’t the same.)

According to The Daily Mail, passengers arriving at Gatwick Airport have to walk down one of several nearly identical thin gate corridors after retrieving their luggage and declaring their items.
