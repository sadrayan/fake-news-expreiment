Transcript of phone interview of Jerry Patterson by Ken Herman, commentator, Austin American-Statesman, Dec. 8, 2017 (received by email from Herman, Dec. 8, 2017)

If your premise or your headline is Patterson wants his old job back, you would be wrong.

I don’t need a job and I would frankly prefer to be praising George P. Bush at this point in time. However, for the last four months I’ve been looking an opponent (for Bush) and I haven’t had any success.

Over the last three years I’ve watched the GLO be rebooted and it’s actually essentially cratered. It was the best agency in Texas government. And I’ve watched the Land Office mismanage the rollout of the restoration of the Alamo. I’ve watched them hide the ball by refusing to answer open records requests.

And frankly if you saw the hearing that happened several days ago with the Senate Finance Committee, after he essentially had somebody rip him a new one by members of the Senate and tell him that he needs to be open and that disclosure is required by them if not by law. And then George P. tells the Chronicle and other gathered reporters that he was going to take it under consideration and go back to the board members of this nonprofit that he created and who serve at his pleasure and see what they want to do. I mean who the hell’s in charge here?

And now we have tens of thousands of Texans who are essentially homeless and the Land Office has repaired two, two homes. And we’ve got folks waking up that have been sleeping in tents and they got snow this morning. People are still sleeping in tents.

So at the end of the day, even though I don’t need a job, not looking for this job, I kind of think that there’s something more important than enjoying my retirement like I have been doing.
