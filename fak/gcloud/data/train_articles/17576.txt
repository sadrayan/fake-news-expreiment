Congressman Duffy Re-Introduces Women's Public Health & Safety Act
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Congressman Sean Duffy (R-WI) today re-introduced the Women’s Public Health & Safety Act. The legislation would empower states to exclude abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funds.

Congressman Duffy released the following statement upon the introduction of the Women’s Public Health & Safety Act: “New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions. If a state wants to take taxpayer money that would have otherwise gone to a disreputable organization like Planned Parenthood and instead transfer it to non-controversial community centers that provide women’s health, they should be free to do so.”

Background: The bill makes abortion providers not fall under the “free choice of qualified provider” provision. So excluding abortion providers from Medicaid funding would not count as “limiting healthcare options”, which is not allowed under Medicaid. In 2015, the Women’s Public Health & Safety Act passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 236 to 193.
