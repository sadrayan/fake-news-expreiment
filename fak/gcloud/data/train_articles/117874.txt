Saccharin
Introduction: Saccharin was discovered in 1879 by Constantine Fahlberg, while working in the laboratory of Ira Remsen, quite by accident as were most other sweeteners. While working in the lab, he spilled a chemical on his hand. Later while eating dinner, Fahlberg noticed a more sweetness in the bread he was eating. He traced the sweetness back to the chemical, later named saccharin, by tasting various residues on his hands and clothes (unsanitary conditions) and finally chemicals in the lab (not a safe lab practice). By 1907, saccharin was used as a replacement for sugar in foods for diabetics. Since it is not metabolized in the body for energy, saccharin is classified as a noncaloric sweetener. By the 1960s it was used on a massive scale in the "diet" soft drink industry. Saccharin is the foundation for many low-calorie and sugar-free products around the world. It is used in table top sweeteners, baked goods, jams, chewing gum, canned fruit, candy, dessert toppings and salad dressings. Saccharin also is one of the most studied food ingredients. Although the overall evidence indicates saccharin is safe for human consumption, there has been controversy over its safety in the past. The basis for the controversy rests primarily on findings of bladder tumors in some male rats fed high doses of sodium saccharin. Extensive research on human populations has established no association between saccharin and cancer. In fact, more than 30 human studies have been completed and support saccharin's safety at human levels of consumption. Saccharin Web Site Saccharin - Chime in new window
