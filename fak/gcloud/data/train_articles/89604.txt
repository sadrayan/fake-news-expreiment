Hillary Clinton would defeat three potential Republican presidential candidates if the 2016 presidential election were held today, with New Jersey Gov. Christopher Christie second in a field of three Democrats and three Republicans selected by Quinnipiac University for a national poll released today.





Vice President Joseph Biden and New York's Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo would not fare nearly as well, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds.





The Republicans tested also include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.





Former First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State Clinton wins easily against any of the Republicans, topping Christie 45 - 37 percent; leading Rubio 50 - 34 percent and besting Ryan 50 - 38 percent.





"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would start a 2016 presidential campaign with enormous advantages," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "She obviously is by far the best known and her more than 20 years in the public spotlight allows her to create a very favorable impression on the American people. But it is worth noting that she had very good poll numbers in 2006 looking toward the 2008 election, before she faced a relative unknown in Barack Obama."





Christie gets 43 percent to Vice President Biden's 40 percent and tops Cuomo 45 - 28 percent.





Biden tops Rubio 45 - 38 percent and gets 45 percent to Ryan's 42 percent.





Ryan tops Cuomo 42 - 37 percent while Cuomo and Rubio are tied 37 - 37 percent.





"Although some Republicans don't think New Jersey Gov. Christopher Christie is conservative enough for their taste, he runs best of the three Republicans tested and would defeat two of the top Democrats," Brown said. "He obviously is doing better than the Democrats' rising star, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, despite other indications of anti-Republican sentiment."





The Democratic edge is seen in the poll finding that voters disapprove of the job Democrats in Congress are doing 60 - 32 percent, compared to an overwhelming 71 - 20 percent disapproval for Republicans in Congress.





"The Republican brand is not doing very well these days," said Brown.





The difference between the showing by Mrs. Clinton, Biden and Cuomo shows in her ability and their inability to attract independent voters. For instance, Mrs. Clinton ties Christie 36 - 36 percent among independents while Biden trails Christie 44 - 32 percent among those voters. Cuomo trails Christie 47 - 20 percent among independent voters.





President Barack Obama has a 45 - 46 percent job approval, virtually unchanged from last month's 46 - 45 percent score, but down from his post-election high of 53 - 40 percent in December. The gender gap continues to mark the president's ratings, with women approving 48 - 42 percent, while men disapprove 51 - 41 percent.





The good news for Obama is that voters trust him slightly more on several issues than they do congressional Republicans. They give him the advantage 44 - 40 percent on handling the economy, 46 - 41 percent on handling health care and 45 - 40 percent on handling immigration. Republicans have the trust of 44 percent of voters on gun policy, compared to 42 percent for the president, and 43 percent for handling the budget deficit, compared to 41 percent for Obama.





By an 88 - 10 percent margin, including 85 - 13 percent among voters in households with guns, American voters support background checks for all gun buyers. Voters also support 54 - 41 percent a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons and back 54 - 42 percent a nationwide ban on the sale of ammunition magazines with more than 10 rounds.





From February 27 - March 4, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,944 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.2 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia and the nation as a public service and for research.
