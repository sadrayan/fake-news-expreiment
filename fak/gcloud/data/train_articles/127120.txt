USPS Forever Stamps, First Class Stamp
How Do Forever Stamps Work?

Forever Stamps are ideal for mailing normal-sized, one-ounce letters within the United States. If you suspect that your letter may weigh more than one ounce, be sure to weigh it prior to affixing a Forever Stamp, as heavier letters will be returned due to lack of postage. For any domestic mail piece that weighs more than one ounce, you must include additional postage along with your Forever Stamp to ensure USPS delivery. Also, you may purchase higher denomination postage stamps for heavier postage at the Post Office™.

Avoid placing two Forever Stamps on a mail piece for heavier mail. Additional ounces are much cheaper costing only $0.15 per additional ounce rather than $0.55 for a one ounce letter. If you add two Forever Stamps to a 2 ounce letter, you would be paying for an item that should only cost $0.70.
