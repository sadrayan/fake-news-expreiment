United States of America Document: PDF Type: Legislative Hearing/Committee Report Language: English Country: United States of America Annotation: This document contains the text of hearings held before the U.S. House of Representative Committee on the Judiciary concerning the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1985. Abstract: The Committee considered two version of the Act, H.R. 4 and H.R. 13, which would outlaw the manufacture, import, or sale of armor-piercing ammunition except for government use, including military and police, testing, research, or export. Armor-piercing ammunition is defined in the bill as ammunition that is composed of projectiles made from certain hard metals including beryllium copper, tungsten alloys, steel, and bronze. Armor-piercing ammunition, which is not used by hunters or target sportsmen, poses a special threat to the safety of policemen, but proposals to prohibit the sale of such ammunition in the U.S. have always been opposed by the National Rifle Association. This document contains statements made by congressmen; officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and other Federal agencies; representatives of police departments and organizations; and the executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action of the National Rifle Association.
