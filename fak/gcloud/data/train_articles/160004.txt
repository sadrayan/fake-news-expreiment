CRUZ: We are a people of faith who see Godâ€™s hand in our lives and in our history
Releases Statement on National Day of Prayer

HOUSTON, TX — Today U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in observance of the National Day of Prayer:

“On April 29, 1607, after a four and a half month journey, 144 Englishmen landed at Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The first thing they did on the shores of what would become the United States of America, was to erect a wooden cross and hold a prayer meeting.

“Prayer is the manifestation of our relationship with God, in triumph, in discouragement, or just to face a new day.

“Today, more than 400 years later, we recognize that God is central to the American experience by designating the first Thursday in May as a National Day of Prayer. This morning in Washington, DC, at the National Prayer Breakfast, I prayed for Godâ€™s continued blessing upon our nation. ‘Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it.’ If the Lord directs our future, our nation has bright days ahead!

“Since the very beginning at Cape Henry, our nationâ€™s people have found comfort in prayer. We are a people of faith who see Godâ€™s hand in our lives and in our history.”
