Nigerian boy is rescued after spending THREE DAYS trapped in a wall
Passers by ignored his cries for three days before his singing

A 12-year-old boy was miraculously rescued after spending three days trapped in a tiny gap between a house and a wall.

Aduragbemi Saka had been visiting a cafe alone when he started playing in 12-inches wide gap between the breeze block wall and a student house.

But he became stuck and with no relatives nearby he spent three days crying to himself - with passersby ignoring the sounds.

Nearly there. After three days of being trapped in the wall Saka is on the verge of freedom

Eventually neighbours heard the boy singing to himself and they looked inside the gap to see him curled up in a ball.

Police smashed through the wall and pulled him out covered in dust but still alive in the Oduduwa Area of Ondo state, Nigeria.

Resident Felicia Olaniyi said the boy had run away from his grandmother who had been looking after him at the time.

She said: ''I asked my neighbours if they were aware of the strange voice inside the wall and they were also confused about what was going on there.

''So we got a ladder to trace where the voice was coming from and found the young boy where he was stuck. A policeman had to break the wall to rescue him.''

Rinse: The boy is splashed with water to clean the dust of his body. He was later reunited with his grandmother

Another neighbour Charity Adebayo said: ''We heard a voice speaking that 'I am Judas Iscariot. The following day we asked for a ladder and found him. We discovered the poor boy.''
