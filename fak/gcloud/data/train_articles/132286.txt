The Law Of The Land
: Chief Justice Moore's Message To America - Expanded Edition Roy Moore , Senior Tutor Ruskin College Roy Moore Vision Forum , Sep 1, 2003 - Religion - 208 pages 0 Reviews https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Law_Of_The_Land.html?id=h8yNAAAACAAJ Arguably the most significant stand for God s Law in our generation occurred when the Chief Justice of the State of Alabama refused to remove the Ten Commandments Monument after a federal judge declared it illegal for the state to acknowledge God. In so doing, Roy Moore proved himself to be the most heroic Christian elected to high office in a century. But his actions also earned him a judicial suspension, the wrath of the ACLU, and the disapprobation of the secular news media. Now, in The Law of the Land you can travel with Vision Forum to the classrooms of our Witherspoon School of Law and Public Policy, where Chief Justice Moore has served as faculty since 1999, and join us for a behind the scenes look at the stand-off in Montgomery, where thousands gathered by the Ten Commandments Monument in support of the basic proposition that the state must acknowledge God. This film is a collection of great speeches by men like the Chief Justice, Alan Keyes, and Howard Phillips. The Law of the Land is a great resource to educate your local church, to motivate your children to become future leaders, and to receive the encouragement that comes when we are reminded that God is raising a remnant of faithful warriors to stand in the gates of the nation. The revised edition includes new, on-location footage and information about the final trial. Format: DVD (109 minutes)"
