Scott likes Rubio's push on immigration reform, or at least, that part on border security
Sen. Marco Rubio might be getting flak from some conservatives for helping write and support an immigration reform bill that passed the U.S. Senate last month, but don’t count Gov. Rick Scott among the critics.

Scott, who has his own concerns with shoring up his tea party base, said he’s reviewed the legislation, which passed the U.S. Senate on June 27 by a vote of 68-32. The bill offers up to 11 million illegal immigrants a path to citizenship (not popular with some on the right) while spending tens of billions on border security with Mexico (quite popular on the right).

Asked Tuesday about the plan, which is unlikely to pass the U.S. House, Scott said, in measured language, that it’s the "right thing."

"We need to have a discussion about how we improve immigration," Scott said. "First thing we have to focus on is border security. So I’m glad they’re focused on border security. If we don’t have border security it’s hard to get something accomplished. But I’m glad Sen. Rubio is focused on it."

Asked again if he reviewed the plan and what he thought of it, Scott replied: "I’ve reviewed the plan. He’s doing the right thing. He’s very focused on border security. He’s doing the right thing."

It’s notable that in that brief remark, Scott managed to say "border security" four times. Not once did he mention the other part of the reform plan: the path to citizenship for 11 million.
