Rosie O’Donnell, Debra Messing Among Those Signing Anti-Trump Warning – Variety
Rosie O’Donnell, Debra Messing, Joe Dante, and Ed Asner are among the celebrities who have signed on to an anti-Donald Trump effort calling his pending presidency “illegitimate” and for a month of resistance to stop what it sees as a move toward fascism.

The group RefuseFacism.org published a full-page ad in the New York Times on Wednesday with the headline, “No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America.” The showbiz signatories to the ad also included director Charles Burnett, comedian Margaret Cho, playwright Eve Ensler, musician Wayne Kramer, director John Landis, actor Michael Shannon, musician Michelle Phillips, actor David Strathairn, and director David Zeiger. O’Donnell was not among the names in the print ad, but added her name after its publication, according to Larry Everest, a spokesman for the group.

The group’s initiators include Bill Ayers, jazz musician Ted Sirota, musician Arturo O’Farrill, and Cornel West. In calling Trump’s election illegitimate, it notes that he lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes. Also signing were author Alice Walker and poet Saul Williams.

In the ad, the group calls “on each and every one who opposes what this regime stands for, and what it will do, to take part in and actively build, this resistance and refusal.” The group is calling on protests in the days leading up to the Jan. 20 inaugural, including demonstrations in Washington.
