FACT CHECK: President Donald Trump in a Diaper?
In June 2017, images purporting to be photographs of President Donald Trump in various potentially embarrassing or incriminating scenarios (including one of him in a diaper with various pieces of what appears to be bondage gear behind him) were stealthily dropped and then circulated on social media, along with claims that the images had been leaked by Russian agents:
