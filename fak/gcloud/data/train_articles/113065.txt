Legislation enacted prior to 1958 established PIAs by formula. Thereafter, PIAs were determined by tables. Thus, the formulas shown above for the 1958 Act and later are only approximations to the tabular PIAs.

For years after 1974, the tabular PIAs were increased (subject to certain rounding rules) by automatic benefit increases shown in section J.5. The PIA table was also extended each year to reflect increases in the earnings base (shown in section I).

Approximation formulas for later tables are available in the SSA publication "Annual Statistical Supplement to the Social Security Bulletin." The tables for any year after 1958 are available over the Internet. The address is http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/tableForm.html.

5. Maximum Family Benefit (MFB)





D. AVERAGE INDEXED MONTHLY EARNINGS, PRIMARY INSURANCE AMOUNT, AND MAXIMUM FAMILY BENEFIT, BASED ON 1977 ACT PROVISIONS 1 / 1. Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)

Act 1977 AIME computed using indexed earnings after 1950 and before year of retirement or disability, or year after year of death. Years with highest indexed earnings are used in computing the monthly average, with the number of years of earnings used equal to the number of years elapsed after 1955 (or year aged 26 if later) and before year of death, disability, or age 62. Indexed earnings for a given year equal actual earnings times average wages for second year before death or eligibility to old-age or disability benefit, divided by average wages in the given year, except that for years after the second year before death or eligibility, indexed earnings equal actual earnings. Eligibility defined as attainment of age 62 for old-age benefits, or onset of disability (or age 62, if earlier) for disability benefits. 1980 For DI, the number of years of earnings used equals the number of years elapsed after 1950 (or year aged 21 if later) and before year of disability, minus dropout years equal to one-fifth of that number (to a maximum of 5 dropout years). However, the number of years of earnings used is at least 2. Effective for initial entitlements after June 1980. For DI, persons who receive fewer than 3 dropout years under the one-fifth rule are credited with additional dropout years based on child care, up to a total of 3 dropout years. However, the number of years of earnings used is at least 2. Effective for July 1981.





2. Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

Act 1977 90% of first $180 of AIME, plus 32% of AIME over $180 thru $1,085, plus 15% of AIME in excess of $1,085. Effective for 1979 deaths and eligibilities. 1 / Any general benefit increases occurring in year of death or eligibility or later are applied to the PIA calculated from the formula. For retirees reaching age 62 in 1979-83 and their auxiliaries and survivors, PIA shall not be less than that calculated on December 1978 PIA table (based on provisions prior to 1977 Act), excluding earnings after year aged 61 in computation of AMW, and including any general benefit increases after year aged 61. PIA formulas effective for deaths and eligibilities after 1979 use the same percentages (90%, 32%, and 15%) as the formula for 1979. The dollar amounts of AIME, however, are indexed and are shown in section J. 7. 1981 For retirees reaching age 62 in 1982-83 and their auxiliaries and survivors, December 1978 PIA table modified to reflect elimination of minimum PIA of $121.80 for AMW of $76 or less. 1983 For workers first eligible after 1985 for both retirement or disability benefits and a pension based on noncovered employment, the 90% factor is replaced by 40%. The reduction is phased in by reducing the factor by 10% for each year after 1985 up to the year of first eligibility. For workers with over 25 years of coverage, as defined for special minimum (see Special Minimum below), the factor will not be reduced by more than 10% for each year of coverage under 30. The reduction will not exceed one-half of the portion of the other pension based on noncovered service after 1956 (prorated on basis of years of service). Does not apply to Railroad Retirement pensions or pensions based on service first covered by the 1983 amendments. 1987 Federal employees who elect FERS coverage after December 31, 1987 must have 5 years Federal employment covered by OASDI to be exempt from noncovered pension offset. 1988 Noncovered pension offset factor modified for workers with over 20 years of coverage such that the factor will not be reduced by more than 5% for each year of coverage under 30.





3. Minimum PIA

Act 1977 $122.00. Effective for new eligibles beginning in 1979. Minimum not subject to automatic provisions until earlier of year aged 65 or year of first receipt of benefits. 1981 Minimum eliminated for new eligibles beginning in 1982.





4. Special Minimum

Act 1977 $11.50 per month times "years of coverage" in excess of 10 years, but not in excess of 30 years (maximum of $230.00). A year of coverage is defined as a year with earnings equal to at least 25% of the earnings base through 1978; amount required for a year of coverage for year after 1978 does not include effects of the 1978-81 earnings base increases beyond those resulting from automatic provisions ("old-law" earnings bases; see section J.6). Effective for January 1979. 2 / For years after 1979, the product of $11.50 and the number of years of coverage in excess of 10 is increased by annual automatic benefit increases, as shown in section J.5. Special minimum PIA tables for years after 1978 are available over the internet. The address is http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/tableForm.html. 1990 A year of coverage for special minimum PIA is defined as a year with earnings equal to at least 15% of the "old-law" earnings base. (Factor remains at 25% for determination of noncovered pension offset factor.) Effective for January 1991.





5. Maximum Family Benefit (MFB)

Act 1977 150% of first $230 of PIA, plus 272% of PIA over $230 thru $332, plus 134% of PIA over $332 thru $433, plus 175% of PIA above $433. Effective for 1979 deaths and eligibilities. 2 /, 3 / Any general benefit increases occurring in year of death or eligibility or later are applied to the MFB calculated from the formula. MFB formulas effective for deaths and eligibilities after 1979 use the same percentages (150%, 272%, 134%, and 175%) as the formula for 1979. The dollar amounts of AIME, however, are indexed and are shown in section J.7. 1980 For DI, the smaller of 85% of AIME (but not less than PIA), or 150% of PIA. Effective for initial entitlements (payment of benefits) after June 1980, if eligibility (onset of disability) is in 1979 or later. 1 Applicable only to persons dying or becoming eligible in 1979 or later, where eligibility is defined as attainment of age 62 for old-age benefits or onset of disability for disability benefits. See section C for provisions prior to 1977 Act.

2 Subject to automatic provisions.

3 DI maximum family benefits may also be effective.

Percentage increase rounded to nearest one-tenth percent. PIAs in current-payment status, minimum PIA, and transitional benefits for age 72 and older increased by same percentage. 1973 Increases to take effect in June, based on increase in average CPI for calendar quarter January-March of same year over such average CPI for preceding year. 1977 Special minimum amounts increased by same percentage, beginning June 1979. 1983 1983 increase delayed from June to December.

Act 1972 Earnings base (shown in section I) increased in January, based on increase in average earnings in covered employment for calendar quarter January-March of preceding year over such average earnings for second preceding year. (See section J.3.) Increase effective only if automatic benefit increase effective at same time. Resulting earnings base rounded to nearest multiple of $300. Earnings test amounts increased by same percentage, with monthly amount rounded to nearest multiple of $10.
