Newly released data from the U.S. Census Bureau provides yet another indication of Wisconsin's glacial business-start-up rate.

The latest evidence comes from an extensive database called the Business Dynamics Statistics. It is based largely on administrative records, not surveys, and it offers insight into the life cycle of businesses.

In 2012, the Business Dynamics Statistics data shows, Wisconsin entrepreneurs created 5,757 businesses with employees.

That amounted to 5.8% of the state's universe of employer firms — third lowest among the 50 states.

Rapidly growing Nevada and Florida topped 10%, while Utah, Texas and North Dakota had start-up rates of more than 9%.

The median rate for all 50 states was a bit above 7%.

Except Iowa, all the other Midwestern states had higher start-up rates than Wisconsin. In most cases, though, the difference was less than a single percentage point.

This isn't a new phenomenon. Another data set used by the Small Business Administration, for example, also has pointed to Wisconsin as a long-standing laggard in creating new businesses. The SBA data statistics show Wisconsin ranked near the bottom among the states in the population-based rate of business establishments opened in 2003, 2007 and 2010.

The survival rate of Wisconsin's business establishments, however, stands well above the U.S. average.

Establishments differ from firms, though there is considerable overlap. An establishment is a single location of a firm. Most firms have only one location, but some have many.

Many — but not all — economists view start-ups as a key sign of economic vitality.

A 2010 report from the Kauffman Foundation found that start-ups create most net new jobs in the United States.
