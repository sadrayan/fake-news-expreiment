Billionaire liberal donor George Soros told a close Hillary Clinton ally in 2012 that he regretted supporting Barack Obama over her in the 2008 primaries and praised Clinton for giving him an open door to discuss policy, according to emails released Thursday by the State Department.

In an email to Clinton, Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, recounted a conversation she had while seated next to Soros at a dinner sponsored by the liberal major donor club called Democracy Alliance.

After Tanden informed Soros that she had worked for Clinton during her bitter 2008 campaign for the Democratic nomination against Obama, Tanden wrote that Soros “said he's been impressed that he can always call/meet with you on an issue of policy and said he hasn't met with the President ever (though I thought he had). He then said he regretted his decision in the primary - he likes to admit mistakes when he makes them and that was one of them. He then extolled his work with you from your time as First Lady on."

In 2012, The New Yorker reported that Soros felt snubbed by Obama after trying unsuccessfully to set up a White House meeting with the president. The two eventually met during “a low-profile, private meeting in New York, when the President was in town for other business,” according to the magazine.

Soros is now considered among Clinton’s most important major donors, having contributed $2 million to the pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC Priorities USA and American Bridge 21st Century in the first half of 2015.
