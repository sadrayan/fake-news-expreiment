...our argument is that 7 million will drop their current coverage. Point being that the

people are losing their options and being thrown into exchanges that will not offer the same plans they have now.

Gardner - the point of the senator's argument and the context in which he used this stat both in the Freedom Minute and in his floor speech, refers to the fact that President Obama promised Americans would be able to keep their health plans. According to the facts cited by CBO and others, that is not true. And CBO cites that it is as a result of ACA: "In 2022, by CBO and JCT’s estimate, 7 million fewer people will have employment-based health insurance as a result of the Affordable Care Act" As you noted CBO also cited 12 million, but we went with the lower figure. Page 61, here: http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43907-BudgetOutlook.pdf

The senator has referred to other sources to back up the fact that many Americans will not be able to keep their plan, as originally promised. Specifically a study by McKinsey & Company, which found that thirty percent of employers will definitely or probably stop offering employer-sponsored insurance in the years after 2014. Respondents were asked: "Starting in 2014, there will be state-run exchanges for individuals to more readily purchase medical insurance on their own. Here are some additional facts: [see questionnaire for details] … Given this information, how likely do you think your company would be to discontinue employee health coverage?" On page 163 of the McKinsey survey’s complete results 29.8% say they definitely or probably would. www.mckinsey.com/en/%7E/media/McKinsey/dotcom/US%20employer%20healthcare%20survey/Employer_healthcare_survey-tables.ashx

You mention that more Americans will be insured under Obamacare. That is not the argument the senator is making. It is that Americans were promised they could keep their plan if they wanted and large numbers will not be able to because employers will stop offering them and put many of their employees on exchanges. Please include this information in the article you are writing. Thanks.

The point is that President Obama promised americans they could keep their plans under Obamacare. Millions won't be able to. This isn't an argument over who gets care, it's over who gets to keep their current plan.
