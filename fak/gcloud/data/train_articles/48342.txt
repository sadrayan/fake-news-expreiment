What most distinguishes Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders from other presidential candidates is the fact that heâ€™s a self-identified democratic socialist and represents his state as an independent, not a Republican or Democrat (though he caucuses with the Democrats). Sanders has concerned himself with middle class issues, the growing wage disparity and promoting renewable energy sources. Before winning his Senate seat in 2006, Sanders served in the House of Representatives for 16 years, making him the longest-serving independent member of Congress in history.
