Shropshire police respond to 'tracking key fobs' hoax
The key fobs are said to contain a hidden device that could be used by criminals to track the movements of potential victims.

A post, which has been shared across Facebook, warns people that a detector on the key fob can be used to follow them home.

But West Mercia Police has described it as an "internet hoax".

A message posted on Telford & Wrekin Cops Facebook page reads: "The warning is just a revamped version of a much older hoax that falsely claimed that free sun-powered key holders being handed out at petrol stations contained a hidden device that could be used by criminals to track the movements of potential victims."
