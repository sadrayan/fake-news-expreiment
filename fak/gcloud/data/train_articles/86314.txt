As Republicans Caucus, Obama Campaign Buys Premium Iowa Ad Space : It's All Politics : NPR
President Obama is using Iowa's largest newspaper to get his message across as Republicans compete in the Iowa caucuses, the first-in-the-nation nominating contest.

Obama For America purchased full banner ads across the Des Moines Register's homepage Tuesday. Along the top of the site — above the newspaper's live blog of caucus results with a photo of each of the GOP candidates — was a message from the Republicans' ultimate opponent and a link to an Obama video.

Obama For America / YouTube The Obama campaign links a Des Moines Register.com ad buy to this segment of his 2008 speech on the night of the Iowa caucuses.

The ad — "See How Barack Obama Kept His Promises" — links to the two-minute video featuring Obama's Iowa caucus night victory speech four years ago. The Hawkeye State is particularly important to the president. Iowa ignited Obama's path to the White House in 2008 when he won the state's Democratic caucuses.

On Tuesday night, Obama was to hold a live video conference addressing Democrats participating in their party's Iowa caucuses, asking them to support his 2012 campaign. While Obama has no Democratic opposition, supporters in Iowa still pushed for a major turnout as a rehearsal for the general election.
