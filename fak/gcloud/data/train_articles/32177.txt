Stacey Abrams is running for governor as a Democrat in Georgia and she’s been running as your typical Democrat. Hates Trump. Hates guns. Loves taxes. Loves ignoring immigration law. And so on. As far as the guns go, she even suggested that Georgians might need to turn their guns in if she becomes governor.

Obviously that’s an insane position especially in a place like Georgia but if she’s really worried about guns she might want to check in on her own supporters.

From Western Journal:

Members of the Black Panther Party marched through the city of Atlanta, strapped with assault rifles and brandishing Stacey Abrams campaign signs. Claim Your FREE President Trump Coin In a video posted on the group’s Facebook page on Saturday, members of the Black Panther Party are seen marching through the West End neighborhood of Atlanta in support of Stacey Abrams gubernatorial campaign. As they marched, the Black Panthers carried assault rifles and continually shouted slogans such as “black power” and “power to the people.”

From The Daily Caller:

When reached for comment by The Daily Caller News Foundation, the Abrams campaign forwarded a statement from spokeswoman Abigail Collazo. Her statement did not specifically address the Panthers’ march, but instead attacked Kemp. “Brian Kemp is the only candidate in this race who has posed for pictures with supporters wearing racist, hate-filled t-shirts and refused to denounce them, while Abrams continues to condemn any racist, anti-Semitic, or otherwise discriminatory words and actions,” Collazo said.

That’s nice. Always helpful to have an organization that supports and has carried out the execution of police officers marching with guns to support you.

You think those guys know that Abrams wants to take their guns? Probably not.
