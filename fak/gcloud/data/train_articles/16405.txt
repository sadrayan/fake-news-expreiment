Subject: Hispanic City Council Members

Here are the four I’ve found:

John Trevino

Raul Alvarez

Gus Garcia

Mike Martinez

This is the site in which I found the info: http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/election/search.cfm

Under “Search by Candidate Name” just hit “submit” without entering a name and it will show all the election results by percentage of vote for every candidate going back to the 1800s. No luck yet on finding an extensive list of every council member or appointed members that did not face an election.
