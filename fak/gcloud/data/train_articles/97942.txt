Quarterly report of Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security monthly amounts and related figures
Each year a valid contribution is made to the CPP while a retirement pension is being received, the person becomes eligible for a post-retirement benefit (PRB) in January of the following year and thus can receive more than one PRB. Since the PRB is a supplementary benefit which enhances the retirement benefit, the number of PRBs is not included in the total CPP benefits. This exclusion applies to the Retirement Pension Supplement for the total QPP benefits.
