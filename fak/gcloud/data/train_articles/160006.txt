Thank You #CruzCrew!
Thank you.

Thank you to the more than 317,000 of you who signed up to volunteer with this campaign — who made hundreds of thousands of phone calls, knocked on tens of thousands of doors, and spread the word to everyone you know in person and online. Together we assembled a grassroots army unlike anything seen in modern times.

Thank you to the 900,000+ of you who made over 1.5 million contributions averaging around $60. Together we shocked the political world by raising north of $90 million.

Thank you to the thousands of you who joined our Strike Forces in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Wisconsin, and Indiana. Together we built an unrivaled GOTV operation.

Over the past thirteen months, we built a movement. And make no mistake, that movement will continue as we fight for liberty, fight to restore our Constitution, and fight for Jobs, Freedom, and Security for all Americans.

I’m honored and humbled to have the opportunity to fight alongside each and every one of you to restore that “Shining City upon a Hill” that is the United States of America.

What we’ve accomplished together so far is truly remarkable — and it’s only the beginning.
