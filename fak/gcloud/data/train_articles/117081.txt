Biscuits overdose sends man into a COMA
Food writer Kevin Shalin, AKA The Mighty Rib, was attempting a Man vs Food style challenge to wolf down HUNDREDS of the buttery Cheddar Bay Biscuits at the Red Lobster restaurant.

But rather than finish the challenge in a belly of glory, Shalin instead slipped into a COMA.

He had eaten a whopping 413 of the treats when he was rushed to a hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas, after complaining that he felt dizzy.

The restaurant is famed for the Cheddar Bay Bisuits, which contain 150 calories EACH, and they give them out for free in unlimited amounts with main meals.

Guest Kelly Gee said: "After about 30 I see him over asking the manager what was the record for most biscuits ate.

"He just came back and said 'I think I can do 415', and started really digging in.
