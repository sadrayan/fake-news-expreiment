After abortion, the incidence of any complication is 2.1% and the incidence of major complications is 0.23% in a closed system with data from all sources of care and complete follow-up.

CONCLUSION: Abortion complication rates are comparable to previously published rates even when ED visits are included and there is no loss to follow-up.

RESULTS: A total of 54,911 abortions among 50,273 fee-for-service Medi-Cal beneficiaries were identified. Among all abortions, 1 of 16 (6.4%, n=3,531) was followed by an ED visit within 6 weeks but only 1 of 115 (0.87%, n=478) resulted in an ED visit for an abortion-related complication. Approximately 1 of 5,491 (0.03%, n=15) involved ambulance transfers to EDs on the day of the abortion. The major complication rate was 0.23% (n=126, 1/436): 0.31% (n=35) for medication abortion, 0.16% (n=57) for first-trimester aspiration abortion, and 0.41% (n=34) for second-trimester or later procedures. The total abortion-related complication rate including all sources of care including EDs and the original abortion facility was 2.1% (n=1,156): 5.2% (n=588) for medication abortion, 1.3% (n=438) for first-trimester aspiration abortion, and 1.5% (n=130) for second-trimester or later procedures.

METHODS: Using 2009–2010 abortion data among women covered by the fee-for-service California Medicaid program and all subsequent health care for 6 weeks after having an abortion, we analyzed reasons for ED visits and estimated the abortion-related complication rate and the adjusted relative risk. Complications were defined as receiving an abortion-related diagnosis or treatment at any source of care within 6 weeks after an abortion. Major complications were defined as requiring hospital admission, surgery, or blood transfusion.

With 1.1 million induced abortions in the United States each year,1 accurate estimates of abortion complications are paramount to assess and improve quality of care and determine how public policies can most effectively safeguard women's health. Although national abortion-related mortality data exist for the United States,2 no surveillance system captures abortion-related morbidity. Studies find varying complication rates3–7 depending on the procedure, weeks of gestation, length of follow-up, and protocols used to detect complications. Furthermore, complication rates are underestimated by low follow-up rates.5,7–9

Published complication rates are considered incomplete because they usually do not include those diagnosed at sites other than the original source of care.10 Limited research focuses on emergency department (ED) use when examining postabortion care. Because the abortion care delivery system is concentrated in urban centers maldistributed across states,1 women often travel to obtain abortion care. Thus, women are likely to seek postabortion care at an ED near their home.

Using state Medicaid data, we examine reasons for postabortion visits, contributing to the literature on ED use among patients with public insurance.11,12 Then, using a standardized methodology for identifying and classifying complications, we estimate the incidence of postabortion complications diagnosed, treated, or diagnosed and treated at all clinical sites to see whether the rate of complications in a closed system with complete follow-up differs from the rates found in other studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We used patient-level billing data from Medi-Cal, California's State Medicaid program. Medi-Cal provides pregnant low-income women immediate, temporary Medicaid coverage. California is one of 17 states that covers abortion and subsequent care for women enrolled in Medicaid. In 2011 an estimated 512 facilities in California performed 181,730 abortions,1 approximately 51% of which were covered by Medi-Cal.13

The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of California, San Francisco and the California Health and Human Services Agency.

Medi-Cal is administered on a fee-for-service or managed care arrangement, split approximately in half across the two. Only the fee-for-service billing records contain complete information for care provided to a particular beneficiary; therefore, we received data only for those beneficiaries with fee-for-service coverage. We obtained billing records for every fee-for-service beneficiary who had an abortion in 2009 and 2010 and all billing records for all clinical encounters for each of those beneficiaries up to 6 weeks after the abortion. Each clinical encounter results in multiple (

=12) billing records; thus, we acquired 659,361 records.

Data included an encrypted beneficiary identification number, date of birth, race or ethnicity, city, state, zip code, date(s) of service, type of facility, diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision [ICD-9] codes), procedure or treatment (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes), facility type, and amount paid per treatment. For each abortion, we calculated the beneficiary's age and urban or rural residence (determined by zip code).

Abortions were identified using Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes (59840–59841, 59850–59852 and 59855–59857, X7724, Z0336); these codes also indicated the abortion type: 1) “medication abortions,” which includes use of mifepristone and misoprostol up to 9 weeks of gestation; 2) “first-trimester aspiration,” which includes both manual and electric aspiration abortions as well as dilation and curettage “in the first 12–14 weeks of gestation”14; and 3) “second-trimester or later procedures.” Included in this latter category are medical and surgical abortions performed using multiple abortion techniques such as dilation and evacuation, with or without osmotic dilators and misoprostol as well as full or partial inductions used “after 12–14 weeks of gestation.”14 The billing data that we had did not allow us to make a determination of weeks of gestation nor the specific technique used.

We searched for additional claims made to Medi-Cal up to 6 weeks after the abortion for each abortion identified. Postabortion ED visits (not including urgent care) within 6 weeks were identified using codes associated with ED use (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes: 99281–99285, and Z7502). Clinically trained reviewers evaluated all available billing data (including all ICD-9 and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System or CPT procedure codes) for each beneficiary who had an ED visit and assigned the visit to one of three categories: 1) not abortion-related; 2) not abortion-related but for a concurrent problem (diagnosed, treated, or diagnosed and treated at the time of the abortion); and 3) abortion-related. An ED visit was classified as abortion-related based on the constellation of ICD-9 and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System or CPT procedure codes for that visit. For example, in many cases, it was a combination of an ICD-9 code for an abortion, postabortion complication, or abdominal pain that indicated that the visit was abortion related along with a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System or CPT procedure code for a pregnancy test, pelvic examination, transvaginal ultrasonography, abdominal ultrasonography, or dose of misoprostol.

Each abortion-related visit was then classified as 1) woman received an abortion-related diagnosis, treatment, or both; or 2) woman presented with abortion-related symptoms such as abdominal pain or cramping but received no pathologic diagnosis or treatment. When ED visits took place for multiple reasons, only the reason most closely related to the abortion was recorded (Fig. 1).

Additionally, we identified all ambulance transfers (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes: X0030, X0034, X0036, X0400, X0402, X0412) and all self-referred ED visits on the day of the abortion regardless of whether the visit resulted in an abortion-related diagnosis or treatment.

The process of identifying and classifying abortion complications involved several steps. We defined a complication as any postabortion adverse event that received an abortion-related diagnosis or treatment at any source of care, including EDs and the original abortion facility within 6 weeks of an abortion procedure. To identify complications, the clinically trained reviewers evaluated all: 1) abortion-related diagnoses and treatments identified through the ED visit analysis described previously (excluding visits having no pathologic diagnosis or treatment); 2) ICD-9 codes that indicate abortion-related complications (635.00–635.82) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System or CPT codes for laparoscopy, laparotomy, and hysterectomy surgeries (49000, 49320, 49329, 58150, 58578, 58960), blood transfusions (86970, P9016–P9021, P9048, 390), and antibiotics commonly used to treat abortion-related infections and sepsis at least 1 day after the abortion; and 3) subsequent medication abortions and aspirations within 6 weeks.

The reviewers examined each case identified through this process and applied a systematic classification scheme developed by several of this study's authors and used in a recent study of abortion safety.3 The classification system comprised a list of known abortion complications with standard definitions that included specific criteria (signs, symptoms, laboratory findings) to indicate the complication diagnosis. To validate the system, first, outside experts who work with the U.S. Agency for Health Research & Quality Evidence-Based Practice Centers and from abortion-related research or service delivery reviewed the classification system. Second, a Data and Clinical Safety Monitoring Committee reviewed incident data to further clarify complication definitions and criteria.

For this study, the clinician reviewers categorized each identified case into one of seven diagnoses: incomplete abortion, failed abortion, hemorrhage, infection, uterine perforation, anesthesia-related, and other or undetermined. The clinically trained reviewers examined all available billing data for the beneficiary, including laboratory tests ordered and medications, to validate each diagnosis. For example, to confirm a diagnosis of failed abortion, they checked for additional confirmatory evidence such as codes for aspiration or prenatal care. For diagnoses of hemorrhage, the reviewers looked for treatments such as aspiration, Methergine, or blood transfusion. One diagnosis category was assigned per abortion; when the billing records indicated more than one diagnosis, the highest level diagnosis was selected. Cases identified based on subsequent medication abortion, misoprostol dose, or aspiration within 6 weeks of the initial abortion without any ICD-9 code indicating a complication were categorized as “other or undetermined.” Cases with the ICD-9 code “635.8 Abortion with unspecified complication” were also categorized as other or undetermined. To produce the most conservative estimate, we included undetermined diagnoses in the overall complications estimate.

Each complication was then classified as receiving one of six treatment categories: no treatment, medication (including mifepristone and misoprostol, misoprostol alone, or other medications), uterine aspiration, both medication and aspiration, other treatment, or undetermined. Abortion-related complications were classified as major if they required hospital admission (vendor codes 50, 60), surgery, or blood transfusion with all others classified as minor.

The data analysis was done in several steps. Using Stata 13, first we described the sample characteristics: age, race, residence, abortion procedure type, facility type, and year of abortion. Second, we estimated ED visits on the day of the abortion and within 6 weeks and present reasons for visits. Third, we estimated the abortion-related complication rate by the sample characteristics and the relative risk of a complication adjusted for all other characteristics using a generalized linear mixed model that accounts for lack of independence between multiple abortions by the same woman and those performed by the same health care provider; P values were determined from z tests derived from the model. Women who had missing data for any characteristic were retained in the model. Fourth, we compared major and minor complications by abortion procedure type using Pearson χ2 tests. Finally, we described complication diagnoses by abortion procedure type and treatment. The abortion was the unit of analysis because 8.3% (n=4,165) of women in the data set had more than one abortion. Statistical significance was set at P<.05 for all comparisons; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported.

RESULTS

Among the 659,361 records received, we identified 54,911 abortions among 50,273 fee-for-service Medi-Cal beneficiaries in 2009 and 2010. The largest proportions of women were ages 20–29 years, Hispanic, urban, had a first-trimester aspiration abortion, and were seen at an outpatient clinic (Table 1).

Among all 54,911 abortions, one in 1,036 (0.10%, n=53) were followed by an ED visit on the day of the abortion, including 1 of 5,491 (0.03%, n=15) transferred by ambulance for immediate care, although not all resulted in an abortion-related diagnosis or treatment.

Among all abortions (N=54,911), 1 of 16 (6.4%, n=3,531) was followed by an ED visit within 6 weeks of the abortion. Of these, 49.8% (n=1,758) were unrelated to the abortion, 9.4% (n=332) were conditions unrelated to but concurrent with the abortion, and 40.5% (n=1,431) were abortion-related. Among abortion-related visits, two thirds (66.6%, n=953) were cases in which a patient presented with abortion-related symptoms but did not receive a pathologic diagnosis or treatment. Thus, 1 of 115 (0.87%, n=478) abortions resulted in an ED visit receiving a diagnosis, treatment, or diagnosis and treatment. Among all abortion-related ED visits (n=1,431), 21.8% (n=770) followed a medication abortion, 64.2% (n=2,266) followed a first-trimester aspiration abortion, and 14.0% (n=495) followed a second-trimester or later procedure (Table 2).

Among all abortions (N=54,911), 1,156 (2.1%, 95% CI 1.99–2.23) resulted in an abortion-related complication diagnosed or treated at any source of care, including EDs and the original abortion facility. The unadjusted complication rate was 5.2% (n=588) for medication abortions, 1.3% (n=438) for first-trimester aspiration abortions, and 1.5% (n=130) for second-trimester or later procedures. Adjusted results indicate that women ages 30–39 years were 1.20 (95% CI 1.02–1.40) times as likely to have a complication compared with women ages 20–24 years, and Hispanic women were significantly less likely to have a complication compared with white women. Medication abortions were 5.96 (95% CI 5.11–6.94) times as likely to result in a complication as first-trimester aspiration abortions. Women receiving abortion care at hospitals or physician's offices or groups were significantly more likely to have a complication than women receiving care at outpatient clinics (Table 1).

The rate of major complications among all 54,911 abortions was 0.23% (95% CI 0.19–0.27) (n=126, 1/436), 0.31% (n=35) among women who had medication abortions, 0.16% (n=57) among women who had first-trimester aspiration abortions, and 0.41% (n=34) among women who had second-trimester or later procedures (Table 3). Among all women, 0.20% (n=108) were admitted to hospitals, 0.02% (n=13) had surgery, and 0.09% (n=50) received blood transfusions (data not shown). These three categories are not mutually exclusive; some women were admitted to a hospital and had surgery, received a blood transfusion, or had surgery and a blood transfusion.
