Indiana is committed to providing all children access to quality educational opportunities. Indiana's Choice Scholarship Program, commonly referred to as the voucher program, (authorized under IC 20-51-1 and IC 20-51-4) provides scholarships to eligible Indiana students to offset tuition costs at participating schools. Students must satisfy both household income requirements and student eligibility criteria to qualify.

Participating schools and interested parents work together to enroll students and to submit Choice Scholarship applications to the Indiana Department of Education. Schools and parents should explore the links below for more information.
