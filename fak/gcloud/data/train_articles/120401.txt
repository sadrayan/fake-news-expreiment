"Fried chicken" Oreo flavor is fake, company says
By of the

The "fried chicken" Oreo flavor that's been making the viral rounds today on various food blogs and media sites is fake. It's a hoax -- and a good example of how quickly rumors can spread on social media.

Rumors of the potential of a "limited edition" fried chicken Oreo flavor has the web buzzing (see this post on Foodbeast Wednesday).

That's partly because of an image of a bag of such supposed fried chicken Oreos posted by Instagram user Moorestyle10. She claimed to have seen it on Facebook Monday. (As the Plain Cheese pointed out, the photo appeared to be made up.)

But a PR person confirmed on behalf of the company, in a response to an inquiry by the Public Investigator Thursday, that the fried chicken flavor doesn't exist.

"The flavor you are referring to is in fact not real," said Lindsay Kaplan, a Weber Shandwick employee, wrote in an email to the Public Investigator Thursday.

You can't blame people for thinking the fried chicken flavor might be real, though: In addition to more traditional flavors such as chocolate Oreos and mint Oreos, there's a series of new Oreo flavors such as cookie dough Oreos, berry Oreos, lemon Oreos, marshmallow crispy Oreos and peanut butter Oreos.

But alas, the fried chicken flavor? Not so much.
