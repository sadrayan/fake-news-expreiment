WASHINGTON, July 15 (UPI) -- The White House said Thursday that former U.S. President George H.W. Bush would lead the U.S. presidential delegation to the 2004 Athens Olympic games.

Bush will be accompanied as members of the delegation by his wife, former first lady Barbara Bush, and their grand-daughters, Barbara and Jenna Bush.

Former U.S. tennis champion Chris Evert and U.S. Ambassador to Greece Thomas Miller will be members of the delegation along with Faye and Alex Spanos, the owner of the San Diego Chargers football team. The games, which begin August 13, are being held in Athens to commemorate the revival of the olympiad as an international amateur athletic competition in 1899.
