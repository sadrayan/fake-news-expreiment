“That’s for the Ethics Committee to review,” Pelosi told NBC’s “Meet the Press” when asked if she believes the allegations.

“We are strengthened by due process,” she added.

Pelosi also called Conyers an “icon in our country.”

“He has done a great deal to protect women — Violence Against Women Act, which the left, right-wing is now quoting me as praising him for his work on that, and he did great work on that,” she said.

“As John reviews his case," she added, "I believe ... he will do the right thing.”

Conyers last week acknowledged that he settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015, but denied the sexual harassment accusations made against him.

The House Ethics Committee said last week that it has opened a probe into the allegations against Conyers, which include accusations of unwanted sexual advances.

Pelosi in the interview on Sunday called for an end to nondisclosure agreements that prevent sexual misconduct accusations from coming to light.
