Orange County school board changes what qualifies as 'F' grade - FOX 35 News Orlando
It's an intense debate over school grades in Orange County. The question is how low should they go?

On Tuesday night, the Orange County School Board decided the lowest "F" score a student can get at the end of a quarter or semester should be a "50" and not a zero. Critics call it inflating grades. Supporters say it will give struggling students a chance to succeed.

The district's Pupil Progression Plan says "50" is the lowest "F" grade a middle school or high school student can receive for a quarterly grade or an end of semester grade. That's in sharp contrast to a zero being the lowest "F" grade.



Supporters say a "50" is still an "F," but if a student gets tutoring, they might be able to raise their grades and pass by the end of the school year.



Orange County School Board Member Joie Cadle supports having "50" as the minimum "F" grade.



She says, “We do not want our children dropping out of school. At some point if the hole is so deep that you cannot dig out of it. Why try?”



Critics call the "50" minimum "F" score inflating grades. They claim some students will game the system and do just enough work to get by.



Cindy Hamilton is a concerned parent. She says, “I agree in some cases with our chair in that students need to work for what they're going to get in regards to their grades.”



Hamilton also believes teachers should have had more input in the new "F"grade decision.



Some teachers say a "50" minimum "F" grade takes autonomy away from them, that it should be their right to assess a student's performance and give them a grade from zero to 100.



The school board clarified the "50" minimum "F" grade is for quarterly grades and end of semester grades, but it does not pertain to day to day homework assignments or individual projects.
