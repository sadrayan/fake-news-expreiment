ATTENTION PLEASE: For a fact-check that will appear online nationally and internationally, I continue to seek Chick-Fil-A’s analysis of the claim by Sen. Cruz this week that Facebook shut down a Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day.

Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Cruz, has provided this web link to a Huffington Post account along such lines.

What more can you tell us today?

Thanks,

To clarify: CFA Appreciation Day, which was years ago, was not initiated by the company. It was initiated by a former TV host. We did not organize the event referenced in this week’s news cycle.

Kind regards,

Jackie

What’s your company title?

Also, does that day repeat annually or not at all?

Just to clarify, CFA was not the organizer. It is my understanding this event happened only one time a number of years ago.
