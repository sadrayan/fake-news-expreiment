What US Ambassador said about 2019 election after meeting Governor Wike
United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Stuart Symington, has said that the forthcoming elections will define the future of the country.

Symington, while addressing journalists after meeting with the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, at the Government House, Port Harcourt, declared that all institutions of government must do what is right.

“All of the institutions of government must do what is right. An election is not a matter of life and death.

“It is a matter of defining the future of Nigeria. There must be free, fair and credible elections.

“I am quite confident that on election day, the sons and daughters of the powerful will not be out there causing violence,” he said.

On the campaigns, he charged the electorate to always ask their political leaders, to outline ways through which they would actualize their promises.
