Let's all eat trafe for Chanukah! - NancyKay Shapiro
A holiday scene:The Place: Balducci's , today.Personae: Me, shopping for low-carb food.Action: I'm sort of staring at the meat display, lots of salamis and sausages, and then various hams. And the hams' price signs have all been tagged with festive PERFECT FOR CHANUKAH banners. Which I blinked at for a couple of secs, trying to decide if this was an example of truly monumental cluelessness or ... nah. It's just the Department of Monumental Cluelessness, Well-Meaning Division.Photos taken at the Balducci's on 8th Ave at 14th Street, on Sunday, 12/2.: As of Tuesday morning 12/4, the hams are now tagged with green "Perfect for the Holidays!" signs.: If you're tickled by the Ham for Chanukah pic, visit my store at cafepress.com , where you can get it on a mug, or on greeting cards (stock up now for next year!).
