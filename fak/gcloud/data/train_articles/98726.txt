Today, an entire province is in mourning after the death of a nine-year-old girl who rose above and raised tens of thousands of dollars to help others, all the while she was battling cancer.

Nevaeh Denine, the young girl who started a lemonade stand to help raise money for children with cancer, has passed away.

Denine turned nine years old on July 27, and hosted this year’s Lemonade Stand just one day later in Paradise Park.

She was diagnosed with neuroblastoma at an early age, and started her lemonade stand to raise money to help children diagnosed with the disease.

Her aunt, Barb Denine Evans, told VOCM Open Line with Darrell Power that Nevaeh was watching the Janeway Telethon when she said to her mom that she would like to have the biggest, best lemonade stand ever. Denine Evans says the stand was Nevaeh’s idea, and that it will live on.

She thanked everyone for all the condolences, but says they’re not able to respond to all of them at this time.

Denine Evans says there were difficult times even before the cancer diagnosis, as Nevaeh’s father died before she was even born.

Her father, Joey Poole, passed away from cancer. Nevaeh’s mom was five months pregnant with her at the time.
