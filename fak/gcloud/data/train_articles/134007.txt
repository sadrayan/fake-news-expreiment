A review on the legislative aspect of artificial fruit ripening
The South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. No unified policy on fruit cultivation, preservation, and distribution exists within these countries. As artificial fruit ripening using calcium carbide poses greater threat to human health, most of the SAARC countries have banned the use of calcium carbide as an artificial fruit ripening agent [5, 11, 13, 16, 33].

In India, the use of carbide gas for fruit ripening is prohibited under Rule 44 AA of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules 1955 [34]. Moreover, the Food Safety and Standards Regulations, 2011, explicitly prohibits the selling of fruits, which are artificially ripened by carbide gas [11]. In addition, selling unsafe food is punishable under Sects. 50 and 59 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 [35].

In Bangladesh, the laws and acts on fruit ripening and marketing include Bangladesh Pure Food Ordinance (Amendment) Act 2005 that originated from the Bangladesh Pure Food Ordinance, 1959, Agricultural products Market Act 1950 (revised in 1985), The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution Act, 1985, The Plant Quarantine Act 2011, The Mobil Court Act 2009, Bangladesh Consumer Protection Act 2009, and The penal code of Bangladesh, Formalin Control Act 2014 [36]. According to the Bangladesh Pure Food Ordinance (Amendment) Act 2005, a new section, 4A, has been introduced that proposes the formation of a National Food Safety Advisory Council (NFSAC), which will advise the Government regarding food safety. Section 6A of the ordinance prohibits the sale of any food in which chemicals such as calcium carbide, formalin, pesticides (DDT, PCBs oil, etc.) have been used [13]. The Mobile Court Act 2009 gives magistrates the authority to impose maximum sentence of 2 years to anyone who is found guilty of illegal usage of artificial fruit ripening agents [37], and to penalize the person right on the spot.

The food laws in Pakistan are similar to those in Bangladesh. In Pakistan, the primary law related to food is the ‘West Pakistan Pure Food Ordinance, 1960’ [38], which is to some extent similar to the East Pakistan Pure Food Ordinance, 1959, now amended as Bangladesh Pure Food Ordinance (Amendment) Act 2005. Section 6 of this law deals with adulterated food items and is applicable throughout Pakistan (except the cantonments) with minor regional changes. Like Bangladesh, the cantonment areas in Pakistan are governed by Cantonment Pure Foods Act 1966 [39]. The offenses under these acts are classified as first offense, second offense, and repeated, large, or serious offense. The punishments include fine and/or imprisonment [39].

In Sri Lanka, under the Food Act No 26 of 1980, no person can manufacture, sell, or distribute food that has any natural deleterious substance added upon it which are injurious to health [15].

In Nepal, Part 7, rule no 19(d) of The Nepal Food Regulation 2027 strongly prohibits the use of carbide gas in fruit ripening [5, 16].

South Asian Regional Standards Organization (SARSO) Headquartered in Dhaka, Bangladesh, South Asian Regional Standards Organization is responsible for harmonizing national standards of SAARC member states and for developing SAARC standards on common products of interest [41, 42, 43]. To date, the organization has identified 28 common products for harmonization of standards; however, fruit and fruit-related products are not on the list [42]. SARSO can be used as a platform for issuing a single list of artificial fruit ripening agents that should be banned in the whole South Asia region.
