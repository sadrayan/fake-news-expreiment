Republican Party of Florida Sets 2016 Florida Presidential Primary as “Winner-Take-All”
Today, the Republican Party of Florida’s Executive Board set new rules for the allocation of Florida’s 99 Delegates to the 2016 Republican National Convention as “Winner-Take-All.”

“The road to the White House runs through Florida,” said Blaise Ingoglia, Republican Party of Florida Chairman. “This now confirms that the road to the Republican nomination for President will run through Florida as well.”

“With Florida’s immense size and diverse population, any campaign that can mount a successful state-wide effort in Florida will be well positioned to run a truly national campaign come 2016. Florida will now be the first winner-take-all primary in the country, this ensures that all presidential campaigns will have to spend a considerable amount of time in Florida speaking to Republicans from Pensacola to Key West and everywhere in-between.”

Background:

Florida’s legislature moved Florida’s Presidential Preference Primary date to March 15th during the 2015 Regular Session. The state parties are then required by RNC Rule to decide how to allocate their delegates to the National Convention. Delegates are allotted to states per RNC Rules.
