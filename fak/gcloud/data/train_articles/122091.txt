MealTickets is a powerful new campaign that sees Action Against Hunger partner up with the live music industry. And it’s brilliantly simple: £1 from each event ticket goes straight towards saving the lives of malnourished children across the world.

We're pleased to be partnering with Action Against Hunger to launch this life-saving campaign for the charity at our only UK gig in November 2018.

For music-lovers, it’s only a small thing; but for those they help, it’s a massive deal. It means access to clean water, food, training and healthcare. And ultimately, it means that entire communities can be free from hunger, helping the charity move closer to achieving its aims to end hunger by 2030.

Music has always been a compelling medium; but now, if every ticket for every concert in every country gave that extra £1, it could change the future for millions of children.
