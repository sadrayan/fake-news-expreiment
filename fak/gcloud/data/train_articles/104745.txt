The infamous comic posted the bizarre offer on twitter ahead of Tuesday’s vote, saying “I promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan Collins and 2 million to senator jeff flake… if they vote NO.”

Luckily for O’Donnell neither official decided to change their vote at the last minute, sending the GOP-led tax overhaul to President Trump’s desk well ahead of their Christmas deadline.
