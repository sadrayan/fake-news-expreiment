Statement by FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras on the Do Not Call Registry Decision Announced Today

The Federal Trade Commission today announced that it will not remove any telephone numbers from the National Do Not Call Registry for telemarketers, based on the five-year registration period, pending final Congressional or agency action regarding whether to make registration permanent. We made this decision in response to consumer concerns regarding this popular program.

When the Registry was developed in 2003, the five-year registration period was a reasonable way to ensure that the list remained accurate and up-to-date. Our experience since then in building, maintaining, and enforcing the Registry has led the Commission to re-examine its original position on re-registration. The FTC will continue to ensure the Registryâ€™s integrity and effectiveness moving forward, and will maintain the strength of its privacy protections for the benefit of the American people.
