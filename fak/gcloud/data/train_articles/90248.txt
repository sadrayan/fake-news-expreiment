Rob Portman Statement Regarding President Obama’s Stimulus Rally in Columbus, Ohio
COLUMBUS, OH – U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman issued the following statement today regarding President Obama’s visit to Columbus, Ohio, to promote a failed stimulus that has not resulted in the promised job creation and lower unemployment:

“I welcome President Obama to Columbus, and I hope he brings with him new ideas for creating the jobs Ohio needs turn our economy around. Today we learned that Ohio created just 300 private sector jobs last month, and Ohioans are still suffering through a historic economic crisis. They’re looking for real leadership, not the same failed policies that have resulted in the loss of nearly 400,000 Ohio jobs in the last three years.

“While we can expect Lt. Gov. and Ohio Job Czar Lee Fisher to once again tout the $800 billion big government stimulus package enacted last year, I doubt we will hear him acknowledge the nearly 150,000 jobs lost since the program was enacted. Washington’s current policies of higher spending, record deficits, big-government health care and new energy taxes are destroying our chances for real economic recovery. Washington’s status quo that Lt. Gov. Fisher enthusiastically supports is not working. In fact, just the opposite is needed: we need to stand up against Washington’s dangerous big-government agenda and start taking the steps necessary to put Ohio and our nation back on the path to prosperity.”

BACKGROUND

While Lt. Gov. Fisher Is Cheerleading For The Obama Administration’s Stimulus Plan, Franklin County And Ohio At Large Have Seen Jobs Leave The State:

Ohio Has Been Awarded $7.5 Billion In Stimulus Funds And has Received $1.7 Billion Of Those Funds To Date. (www.recovery.gov, Accessed 6/16/10)

But Ohio Has Lost Nearly 150,000 Jobs Since The Stimulus Was Enacted. (“Ohio Labor Market Information,” Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services Website, http://lmi.state.oh.us, Accessed 6/16/10)

And Ohio Has Lost Nearly 400,000 Jobs Since Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher Took Office. (“Ohio Labor Market Information,” Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services Website, http://lmi.state.oh.us, Accessed 6/16/10)

Franklin County Has Been Awarded $2.5 Billion In Stimulus Funds. (www.recovery.gov, Accessed 6/16/10)

And Yet Franklin County Has Seen Steadily Rising Unemployment Since The Enactment Of The Stimulus, With Unemployment Rising From 7.9% In April Of 2009 To 9.3% In April Of 2010. (“Ohio Labor Market Information,” Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services Website, http://lmi.state.oh.us, Accessed 6/16/10)

Ohio Has Only Added 300 Jobs Via The Private Sector Over The Last Month; 16,800 Of The 17,100 Job Created Were Temporary Census Workers. “Ohio’s nonfarm wage and salary employment advanced 17,100 over the month, from 5,035,400 in April to 5,052,500 in May, according to the latest business establishment survey conducted by ODJFS. Service-providing industries increased 10,500 to 4,240,300. The hiring of temporary census workers helped boost government 16,800. Other sectors with increased employment were leisure and hospitality (+4,000) and financial activities (+1,300). Educational and health services (-5,800), other services (-2,500), trade, transportation, and utilities (-2,400), and professional and business services (-900) declined over the month. The workforce in information was little changed. Goods-producing industries, at 812,200, advanced 6,600. An increase in durable goods (+5,900) exceeded a decrease in nondurable goods (-1,100) to add 4,800 jobs to manufacturing. Also up were construction (+1,700) and mining and logging (+100).” (Ohio Department Of Jobs And Family Services, Press Release, 6/18/10)

Fisher Has Incorrectly Praised The Stimulus Again And Again, Despite The Fact That Ohio Has Lost Jobs Since The Stimulus Was Enacted:

Fisher Said That He Believes The Stimulus Has Been “Helpful” And “Good.” “I happen to believe that the stimulus has been helpful, has been good, it is the money that has gone out too slowly, not too much of the money perhaps has been directed to job creation or job retention, but it also provided the largest tax cut in America in history for the middle class.” (Lee Fisher Q & A, City Club Podcast, www.cityclub.org, 2/23/10)

In August, 2009, Fisher Said He Saw The Stimulus “Working” Despite Climbing Unemployment. “Fisher said that despite that trend and the climbing unemployment rates both locally and statewide, he sees the stimulus working, pointing to the most recent national jobs report.” (James Pilcher, “Workforce Exec: Economy ‘Bottoming Out,’” Cincinnati Enquirer, 8/12/09)

In October 2009, Fisher Claimed The Stimulus Had Caused “Many Positive Things.” “‘But I do know positive things that already have happened,’ Fisher said.” (Joe Hallett, “Stimulus Legacy Less Tangible Than WPA,” The Columbus Dispatch, 10/18/09)

In February 2010, Fisher Claimed The Stimulus Helped Create Jobs. “It also saved the jobs of teachers and firefighters and police men and women around Ohio and around this country. Ah, it has stated infrastructure projects that has the advantage of having short term jobs and long term infrastructure that helps the back bone of our economy.” (Lee Fisher Q & A, City Club Podcast, www.cityclub.org, 2/23/10)

But That Same Week, Fisher Flip-Flopped And Criticized The Stimulus Package Passed By Congress. “Fisher criticized the stimulus package passed by Congress for not boosting hiring at a faster pace. He said President Barack Obama should redirect the unspent stimulus money to infrastructure and home weatherization programs that will lead to new jobs immediately.” (Mark Naymik, “Fisher Airs Plan To Spur Job Creation,” The Plain Dealer, 2/23/10)
