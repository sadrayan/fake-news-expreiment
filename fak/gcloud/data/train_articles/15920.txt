Below please find some backup information regarding the passing of the tax package in the Senate.

First - Looking back at history of taxes and fees since 1972 from the Comptroller there are only three previous tax packages that have even topped $1B so for simplicity I will just address those specifically. All three of those address property tax, which as you know is a local tax not a state tax. So on its surface right there no other state tax cut in the history of Texas even approaches what the Senate passed with SB 7 and SB 8 (combined total of $2.476 billion)

To go into more detail, according to the above noted comptrollers report, below are the three passed tax cuts larger than $1B (description taken directly from report):

· In 1997 HB 4 "Raising the homestead exemption from $5,000 to $15,000, yielding $1.04 billion in local property tax relief."

· In 1999 SB 4 "SB 4 provided $3.8 billion in local school funding and property tax relief. In addition to making possible a $3,000 statewide teacher pay raise, this bill granted $1.4 billion in local school district property tax relief for 2000-01."

· In 2006 HB1 "established a procedure to phase in over two years a reduction in the average school district maintenance and operations tax rate, first to $1.33 per $100 of taxable value in fiscal 2007, and then to $1.00 per $100 of taxable value in fiscal 2008. This bill generated an estimated General Revenue-related cost of $3.9 billion in fiscal 2007 and $18.8 billion in the 2008-09 biennium."

o However in analyzing HB1 one must also consider HB2, HB3, HB4, and HB5 passed as part of the tax swap:

o "HB 2 created the Property Tax Relief Fund to receive certain new revenues for the purpose of reducing school property tax rates. As such, the bill allocated to the new fund the tax revenue attributable to the revenue gains (defined as the amounts above what would have accrued had current law remained in effect) from the changes implemented by HB 3, HB 4, and HB 5. By itself, this bill had no direct fiscal impact. "

o "HB 3 made substantial changes to the Franchise tax, affecting not only the types of entities subject to the tax, but also how the tax is calculated. Before the changes made in HB 3, only businesses organized as corporations or limited liability companies were subject to the tax. HB 3 extended the tax to other business entities, including limited partnerships, certain general partnerships, business trusts, and other legal entities. Sole proprietorships, gener­al partnerships directly owned only by natural persons, and passive entities remained exempt from taxation. Before the changes made in HB 3, a taxpayer calcu­lated tax liability as the greater of 4.5 percent of Texas-ap­portioned earned surplus, or 0.25 percent of Texas-appor­tioned capital. HB 3 eliminated both the earned surplus and capital bases and replaced them with a firm’s “taxable margin,” defined as total revenue less the greater of: cost of goods sold, or total compensation. The tax rate on mar­gin apportioned to Texas was set at 1 percent for most tax­able businesses, with a half-rate of 0.5 percent applicable to businesses in retail or wholesale trade. In addition, HB 3 made changes to the small business exemption provisions of the tax. Before, a business with less than $150,000 in total gross receipts or a tax liability of $100 or less owed no tax. HB 3 increased the exemption levels to $300,000 in gross receipts and $1,000 in tax liability. Finally, HB 3 required combined reporting for tax­payer groups with common ownership in those situations where group members are engaged in a unitary business. Before HB 3, franchise taxpayers had to report on a sepa­rate-entity basis. The franchise tax provisions of HB 3 applied to reports due after January 1, 2008. HB 3 made $6.8 billion in General Revenue–related funds available for school property tax relief in the 2008-09 biennium."

o "HB 4 established, effective October 1, 2006, a stan­dard “presumptive value” for the purpose of determining the amount of Motor Vehicle Sales and Use tax due on private-party sales of used motor vehicles. This bill made $30.6 million in General Revenue-related funds available for school property tax relief in fiscal 2007 and another $85.1 million in the 2008-09 biennium."

o "HB 5 raised the Cigarette tax rate by $1.00, making the rate $1.41 per pack, and raised the Cigar and Tobacco Products tax rate on tobacco products other than cigars to 40 percent of the manufacturer’s list price from the former rate of 35.213 percent. Effective January 1, 2007, HB 5 made $431.7 million in General Revenue related funds available for school property tax relief in fiscal 2007, and another $1.4 billion in the 2008-09 biennium."

Even if one is to count property tax relief in the determination, it has been widely reported, including by Politifact, this was in large part a tax swap, not a straight tax cut. Further it has also been reported that the property tax cuts, while well intended, in practice amounted to at best a tax slowdown rather than a true tax cut.

Politifact noted in 2010 that:

· In 2006, the Legislature passed and Perry signed a tax overhaul that was intended to reduce property taxes paid to school districts. To help offset the revenue lost by the districts, lawmakers restructured the state’s business tax and raised the cigarette tax.

· We found that the total amount of local property taxes paid by Texans — to all the different taxing entities — actually rose nearly 5 percent from 2005. When all was said and done, taxpayers paid $1.6 billion more in 2007.

· The first was a provision in the 2006 tax overhaul that gave school boards the option of voting to raise the maintenance and operations rate by a few cents for enrichment purposes. By 2007, more than 1,000 Texas school districts had done so, according to the TTARA report. That lessened the impact of the mandatory 33 percent rate reduction in those districts.

· Summing up: In the debate, Perry failed to accurately characterize the tax cut passed in 2006 and its impact on Texans. Total property tax collections rose, not fell. And though it's estimated that Texans did receive significant tax savings compared with what they would have paid without the cuts, those savings were probably closer to 20 percent than 33 percent.

Further in 2013 Politifact wrote:

· Then again, school property tax collections ultimately increased partly because districts had leeway to inch up their rates over the years and benefited, in many cases, from increasing property values.

· The taxpayer association identified other reasons that the overall reduction in property taxes did not meet expectations: increases in the portion of school taxes dedicated to bond debt, as well as increases in taxes paid to cities, counties and other taxing districts.

Below is a chart from the Comptroller showing only in 2007 was there are total reduction in property tax revenues. In that year there was a $2.043 B decrease in property tax revenues for school districts. By 2008, the tax revenues increased above the original 2006 level. Ignoring the increases in subsequent years, the 2007 tax cut of $2.043 B is still smaller than what the Senate passed if you annualize the $4.6 billion (adding property tax in this calculation to try and compare apples to apples).

· At best, the argument behind the 2006 tax swap is that it is a reduction from future tax increases, or tax slowdown, not a true tax cut. This point is even noted by the 2008 TTARA report that 2010 Politifact article referenced as supporting claims to the size of the 2006 tax package: “The average Texans’ property tax bill may not be lower today than it was two years ago, but it is unmistakably much, much lower than it would have been.”

· Additionally any tax cuts, or reduction of increases, were largely offset by new and increased taxes or fees.

o Tax increases from just the franchise tax alone were:

§ Year 2008: $4.451 B

§ Year 2009: $4.420 B

§ Year 2010: $3.857 B

§ Year 2011: $3.932 B

§ Year 2012: $4.565 B

§ Year 2013: $4.799 B

Additionally, here is a news report that referenced the package stating: "The measure now goes to the full Senate, where it is expected to pass. If approved, it would be the largest tax cut in Texas history."

Last, I know you mentioned to only include information in our possession at the time of the statement, but I thought you would find it relevant to include a commentary piece written by the Texas Public Policy Foundation that also makes the same assertion: “It’s encouraging to see valuable strides to boost the Texas model’s success were taken recently by the Texas Senate with the passage of a $4.6 billion tax relief package that would be the largest tax cut in the state’s history.” … and again in another commentary here: “There is a lively discussion going on at the Texas Capitol over how best to provide meaningful, lasting tax relief to Texans statewide. If proposed tax cuts pass both houses, this could be the largest tax relief in the state’s history.”

Again, I hope this is helpful. In the process of your research if you have any follow up questions please let me know.

Best,
