Clinodactyly means that your child has an abnormally bent or curved finger. It is typically caused by abnormal growth and development of the small bones of the finger. It is estimated to affect about 10 percent of the general population to varying degrees.

Clinodactyly can be an inherited condition and may present as a part of an associated syndrome. A significant percentage of people with Down syndrome, for example, have clinodactyly.

The exact incidence of this condition is unknown, in part because there is no precise definition of what level of curvature is normal and abnormal. It tends to be present more commonly in boys and usually affects the small finger; it is unusual to have it on both hands.
