She grew up in Florida and Michigan, the daughter of migrant laborers. Once she graduated from university with her nursing license she worked in Detroit’s Henry Ford Hospital before moving to Portland in 1974 for the weather.

She worked as a nurse, and then got a job as a TriMet bus operator in 1981. She also married and raised children of her own, as well as 11 foster children. Her daughter currently works at TriMet, as did her husband, now retired.
