BREAKING: Trump Invokes 25th Amendment to Expel Nancy Pelosi for Mental Health Reasons
President Trump and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have decided the time has come to bust open the Bill of Rights and use everything in their power to defend themselves against the Democrats and the fake news press.

That includes invoking the 25th Amendment, written to give those in power the right to police their own. According to Article 5 of the sacred document, written by Ben Franklin in 1788:

“Sub-section 34: No member of Leadership, be it the President, Vice President, Speaker of the House or Senate Pro Tempore, is exempt from mental health evaluation and concern. In particular we pay attention to dementia and the over-use of the poppy, absinthe or cannabis. Upon unanimous vote of the Cabinet, that leader shall be replaced by the next in the line of succession.”

In this case, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is next in line to be Speaker, but only if Trump can pull it off.

White House Propaganda Director, Art Tubolls, says the vote is in the bag and the next in line is ready to go:

“We’re standing at a critical juncture. If we allow these people to just rule a chamber of the Congress based on their popularity or many votes they can ger, we may as well be living on Facebook. Do we save Nancy if she gets enough heart reacts? The answer is no. Power in this country was given, in full, to Donald Trump when he won the biggest landslide victory in history and became the most popular president of all time.”

Trump could technically just keep removing people until he was the only one left with a vote on anything. Maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad thing. How much do we really get to decide anyway?

President Trump has proven he can be trusted. Give him his country and step aside.
