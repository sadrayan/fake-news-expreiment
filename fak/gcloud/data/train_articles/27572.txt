Trends in Foster Care and Adoption
The report and data visualization below present national estimates related to children who experience time in foster care and who are adopted from the foster care system, relative to each Federal Fiscal Year shown. As states are permitted to resubmit AFCARS data, estimates may change over time. This reflects all AFCARS data received as of August 10, 2018 related to AFCARS reporting periods through September 30, 2017.

The national dataset and state data tables are available for download as well.
