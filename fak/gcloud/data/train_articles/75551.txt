Extremist �Constitutional Sheriffs� Meet With Senators, Their Supporters Call for Obama�s Lynching

From SPLC's Hatewatch Blog:



In one of the spacious meeting rooms of the Russell Senate Building in Washington, D.C., last month, three conservative members of Congress had an unusual meeting with a small group of law-enforcement officers who ascribe to far-right �constitutionalist� theories.



CSPOA-SenateU.S. Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and David Vitter, R-La., and Rep. Martha Blackburn, R-Tenn., all met with former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, the far-right former lawman from Graham County, Ariz., who now leads the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA), a group of �constitutionalist� sheriffs who see themselves the last line of defense against those who would seek to infringe on the U.S. Constitution.



Originally billed in the National Review as a �massive gathering� of sheriffs from around the nation to protest immigration, the event was organized by two sheriffs who are active leaders in former Mack�s CSPOA and drew a much smaller crowd. And while CSPOA promoted the event and reported on it afterward, Mack told Hatewatch that it was not the chief organizer.

Just down the Capitol Mall that same day, a small group of protesters supporting the sheriffs gathered at the White House and began shouting slogans and demanding the removal of President Obama. Some in the crowd demanded the president be lynched��Hang the lying Muslim traitor!� one of them shouted.
