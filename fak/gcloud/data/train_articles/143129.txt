Donald Trump Ends School Shootings By Banning Schools
“Sometimes the best solution is the simplest”, said the president of the US.

Washington, D.C — The president of the United States has decided to put an end to school shootings by attacking the root of the problem: schools. He is going to ban all schools so there won’t be any school shootings.

“We have a total disaster. Kids are dying in these shootings. It’s time to stop talking and doing something, and I’m gonna do something, believe me.”, said Trump in a press conference. He kept going: “If there are no schools, there will be no school shootings. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it.”

With this, shooters will have nowhere to go and will probably shoot themselves.

“This is a great step into making our country great again. Believe me”.

Some people disagree with this. They’re asking what will happen with the country’s education. Trump replied to those critics by saying: “Some things need to be sacrificed for a greater good, believe me.”
