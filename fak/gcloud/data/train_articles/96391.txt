On the floor of the Senate, Dick Durbin argued that global warming is evaporating Lake Michigan and the rest of the Great Lakes.

“Lake Michigan, when measured just a few weeks ago, was at its lowest depth than in any measured time in recent history,” Durbin said. “What we’re seeing in global warming is the evaporation of our Great Lakes. It’s a scary thing to think about what this will ultimately do to us.”

Durbin said there are some who want to run away from this, but he said their war on science is short-sided.
