Clayton County police officer laid to rest following deadly crash
Friends, family and hundreds of police officers came to Divine Faith Ministries in Jonesboro to remember a police officer who died on duty in Clayton County.

Police say Clayton County police Officer Darryl Wallace went off Tara Boulevard and hit a tree Sunday night.

Police say Wallace was responding to a prowler call when the accident happened. Wallace, who was alone in the police cruiser, had his lights on.

"Officer Wallace will be remembered for his selfless and dedicated service to the community and fellow officers," the department said in a statement.

A line of mourners viewed Wallace before services began. Channel 2 Action News spoke to several family members before the service. They described Wallace as a really good kid who loved people and serving his community. They said he died doing what he was meant to do.

"The love. The love, just the love and the smile I’ll always remember the smile he had from the time he was a little boy running around in the yard playing,” said Gladys Arnold, the officer's aunt.

Other officers from the metro and from as far away as Athens and Columbus came to attend the funeral.

They were here to support each other, as well as Clayton County officers who worked closely with Wallace. His shift commander says many of his fellow officers will be back on duty Friday afternoon.

"And we have to press on and continue in his memory because this is what he loved to do. And we all have to continue this job. It's going to be with heavy hearts today,” said Clayton County Police Lt. William Ibarondo.

The officer had been with the department approximately one year.
