Generic Downloader.ab is detection for this Trojan that downloads other malicious files. It may also spread via removable drive and creates an autorun.inf in all the system drives.

Upon execution, the Trojan get injects with explorer.exe and it tries to connects to the below IP address through a remote port 53.

The Trojan creates files in the below location:

[System Drive]:\WINDOWS\Kb85lOl9.log

: [RemovableDrive]\autorun.inf

[System Drive]:\autorun.inf

And the Trojan drops an autorun.inf file into the root of all removable drives and mapped drives in an attempt to autorun an executable when the drive is accessed.

The file "AutoRun.inf" is pointing to the malware binary executable, when the removable or networked drive is accessed from a machine supporting the Autorun feature, the malware is launched automatically.

The autorun.inf is configured to launch the Trojan file via the following command syntax.

[autorun]

OPEN=rundll32.exe Pagefi1e.sys,RunDll

shell\´ò¿ª(&0)\command=rundll32.exe Pagefi1e.sys,RunDll

shell=´ò¿ª(&0)

The following registry key values have been added to the system:

HKey_Current_User\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce Rundll32 MSGM.DLL,ServiceMain

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The detection for Generic Downloader are for several specific trojan variants, so this description is meant as a general guide. This detection is for trojans which are intended to retrieve and execute files from a remote server. This file will then be automatically executed on the infected machine. The nature of the remote file may vary. As the presence of these trojans and remote files are discovered, sites hosting these files are frequently taken down, so the downloading may cease to function as expected. This may result in empty, 0 byte files or HTML error messages being downloaded instead, or the remote file simply not being downloaded at all.

As new trojans are frequently added to this detection, users are recommended to use the latest engine/DAT combination for optimal detection. Variants are likely to be packed with a PE packer, so enabling the scanning of compressed files will also provide optimal detection.

Exact details (filenames, Registry keys, file size) will vary between variants.

Typically this downloader variant will install itself and/or the remote file into the Windows or System directory, and hook system startup via a Registry key such as:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\

The following Registry keys are also added:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{AECE402B-3DC8-5CF2-E20A-

AA3872D92E43}

AA3872D92E43} HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{AECE402B-3DC8-5CF2-E20A-

AA3872D92E43}\Data

AA3872D92E43}\Data HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{AECE402B-3DC8-5CF2-E20A-

AA3872D92E43}\LocalServer

Additionally a file may be dropped in the %Windows% or \Documents and Settings\administrador\Configurações locais\Temp\ directory.
