Welcome
Dear Neighbor,







My name is Montgomery Elmer and I’m running to be your next State Senator in the 1st Senate District. My family, friends, and patients call me “Monk,” and I hope you will too.







Many of you are hearing about me for the first time, as I travel the district talking to you and your neighbors about my Prescription for Progress for northeastern Wisconsin.







I'm a career doctor, not a career politician and have spent over 20 years caring for the people of our area. I also serve as President of the Kimberly School Board where I am fighting to keep our quality of education high while controlling costs and protecting taxpayers.







Please take a moment to browse this site to learn about me and my ideas to support the hard working families in our



communities.







Sincerely,







Monk Elmer, M.D.
