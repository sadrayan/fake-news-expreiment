“UNLV is honored to be the site for the final 2016 presidential debate, as we believe it will bring a unique energy to one of the most diverse campuses in the country. A core mission of a university is to educate future leaders and having the final presidential debate will allow students to experience the political process first-hand and better understand how public policy impacts their lives.”
