Overrepresentation of Blacks in Iowa
I co-founded the Prison Policy Initiative to put the problem of mass incarceration — and the perverse incentives that fuel it — on the national agenda. Over the last 15 years, our campaigns have protected our democracy from the prison system and the poorest families in this country from the predatory prison telephone industry . Our reports untangle the statistics and recruit new allies.But now, more than ever, we need your help to put data & compassion into the conversation. A group of donors will match the first $80,000 we can raise. Will you help us meet this goal?Thank you.—Peter Wagner, Executive Director Donate
