Cybersecurity Incident & Important Consumer Information
Consumers who have been impacted by the March 1, 2018 announcement will be notified by U.S. Postal mail. The Equifax customer care team will NOT be able to tell you if you’ve been impacted. Additionally, the “Am I Impacted” tool on this site does not reflect consumers who have been impacted by the March 1 announcement.

For all other consumers, if you have a U.S. Social Security number, you can see if your personal information has been impacted by cybersecurity incident by clicking the “Am I Impacted” tool on this website.
