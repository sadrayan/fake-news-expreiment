First responders want state to restore local-government funding
When the state budget faced a major financial crisis two years ago, Ohio police and fire leaders say they understood that local governments would join in the pain and take hundreds of millions in budget cuts.

When the state budget faced a major financial crisis two years ago, Ohio police and fire leaders say they understood that local governments would join in the pain and take hundreds of millions in budget cuts.

But the leaders of the state�s police and firefighters unions are a lot less forgiving this year, as lawmakers work with a budget surplus so large that they are proposing a $1.4 billion tax cut for business owners.

While Republicans have proposed modest increases in state funding for local governments in each of the next two years, union leaders say total funding is still $200 million less over two years than the current budget � and that doesn�t include roughly $250 million a year cities are losing through the elimination of the estate tax.

�The only ones now sharing the pain are local governments,� said Jay McDonald, president of the Ohio Fraternal Order of Police. He noted that since 2010, the number of local-government employees in Ohio has decreased by 29,200. A number of cities, he said, are seeking tax increases just to maintain the status quo.

�We believe in fairness. We believe that government is supposed to work for all Ohioans, not just for politicians and their contributors,� McDonald said. �When you force local governments to choose between eliminating vital services and seeking new tax revenue, we believe that is fundamentally unfair.�

If local governments had received their traditional percentage of the state general-revenue fund, it would mean nearly $1.4 billion more for local governments between 2012 and 2015, McDonald said. The proposed two-year budget, which is set for a Senate vote next week, would provide $364 million for local governments next year and $376 million in 2014.

The fund was nearly $700 million in 2003.

�We have all made sacrifices, and now it�s time to restore so that local governments aren�t taking the brunt of these budget cuts,� said Mark Sanders, president of the Ohio Association of Professional Fire Fighters.

McDonald said Republicans are refusing to even discuss the issue of local funding.

�We give a lot of continued support to local governments,� said Senate President Keith Faber, R-Celina. �This has been part of the ongoing discussion. Local governments are going to have to manage.�

Local-government funding makes up a small percentage of the budgets of political subdivisions, Faber said. �This seems to be more of a flash than substance about local-government budgets and spending.�

McDonald said the cuts are a big deal, noting that Ohio is gripped by a heroin epidemic and Ohioans are not seeing less need for safety forces.

�When you lose people, you lose services,� McDonald said. �As Ohio rebounds economically, local governments are left behind.�
