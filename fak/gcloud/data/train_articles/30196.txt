This Man Dug A Tunnel To The Pub Using A Spoon—Updated
We messed up. The story is a hoax, and we fell for it. We’re really sorry. Original story follows.

2. Omagh County Court heard how plumber Patsy Kerr has spent the last five years visiting his local pub via a secret tunnel under his house.

Kerr spent 15 years building the tunnel using everything from spoons to a heavy-duty boring machine. The most incredible part of this story, though, is that his wife remained none the wiser throughout.

“The wife has a bad snore on her,” Kerr told Tyrone Tribulations. “After watching The Shawshank Redemption on RTE one night in 1994, I decided to do something about it so I waited til she was in a deep sleep and then set about digging a hole under the bed in the direction of the pub.
