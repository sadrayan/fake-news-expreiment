Kamala Harris' desk, in the office of the district attorney of San Francisco, has to be the cleanest desk in her department of 300. The wood is polished, with one piece of paper on it.

Q:How do you pronounce your name?

A: You are the only person that's ever asked me that. Thank you. Either think of it as "comma-la" or "calm-ala."

Q:What's your latest project?

A: I'm running for attorney general (in 2010). I really want to do that job. There are initiatives that we've created here in San Francisco that have reduced recidivism significantly to the point that our initiative Back on Track has been chosen as a national model for D.A. offices around the country. That's the kind of work we should be doing throughout the state.

Q:Will your opposition to the death penalty help or hurt you?

A: I will enforce and uphold the law. I think 4 out of the last 9 elected attorneys general felt the same way I do, including the current one.

Q:What neighborhood do you live in?

A: South of Market, in a loft.

Q:Who do you live with?

A: Me, myself and I.

Q:Have you ever been married?

A: Not officially.

Q:What book is on your nightstand?

A: I have two books. One is "Eat, Pray, Love" which is about the journey of this woman through these different phases. I love to eat, I love to cook. The other book, which is in stark contrast to that, is about the evolution of violence in American streets, called "Fist Stick Knife Gun."

Q:How much time do you have to cook?

A: My favorite recent cookbook is Alice Waters' "The Art of Simple Cooking." I have taken on Julia Child recipes, for example, but you have to dedicate about two or three days to those. Alice Waters, in this latest cookbook, you can go to the grocery store or the farmers' market, pick up a few basic things and make a beautiful stew or whatever.

Q:Favorite neighborhood restaurant?

A: Coco500, Town Hall and Boulette's Larder down at the Ferry Building. Everything is fresh, fresh, fresh, and seasonal and they do these meatballs that are just exquisite and melt in your mouth.

Q:If your loft were on fire and you could only grab one thing, what would it be?

A: Probably a photograph of me and my mother (breast cancer researcher Dr. Shyamala Harris). She passed away a couple of months ago. She was 70.

Q:When you were a kid, what did you want to be?

A: A lawyer. They were the heroes growing up. They were the architects of the civil rights movement. I thought that that was the way you do good things and serve and achieve justice. It was pretty simple.

Q:Where did you grow up?

A: In Berkeley and in Oakland and in Montreal. My mother took a position doing research at the Jewish General Hospital and teaching at McGill University.

Q:What time do you get up in the morning?

A: About 6 a.m. I go to my neighborhood gym with a hoodie on and the hood is up because I'm not a morning person. I get on the treadmill and walk very fast at an incline and I switch the channels between CNN, local news and MTV. I go for 35 minutes.

Q:Last vacation?

A: A few days last summer in Martha's Vineyard.

Q:Regrets?

A: About that trip? None (laughs).

Q:What is on your iPod? Newest addition?

A: I have everything from reggae to jazz to the Beatles. Love hip-hop. My newest addition is this remake of Al Green songs. I don't know what it is called.

Q:Never without?

A: My cell phone. I have three - office, personal and political. I have one that I can never turn off and if it rings between about 10 at night and 6 in the morning it's never a good call.

Q:Motto?

A: A saying my mother had, "You may be the first, but make sure you're not the last."

Q:Lesson learned in love?

A: Communicate, whatever the subject.

Q:Is this the cleanest office of any attorney anywhere?

A: I knew you were coming and didn't want you looking at all my stuff (laughs).
