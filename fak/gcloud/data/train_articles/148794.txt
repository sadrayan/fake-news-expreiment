The chairman was directed to transmit a copy to the Speaker of the House. The Committee on Government Reform has conducted a year- long investigation of the actions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense with regard to the standoff which occurred at the Mt. Carmel Center outside Waco, TX, from February 28, 1993, through April 19, 1993, as well as actions taken after the tragic end of the standoff. I. Why the Committee Conducted This Investigation From July 26 through August 1, 1995, this committee's Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal Justice and the Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime held joint hearings on all aspects of the Federal Government's role in the 1993 tragedy at the Mt. Carmel Center, a religious community about 10 miles northeast of Waco, TX.\1\ On August 2, 1996, the committees released a joint report.\2\ Major findings of the report included: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ ``Investigation Into the Activities of Federal Law Enforcement Agencies Toward the Branch Davidians (Part 1),'' hearings before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Committee on the Judiciary and the Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal Justice of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, 104th Cong., 163 (1995). \2\ H. Rept. No. 104-749. LThe BATF's investigation of the Branch Davidians was --------------------------------------------------------------------------- incompetent. LThe affidavit filed in support of the ATF's arrest and search warrants included knowingly false statements. LThe BATF fraudulently claimed that the Branch Davidians were producing methamphetamine, in order to obtain non-reimbursable and prompt military support. LThe BATF's military-style raid was deeply flawed, in concept, in planning, and in execution. LThe decision to end the standoff on April 19, 1993, was ``premature, wrong, and highly irresponsible.'' \3\ The possibility of a negotiated end should have been further pursued. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ Id. at 4. LPresident Clinton should have accepted Attorney --------------------------------------------------------------------------- General Reno's resignation. LThe committees found no evidence that the FBI discharged firearms or set the fires, either intentionally or inadvertently, on April 19, 1993. LThe actions of the military, including the National Guard, did not violate the Posse Comitatus Act. It was the committees' understanding that on April 19, 1993, the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team used only two means to insert CS gas into the Branch Davidians' residence: spraying devices attached to the booms of M-728 Combat Engineering Vehicles \4\ and plastic, non-pyrotechnic ferret rounds fired from 40mm M-79 grenade launchers.\5\ This understanding was consistent with the public statements of Attorney General Janet Reno in 1993 and with the position of the Department of Justice until 1999. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\ Id. at 68. \5\ Id. at 69. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Attorney General Reno, along with other Department of Justice and FBI officials, had been emphatic in their public statements about the means by which the HRT inserted gas into the Branch Davidian residence. Before the House Committee on the Judiciary, on April 28, 1993, Reno stated in a prepared statement that, ``I wanted, and received assurances that the gas and its means of delivery were not pyrotechnic'' \6\ At the same hearing, FBI Director William Sessions' prepared testimony stated that ``[o]ne critical factor [in formulating the plan] was that CS gas could be used without pyrotechnics. It will not start or contribute to a fire.'' \7\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ ``Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas,'' hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 16 (Apr. 28, 1993) (statement of Attorney General Janet Reno). \7\ ``Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas,'' hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 85 (Apr. 28, 1993) (statement of William Sessions, former FBI Director). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sometime in 1998, an independent filmmaker, Michael McNulty,\8\ obtained permission to review the physical evidence collected at the scene of the tragedy, which was then in the custody of the Texas Rangers Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety. McNulty found pictures taken by the Texas Rangers during the week after the April 19, 1993, fire which portrayed at least one expended M-651 projectile, a military CS gas projectile that uses pyrotechnic means to expel gas. On June 14, 1999, Senior Captain Bruce Casteel, Chief of the Texas Rangers, directed Ranger Sergeant Joey Gordon to review the evidence, particularly any evidence that pyrotechnic rounds may have been used.\9\ The chairman of the Texas Public Safety Commission, James B. Francis, first raised questions in public about the use of pyrotechnic rounds to the Dallas Morning News in an article published July 28, 1999.\10\ A retired senior FBI agent, Danny Coulson (who also founded the FBI Hostage Rescue Team) confirmed to the Dallas Morning News on August 24, 1999, that pyrotechnic rounds had been used.\11\ Committee staff also traveled to Texas, interviewed Texas Rangers, and examined the physical evidence in attempt to ascertain whether the pyrotechnic rounds had been used. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ McNulty was a producer of ``Waco: The Rules of Engagement'' (Fifth Estate Productions, 1997) and ``Waco: A New Revelation'' (MGA Films, 1999). \9\ ``Texas Rangers Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Investigative Report Branch Davidian Evidence'' (September 1999) (exhibit 1). \10\ Lee Hancock, ``DPS Head Raises Questions About Davidian Fire,'' the Dallas Morning News, July 28, 1999 (exhibit 2). \11\ Lee Hancock, ``2 Pyrotechnic Devices Fired at Davidians, Ex- official Says,'' the Dallas Morning News, Aug. 24, 1999 at A1 (exhibit 3). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to the newly-revealed possibility that FBI use of pyrotechnic rounds may have contributed to the fire, allegations surfaced regarding the active participation of the military in the April 19, 1993, assault and regarding the possibility that videotapes filmed on April 19, 1993, using aerial Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology, depicted government agents firing weapons. Also, a report issued by the General Accounting Office on August 26, 1999, called into question certain findings of the 1996 committee report with respect to the military's support of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms prior to their February 28, 1993, raid.\12\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \12\ ``U.S. General Accounting Office, Department of Defense: Military Assistance Provided at the Branch Davidian Incident'' (GAO/ NSIAD/OSI-99-133, Aug. 26, 1999) (exhibit 4). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The 1996 joint report concluded that the BATF misled the Defense Department as to the existence of a drug nexus in order to obtain non-reimbursable support in a prompt manner from the Defense Department. While there had been allegations that a drug manufacturing operation was located at the Davidian residence at some point in the mid to late 1980's before Koresh took control of the group, there was no evidence that the drug operation continued into late 1992. The committee's investigation was limited to resolving these new allegations, thereby building on, but not replacing, the report issued in 1996. We have found no reason to revise the major findings of the 1996 report. II. How the Committee Conducted This Investigation In September 1999, the committee issued document subpoenas to the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the White House. Over the course of the committee's investigation, committee investigators reviewed and analyzed over 1 million pages of documents. Committee attorneys interviewed 20 representative members of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team who were involved in the standoff, along with military personnel, numerous senior Justice Department and FBI officials, and surviving Branch Davidians. In September 1999, the committee retained a FLIR analyst, Carlos Ghigliotty, to analyze flashes that appeared on the FLIR tapes taken on April 19, 1993, that were alleged to be gunfire. On October 6, 1999, the Washington Post published an article in which Ghigliotty was quoted stating that he ``conclude[d] that the FBI fired shots on that day.'' \13\ According to the article, Ghigliotty's conclusion was based on his review of both visual-range and FLIR videotapes.\14\ On October 12, 1999, Ghigliotty examined the original FLIR tapes at an FBI lab and supervised the creation of first generation copies. Beginning in December 1999, Ghigliotty prepared a list of all of the questionable thermal flashes he detected on the four FLIR tapes taken on April 19, 1993.\15\ Ghigliotty died in the spring of 2000 without having submitted to the committee a scientific report on the flashes. The Maryland Medical Examiner reported that his death was caused by cardiac arrhythmia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\16\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \13\ David A. Vise and Richard Leiby, ``Expert Concludes FBI Fired Shots During Waco Siege,'' the Washington Post, Oct. 6, 1999 at A6 (exhibit 5). \14\ Id. \15\ The final version of the list Carlos Ghigliotty provided the committee is attached as exhibit 6. \16\ ``Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, State of Maryland, Post Mortem Examiantion Report No. 00-2354-027 on Carlos Ghigliotty'' (Apr. 28, 2000) (exhibit 7 on file with the committee). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In December 1999, the committee retained a second FLIR analyst, Dr. Don Frankel of Photon Research Associates, Inc. On September 11, 2000, Frankel submitted a report to the committee concluding that the flashes analyzed by him on behalf of the committee do not depict gunfire.\17\ His report is discussed in detail in Section IV of this report. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \17\ Donald S. Frankel, Photon Research Associates, ``Assessment of Waco, Texas FLIR Videotape'' (Sept. 11, 2000) (exhibit 8). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- III. Findings The committee has reached the following conclusions as a result of its investigation: A. THE EVENTS OF APRIL 19, 1993 LAerial Forward-Looking Infrared videos filmed on April 19, 1993, include flashes around the Mt. Carmel Center that at first blush resemble muzzle blasts. Careful scientific analysis of the flashes does not, however, appear to support allegations that these flashes are the result of gunfire. Analysts who submitted reports to both this committee and the Office of Special Counsel reached similar conclusions: that the flashes they were asked to examine appeared to be solar or other thermal reflections emanating from debris. However, the analyst retained by this committee reported that an overhead FLIR camera of the type used by the FBI on April 19, 1993, would not record every muzzle flash occurring within its field of view. Therefore, while the flashes that have generated such controversy do not appear to represent gunshots, it is within the range of possibility that gunshots may have occurred that were not captured by the FLIR camera. This conclusion is bolstered by the March 21, 2000, FLIR reenactment performed at Ft. Hood, TX. LEvery FBI agent interviewed by the committee has denied discharging any weapons (other than for the delivery of CS gas) on April 19, 1993, or knowing of any gunfire from government sources. This committee has uncovered no evidence to contradict these claims. LThere is no evidence that HRT snipers stationed at a house (designated the Sierra One sniper position) across the Double EE Ranch Road from the compound fired shots on April 19, 1993. Shell casings recovered at the house by the Texas Rangers have been tested by the Office of Special Counsel and matched weapons used by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on February 28, 1993. LThe operations plan approved by Attorney General Janet Reno called for a gradual, section-by-section, insertion of CS gas over the course of 2 days, followed by ``deconstruction'' of the building if the Branch Davidians had not surrendered after 48 hours. Nonetheless, on the morning of April 19, 1993, the HRT punched large holes in the walls of the building, drove M-728 Combat Engineering Vehicles deep into the building, and destroyed one-half of the gymnasium on the Black side of the building. LAt approximately 8 a.m. on April 19, 1993, HRT member David Corderman, after obtaining authorization from HRT commander Richard Rogers, fired either two or three pyrotechnic M-651 rounds in an attempt to insert gas in an underground tornado shelter on the Green side of the Center.\18\ Corderman had fired non-pyrotechnic ferret rounds at the shelter's tarpaper and plywood roof, but they had failed to penetrate it. Although HRT leadership was aware of the possibility that HRT personnel might need to use M-651 rounds, they failed to include the contingent use of M-651 rounds in the operations plan they sent for approval to the Attorney General. They also failed on April 19, 1993, to obtain authorization for this deviation from higher up the chain of command. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \18\ The FBI designated the front of the Center, which faced southwest toward the Double EE Ranch Road, the ``White side,'' the side of the Center facing roughly southeast toward Elk Road the ``Red side,'' the side of the Center facing roughly northwest toward the Perry Ranch and beyond towards Old Mexia Road the ``Green side,'' and the rear of the Center the ``Black side.'' These designations are used throughout this report. LA Texas Department of Public Safety photographer took pictures of an expended M-651 projectile during the crime scene investigation after the fire. The projectile was never logged into evidence by the Texas Rangers or FBI, and numerous searches have failed to locate this expended projectile. b. failure to disclose the use of pyrotechnic tear gas rounds LDepartment of Justice attorneys William ``Ray'' Jahn, LeRoy Jahn, and William Johnston, who were responsible for prosecuting the surviving Davidians, learned in 1993 that HRT personnel had sought and received approval to fire the M-651s. They did not disclose these facts to the criminal defendants, to the Congress in 1995, or by her account, to Justice Department civil trial defense attorney Marie Hagen. The Jahns and Johnston arguably had a legal and ethical duty to disclose these facts. Had they done so, the considerable time and resources that have been devoted to uncovering these facts now would not have been expended. LFormer HRT Commander Richard Rogers approved the use of pyrotechnic M-651 rounds on April 19, 1993. He sat silently behind Attorney General Reno and former FBI Director William Sessions during the 1993 House Judiciary Committee hearings as they stated under oath that no pyrotechnic device had been used by FBI personnel on April 19, 1993. Rogers claims that he was distracted at the time. c. the justice department internal review LAttorney General Reno failed to ensure that the ``vigorous and thorough investigation'' ordered by the President and promised by Reno occurred. The Scruggs investigation was negligent and was improperly rushed to its conclusion solely for political purposes. A thorough investigation in 1993 would have saved time and resources later incurred to discover the truth. LHad Scruggs and his colleagues conducted a ``vigorous and thorough investigation,'' they would have discovered the truth regarding: (a) the use of the pyrotechnic M-651 rounds; (b) the role of active duty Army special operations personnel during the 51-day standoff; and (c) FBI Special Agent Riley's statement regarding gunfire from an HRT sniper position. LPressure from senior Justice Department officials, including then-Deputy Attorney General Phil Heymann, caused the Scruggs team to rush to conclude their investigation and to publish their report, thus failing to uncover and disclose facts which could have fully accounted for the allegations made in the civil trial and disclosed in the fall of 1999. LAll of the actions taken by the Justice Department were consistent with an organization that was not eager to learn the full truth about what happened on April 19, 1993. This is made clear by the fact that the original FLIR tapes made on that day sat unanalyzed in an FBI office for 6 years. LThe committee recommends that in the case of future tragedies of the scale and importance of Waco, an outside and independent investigation should be commissioned to preclude the kind of negligence that occurred in 1993 and to obviate the need for subsequent congressional and other investigations. d. the role of the military LThe committee uncovered no evidence that any member of the armed services present at Waco, including the National Guard, violated the Posse Comitatus Act. Representatives from the U.S. Special Operations Command were present, but the available evidence indicates that they acted only as observers and technicians. LRelations between civilian officials and the military with regard to Waco were characterized by disregard of the Posse Comitatus Act on the part of the civilians, and by diligence on the part of the military. Two senior Army officers were asked to evaluate the FBI's proposed operations plan for April 19, and consistently refused to do so, as such support would have made them direct participants in planning the arrest of the Branch Davidians, and would have therefore violated the Posse Comitatus Act. LTwo senior Army officers were asked to review the FBI's proposed operations plan and attend a briefing with Attorney General Reno on April 14, 1993. While Attorney General Reno has stated that these officers told her the FBI's plan was ``excellent'' in one case, and ``sound'' in another, both officers have clearly stated they were careful not to evaluate the plan during the meeting. President Clinton and Attorney General Reno have deceived the American people for over 7 years by misrepresenting that the military endorsed, sanctioned or otherwise approvingly evaluated the plan. IV. Further Analysis of the Events of April 19, 1993 a. development of the operational plan 1. Emergency Plans During the 51-Day Standoff On February 28, 1993, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) attempted to serve a search warrant on the Branch Davidian religious community near Waco, TX, and an arrest warrant on the community's leader, David Koresh. That raid ended in tragedy, as four BATF Special Agents and six Branch Davidians were killed in an ensuing gunfight. The flaws in the conception, planning and execution of the BATF raid are well documented in the 1996 joint report of the Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime and this committee's Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal Justice.\19\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \19\ H. Rept. No. 104-749. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the aftermath of that failed raid, the Treasury Department requested that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assume command of the situation. The FBI deployed its Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), a full-time counterterrorist unit based at the FBI Academy at Quantico, VA, along with part-time Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams from various FBI Field Offices and hundreds of other Special Agents and support personnel. HRT assumed tactical command of the site on March 1, 1993, and began deploying its members to various positions around the compound. Upon arrival at an incident site, HRT commanders, as standard procedure, formulate an emergency plan for approval by the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) in overall command of an incident.\20\ Soon after arriving in Waco, HRT commanders developed emergency plans to deal with various contingencies, including the possibility that the Davidians would attempt suicide. The first such plans were oral, and were later committed to writing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \20\ Interview with Richard Rogers, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge and Commander, HRT, FBI, in Phoenix, AZ (Aug. 9, 2000). In 1993, the SAC of the FBI Field Office within which a critical incident occurred was in overall command of the incident. In 1995, the FBI created the Critical Incident Response Group, which assumed responsibility for management of critical incidents. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the early versions of HRT's emergency plans, in the event of a mass suicide attempt by the Davidians or under similar circumstances, HRT personnel would have attempted to disable those inside by firing non-pyrotechnic ``ferret'' rounds from M-79 40 millimeter grenade launchers \21\ through the doors and windows. Ferret rounds are plastic projectiles with stabilizing fins containing 25 grams of CS, a type of tear agent, suspended in a liquid solvent.\22\ Upon impact, the front of the round ruptures, releasing its contents. Ferret rounds are often used to deploy CS gas indoors or in areas where flammable materials are present, because there is little risk of fire from the round. Another type of CS gas round in HRT's inventory at Waco was the M-651, or ``military'' round. Inside the M-651's metal projectile, a fuse ignites a chemical mixture a short time after the round is fired, propelling CS gas from its base.\23\ The pyrotechnic M-651 round is the preferred round for use when flammability is not a concern, as it expels a large cloud of visible CS gas and can be used to deny large areas to threats. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \21\ The M-79 is a Vietnam War-era shotgun-like weapon that fires 40-milimeter, spin-stabilized rounds such as tear gas, buckshot, high explosive, illumination and smoke. \22\ A discussion of CS gas generally, and ferret rounds in particular, can be found at H. Rept. No. 104-749 at 69-75. \23\ ``Texas Rangers Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Investigative Report Branch Davidian Evidence'' (September 1999) (exhibit 1). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The emergency plans evolved over the course of the 51-day standoff. The written plan was lengthened, and incorporated the use of M728 Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEVs) on loan from the Texas National Guard. The CEVs were equipped with mounted CS gas spraying devices, which were to be used to insert CS gas directly in the building through windows and through holes punched in the walls. The plan continued to include the use of M-79 grenade launchers to launch ferret rounds through the doors and windows. 2. The Proposed Operations Plan As it became clear that the standoff with the Davidians could be a protracted one, a formal, written operations plan was drafted under the direction of FBI SAC Jeff Jamar and HRT Commander Richard Rogers.\24\ As was the case with the emergency plan, the operations plan was sent up the FBI's chain of command, except this time it was presented to Attorney General Janet Reno. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \24\ Interview with Richard Rogers, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge and Commander, HRT, FBI in Phoenix, AZ (Aug. 9, 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Several earlier versions had been drafted and proposed, and these earlier versions provided for immediate insertion of tear gas by the combined use of CEVs with boom-mounted gas cylinders along with ferret rounds shot into every opening into the compound. These earlier versions were not approved. The FBI's proposed operations plan, as submitted and approved by Attorney General Janet Reno, described what was to occur on April 19, 1993, in the following manner: On order, two CEVs will enter the compound inside the concertina wire prior to sunrise. One CEV will penetrate the structure on the 1st floor, at the White/ Green corner utilizing the boom and project tear gas via the Mark 5 delivery system secured to the boom. After delivery, the CEV will retreat from the structure and stand-by. The second CEV will stand by and upon retreat by the 1st CEV, will insert additional tear gas into the 2nd floor of the White/Green corner. Prior to the entry of the CEVs, the BVs [Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a type of armored personnel carrier] will be engaged in routine spotlight maintenance. Upon delivery of the tear gas by the CEV, a BV on the Green side will deliver Ferret liquid tear gas rounds into the top of the black covering on the unfinished and unoccupied construction in order to deny access in this area. If firing commences from the Compound, the BVs will be prepared to deliver Ferret liquid tear gas rounds into all windows/openings in the compound structure. If all subjects fail to exit the compound structure after 48 hours of tear gas, then, on order, a modified CEV will proceed to open up/disassemble the structure at the location where the structure was least gassed until all subjects are located.\25\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \25\ ``WACMUR: Major Case #80--Assault on a Federal Officer,'' briefing for the Attorney General at Bates Stamp No. WWC142-0441, 26 (Apr. 12, 1993) (exhibit 9). The operations plan clearly outlines the tactics to be employed. That is, the two CEVs would ``penetrate the structure . . . utilizing the boom and project tear gas via the Mark 5 delivery system secured to the boom.'' The CEVs would insert tear gas incrementally, and only one CEV would insert gas at a time. Right after the CEVs first began inserting tear gas, a Bradley would approach the ``unfinished and unoccupied'' tornado shelter and fire ferret rounds through the top. If the Davidians fired at the HRT, then the HRT would shoot ferret rounds into all openings in the compound. The plan also details the type of tear gas to be used; the CEVs would discharge tear gas from the cylinders mounted on their booms and the HRT would be firing liquid ferret rounds. There is no mention in the operations plan of the possibility of using any pyrotechnic types of tear gas rounds. 3. Deviation in the Execution of the Plan This plan, as approved by the Attorney General, bears little resemblance to what actually occurred on April 19, 1993. The plan antiseptically describes ``[o]ne CEV will penetrate the structure . . . utilizing the boom and project tear gas.'' On April 19, 1993, HRT members operating the CEVs repeatedly entered the structure at different points, causing damage to the building far exceeding what one would expect from reviewing the plan. One photograph shows holes in the compound walls that exceeded the width of a CEV.\26\ The photograph also shows that the gymnasium in the rear of the compound has collapsed and entire sections of the first floor walls on the compound are missing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \26\ Exhibit 10. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- At mid-morning on April 19, 1993, the CEV that was tasked to insert gas into the Black side of the compound, designated CEV-2, became disabled as it attempted to return to the T- intersection to reload its CS cylinders. The driver and the vehicle commander exited CEV-2 and entered a reserve CEV that did not have the capability to inject CS gas. This CEV returned to the Black side, and was ordered to open up a path to the area around the base of the tower for CEV-1.\27\ This was an area that the HRT commander believed had not had any tear gas inserted.\28\ The path to the tower between the swimming pool and the gymnasium was not much wider than a CEV, so CEV-2's commander opted to push through the walls of the gymnasium rather than risk collapsing the side of the pool with the weight of his vehicle. CEV-2 repeatedly entered the gymnasium until the structure collapsed a short time before noon. During their interviews with committee staff, the tank commander and the on-site commander both claimed that this collapse was an accidental result of their attempts to insert tear gas in the tower area, and not a deliberate attempt to demolish the building.\29\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \27\ Interview with Jim Walden, Special Agent, FBI, in Washington, DC (Dec. 10, 1999). \28\ Interview with Richard Rogers, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge and Commander, HRT, FBI, in Phoenix, AZ (Aug. 9, 2000). \29\ Interview with Jim Walden, Special Agent, FBI, in Washington, DC (Dec. 10, 1999); interview with Jeff Jamar, former Special Agent in Charge, FBI, in Austin, TX (Feb. 16, 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The operations plan did include a provision for the demolition of the compound, but only after 48 hours of deliberate gas insertion. Nonetheless, the gymnasium was demolished less than 6 hours after the HRT implemented their operations plan. 4. Foreknowledge of Need to Deviate from the Plan Of concern to the committee is why the possibility of early, serious structural damage to the compound was not put forth in the operational plan. The shoddy nature of the construction of the compound was well known to the FBI, and concerns had previously been noted concerning its fragility, especially the gymnasium's: HRT has talked to military engineers and have developed information regarding the construction of the compound. It is not of good quality. Information has been obtained from individuals who have worked in the compound regarding construction. They believe that if they use the rail on the CEV to penetrate into the white side, the result will be a peeling away of the siding exposing the rooms on that side. They anticipate the roof will remain intact [sic] The construction of the black side (gym) is not of good quality. It is believed that the same type of activity directed toward the gym will result in the collapse of the roof. HRT advised that they have on occasion ``bumped'' the compound using the CEVs and it is not very stable.\30\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \30\ Memorandum from Danny Coulson, former Deputy Assistant Director, FBI, undated, 2, at Bates Stamp No. WWC130-0247 (exhibit 11). Despite the foreknowledge of the poor quality of the construction, and despite the fact that the operational plan did not call for a systematic ``disassembly'' of the compound until after 48 hours had elapsed, the gymnasium was demolished within 6 hours of the implementation of the plan. Jeff Jamar, the on-scene commander at Waco, claimed in his deposition taken in preparation for the civil trial that he had the discretion to allow deviations from the operational plan: Q. My question is, is it your testimony that there was a specific reference contained in the plan of operations, the written plan of operations that was approved for April 19, 1993, that permitted you the authority to order penetration of the building with more than simply the tear gas insertion booms? A. . . . Yes, that was part of my discretion as--in implementing plan was to do that, yes.\31\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \31\ Transcript of Deposition of Jeffrey Jamar, former Special Agent in Charge, FBI, at 6-10:48, Andrade v. Chojnacki (W.D. Tex. Mar. 15, 2000) (No. W-96-CA-139) (exhibit 12). The court, in the civil litigation arising from the issues centering on the FBI's deviation from its operational plan, --------------------------------------------------------------------------- agreed: FBI agents operating the military vehicles inserted tear gas in accordance with the approved Plan of Operations on April 19, 1993. Because the plan could not provide for every contingency, it necessarily afforded discretion to the FBI agents on the scene to adapt to the evolving conditions, including, among other things, the failure of the Davidians to leave the building, the relative ineffectiveness of the tear gas due to the wind and the Davidians' gas masks, and the possibility that certain individuals were prevented from leaving because the exits were barricaded. Any deviation from the written plan was within the authority delegated to the agents on the scene.\32\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \32\ Findings of facts and conclusions of law at 9, Andrade v. Chojnacki (W.D. Tex. Sept. 20, 2000) (No. W-86-CA-138) (exhibit 13). The on-scene commander clearly felt he had the implied, if not explicit, authority to deviate from the operational plan, and the court ultimately came to the same conclusion. Of interest to the committee, however, is that earlier, more aggressive proposed operational plans which allowed for immediate and total tear gas bombardment from M-79 grenade launchers along with CEVs were not approved by FBI headquarters personnel from Washington, DC.\33\ The plan as approved for April 19, 1993, allowed only incremental increases in tear- gassing. Only if the Davidians fired at the HRT was the gassing to be accelerated, and the M-79s employed. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \33\ Transcript of Deposition of Jeffrey Jamar, former Special Agent in Charge, FBI, at 2-10:31, Andrade v. Chojnacki (W.D. Tex. Mar. 15, 2000) (No. W-86-CA-138) (exhibit 12). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This appears to have been a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Jamar told committee staff he believed the Davidians would start shooting as soon as the HRT approached the compound with the CEVs. It is an issue of serious concern that the plan, as executed, was more aggressive and destructive than the plan that was approved, and resembled closely earlier plans which had not been approved. B. The Use of Pyrotechnic Devices on April 19, 1993 1. No Contingency for Use of Pyrotechnic Rounds The FBI's operations plan did not include as a contingency the use of pyrotechnic M-651 rounds against the Branch Davidians. The plan only referred to the use of ferret tear gas rounds and the use of CEVs modified to insert tear gas from boom-mounted cylinders.\34\ No mention was made concerning the possible use of M-651s in the proposed operation plan given to the Attorney General.\35\ Further, the plan mentioned the need to insert tear gas into the outdoor tornado shelter, but only with ferret rounds: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \34\ ``WACMUR: Major Case #80--Assault on a Federal Officer,'' briefing for the Attorney General at Bates Stamp No. WWC142-0441 (Apr. 12, 1993) (exhibit 9). \35\ Id. Four Bradley Vehicles (BV) will be positioned around the compound ready to supplement the CEV in gas delivery, if needed. One of the four BV's will insert Ferret liquid tear gas rounds into the black covering of the new unoccupied construction on the green side immediately after the introduction of tear gas into the previously referenced white/green section of the compound structure.\36\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \36\ Id. at Bates Stamp No. WWC142-0440. Moreover, HRT personnel were aware that the use of ferret rounds against the unfinished tornado shelter would likely --------------------------------------------------------------------------- prove ineffective: THE UNFINISHED AREA OF THE COMPOUND ON THE GREEN SIDE WILL BE THE TARGET OF CS INTRODUCTION USING THE M-79 GRENADE LAUNCHERS. IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE POSSIBLE TO USE HAND HELD CANISTERS TO ENGAGE THIS PART OF THE COMPOUND. THERE IS SOME QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE FERRET WILL PENETRATE THE TARPAPER-COVERED PORTION OF THE UNFINISHED AREA. (DUE TO THE ANGLE), SOME OR ALL FERRETS MAY NOT PENETRATE. THE INTRODUCTION OF CS INTO THE WHITE GREEN COVER SHOULD GIVE SOME COVERAGE OF THE TRAP DOOR ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL, THUS DENYING SUBJECTS ACCESS TO THE TUNNEL AND THE UNDERGROUND BUS. THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT THIS PORTION OF THE COMPOUND IS FLOODED.\37\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \37\ See memorandum from Danny Coulson, former Deputy Assistant Director, FBI, undated, at Bates Stamp No. WWC130-0247 (exhibit 11). It is obvious that there was prior awareness on the part of the HRT that ferret rounds were likely to be ineffective against the roof of this structure. Why the operations plan failed to describe the possible need to use a more dangerous round remains a troubling question. 2. Use of Pyrotechnic Rounds On April 19, 1993, HRT member David Corderman fired ferret rounds from a Bradley Fighting Vehicle using an M-79 grenade launcher at the shelter from the White/Green corner. Since he was shooting at a downward and shallow angle, the ferret projectiles merely bounced off the roof.\38\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \38\ Interview with David Corderman, Special Agent, FBI, Washington, DC (Nov. 4, 1999). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- At approximately 8 a.m., Corderman asked for approval to use M-651 tear gas rounds on the shelter's roof. The request went up the HRT's chain of command to HRT commander Richard Rogers, who granted permission.\39\ Portions of these conversations are clearly audible on the overhead FLIR tapes: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \39\ Interview with Richard Rogers, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge and Commander, HRT, FBI in Phoenix, AZ (Aug. 9, 2000). [``HR 1'' is Richard Rogers, Commander of the HRT. ``HR 2'' is Stephen McGavin, Supervisory Special Agent, --------------------------------------------------------------------------- HRT.] 7:48:55 a.m. (4/19/93) HR 2.

He thinks he can get into position with relative safety utilizing the track for cover and attempt to penetrate it with military rounds. HR 1. Roger. Of course, if there's water underneath that's just going to extinguish them but you can try it. HR 2. Ten-four. Copy. He can try it? HR 1. Yeah, that's affirmative. 8:08 a.m. (4/19/93) Charlie 1.

IT BOUNCED OFF.\40\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \40\ Transcript of FBI FLIR Tape (Apr. 19, 1993) (exhibit 14). Corderman told committee staff that he fired two or three M-651 rounds. These rounds also bounced off the roof. A photograph from an FBI surveillance plane shows a small cloud of white smoke near the outdoor structure.\41\ Corderman identified this photograph to committee staff as depicting the effects of the military round that he fired.\42\ Corderman stated that he used the M-651 round because he thought this heavier metal projectile would be more likely to penetrate the shelter roof than the lighter, plastic ferret projectile. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \41\ Exhibit 15. \42\ Interview with David Corderman, Special Agent, FBI, in Washington, DC (Nov. 4, 1999); interview with David Corderman, Special Agent, FBI, in Washington, DC (Apr. 13, 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The HRT personnel at Waco did not consider the fact that Corderman fired military tear gas rounds extraordinary. All HRT personnel were interviewed by the FBI soon after the fire and none of them mentioned the use of M-651 rounds because none of them had been asked if such rounds had been used. In November 1993, when HRT members were again interviewed, this time by Department of Justice prosecutors preparing for trial, Rogers and other HRT members readily admitted that M-651s had been used.\43\ By their accounts, none thought it significant and they did not recall any response from the Justice Department prosecutors at that time.\44\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \43\ Interview with Richard Rogers, former commander, HRT, FBI, in Phoenix, AZ (Aug. 9, 2000). \44\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Curiously enough, in addition to the fact that the possession and eventual use of M-651 rounds were never mentioned in the operational plan, neither was the fact that the Bradleys also contained high explosive (HE) rounds for the M-79 grenade launchers. Although no evidence whatsoever has been found that these rounds were fired on April 19, 1993, their existence for use as a contingency should have been explicit in the operational plan. 3. Disappearance of the Pyrotechnic Rounds An issue that has long plagued the Waco civil litigants as well as law enforcement officials concerns the whereabouts of the expended M-651 projectiles. The rounds were known to have been fired, one was photographed, another was seen on the ground shortly after the fire, but none were ever logged in as evidence by the Texas Rangers or the FBI. Shortly after the end of the fire, evidence technicians from both the FBI and the Texas Department of Public Safety took over the crime scene to collect and inventory all evidence. A few days after April 19, 1993, a photographer for the Texas Department of Public Safety took photographs of an expended M-651 projectile.\45\ Adjacent to the round in the photograph is what appears to be the wire shaft of a flag used to mark objects to be inventoried into evidence.\46\ However, the evidence log maintained by the Texas Rangers shows no entry for this projectile.\47\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \45\ Interview with Joey Gordon, Sergeant, Texas Rangers Division, Texas Department of Public Safety, in Ft. Hood, TX (Mar. 19, 2000). \46\ See ``Texas Rangers Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Investigative Report Branch Davidian Evidence,'' attachment I (September 1999) (exhibit 1). \47\ ``Texas Rangers Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety Investigative Report #2 Branch Davidian Evidence'' (January 2000) (exhibit 16). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wallace Higgins, an FBI Hazardous Devices and Explosives Examiner for the FBI's Explosives Unit, told committee staff that he observed two M-651 projectiles at the crime scene following the fire. One was in water and he couldn't see the end of it in order to determine whether or not it was live. Borrowing a .45 pistol from a Texas Ranger, he shot at it twice, hitting it and denting the projectile. According to Higgins, this was a ``render safe'' action that was done in order to determine if the round was still live. The round did not initiate; indicating it had been fired and activated previously. This round was found between the silo and the outdoor tornado shelter.\48\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \48\ Telephone interview with Wallace Higgins, former Special Agent, FBI (Oct. 2, 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Higgins found a second round in the dirt near the underground walkway, which abutted the tornado shelter. Higgins determined that the round had been expended and he left it in place. Higgins recalled that he told someone on the FBI evidence collection team about the rounds. However, he wasn't certain whether it was Rick Crum, an FBI firearms expert, or James Cadigan, the on-scene leader of the FBI's evidence collection team. Higgins further recalled that he didn't believe the rounds were still present on the ground by the time that the evidence collection was finished. Higgins stated he did not know what became of the rounds. He acknowledged that the FBI laboratory subsequently erred in labeling certain 40 millimeter flashbang rounds at the crime scene as M-651s, but the rounds he saw near the compound were M-651s and not flashbang rounds.\49\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \49\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FBI Special Agent James Cadigan, who led the on-scene evidence collection for the FBI, stated to committee staff that he arrived at Waco on April 19, 1993. Cadigan stated that his expertise is in small arms identification, up to and including .50 caliber weapons, but not larger ordinance such as 40mm rounds. When Cadigan arrived at the crime scene, the rubble from the compound was still smoldering. Within 24 hours he met with members of the ATF, Texas Rangers, and Federal prosecutors Ray and LeRoy Jahn. They established a protocol to divide the crime scene into grids. The Jahns told him the Texas Rangers were in charge of the evidence search. Cadigan became the administrative person on the site. He was primarily located at a mobile home brought to the compound, where he was responsible for locating equipment to be used by the evidence collection teams. Cadigan stated that he never observed any M-651s at the site. Cadigan recalled that some time after the fire, the Texas Rangers shipped a truckload of evidence to the FBI lab in Washington, DC. Federal prosecutors Ray and LeRoy Jahn, along with John Lancaster and, possibly, John Phinizy, reviewed each item at the lab for its probative value. The prosecutors logged probative value items, or those that might be used at trial, and sent the non-probative items back to the Texas Rangers. Cadigan also acknowledged that the FBI laboratory had misidentified certain 40mm flashbang rounds as M-651s.\50\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \50\ Interview with James Cadigan, Supervisory Special Agent, FBI, in Washington, DC (Oct. 3, 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Texas Rangers collected and stored the evidence from the compound at two primary sites. Items that might be used at the criminal trial in 1994 were stored at a large locker at the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin, TX. In 1999, the Texas Rangers searched this area and found no military tear gas projectile. The other site was a warehouse in Waco, TX. This site contained many large, locked Conex containers. These containers were filled with hundreds of five gallon sealed drums; most of which contained hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition from the Branch Davidian compound, many of which had ``cooked off'' in the fire. On November 17 and 18, 1999, the Texas Rangers and U.S. Postal Inspectors working for the Office of Special Counsel conducted an exhaustive hand search of the many tons of physical evidence stored at the warehouse in Waco.\51\ The search failed to produce any military tear gas rounds. Only the photograph of the projectile was found in the inventory.\52\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \51\ Committee staff were present and participated in this search. \52\ The search did produce the remains of 40mm illumination rounds, presumably fired over the compound to illuminate the area prior to the installation of search lights. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. Allegations of government gunfire on April 19, 1993 The tragic outcome of the FBI's attempt to end their standoff with the Branch Davidians has been understandably difficult for most, if not all, Americans to comprehend. The fact that approximately 80 men, women and children did not flee tear gas and flames, and instead met gruesome deaths, has led a large cross section of the American public to suspect that the government somehow prevented the Davidians from escaping their residence on April 19, 1993. These suspicions have centered on the allegation that HRT or military personnel fired upon the Davidians both before and during the fire. These suspicions have been further raised by troubling evidence brought to light during the discovery process in a wrongful death lawsuit and by independent investigators, Freedom of Information Act plaintiffs, and other private parties. This evidence includes: LAn FBI witness statement given by an HRT member that states that the agent ``heard shots fired from sniper position #1.'' \53\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \53\ FBI telephone interview with Charles Riley, Special Agent, FBI, 2 (June 2, 1993) (exhibit 17). LSpent shell casings recovered from the FBI sniper --------------------------------------------------------------------------- position. LInfrared footage taken by an FBI surveillance airplane on April 19, 1993, which to many viewers appears to include images of muzzle blasts directed at the rear of the compound. One example of such an image on the FLIR tape, pointed out by documentary filmmaker Michael McNulty, concerned what appeared to be dark forms located directly behind CEV-2, which was making repeated entries into the gymnasium located on the back side of the compound. Flashes appeared on the FLIR tape from the edges of the forms, which McNulty alleged represented automatic gunfire from government agents located immediately behind CEV-2.\54\ Dr. Allard, a FLIR expert retained by the plaintiffs in the civil case, described this event: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \54\ See ``Waco: The Rules of Engagement'' (Fifth Estate Productions, 1997) and ``Waco: A New Revelation'' (MGA Films, 1999). A tank (CEV) was used to smash into a building before the complex fire. As the tank approached the building, two appeared on the videotape behind the tank. They rolled over and began shooting into the building with automatic gunfire. (The airborne FLIR recorded only part of the operation). A short time later, the tank backed out of the building. Standing behind the tank were three men. The tank appeared to roll over the men, as they disappeared under the tank. It stopped for a few seconds, turned, and left the scene. No men were observed after the tank left the scene. The men had to enter and leave the tank through its bottom escape hatch.\55\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \55\ Edward Allard, ``Preliminary Analysis of the Waco FLIR Tapes'' 5 (Aug. 30, 1999) (exhibit 18). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Sites Manned by the FBI By April 19, 1993, the HRT had occupied various outbuildings and other sites around the compound for nearly 51 days. Immediately following the failed BATF raid on February 28, 1993, HRT personnel had taken over two pre-existing observation and sniper sites that had been used by the BATF on February 28, 1993. These sites provided cover for the agents while affording them a fairly unobstructed view of the compound. Both of these sites were fortified by the HRT. These sites were designated by the HRT as ``Sierra One'' and ``Sierra Two.'' Sierra One was a house across the Double EE Ranch Road from the compound. The driveway leading from the compound entered the road almost directly in front of the house. Sierra One, and the house next to it (designated ``Sierra One Alpha'') were less than 300 yards from the compound and allowed full observation of the entire front or ``white'' side. Sierra Two was a cinderblock garage located several hundred yards behind or on the black side of the compound. Between the two locations, HRT personnel had direct views of the white and black sides of the compound, with peripheral views of the red and green sides. These locations were provided with spotting scopes, rifle scopes and night vision equipment. By early March 1993, HRT had heavily fortified both Sierra One and Sierra Two with sandbags and metal plates. Both sites had machine-gun emplacements as well as sniper/observer positions. As additional protection from attack, these sites had seismic sensors, on loan from the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), placed around them.\56\ These proved of little value, however, as cattle and deer often set the sensors off. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \56\ Interviews with 10 current and former USSOCOM Army Special Forces personnel at Ft. Bragg, NC; Raleigh, NC; and Washington, DC. The identities of these individuals remain classified by the Department of Defense. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In order to more effectively monitor the right, or red side of the compound, HRT members constructed a new sniper position, designated ``Sierra Three,'' up the driveway approximately 180 yards from the white/red corner. This position consisted of a trench fortified by metal plates and sandbags. It was occupied only part-time when HRT members needed to monitor special events. The HRT also constructed dummy sites on the red side to deceive the Davidians as to the snipers' true location.\57\ Three HRT snipers manned Sierra Three on April 19, 1993.\58\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \57\ Interview with Kenneth G. Vincent, Special Agent, FBI, Washington, DC (Apr. 12, 2000). \58\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FBI agents from various FBI field office SWAT teams were also located on the left, or green side of the compound along a driveway that ran roughly parallel to the green side, on the neighboring Perry ranch. Personnel were stationed along this road, approximately 550 yards from the green side. This location was designated ``Sierra Four.'' There was also an outer perimeter, consisting of roadblocks and other positions manned by various Federal, State and local law enforcement agents, including the BATF and FBI SWAT. This outer perimeter had been manned since the early days of the standoff. In addition to manned sites, HRT personnel observed the Davidians through various technical devices, which the HRT obtained from U.S. Special Operations Command. Two remotely operated closed circuit TV cameras were placed; one on the green side and one on the red.\59\ In addition, a thermal imager, also on loan from U.S. Special Operations Command, was placed on top of a water tower at an intersection of the Double EE Ranch Road and Elk Road, situated on the red side of the compound.\60\ These devices, coupled with transmissions from several bugging devices inside the compound, allowed fairly close observation of the compound as well as intelligence from inside the compound. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \59\ Interviews with 10 current and former USSOCOM Army Special Forces personnel at Ft.

However, several times during the standoff, Davidians went outside unannounced and HRT members fired 40mm ``flashbang grenades'' over the Davidians' heads.\62\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \61\ ``WACMUR: Major Case #80--Assault on a Federal Officer,'' briefing for the Attorney General at Bates Stamp No. WWC142-0433.

The fence, remnants of which remain at Mt. Carmel today, consisted of two stacked rolls of concertina wire, supported by metal posts. It was constructed by the HRT utilizing various armored vehicles as cover from potential gunfire from the compound. The fence was approximately 5 to 6 feet high and followed the contours of the compound, at a distance anywhere from 15 to 25 yards.\64\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \63\ ``WACMUR: Major Case #80--Assault on a Federal Officer,'' briefing for the Attorney General at Bates Stamp No. WWC142-0437 (Apr. 12, 1993) (exhibit 9). \64\ FBI aerial photograph with outline of fence as described to committee staff by Steve McGavin, former Deputy Commander, HRT, FBI (exhibit 19). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the operation of April 19, 1993, all HRT sites were manned, allowing close observation of the compound from all sides. Committee staff interviewed individuals from all positions. All consistently stated that not one government agent fired any gunshots at the compound. Numerous photographs and numerous videotapes taken of the compound from all angles were examined. None showed any government personnel on foot in close proximity to the compound, except for those that were involved in rescuing Davidians from the burning structure. 2. Gunfire from HRT Sniper Position Two houses across the Double EE Ranch Road from the Mt. Carmel Center were manned both by BATF snipers on February 28, 1993, and by HRT snipers (who designated the two houses Sierra One and Sierra One Alpha, as described above) throughout the 51-day standoff. The BATF snipers had been armed with .308 caliber sniper rifles as well as .223 caliber assault rifles, and admitted firing both during the February 28, 1993 shoot- out. The HRT snipers who manned the same positions throughout the standoff were armed with the same types of weapons, but denied ever firing them. On April 20, 1993, an HRT member who had been stationed at the Sierra One sniper position handed over to the Texas Rangers 11 .308 caliber shell casings and 24 .223 caliber shell casings which the HRT member stated he had found at Sierra One.\65\ On April 22, 1993, Texas Rangers searched the houses. Pursuant to this search, the Rangers sifted through sand found throughout the house (which had apparently leaked from sandbags used to fortify the sniper position) and found an additional .308 caliber shell casing.\66\ The presence of spent shell casings at the sniper position as late as April 22, 1993, raised the disturbing possibility that the FBI had fired from the position on April 19, 1993, or sometime during the standoff. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \65\ ``Criminal Law Enforcement Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Report of Investigation,'' RF093021-U.12, at 3 (May 1993) (exhibit 20). \66\ ``Texas Rangers Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Investigative Report #2 Brance Davidian Evidence'' at 3, 4 (January 2000) (exhibit 16). (Pages are not numbered in text). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Despite this possibility, firing pin and ejector impressions on the shell casings were not compared with test firings of BATF weapons until this year, by the Office of Special Counsel. The Special Counsel found that the shell casings found on April 20 and 22, 1993, matched BATF weapons used on February 28.\67\ In light of this evidence, a claim in the civil suit was withdrawn by the plaintiffs.\68\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \67\ John C.

Supervisory Special Agent Gail Seavey, who conducted the interview, wrote that, on April 19, 1993, Riley ``heard shots fired from sniper position #1.'' \69\ Riley stated that he did not review this statement prior to its final draft, but that he had been misunderstood.

Allegations that FLIR Tape Depicted Muzzle Flash During the standoff, the FBI employed various aircraft for observation purposes. In addition to small fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, the FBI utilized their primary observation plane known as the Nightstalker. This plane was equipped with a Forward Looking Infrared imager or ``FLIR,'' essentially a video camera which films in the infrared range. Since it measures in this range, the plane is useful in low light and nighttime conditions. At Waco, the Nightstalker was often employed to circle the compound during the evening hours in order to detect unauthorized entries or exits. Since the FLIR operators had video monitors as well as recorders onboard, FLIR operators could make real-time observations and communicate with the HRT commanders. The FLIR recorders on the plane recorded on two tapes, allowing the operator to switch to another tape when the first tape ran out, without ceasing to record. This created some overlap at times.\71\ On April 19, 1993, the plane also provided daytime overhead surveillance to monitor the execution of the HRT's tear gassing plan. On April 19, 1993, the plane circled the compound for periods of time, landed and refueled at a nearby airport, then returned to the compound. As a result, several FLIR videotapes were made, some of which overlapped. Certain portions of FLIR tapes, one starting at 10:41 a.m. and ending at 12:16 p.m., and one starting at 12:16 p.m. and ending at 1:39 p.m., were analyzed by experts hired by the committee. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \71\ Interview with Isaac Nakimoto, Special Agent, FBI, in Washington, DC (Dec. 15, 1999). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The committee retained Dr. Donald Frankel, of Photon Research Associates in Newton, MA, to perform an analysis of the FLIR tapes from April 19, 1993, and from the planned March 19, 2000, FLIR test at Ft. Hood, TX. His report, attached as exhibit 8, focused on analyzing four segments of FLIR tape from April 19, 1993. The four segments that Dr. Frankel analyzed were selected because three out of the four contained footage that the plaintiffs in the civil litigation had asserted represented muzzle flashes.\72\ The first segment, as discussed earlier in this report, contained the FLIR footage that depicted flashes from directly behind the CEV that was penetrating the gymnasium at the rear of the compound.\73\ The second segment contained what appeared to be bright flashes at the corner of the gymnasium.\74\ The third segment contained flashes appearing to the left of the CEV.\75\ The fourth segment contained a flash located in the center of the courtyard.\76\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \72\ Edward Allard, ``Preliminary Analysis of the Waco FLIR Tapes'' (Aug. 30, 1999) (exhibit 18). \73\ FLIR tape #3, local time 11:24:11, tape counter 00:37:36. \74\ FLIR tape #3, local time 12:08:31, tape counter 01:21:54. \75\ FLIR tape #3, local time 12:08:51, tape counter 01:22:13. \76\ FLIR tape #3, local time 12:10:55, tape counter 01:24:14. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, on March 19, 2000, Special Counsel Danforth, pursuant to an order of the civil trial court and with the concurrence of the civil litigants, conducted a FLIR test at Ft. Hood, TX, in an attempt to shed light on what, if any, muzzle flashes were observable by the type of FLIR in use in 1993. The Department of Justice was initially reluctant, but eventually consented to the test.\77\ The test protocols, agreed to by all the parties in the civil suit, provided for flying FLIR-equipped aircraft over a group of individuals firing weapons of different calibers and firing rates. It also provided for the creation of a ``rubble field'' which was believed to approximate the construction debris found at the compound late in the morning of April 19, 1993, when the FBI's CEVs were forcibly penetrating the compound walls to insert tear gas. The committee sent observers to this test. Both the FLIR videotapes taken by the FBI's Nightstalker surveillance airplane (utilizing a more advanced, digital version of the FLIR camera in use in 1993) and a British Lynx helicopter (utilizing the same model FLIR camera as used by the FBI in 1993) were obtained and analyzed by Dr. Frankel. These tapes were then compared with the four segments of FLIR tape from April 19, 1993. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \77\ Lee Hancock, ``Government Rejects Attorney's Effort to Test if Agents Used Guns at Waco,'' the Dallas Morning News, Oct. 27, 1999 (exhibit 23). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In his 34-page report submitted to the committee on September 11, 2000, Dr. Frankel concluded that the flashes exhibited in the four tape segments referenced above could not depict gunfire.\78\ Dr. Frankel drew three conclusions from his analysis of the FLIR tapes. He first concludes: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \78\ Dr. Donald S. Frankel, Photon Research Associates, ``Assessment of Waco, Texas FLIR Videotape,'' 1 (Sept. 11, 2000) (exhibit 8). (1) The flashes seen on the tape during the four critical time periods cannot be weapons muzzle flash. Their duration is far too long and their spatial extent is far too great. They are almost certainly the result of solar energy or heat energy from nearby vehicles reflected toward the FLIR by debris or puddles.\79\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \79\ Id. Dr. Frankel's report breaks down the elements involved in detecting muzzle flashes. Muzzle flashes have distinct spatial and temporal characteristics.\80\ Frankel measured the spatial proportions and the durations of the flashes found on the FLIR tapes and compared the results with standard reference works in the field.\81\ For example, a rifle firing the .308 caliber NATO round (7.62mm) leaves a muzzle flash that is 0.4 meters long and lasts for approximately 2 milliseconds.\82\ By contrast, Dr. Frankel reported that the flashes seen on the April 19, 1993 FLIR tape ranged from one tenth of a second to over 1 second long.\83\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \80\ Id. \81\ Id. at 5, 6. \82\ Id. at 6. \83\ Id. at 13-20. (2) The FLIR video technology has a very low probability of detecting small arms muzzle flash.\84\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \84\ Id. at 1. Due to the limitations of the FLIR camera, events such as muzzle flashes are of such short duration as to limit the camera's chances of depicting muzzle flash. Since the FLIR camera uses a scanning apparatus which scans the field of view 60 times per second, or any given point in the field of view once every 16.67 milliseconds, shorter duration events such as --------------------------------------------------------------------------- muzzle flash may not appear on the FLIR tape: The FLIR video scanning arrangement described in the previous section implies that the detector is observing only a small part of the scene at any given instant. For ordinary objects that persist for long periods of time, the effect is not noticeable. For fast motion, it results in blurring. For very brief events, such as muzzle flash, it can result in the event being missed entirely. . . . The FLIR camera scans a field in 1/60 s [1/60 of one second]. During the 1 ms that a muzzle flash is observable, the camera therefore scans only 6% of the scene. This figure may be taken as a first order approximation of the probability that the FLIR can detect a small arms muzzle flash that occurs within its field of view. This estimate does not take into account the sensitivity of the camera, which may prevent muzzle flash from ever being detected at useful ranges.\85\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \85\ Id. at 3. Dr. Frankel's third conclusion concerns the possibility that muzzle flash may have occurred, but wouldn't necessarily --------------------------------------------------------------------------- be picked up on the FLIR: (3) As a consequence of (2) above, the absence of muzzle flash detection on the FLIR tape does not prove that weapons were not actually fired during the final assault. Indeed, there is ample evidence (not presented here) that the Davidians were firing at the federal agents throughout this period, but none of their muzzle flashes are detectable on the videotape.\86\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \86\ Id. at 1. Dr. Frankel then examines the four specific segments of FLIR tape. The first segment, containing the purported flashes --------------------------------------------------------------------------- behind the CEV, are measured temporally: As Figure 7 shows, the ``rhythmic flashes last for several tenths of a second (several hundred ms). Since this is 50 to 100 times longer than the muzzle flash from small arms lasts, these flashes cannot be muzzle flash. They are most likely a reflection of the CEV engine's hot parts, which themselves are clearly visible in the videotape.\87\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \87\ Id. at 13. The other three segments also contain flashes with duration --------------------------------------------------------------------------- times that preclude them from being muzzle flashes: [I]t is possible to state with 100% confidence that the bright flashes that occur at the four 1993 time periods covered by this report are not muzzle flash. They are all far too long in duration to be muzzle flash. Comparison with the re-enactment videos also indicates that they are too bright compared to their surroundings, and too great in spatial extent. The most plausible sources for these flashes varies from case to case, but include sunlight reflected from debris, puddles of water, or window glass, and CEV engine hot parts thermal radiation reflected from debris or puddles of water. After the compound catches fire, it is hard to discount burning construction material as the source of flashes.\88\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \88\ Id. at 32, 33. Although Dr. Frankel rules out that any of the four segments depicted muzzle flash, that does not rule out the possibility that muzzle flashes were present, but not recorded --------------------------------------------------------------------------- by the FLIR: Examination of the FLIR videotape of the last day of the siege of the Branch Davidian compound fails to identify any events that resemble the muzzle flashes observed during the re-enactment. One might have hoped that the apparent lack of muzzle flash would prove that the FBI agents did not fire their weapons. But because of the FLIR's low probability of muzzle flash detection, it is not possible to make such a statement with much confidence.\89\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \89\ Id. at 32. It is extremely unlikely that anyone will ever be able to prove, scientifically, that no government agent ever fired a shot at the Davidians on April 19, 1993. The committee, however, has not found sufficient evidence to support the allegations that law enforcement or military personnel directed gunfire toward the Branch Davidians on April 19, 1993. V. Actions and Omissions of The Department of Justice Since 1993 A. Introduction There is a stark contrast between what should have occurred after the April 19, 1993, tragedy and what, in fact, did occur. On April 20, 1993, President Clinton made the following clear pronouncement: I have directed the United States Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been done differently. . . . Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people.\90\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \90\President William Clinton, remarks by the President in question and answer session with the press in Washington, DC at 2 (Apr. 20, 1993) (exhibit 24). Seven years later, Special Counsel Danforth explained what he --------------------------------------------------------------------------- thought of the Justice Department investigation: The failure of the Scruggs team to discover and report that the FBI used pyrotechnic tear gas rounds was the result of initiating the investigation with the assumption that the FBI had done nothing wrong, was inconsistent with the responsibility to conduct a thorough and complete investigation, and was clearly negligent.\91\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \91\ John C. Danforth, Special Counsel, U.S. Department of Justice, ``Interim Report to the Deputy Attorney General Concerning the 1993 Confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco, Texas'' 52 (2000). Special Counsel Danforth's conclusions, and the conclusions of this committee, show how empty the President's promise has been. Following the tragic deaths of the Branch Davidians on April 19, 1993, Attorney General Reno asked her assistant, former Federal prosecutor Richard Scruggs, to conduct an investigation into the facts surrounding the tragedy.\92\ Justice Department officials later asked former Justice Department official Edward Dennis, Jr.,\93\ to conduct an analysis of those facts. The Department of Justice published their respective findings on October 8, 1993.\94\ Both Scruggs and Dennis stated publicly and during their interviews with committee staff that their findings were based upon a complete review of all relevant documents and interviews with numerous Justice Department, Federal and State law enforcement officials. Neither report, however, constituted a substantial review of the evidence. The Justice Department investigations were not as thorough as required by a tragedy of this magnitude. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \92\ Interview with Richard Scruggs, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Department of Justice, in Miami, FL (Jan. 5, 2000). \93\ Dennis is a former U.S. Attorney and served as the Justice Department's Assistant Attorney General (Criminal Division) during the Bush administration.

[W]e believe this report to be accurate and based upon solid evidentiary grounds; we expect additional details to be revealed at trial. This report has been prepared with the cooperation of literally hundreds of individuals. Approximately 950 interviews were conducted, and tens of thousands of pages of documents and transcripts were read and analyzed.\97\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \97\Richard Scruggs, U.S. Department of Justice, ``Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas, Feb. 28-Apr. 19, 1993,'' (Oct. 8, 1993) (unredacted version) at 12-14 (emphases added). Dennis stated that he largely relied upon the facts discovered and interviews conducted by Scruggs in order to --------------------------------------------------------------------------- prepare his report: To make this evaluation, I have reviewed the procedures followed by the Department and the FBI, giving particular attention to the means employed, the alternatives considered and the decisions made in attempting to resolve the stand-off. I have not been called upon to conduct a de novo factual inquiry. A comprehensive factual report is being prepared by the Department and the FBI. I have primarily relied upon the record gathered by the Department as the basis for the conclusions in this Report, supplemented by a number of follow-up interviews. However, I am satisfied that the factual inquiry by the Department was conducted in a thorough and objective manner. . . . I have been afforded access to documents gathered in that effort and to the reports of interviews conducted for factual investigation. In addition, since my appointment I participated in a number of Department interviews. I have also conducted independent interviews of some witnesses.\98\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \98\ Edward S.G. Dennis, Jr., U.S. Department of Justice, ``Evaluation of the Handling of the Branch Davidian Stand-off in Waco, Texas'' (Oct. 8, 1993) (redacted version) at 1-2 (emphasis added). Commenting in the fall of 1999 on the scope of his investigation, however, Dennis stated that his report ``was not intended to be a comprehensive, all-encompassing report.'' Stephen Labaton, ``Reno Admits Credibility Loss in Waco Case,'' the New York Times, Aug. 27, 1999 at A18, col. 4 (exhibit 33). It is troubling that the Waco tragedy did not seem to merit a ``vigorous and thorough investigation.'' President Clinton called for such an inquiry. Attorney General Reno promised that such an inquiry would take place. Neither took the steps necessary to make sure it would happen. Congress and the American people demanded a ``vigorous and thorough'' analysis of the events leading up to the tragedy. While Scruggs admitted to committee staff that, at first, he believed that the FBI had in fact committed some sort of error on April 19, 1993, he changed his mind early in the investigation.\99\ An objective, thorough analysis should have been the Justice Department's top priority. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \99\ Interview with Richard Scruggs, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Department of Justice, in Miami, FL (June 22, 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. What the American People Were Told Between 1993 and 1999 1. 1993-1994--the Department of Justice Conducts the Post-Tragedy Investigation and the Criminal Trial Congress and members of the media expressed concern with regard to the thoroughness of the Justice Department's investigations of BATF's and the FBI's handling of the Waco tragedy. In 1993, the Committee on the Judiciary requested documents from several agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Defense, the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, regarding the planning and execution of the initial BATF raid on February 28, 1993, and the subsequent FBI assault on April 19, 1993. On April 28, 1993, Justice Department and FBI officials, including Attorney General Reno, then-HRT Commander Richard Rogers and then-FBI Director William Sessions, testified before the House Committee on the Judiciary regarding Attorney General Reno's decisionmaking prior to, and HRT's actions on, April 19, 1993. Attorney General Reno testified that HRT personnel did not employ pyrotechnic devices on the day of the fire: I wanted, and received, assurances that the gas and its means of use were not pyrotechnic.\100\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \100\ ``Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas,'' hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 13, 16 (Apr. 28, 1993) (emphasis added) (statement of Janet Reno, U.S. Attorney General). Sessions likewise stated that the tear gas that HRT personnel --------------------------------------------------------------------------- employed was in itself non-pyrotechnic: CS gas, which is actually a powder, was selected because it was best suited to be used in the circumstances we faced. . . . One critical factor was that CS gas can be used without pyrotechnics. It will not start or contribute to a fire.\101\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \101\ Id. at 83, 85 (emphasis added) (statement of William Sessions, former FBI Director). No Justice Department or FBI official present at that hearing--most significantly, HRT Commander Richard Rogers-- corrected Attorney General Reno or Sessions or advised them that their testimony was misleading or inaccurate. According to Rogers, moreover, other portions of Attorney General Reno's testimony earlier that afternoon so bothered him that he failed to listen to the remainder of her testimony and, therefore, did not take note of her misstatements with regard to HRT's use of pyrotechnic tear gas on April 19, 1993.\102\ In any case, Rogers told committee staff that he would not have corrected Attorney General Reno because, in his opinion, her statement was technically correct in light of the fact that he deemed the tornado shelter, into which HRT personnel fired pyrotechnic tear gas rounds, to be separate from the main Branch Davidian compound.\103\ Roger's opinion on this matter defies logic and credulity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \102\ Reno disclosed classified information regarding an Army special operations unit. That information remains classified. \103\ Interview with Richard Rogers, former Assistant Special Agent in Charge and Commander, Hostage Rescue Team, FBI, in Phoenix, AZ (Aug. 9, 2000). Rogers' statement, however, as discussed in ch. IV, above, is flatly contradicted by the language within the FBI's proposed operations plan which suggests that HRT personnel considered everything within the concertina wire surrounding the Branch Davidian residence as the ``compound.'' ``WACMUR: Major Case #80--Assault on a Federal Officer,'' briefing for the Attorney General at Bates Stamp No. WWC142- 0441 (Apr. 12, 1993) (exhibit 9). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Later in 1993, Scruggs reported to the American people that, after receiving adequate briefings from Justice Department, FBI, military and scientific advisors, the Attorney General approved the dissemination of tear gas into the compound on April 19, 1993: On April 12, 1993, the FBI presented the tear gas plan to the Attorney General for her approval. Over the next several days the Attorney General and senior Justice Department and FBI officials discussed, debated and dissected, every aspect of the plan . . . After becoming convinced that some action was needed, the Attorney General vigorously questioned every aspect of the proposed plan, and the FBI provided her the answers to all her questions. * * * * * In addition, a nationally recognized team of arson experts. . . . has also concluded that the Davidians started the fire, that the fire could not have been started by accident at a single point of origin, and that the gas delivery systems the FBI used were completely nonincendiary.\104\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \104\ Richard Scruggs, U.S. Department of Justice, ``Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas, February-Apr. 19, 1993,'' (Oct. 8, 1993) (unredacted version) at 278-279, 324 (emphases added) (footnotes omitted). As was discovered in 1999 and will be discussed below, Scruggs' investigation was incomplete and his conclusion was wrong with respect to the means by which HRT personnel delivered tear gas on April 19, 1993. In 1995, the subcommittees of the Committee on the Judiciary and this committee (committees) convened joint hearings to review the Waco tragedy. Among others, the subcommittees subpoenaed William ``Ray'' Jahn, the Assistant U.S. Attorney who, with his wife, LeRoy, prosecuted the surviving Davidians in the criminal trial, to testify. Mr. Jahn told the subcommittees that no HRT member fired ammunition other than the non-pyrotechnic tear gas: ``On the 19th of April, though repeatedly fired upon by the occupants of [the Branch Davidian compound], the FBI did not fire a shot, other than non-lethal ferret rounds which carried the CS gas.'' \105\ This was not true. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \105\ ``Activities of Federal Law Enforcement Agencies Toward the Branch Davidians (Part I),'' hearing before the Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary and the Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal Justice of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, 104th Cong., 100, 107 (July 19, 1995) (statement of Ray Jahn, Assistant U.S. Attorney) (emphasis added). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In preparation for those hearings, the subcommittees requested documents from the Justice Department, FBI and BATF.\106\ Many of those documents likewise indicated that HRT personnel did not use weapons or devices capable of fire ignition. For example, an after-action report drafted by the BATF Special Agent who logged the FBI's tactical communications on April 19, 1993, and spoke with various FBI agents regarding the FBI's proposed operations plan indicated that the FBI decided not to use devices or weapons capable of fire ignition due to the risk of loss of life: ``[n]on-military rounds were utilized because they do not have a pyrotechnic deployment system which burns and creates a fire hazard.'' \107\ Other documents also indicate that, once HRT agents heard the code phrase ``compromise'' via radio, they delivered tear gas via non-pyrotechnic ferret projectiles.\108\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \106\ Sadly, the Justice Department did not produce the requested documents until 3 days before the start of the hearings. As Special Counsel Danforth noted, Justice Department officials were more concerned in 1995 with their own political self-preservation than their duty of full disclosure to the American people and the Congress. John C. Danforth, Special Counsel, U.S. Department of Justice, ``Interim Report to the Deputy Attorney General Concerning the 1993 Confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco, Texas'' iii (2000). Justice Department officials refused to produce documents requested by the subcommittees until 3 days prior to the first day of the hearings in 1995 and then produced disorganized collections of documents that were heavily redacted. While it may not have been possible to have reviewed and analyzed every document prior to the hearings, a thorough analysis might have found several documents that now raise questions about the truthfulness of prior Justice Department and FBI testimony and/or the completeness of the Justice Department-sponsored post-tragedy investigations. A reasonable amount of time for congressional review of the documents would also have allowed the subcommittees to more substantively question law enforcement witnesses, such as FBI negotiator Byron Sage and HRT Commander Rogers, regarding the specific use of M-651s in the FBI's proposed operations plan. A reasonable period for such a review would also have allowed staff to ask whether the use of those projectiles was expressly approved by Ren
