iii. Despite a large increase in recreational marijuana sales, medical sales have not declined. There are some differences between recreational and medical marijuana in Colorado, primarily that you must possess a prescription to purchase medical marijuana whereas recreational marijuana can be purchased by anyone over the age of 21. In addition, the tax rate on medical marijuana is significantly lower than the tax on recreational marijuana. Although the legal potency of marijuana flowers is similar across medical and recreational, THC levels in medical edible products can be higher. Also, Colorado law allows individuals to possess 1 ounce of recreational marijuana or 2 ounces of medical marijuana with a prescription. Specific code and regulation of recreational and medical marijuana can be found from the State of Colorado at: https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/MEDICAL-FinalApprovedPermanentRules.pdf and https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Amalgamated%20Retail%20Marijuana%20Rules%2001012018.pdf

xxx. Assuming that full-time employment in the marijuana industry equals 0.467 times the number of active occupational licenses, the change in employment in the marijuana industry between January 2014 and February 2018 equates to 5.4 percent of the total change in Colorado’s nonfarm employment during that time. Data do not exist for the number of occupational licenses in December 2013. If we assume that the number of licenses in January 2014 were all new jobs, the change in employment in the marijuana industry between December 2013 and February 2018 would represent 7.4 percent of the change in total nonfarm employment.
