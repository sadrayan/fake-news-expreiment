Statement, Matt Mackowiak, president, Potomac Strategy Group, LLC, Sept. 24, 2014

9:25 a.m.

I am neither an ‘Abbott strategist’ nor an ‘Abbott surrogate’ and have never claimed to be, so the Davis campaign’s repeated claims of this are false. To the extent that the Davis campaign has intentionally mislead voters about what I said and offended people, I regret that. I do not believe rape or incest is a minor issue and never said that. For any victim of rape or incest, that brutal crime is a major and life-changing issue and the crime deserves to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Rather, I said that rape and incest are a small percentage of abortions. The Davis campaign has intentionally mischaracterized what I said in a desperate attempt to raise money, while selfishly trivializing domestic violence and sexual assault victims by using them to score cheap political points. The Davis campaign has now relentlessly targeted a private citizen for two full days, with thousands of emails, social media postings, online graphics, a speech, a press release and even a press conference demeaning me, based on several blatant falsehoods. It's time for this campaign for Governor to return to a discussion about the future of our great state."
