Health officials say feral cats likely source of hookworm outbreak in Miami Beach
"I went to Miami Beach and all I got was this lousy hookworm" isn't the kind of catchphrase South Florida's biggest tourist destination would want.

But weeks after media reports highlighted a parasitic problem near the city's shores, Miami Beach and Miami-Dade Health Department officials are still trying to get a grasp on conditions contributing to a recent outbreak.

With the winter tourist season kicking off soon — Art Basel starts in little more than a week — Miami Beach is hoping to juggle the twin task of spreading awareness while reassuring beachgoers the hookworms aren't a widespread problem.

"The problem is that with all our dependence on tourism, on money coming in from that source, the last thing you want people to associate with our beaches is that it's a dangerous condition or a dangerous situation," said Victor Conte, senior physician of the Health Department. "That's why we're trying to get a handle on this now before it gets out of hand."

The hookworm infections in humans are blamed mostly on feral and stray cats. Health officials say the infected cats spread microscopic hookworm larvae by defecating on pathways to the west of the beach's sand dunes.

Conte said the Health Department first learned of the problem from a WPLG-Ch.10 reporter in late October. Since then, an investigation has confirmed seven hookworm infections contracted between July and September. Another eight are under investigation, including that of a 3-year-old boy who reportedly contracted the disease this month on the beach off 87th Street.

In response to the findings, authorities say that during the past four weeks, officials with the county, health department and the city of Miami Beach have worked to identify hot spots from 40th to 65th streets, an area expanding out from an outbreak epicenter at 50th Street.
