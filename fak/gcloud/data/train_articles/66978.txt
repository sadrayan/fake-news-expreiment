The ad, produced by American Bridge 21st Century, shows a series of clips of Trump making divisive comments throughout the primary, before he secured the nomination. It follows up with a clip of Kirk saying he’d support Trump if he were the party’s nominee.

Kirk withdrew that support on Tuesday.

“Republicans knew they were endorsing,” on-screen text reads as the ad ends.

Kirk, who is in a difficult Senate reelection race against Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), responded to the ad by tying Duckworth to Trump.

"Ironically, Trump and Duckworth have much more in common than people think," Kirk's campaign manager, Kevin Artl, said in a statement. "Both supported corrupt former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and both are headed to trial."

Duckworth has been accused by two former employees of the state’s Department of Veterans Affairs of retaliating against them while she headed the agency. A trial date has been set for Aug. 15.
