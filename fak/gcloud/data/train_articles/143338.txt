The Anarchist Cookbook: William Powell: 9781684111374: Amazon.com: Books
When I opened the package, I was stunned to find this edition about 1/3 as thick as the original. Thinking that perhaps the publisher had used high quality extremely thin Tyvek "paper" or similar for waterproof purposes, I wasn't too concerned, but decided to Google "Anarchist Cookbook" to find that the original publisher had sold the book and the subsequent publisher had "sanitized" this current edition, in my opinion only, for the sake of continued saleability. I DID NOT take the book from the shrinkwrap, but immediately initiated a return. Do your research and you will see what caused me to return this item.
