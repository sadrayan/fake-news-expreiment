Governor's road map: Kasich will keep turnpike under state control
TOLEDO - Reconstruction of the I-70/71 interchange near Nationwide Children's Hospital could be moved up six years because of a plan announced yesterday by Gov. John Kasich to leverage the Ohio Turnpike. Kasich formally began to sell his plan to finance road projects throughout Ohio by issuing new debt against the 241-mile turnpike, without leasing or selling it, with speeches yesterday in To-ledo, Cleveland and Youngstown - three northern Ohio communities with very real financial and emotional ties to the toll road.

TOLEDO � Reconstruction of the I-70/71 interchange near Nationwide Children�s Hospital could be moved up six years because of a plan announced yesterday by Gov. John Kasich to leverage the Ohio Turnpike.

Kasich formally began to sell his plan to finance road projects throughout Ohio by issuing new debt against the 241-mile turnpike, without leasing or selling it, with speeches yesterday in To-ledo, Cleveland and Youngstown � three northern Ohio communities with very real financial and emotional ties to the toll road.

But Kasich�s tour will take him to the Columbus hospital today to further illustrate how his turnpike-leverage plan could help the entire state. By generating $1.5?billion through new debt issuances and another $1?billion to $1.5 billion through matching local and federal funds, Kasich would move to accelerate road projects that were delayed by several years when the state discovered a $1.6?billion shortfall for outstanding road construction. Assuming $2.5 billion in spending on highway improvements, Kasich estimated that his plan would create 65,000 jobs over the next six years

Among the projects delayed was reconstruction of the I-70/71 corridor Downtown, a project that originally was planned to begin in 2014 but was delayed until 2020.Now, the administration is hopeful many projects like that one can return to their original start dates or close to them because of the turnpike plan.

�You�re going to have all these projects get done, that�s what it�s going to mean,� Kasich said.

Under Kasich�s proposal, which closely resembled the plan reported earlier this week in The Dispatch, a vast majority of the new toll-road revenue generated would be spent on road projects in �northern Ohio� � a term state Transportation Director Jerry Wray loosely defined as projects north of Rt. 30.

Using the turnpike cash in northern Ohio would free up state gas-tax revenue and federal dollars to fund projects in other areas of the state. The Transportation Review Advisory Council, which approves major road projects for funding, still would need to approve a new timeline for projects, so the administration couldn�t say definitively yesterday when Columbus-area projects would begin.

Kasich�s plan includes leaving the turnpike under the control of the Ohio Turnpike Commission � a public governing body that�s separate from the Kasich administration but will be expanded to represent a new partnership with the Department of Transportation.

Tolls for frequent turnpike users would be frozen for 10 years and would rise for everyone else at the rate of inflation. Kasich chose this plan instead of a 50-year lease of the turnpike, which according to Texas firm KPMG�s $3.4 million turnpike study could�ve netted the state $1.8 billion up front and $4 billion over the full term of the lease.

�If we�d leased this, we probably would get more money, potentially, but we would�ve paid a premium of losing control,� the governor said. �And I think people�s concerns about losing control are very legitimate.�

Kasich added: �It�s stunning to me that this hasn�t been done in the last 20, 25, 30 years.�K asich would need the legislature to change Ohio law so that turnpike revenue could be spent more than 1?mile from the toll road.

His choice might have avoided the most politically vexing option of leasing the road to a private entity � an option not only opposed by Democrats and northern Ohio residents but Republican legislators in the region � but didn�t head off a furious spin game from proponents and opponents following Kasich�s Toledo stop.

Ohio Democratic Chairman Chris Redfern called Kasich�s plan �cockamamie� and Rep. John Patrick Carney, D-Columbus, said Kasich aimed to �create an election-year slush fund� � a statement the administration rebuffed.

Among those who attended Kasich�s news conferences in support of his plan were Toledo Mayor Mike Bell and Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, a Democrat. Statements of support also were distributed by the Kasich administration from numerous local political leaders and statewide trucking, engineering and contractors groups.

Gary M. Tiboni, president of Teamsters Local 436, which represents all of the 700 to 800 maintenance and toll workers on the turnpike, said, �I don�t support everything the governor does, but on this issue he�s doing the right thing.� Kasich�s plan does not call for layoffs. It was feared that a turnpike privatization or direct takeover by ODOT would result in involuntary work-force reductions.

Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, a Democrat and potential 2014 challenger to Kasich who had been exploiting the governor�s exploration of a lease, issued a joint statement with individual county commissioners from Lorain, Erie and Mahoning counties that said, �We are pleased that our efforts to provide venues for public comment have deflected the governor�s misguided attempt to privatize the Ohio Turnpike and that he now recommends maintaining the Turnpike and all its revenue as public assets.�

Kasich�s turnpike proposal

A road map for Gov. John Kasich�s Ohio Turnpike plan :

� Control of the 241-mile turnpike would stay with a revamped Ohio Turnpike Commission � a public entity that will expand to represent a new partnership with the Department of Transportation.

� There would be no sale or lease of the turnpike.

� The state would issue $1.5 billion in new debt backed by future turnpike revenue and generate an additional $1 billion to $1.5 billion in matching local and federal funds to pay for state road projects.

� The Turnpike commission still would be responsible for $566 million in current debt

� The plan would create 65,000 jobs through road projects over six years.

� Tolls for frequent turnpike users would be frozen for 10 years, and toll increases for others would be at the rate of inflation.

� There would be no turnpike employee layoffs.

� Accelerated reconstruction of turnpike�s road base would take place.
