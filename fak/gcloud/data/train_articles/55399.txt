Photo Essay: The Things They Left Behind
But to their families, they are loved ones who’ve gone missing. In 2013, 31-year-old Exelina Hernandez fled El Salvador and the gang members who were threatening her. Hernandez traveled for three weeks to reach the Texas border and then found herself on that same dangerous walk around the checkpoint. Along the way, she befriended an older woman in their group. Once the group reached Houston, the woman called Hernandez’s mother, Elsy, with devastating news. “The men carried her on their backs,” the woman said. “Even one of the smugglers carried her for a while. They didn’t want to leave her, but they just couldn’t carry her anymore, and she couldn’t walk. … We prayed with your daughter. I told her, ‘Don’t give up. Think of your children. They are waiting for you.’” Two years later, Elsy is still waiting for someone to tell her where her daughter is.

Such stories inspired this photo essay. These objects belonged to real people — people who wanted to play baseball with their kids, or propose to their love, or see their parents again, and were willing to risk their lives to do so. We should feel compelled to ask why.

We also realized that these photos could do more than build awareness; they could help families identify and recover their loved ones. This realization has inspired another project: We are building a database that includes images of personal belongings and information gleaned from the forensic work of Baker’s team. Although we can’t include all of the cases under review in Texas, we’ve committed to photo documentation of items found with remains currently under Baylor’s supervision. The online tool will be searchable by keyword in both Spanish and English. We hope the project, which we’re calling “I Have a Name/Yo Tengo Nombre,” will contribute to efforts to restore identity to the deceased and bring closure to their families.

CASE 0354

The remains are presumed to be female. The femur shows a massive break that was surgically repaired with a metal rod inserted into the bone. The body was found in a sundress and slippers. Homemade slings, used to carry water, are commonly found on the ranches traversed by migrants.

CASE 0435

The remains are presumed to be male and were found February 9, 2012, on the Laborcitas Creek Ranch, 1.2 miles from the nearest road. They were exhumed from the Sacred Heart Cemetery in Falfurrias on May 23, 2013. All items were found in the blue backpack.

CASE 0517

The remains, exhumed from the Sacred Heart Cemetery in 2014, have not yet been identified as male or female. Found with them were this key chain and necklace, as well as a bag of buttons.

CASE 0408

The remains are presumed to be male, aged 35 to 56, and were found on November 3, 2009, on the Coldwell Ranch. They were exhumed from the Sacred Heart Cemetery on May 26, 2013. The ring was sewn into the waistband of a pair of pants, and a brand tag was still attached to the stuffed lion.

CASE 0462

The remains are presumed to be male, aged 30 to 50, and were found January 7, 2013, on the Laborcitas Creek Ranch about 2 miles from the nearest road. The ball of the femur shows severe damage, possibly related to an untreated hip break or fracture. The Baylor lab team noted that walking with this injury would be extremely painful.
