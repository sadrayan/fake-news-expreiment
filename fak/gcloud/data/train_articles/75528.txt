RE: Your plan to end gun violence Dear Governor, The mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut is a painful reminder of the dangerous gap between what we’re doing and what we should be doing to prevent gun violence. Among the most glaring of our failures is the fact that hundreds of thousands of records of prohibited purchasers are missing from the background check system. The shooter at Virginia Tech was a prohibited purchaser under federal law, but he was able to buy the guns he used to kill 32 people because his mental health record was never submitted to the national database. More than five years later, people with severe mental illness can still purchase an arsenal of deadly weapons because many states haven’t submitted all relevant records to the background check system. I commend my Governor for making it a top priority to submit all of our state’s mental health records to the national do-not-sell gun database. But too many states are not doing enough, and every missing record is another tragedy waiting to happen.

If leaders at the state and federal levels make it a priority, we can keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. So I’m concerned that our state has failed to submit all the records of residents who’ve been deemed too mentally unstable to buy guns to the national background check system. And every missing record is another tragedy waiting to happen. That’s why I’m writing to demand a plan to end gun violence that includes fixing the broken background check system.
