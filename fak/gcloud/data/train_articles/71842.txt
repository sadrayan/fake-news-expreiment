Boardman & Clark
People are choosing to change the way they settle their family law disputes. They are choosing to resolve the matters more humanely, more efficiently, and more creatively. Marta and the other members of the Boardman Family Law Group are on the cutting edge of family law in Wisconsin and can help clients achieve these solutions.

Marta Meyers counsels clients in family law, and works with clients in all process options, including collaborative law, mediation and more traditional negotiation/litigation. Marta served on Boardman & Clark’s Executive Committee for 10 years and relinquished this position at the end of 2015.
