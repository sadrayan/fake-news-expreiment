The last critically injured Parkland shooting patient has improved, hospital says
A patient from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting who had life-threatening injuries has recovered and is now in fair condition, according to Broward Health officials.

“This is an important milestone for this patient and our care team,” said Igor Nichiporenko, medical director of trauma services at Broward Health North Hospital.

Wednesday’s shooting at the school claimed the lives of 17 students and staff.

Two patients remain at that hospital in fair condition and two other patients are also in fair condition at Broward Health Medical Center. The previous update from Broward Health came on Friday and listed the critical case and six others in fair condition.

Broward Sheriff Scott Israel visited one of the injured who was shot five times. Israel tweeted a picture of himself with Anthony Borges, 15, in the hospital. “Fortunately, he is recovering, but has a long road ahead with more surgeries needed,” the tweet said.

President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited Broward Health North Hospital on Friday and spoke with victims and hospital staff.

The hospital is about nine miles from the school and received 17 people following Wednesday’s shooting, including two who died.

Broward County Schools announced that the school will remain closed through Wednesday, Feb. 21.
