Pedophile Priest With HIV Who Raped 30 Children, Found Crucified Outside Church

Catholic priest killed by vigilante gang after being forgiven by the church

Now, it seems as though his past has caught up with him after his dead body was found crucified outside his new church in a rural area of Villa Alta.

As part of Pope Francis 's "more merciful" approach to child abusing clergy, Ataulfo was relocated to a different church to seek "prayer and forgiveness for his sins."

Ataulfo was cleared of any wrong-doing by the church and didn't face any criminal charges, despite the fact that he knew he was infected with HIV when he sexually abused all the children he is known to have raped.

Ataulfo was found tied from a wooden beam that was hanging from a large tree branch by members of his congregation who had arrived for Sunday mass to find the church closed.

According to local police , he had been beaten before he was crucified and his genitals had been "removed" and placed in his mouth.

He also had hot road tar poured onto the top of his head which appears to have been done as "torture" after he was hung up but while he was still alive.

His robes had been removed and burned on the floor and he had been dressed in rags and had a wooden plaque nailed to his hand that was engraved with the words:

"I am no man of God "I am a demon. "I will pay for my crimes in hell."

Police believe that he may have been killed by the violent drug gang known as the "Knights Templar."

The Knights Templar Cartel (Spanish: Los Caballeros Templarios) is a Mexican criminal organization composed of remnants of the defunct La Familia Michoacana drug cartel and are known for their brutal executions.

According to local media reports, it is thought that Ataulfo may have had a "price on his head" for his past crimes and the cartel may have been tipped-off as to where he had been relocated to.
