How the Trump team’s Stormy Daniels story shifted again and again
July 8, 2018

As far as I know, from his original statements, and the president’s statements, and everything I’ve seen in terms of documents ... the president did not originally know.”

Rudolph W. Giuliani

Speaking on ABC news, Giuliani appears appears to hedge his answer with an “as far as I know” when asked whether Trump knew in advance about the payment to Stormy Daniels. The Trump team has said several times that the president had no knowledge of the payment before it was made. Giuliani then adds a curious justification for if Trump did know beforehand: “Even if he had, that would not necessarily be anything. ... That’s something you settle because you don’t want your family to be embarrassed.”
