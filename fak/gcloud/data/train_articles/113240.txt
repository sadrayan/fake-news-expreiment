Pop Tab Fun Facts The Ronald McDonald House Pop Tab Collection Program was established in 1987 by the Minneapolis/St. Paul Ronald McDonald House community.

To date, over 400 million pop tabs have been collected, generating over $300,000.

The ring-pull can known today was invented in 1962.

The pop tab was invented by Mr. Ermal Fraze in Kettering, Ohio.
