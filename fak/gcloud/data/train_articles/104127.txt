Patriots Coach Bill Belichick Just Fined Kneeling Player $1 Million Dollars
Coaches are starting to take a stand against anti-American kneeling players. We saw a blow dealt to Patriots rookie lineman Tyrone Blackman, a black fifth-round draft pick who thought he could make himself famous by kneeling during the National Anthem.

Unfortunately for Blackman, coach Bill Belichick ruined his year. Blackman, who currently makes $973,773 per season, found himself hit with a fine that was outlined in his contract. According to ESPN:

Blackman’s contract states that he will “stand on the field with his hand over his heart as the National Anthem plays.” Blackman violated this clause on Sunday, which triggered a fine laid out in the contract of nearly $1,000,000 per offense or “1/4 of the contracted salary.” Blackman was signed to a four-year deal earlier this year.

While Belichick made the call to fire him, the fine is subject to approval by the Patriots Board of Directors, who endorsed the decision in a meeting held via teleconference two hours later. Since there is no appeal process, this means that Blackman will be playing for free this year almost like an indentured servant.

Maybe this will help teach other players who hate America to think twice before they throw a middle finger up at our troops and law enforcement by disrespecting our flag and anthem.

It’s time to make football great again!
