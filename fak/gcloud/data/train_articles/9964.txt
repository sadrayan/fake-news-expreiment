Percentage of high school seniors reporting drug use, by type of drug and reporting period: Selected years, 1975 through 2009
—Not available.

†Not applicable.

1 Survey question changed in 1993; later data are not comparable to figures for earlier years.

2 Other illicit drugs include any use of LSD or other hallucinogens, crack or other cocaine, or heroin, or any use of other narcotics, amphetamines, barbiturates, or tranquilizers not under a doctor's orders.

NOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Standard errors appear in parentheses. Standard errors were calculated from formulas to perform trend analysis over an interval greater than 1 year (for example, a comparison between 1975 and 1990). A revised questionnaire was used in 1982 and later years to reduce the inappropriate reporting of nonprescription stimulants. This slightly reduced the positive responses for some types of drug abuse.
