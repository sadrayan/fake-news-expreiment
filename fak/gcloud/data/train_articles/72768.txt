MLB Salaries
Payrolls and average salaries for the 2013 Opening Day rosters of the 30 major-league teams. Figures are based on documents obtained from the MLB Players Association, club officials and filed with Major League Baseball's central office. Deferred payments and incentive clauses are not included. Team payrolls do not include money paid or received in trades or for players who have been released. In some cases, parts of salaries deferred without interest are discounted to reflect present-day values.
