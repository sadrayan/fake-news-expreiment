Man arrested for human trafficking by Humble Police
The Humble Police Department detained several individuals after they received a disturbance call from a wrecker driver following a speeding car with a tire missing.

The wrecker driver had followed the vehicle to the park near the Phillip Cezeaux Recreation building at the 100 block of N. Houston Avenue and called Humble PD.

“When the officers arrived at the park, the wrecker driver said he heard a loud pop and then saw the car driving at a high rate of speed with no tire. He followed the car and called us immediately,” Humble Police Department Detective Mike Flynt said. “Once officers arrived at the park, they interviewed the suspects and determined the suspect was transporting several illegal aliens to a meet up location with another group.”

Jesse James Castillo, 33, was arrest on a charge of trafficking of a person and was transported as well as two teens and two adults who were in the United States illegally by Homeland Security for further investigation.
