Virginia Senator Tim Kaine has won his re-election bid and will continue to represent the state in Congress alongside fellow Democrat Mark Warner.

Kaine, an attorney and Virginiaâ€™s junior senator since 2013, was challenged by Corey Stewart, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, at-large chairman of the Board of County Supervisors in Prince William County and international trade attorney.



Kaine had the typical advantages of an incumbent candidate and a huge cash advantage over Stewart.

Stewart's campaign was drama-laden. He started off with promises of running a "vicious" and "ruthless" campaign, and later launched personal attacks on Kaine and his son.

Republicans openly worried that he would hurt down-ballot candidates facing stiff competition in several Virginia congressional districts.

Once considered a key swing state, Virginia has become a reliable win for Democrats.

Hillary Clinton won the state comfortably in the 2016 presidential election, with Kaine on her ticket as the vice presidential candidate, and Democrats have won every statewide office since 2009.

Kaine, who is also a former Virginia governor and lieutenant governor, has never lost a statewide election there.
