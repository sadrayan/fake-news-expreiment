...please find attached a copy of the spreadsheet I set earlier. I have also included a letter I wrote that specifically talks about the budgeted costs of the case and the effect upon the tax rate and tax amounts. I did testify in a Bill King pre-trial hearing on this issue related to a motion by the defense to have the District Judge recused from hearing the case because of potential bias caused by the tax increase on his homestead.

I think this is about as direct to the point as we are going to get. There was not a set aside of a portion of the total tax rate dedicated only for that expense, as the tax collections go to help fund the total budget.

1) Is it your judgment the tax rate was increased to accommodate the trial and appeal costs or no? If yes, to what degree? If no, why not?

Yes, using 2-cents that I used in the letter, then the increase for the budgeted amount would calculate to 6.05% of the 7.25% I highlighted in the chart. So you could say that taxes were increased due to the trial costs by 6.05%. Not to get too wrapped up in numbers, but that means that 83% of the increase was due to the budgeted trial costs [6.05% divided by 7.25%].

2) Finally, did you create the tax-rate chart you emailed to me thanks to our inquiry or should I say it came from your files? If the latter, what date was the chart created, approximately?

Yes, I created the chart as a result of your inquiry, but all the numbers came from my files for each of those tax years. The chart was created 6/26/2015.

Thanks,

David Luther
