Unilever PLC will be taking its first step in the U.S. hemp market in September, when its subsidiary brand Schmidt's Naturals launches a line of hemp-oil deodorants that will be available at certain retailers. That line will be followed later in the fall by a range of CBD products, according to Schmidt's Naturals CEO, Michael Cammarata. CBD, a non-intoxicating ingredient in the cannabis and hemp plant, has come under the purview of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, who do not allow it to be added to food, beverages or cosmetics, for now. The FDA has promised to hold talks this month on regulation of CBD, which it views as a drug because it's included in the only cannabis-based drug that has won FDA approval as a treatment for severe forms of childhood epilepsy. "We are working with our supply chain to ensure that we comply with FDA and state rules," Cammarata told MarketWatch. Schmidt's Naturals has been working on a CBD line for a year and a half, he said and is looking to ensure a consistent, high-quality supply of the ingredient. U.S.-listed shares of Unilever were down 0.5% Tuesday, but have gained about 8% in 2019, while the S&P 500 has gained 15%.
