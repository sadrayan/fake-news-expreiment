Health care for poor rescued
It appears that Gov. Tim Pawlenty blinked.

A compromise state health plan for the very poor, on the verge of collapse just a few days ago, was rescued this week when the Pawlenty administration changed course and negotiated with participating hospitals to limit the number of patients each will see.

As a result, Hennepin County Medical Center and three other metro hospitals will participate in a slimmed-down version of General Assistance Medical Care (GAMC), a health plan for thousands of Minnesota's poorest and sickest residents. The four hospitals serve about 47 percent of the current 36,426 enrollees, none outstate. The remaining 144 Minnesota hospitals will treat patients and dip into a $20 million fund for that purpose.

The agreements reached Thursday were critical for Pawlenty because legislators are pressing hard to expand the federal-state Medicaid program to cover those patients -- a move he strongly opposes. A program in shambles would strengthen their hand.

With a limit of 9,400 patients a month and $32 million to finance their care, Hennepin County Medical Center and the Hennepin County Board voted Thursday to participate in the revamped program, which starts in three weeks. A few weeks ago, only one of the 17 key hospitals, Regions Hospital in St. Paul, had said it might participate.

The Hennepin County hospital cares for more than a fourth of all GAMC patients, far more than any other. Its agreement brought in three others -- Regions, North Memorial and the University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview in Minneapolis. They will divvy up $71 million that was to go to the 17 hospitals. Other hospitals may join the program on Dec. 1.

First hint from Pawlenty

Until early this week, Pawlenty held firm against changes in the stripped-down health program, a compromise he reached with DFL legislators in March after vetoing a different extension of the 35-year-old GAMC.
