Tillis Tries To Rewrite History In New Ad - Kay Hagan for U.S. Senate
TILLIS’ CLAIM THAT HE “FIRED” HIS DISGRACED STAFFERS IS FALSE – HE REPEATEDLY USED THE TERM “RESIGNED” AND EXPLICITLY USED THAT POINT TO DEFEND HIS $19,000 IN SEVERANCE PACKAGES

TILLIS DID NOT DISPUTE THE KEY FACTS OF THE SCANDAL – WHICH ARE TRUE – THAT HE GAVE HIS DISGRACED STAFFERS TAXPAYER FUNDED GOLDEN PARACHUTES AFTER THEY HAD AFFAIRS WITH LOBBYISTS

VO: “Seen those ads attacking Thom Tillis? They’re false.” Visual: FALSE VO: “Tillis fired the staffers.” Visual: TILLIS FIRED THE STAFFERS
