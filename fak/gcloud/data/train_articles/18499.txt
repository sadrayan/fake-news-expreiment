Walking Eagle

President Bush was given the Indian name of "WALKING EAGLE" - Possibly an urban myth.



President Bush was invited to address a major gathering of the American Indian Nation last weekend in Arizona. He spoke for almost an hour on his future plans for increasing every Native American's present standard of living. He referred to his career as Governor of Texas, how he had signed "YES" 1,237 times - for every Indian issue that came to his desk for approval.



Although the President was vague on the details of his plan, he seemed most enthusiastic about his future ideas for helping his "red brothers".



At the conclusion of his speech, the Tribes presented the President with a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name - Walking Eagle. The proud President then departed in his motorcade, waving to the crowds. A news reporter later inquired to the group of chiefs of how they come to select the new name given to the President.



They explained that Walking Eagle is the name given to a bird so full of shit it can no longer fly.
