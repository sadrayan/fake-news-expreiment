See How Gay Baboon Terrorizes South African Village, Rapes 5 Men And Inflicts Them With Anal Cancer
There is panic as men at a village in the North West are leaving in fear over a big male baboon that likes to grope and have sex human males.

The baboon is said to have attacked more than six men in the recently. Baffling, the baboon only attacks guys, and does not hurt its victims. It rather performs sexual acts on top of the terrified victim, and leaves.

A victim, George Chiune, said that he was coming from the local shebeen when the baboon attacked him, and pinned him down.

“I thought it wanted to kill me, but realised it was after my bum,” Chiune said.

Five men were admitted to hospital yesterday , after experiencing acute anal pains and fatigue.

Doctors confirmed that the men have anal cancer.

The baboon, which has been nicknamed Somizi, travels alone.

This, according to animal behaviour specialist, is a strange occurrence because baboons are known to ravel in troops.

“The baboon might be an outcast, and chased away from its troop. That is why it is travelling alone; but as to the reason it’s attacking only males, it beats me. I have never seen that behaviour in my 20 years in this field,” a specialist, Lizzie McKenzie, said.

When journalists visited the village, all male school kids were said to be wearing dresses as a preventative measure until the baboon has been dealt with.
