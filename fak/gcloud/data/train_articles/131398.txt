ABOUT – America's Last Line of Defense
America’s Last Line of Defense is a whimsical playland of conservative satire.

Before you complain and decide satire is synonymous with “comedy”:

sat·ire

ˈsaˌtī(ə)r

noun The use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people’s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.

We realize that our approach to satire may not be what you might expect, as the articles on our websites are completely fictional versions of the real world as viewed by those on the political right. They are — if you would look a little more closely — full of hints, clues and such ridiculous content that not taking the time to Google before sharing them as news would be asinine.

That alone qualifies this content as satire. That is not, however, where it ends. This particular brand of satire is a two-part process. Participation in the comments section of the Facebook Page “America’s Last Line Of Defense” is required to fully understand who we are and what we do.

If you don’t enjoy this sort of thing and think it’s just the worst thing you’ve ever seen, please just move along.
