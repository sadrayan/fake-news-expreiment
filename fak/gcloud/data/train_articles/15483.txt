Thanks for the interview the other day.

I failed to ask if a couple of specific portions of the department’s new policy lessen or restrict its compliance with 8 USC 1373. If not, why not?

That is, the department policy says “TCSO officials shall not conduct or initiate any immigration status investigation into individuals in TCSO custody or provide information on an inmate’s release date or address to ICE.” The policy also says: “No TCSO personnel… may inquire about a person’s immigration status.”

To refresh, the federal law bars any local law agency from restricting any agency or official from sending to, or receiving from, federal immigration authorities “information regarding the citizenship status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”

I was glad to participate in last week’s interview.

Regarding the additional questions posed, the new policy is not intended to restrict compliance with the noted statute, and our agency is certain that we are in compliance. The segments you are referring to are there to ensure TCSO staff do not conduct their own investigation regarding someone’s immigration status. Information regarding citizenship or immigration status is readily shared with ICE upon that agency’s request. Additionally, as noted in our interview, biometric data (fingerprints) is shared via our automated fingerprint information system upon inmate intake.

I hope this helps.
