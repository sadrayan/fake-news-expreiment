What does 134 tons of marijuana on fire look like?
The army and law enforcement authorities in Mexico staged a media event on Wednesday and set ablaze 134 tons of marijuana seized earlier this week.

Authorities said that the stash, enough to make several hundred million joints, was the largest ever seized in Mexico and was worth around $200-million. The pot was seized on Monday after Mexican soldiers fought off members of that country’s notorious drug cartels.

From the Los Angeles Times:

“Think of all the people who won’t be able to smoke this dope,” Noe Lenin Rubio Torres said at the military’s formal burning ceremony Wednesday. “Only the little angels in heaven are going to get stoned tonight,” said fellow soldier Lucio Rangel.

The bales of marijuana took hours to unload and set up and the fires gave off a massive plume of smoke that could be seen (and smelled) for miles. The bonfire is expected to last up to two days. No word on whether nearby convenience stores and restaurants saw a rise in business.

The New York Times

points out that the flashy display is meant as a morale booster for a country weary of a long and often bloody crackdown on powerful drug cartels. What impact this seizure has on the criminal organizations is unknown.

From their story:

Left unsaid was how the marijuana made it so close to the border or how much goes undiscovered — the neat, orderly bundling and labeling made clear the sophisticated smuggling and distribution system that remains in tact despite the government’s crackdown.
