Hello again. Readers have asked us to verify this claim about extra stars on Cowboy helmets.

Is it accurate? Why or why not?

Thanks.

Actor James Woods said in a tweet, at the link I sent, that the Dallas Cowboys “can’t put a sticker on helmets” for the five killed Dallas police officers. Is he right? Why or why not?

Thank you.

The NFL has a uniform code and any adjustment to the uniform needs to be approved by the NFL.
