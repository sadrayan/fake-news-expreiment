Charleston GOP head falls for Putin hoax
Lin Bennett is on my shit list. Right now, she's somewhere between litterbugs and rabies, which is like way, way, way up there.

It all started when Bennett, the head of the Charleston County GOP, got all conspiracy sex nuts and let her Twitter followers know that Obama is giving out free cell phones to those who promise to vote for him in November. Then to make matters worse, Bennett doubled down on the claim, repeatedly stating the charge well after it was proven to be a heaping mound of bullshit.

Now, she's fallen victim to another hoax, this one involving Vladimir Putin.

Bennett's link leads to Godlike Productions, which makes the Free Republic look like an authoritative news source. As for the story that Bennett wants the mainstream media to cover, well, it goes a little something like this:

MOSCOW (SR) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has warned the Obama administration against adopting further socialism, saying Russian history clearly proves it is a recipe for failure. “Any fourth grade history student knows socialism has failed in every country, at every time in history,” said Putin. “President Obama and his fellow Democrats are either idiots or deliberately trying to destroy their own economy.” Economists say Putin’s comments serve to illustrate how worldwide markets have made even economic adversaries dependent on each other’s financial stability. An Obama spokesman dismissed Putin’s claim, saying, “We’re going to do socialism better.”

Geez oh Petes, Lin, how in the hell did you fall for that?

To make matters worse, this, um, report apparently originated on Scooter's Report, a blog-type thing jam packed with racist images of President Obama and the First Lady. You can find Scooter's Putin-Obama post here, but I strongly encourage you to look at the most recent posts.
