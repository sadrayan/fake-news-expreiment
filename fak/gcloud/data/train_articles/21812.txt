American voters disapprove of the pending Republican tax plan 55 - 26 percent, and 43 percent say they are less likely to vote for a U.S. Senator or Congressperson who supports the plan, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. Another 18 percent say they are more likely to vote for someone who supports the plan and 35 percent say support for the tax plan won't matter.





Republicans support the tax plan 66 - 11 percent. Every other party, gender, education, age and racial group listed opposes the plan, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University Poll finds.





Only 16 percent of American voters say the tax plan will reduce their taxes, while 44 percent say it will increase their taxes and 30 percent say the tax plan will have little impact.





The wealthy will benefit most from the tax plan, 65 percent of voters say. The middle class will benefit most, 21 percent say, and 4 percent say low-income people will benefit most.





On another pending issue, 77 percent of American voters say undocumented children brought to the U.S. as children should be allowed to stay and to apply for citizenship.





Another 7 percent say these immigrants should be allowed to stay, but not apply for citizenship and 12 percent say they should be required to leave the U.S.





"American voters pan the tax plan making its way through Congress towards President Donald Trump's desk - and warn candidates it could be a poison pill at the polling place," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.





"Empathy for the immigrants in blunt terms and big numbers. Voters say don't dump the DACA kids and forget about building that wall."





American voters oppose 62 - 36 percent building a wall on the border with Mexico. Support for the wall is 83 - 14 percent among Republicans and 52 - 45 percent among white voters with no college degree. Among white men, 50 percent support the wall, with 47 percent opposed. All white voters oppose the wall 53 - 45 percent. Also opposing the wall are black voters 94 - 5 percent and Hispanic voters 81 - 19 percent.





The abortion issue continues to divide the nation, with stronger support among women and younger voters:

21 percent of voters, including 28 percent of voters 18 to 34 years old, say abortion should be legal in all cases;

39 percent of voters, including 42 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds, say it should be legal in most cases;

22 percent of voters, including 18 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds, say it should be illegal in most cases;

12 percent of voters, including 9 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds, say it should be illegal in all cases.

From December 6 - 11, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,211 voters nationwide with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points, including the design effect. Live interviewers call landlines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts nationwide public opinion surveys, and statewide polls in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa and Colorado as a public service and for research.
