Donald Trump's first TV ad in Florida focuses on immigration
Donald Trump has released his first TV ad of the general election in Florida and other swing states.

The ad "Two Americas: Immigration" contrasts the immigration positions of Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Here is the script: "In Hillary Clinton’s America: The system stays rigged against Americans. Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay. Collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open. It’s more of the same, but worse. Donald Trump’s America is secure. Terrorists and dangerous criminals: kept out. The border: secured. Our families: safe. Change that makes America safe again."

The text on the screen quotes Clinton saying in September "U.S. should take 65,000 Syrian refugees." Clinton said in response to the refugee crisis that the U.S. should raise the number of refugees taken in from 10,000 to 65,000. But she also made it clear that the U.S. shouldn't just blindly take in anyone from Syria.

Trump also has repeatedly said that Clinton wants open borders -- a claim PolitiFact Florida has ruled False.

The campaign is spending $4.8 million to air the ad for 10 days in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.
