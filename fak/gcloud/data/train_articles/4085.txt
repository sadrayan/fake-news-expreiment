Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget

Loren Adler is Research Director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, where he leads research and analysis on a wide variety of fiscal policy issues, primarily focusing on health care, budget, and tax policy. Prior to joining the Committee, Loren spent nearly four years as a senior policy analyst for the Bipartisan Policy Center and Domenici-Rivlin Debt Reduction Task Force. He co-authored the Domenici-Rivlin report, Restoring America’s Future, and A Bipartisan Rx for Patient-Centered Care and System-Wide Cost Containment, co-chaired by Dr. Alice Rivlin and Senators Tom Daschle, Pete Domenici, and Bill Frist. Working with now Federal Reserve Board Governor, Jerome Powell, and other BPC staff, he analyzed Treasury Department and Congressional Budget Office data to predict the timing of the debt ceiling and the consequences of exhausting “extraordinary measures.” Before moving to Washington D.C., he worked for NERA Economic Consulting, where he performed economic analysis for antitrust and regulation cases, and for Goldman Sachs with the Commodities Research group. Loren received his bachelor’s degree in Mathematical Economics from Wesleyan University. Contact him at adler[at]crfb.org and find him on Twitter at @LorenAdler.
