Trump hosting another fundraiser for Crist
Despite criticism that he's focused too much on fundraising and not enough on governing, Gov. Charlie Crist continues to mingle with the rich and famous. Billionaire Donald Trump is hosting a $1,000-per-person reception on Dec. 11 for Crist's Senate campaign at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.

Trump has hosted Crist before and co-hosted a reception for him in New York earlier this year.
