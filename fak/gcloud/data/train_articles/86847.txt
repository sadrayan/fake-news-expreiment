Bill to Ease Puerto Rico Debt Crisis Introduced in House
“If the board is able to impose taxes and reduce services and to fire people from their jobs, it would not only be undemocratic but it would also be unfair,” he said, adding that he had not yet had a chance to read the bill and did not want to evaluate it until he knew what was in the details.

Mr. Pierluisi had expressed reservations about the first draft of the bill, saying it had modeled its oversight board too closely after the one Congress established for the District of Columbia when it needed financial assistance in the 1990s. That board is now considered a success for the District, but it was “not sufficiently tailored or calibrated for Puerto Rico’s specific situation,” Mr. Pierluisi said.

In a statement on Tuesday, he said, “The oversight board section of the bill has been dramatically improved in terms of substance and clarity.” He added that he was not yet ready to comment on the provisions of the bill that were adopted from the bankruptcy code and set the framework for Puerto Rico to reduce its debt to an affordable level.

Mr. Pierluisi, a Democrat and a member of Puerto Rico’s pro-statehood party, is running for governor this year; Governor García Padilla, who favors the island’s continued status as a United States territory, is not seeking a second term.

The new bill also contains a provision that would ultimately let Puerto Rico impose the terms of a broad debt settlement even on holdout creditors. Normally, such legal powers are available only in bankruptcy. But Puerto Rico and its supporters in Congress and in the Obama administration have argued that without the power to force settlements on resistant creditors, the island is likely to be hounded by dissidents for years, much the way Argentina has been.
