CALL PAUL RYAN: The GOP tax plan shouldn't say when life begins!
House Republicans are quickly moving to pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan. This is another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights.

Leading the charge has been House Speaker Paul Ryan. Instead of proposing a tax bill that will make college affordable or help Americans grow their families by adopting, him and the anti-choice GOP want to define when life begins. Scientists and families should determine when life begins, not Ryan or the Republican Party.

NARAL Pro-Choice America is calling him out! Shame on him for pushing his anti-choice extremism in a TAX BILL. Will you call his office to share your frustrations as a constituent?
