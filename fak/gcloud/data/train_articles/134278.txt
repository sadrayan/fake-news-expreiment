City of Tshwane
Unqualified Opinion No Findings The Auditor-General can state, without reservation, that the financial statements of the municipality fairly represent the financial position of the municipality and are in line with Generally Recognised Accounting Practices (GRAP)



Unqualified Opinion Emphasis of Matter Items Same as an Unqualified Opinion with no findings, but the Auditor-General wants to bring something particular to the attention of the reader.



Qualified Opinion The Auditor-General expresses reservations about the fair presentation of the financial statements. There is some departure from the Generally Recognised Accounting Practices (GRAP) but is not sufficiently serious as to warrant an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion.



Adverse Opinion This is expressed when the auditor concludes that the annual financial statements do not present the municipalityâ€™s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in line with Generally Recognised Accounting Practices (GRAP).



Disclaimer of Opinion The Auditor-General does not have all of the underlying documentation needed to determine an opinion. For example, the lack of underlying documentation and the amounts in question may be so great so that it is impossible to give any opinion on all.
