Portman: Minimum wage plan won't work
WASHINGTON - Sen. Rob Portman indicated yesterday he would oppose President Barack Obama's call for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, saying it could discourage companies from hiring younger workers.

WASHINGTON � Sen. Rob Portman indicated yesterday he would oppose President Barack Obama�s call for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, saying it could discourage companies from hiring younger workers.

In a conference call with Ohio reporters, Portman, R-Ohio, said he might consider an increase in the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour if it were attached to �a package which would include incentives to hire.�

But he warned that �if we raise the minimum wage too high and too fast, you�ll have less employment,� adding that �the reality is just over half the people on minimum wage are young people between 16 and 24. A lot of them are folks who need that work.�

Portman�s opposition puts him at odds with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who has campaigned energetically for an increase in the minimum wage.

Brown said last month that Ohio workers earning the state�s minimum wage of $7.95 an hour make roughly $16,000 a year, which he said �isn�t much to live on when you�re trying to put food on the table, fill your gas tank, send your children to school, and provide a safe place for them to live."

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 4.5 million people age 16 or older who were paid an hourly wage in 2010 were paid at or just below the federal minimum wage. Federal law exempts some workers from the minimum wage, such as small-farm workers and baby sitters.

But the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal nonprofit organization in Washington, said increasing the federal minimum wage could lead to raises for as many as 30 million hourly workers.

That is because Ohio and many other states have a higher minimum wage than the federal law requires but lower than Obama�s proposed $10.10 an hour.
