Pfizer and Aid Groups Team Up on Contraceptive for Developing World
Depo-Provera is typically injected into the muscle by health care workers who must first draw the drug into a syringe from a glass vial. The new product has been reformulated into a lower dose and uses an existing device, called a Uniject system, that looks like a plastic bubble with a short needle attached. It is injected under the skin by squeezing the bubble, and can be administered with minimal training.

“You can imagine somebody sticking this in their satchel and going into a very remote area,” said Peter Stevenson, vice president for portfolio management at Pfizer’s Global Established Pharmaceuticals.

The product is already in use in several African countries, but Pfizer said it planned to expand distribution through a financial partnership that would allow the product, which typically costs about $1.50 a dose, to be sold to health care institutions in those countries for about $1.

Several groups, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, as well as the United States Agency for International Development, will help subsidize the cost and assist in introducing the version in countries around the globe.

Women will most likely receive the product free or at a reduced cost.

Chris Elias, president for global development at the Gates Foundation, said the Sayana Press could be an important new choice for an estimated 225 million women worldwide who would like access to contraception but do not have it. “Family planning is an important priority for us, and this is expanding the range of methods,” he said.
