Resolution Passed In This County Forcing Citizens To Pay Slavery Reparations
Last week, a group of Dallas County commissioners decided to pass a Juneteenth resolution, in commemoration of the day that slaves in Texas earned their freedom. What many didn’t realize, however, was that the resolution was also a declaration that African Americans should receive reparations for slavery.

According to the Daily Morning News, Commissioner John Wiley Price authored the resolution, which “included a long list of injustices endured by blacks, from slavery to Jim Crow to predatory lending practices. Then, in its final paragraph, it declared that the suffering of African-Americans should be ‘satisfied with monetary and substantial reparations.”
