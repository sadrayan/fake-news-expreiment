Pelosi: Weiner, Filner behavior ‘so disrespectful of women’
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday harshly criticized the behavior of Anthony Weiner and San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, who recently have been caught up in sex-related scandals.

"The conduct of some of these people that we are talking about here is reprehensible," Pelosi said Thursday morning at a news conference. "It is so disrespectful of women. And what's really stunning about it is that they don't even realize it. They don't even have a clue.... If they are clueless, get a clue. If they need therapy, get it in private."

Last week, Pelosi dodged a question about Filner, who is accused of making unwanted sexual advances toward several women.

Earlier this week, Weiner publicly admitted that he has continued to send sexually explicit messages and photos to young women through the Internet, the same sort of behavior that forced his resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives.

When asked by a reporter if Weiner should drop out of the race for mayor of New York, Pelosi responded: "That's up to the people of New York."
