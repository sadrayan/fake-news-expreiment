Occidental College :: Obama FAQs
Obama FAQs

Barack Obama attended Occidental College from fall 1979 through spring 1981 and then transferred to Columbia University in New York. He is not a graduate of Occidental; however, the Occidental College Alumni Association bylaws state that anyone who completes at least eight courses of undergraduate work (or a year of graduate studies) is eligible for alumni status when their class graduates. The 1974 federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (34 CFR Part 99) protects the privacy of student education records. We, therefore, cannot disclose students’ classes, grade point averages, majors or other such information. President Obama's transcripts and other student records have not been released by Occidental.

Neither Obama’s image or name appear in any Occidental yearbooks or the weekly student newspaper for the years he attended. The picture featured on this page is the only one we have of the president; it was sent in with his Occidental application. It is available to media outlets upon request. Photos of the president as an Occidental freshman taken by Lisa Jack '81 appeared in Time magazine and in an exhibit at M+B Gallery in West Hollywood. Obama contributed two poems to the now-defunct student literary magazine, Feast. Transcripts of his poems are available upon request.

Occidental has a strict privacy policy regarding alumni information. We do not give out alumni contact information but we can, on behalf of media outlets, contact alumni with specific requests.

If you would like to speak with an alumnus for a story, please contact director of communications Jim Tranquada at (323) 259-2990 or jtranqua@oxy.edu.
