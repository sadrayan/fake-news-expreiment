Sara’s ‘Hugpong’ now a regional political party
DAVAO CITY, Philippines — The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has granted the application of Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio’s “Hugpong ng Pagbabago” (Alliance for Change) to become a regional political party, just in time for next year’s midterm elections.

This, according to Comelec spokesman James Jimenez, means that the officers of the group can compete for national posts.

Duterte formed the group in February together with the incumbent governors of Davao Oriental, Del Norte and Occidental and of Compostela Valley – all in Southern Mindanao.

Although she has yet to announce if she will run for a Senate seat in 2019, she said her group would support the candidacies of Christopher “Bong” Go, the President's special assistant, and Sen. Cynthia Villar.

There are at least six Senate re-electionists who reportedly intend to join Duterte’s group.

Several politicians in other regions have also reportedly signified their willingness to join the new regional political party, which is different from the ‘Hugpong sa Katawhan’ that her father, President Duterte, formed several years ago.

In approving the petition, Jimenez said the Comelec’s First Division saw that all the requirements for a regional group were met.

This includes the requirement to have a list of established municipal chapter officer in each province in the region and list of officers and members, Jimenez said.

The party also complied with the requirements on party constitution and y-laws; resolution authorizing the filing of the petition with the Comelec; platform of government, and declaration of political creed.

Last Friday, Mayor Duterte said her group was evaluating possible alliances with other political parties. – With Sheila Crisostomo
