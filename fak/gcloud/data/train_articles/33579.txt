Jane Pinsky has been director of the NC Coalition for Lobbying & Government Reform since 2007. The coalition, in which Common Cause NC is a key player, works to make government at all levels more open and accessible to the citizens of North Carolina.

Since 1978, Pinsky has worked for nonprofit organizations focused on civil rights, women’s rights, family issues, tax reform, highway safety, children’s health, and as her husband says – changing the world. She has worked with such groups as NARAL, the American Nurses Association and the National Women’s Employment Project.
