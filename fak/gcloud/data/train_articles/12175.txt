From the desk of Lord Business
Legoland, Ireland

Dear Senator Johnson,

We haven’t officially met, but I know you’re familiar with my work in "The Lego Movie." Truth be told, I see a lot of myself in you, which is why it meant so much to me when you stuck up for me after "The Lego Movie." I agree, "The Lego Movie" really was part of an "insidious" campaign of "propaganda" against business owners. People like you and me have to stick together!

That’s why I wanted to return the favor and help you with your reelection campaign. I don’t have a lot of cash on hand right now, so unfortunately I can’t donate to one of the 3 Super PACs solely dedicated to your Senate bid. But from what I'm reading in Politifact, it looks like my old buddies the Koch Brothers have you covered on that front.

Instead, I'm prepared to offer you my full endorsement -- on one condition...

I'm looking to move some factories overseas, and I need you to support the TPP.

If you endorse the TPP, I will endorse you. You and I speak the same language when it comes to trade. I’ve even started referring to the "creative destruction" a great trade agreement can lead to. You really nailed it with that line -- even I couldn’t come up with something that clever!

I stopped by your office on Thursday to deliver the news in person, but you were in Manhattan. While your staff was very polite and attentive, they indicated that you still did not yet have a position on the TPP. Here's a video of my visit:

Looking forward to working with you closely on this election. The Senate needs more men like us.

Your friend,

Lord Business
