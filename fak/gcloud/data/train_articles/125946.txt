John Cena Death Hoax
A fake news story published by the entertainment web site TMZNewsOnline.net claiming that WWE wrestler John Cena had passed away in a car accident was circulated online in July 2016:

John Cena died in a single vehicle crash on Route 80 between Morristown and Roswell. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics responding to the vehicle accident and was identified by photo ID found on his body.
