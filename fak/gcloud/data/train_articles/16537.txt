Thank you for the quick response and phone interview. You told us youâ€™re confident after reviewing your resources that Churchill never said the statement. You also said Huey Long may have said something like it. As mentioned, I am also interested in any statements Churchill did make about future fascism.

We count on attributable on-the-record information for all our stories. We hope to complete this review by midday.

Thanks,

Gardner,

I attach a copy of a speech that Churchill made to the House of Commons on 27 July 1943. I have highlighted what I find to be a significant quotation about Fascism.

The source is The Churchill Documents, volume 18, One Continent Redeemed, January-August 1943, page 2076.

Best,

That was fast; thanks. The highlighted portion seems to characterize fascism at that time. Is there separately a time that Churchill talked about fascism in the future?

Many thanks again,

G.

Not so specifically, no. However, I think the second sentence reveals Churchill's philosophy about Fascist regimes, whether they manifest themselves in 1940s Italy or elsewhere in a different era in history.

Best,

Soren
