Projections of Water Stress Based on an Ensemble of Socioeconomic Growth and Climate Change Scenarios: A Case Study in Asia
The sustainability of future water resources is of paramount importance and is affected by many factors, including population, wealth and climate. Inherent in current methods to estimate these factors in the future is the uncertainty of their prediction. In this study, we integrate a large ensemble of scenarios—internally consistent across economics, emissions, climate, and population—to develop a risk portfolio of water stress over a large portion of Asia that includes China, India, and Mainland Southeast Asia in a future with unconstrained emissions. We isolate the effects of socioeconomic growth from the effects of climate change in order to identify the primary drivers of stress on water resources. We find that water needs related to socioeconomic changes, which are currently small, are likely to increase considerably in the future, often overshadowing the effect of climate change on levels of water stress. As a result, there is a high risk of severe water stress in densely populated watersheds by 2050, compared to recent history. There is strong evidence to suggest that, in the absence of autonomous adaptation or societal response, a much larger portion of the region’s population will live in water-stressed regions in the near future. Tools and studies such as these can effectively investigate large-scale system sensitivities and can be useful in engaging and informing decision makers.

In Section 2 of this paper, the models and methods are described; in Section 3, the changes in water supply and demand are shown in detail, as well as the resulting water stress risk portfolios; and in Section 4, the main conclusions from this work are presented.

Tools and studies such as these can effectively investigate large-scale system sensitivities and can be useful in engaging and informing decision makers. In addition to demonstrating what results may be derived with a tool such as this, we also hope to highlight the large-scale sensitivities in this specific region—which contains several heavily populated areas already water stressed—with the hope of directing more detailed, project-scale studies within the region.

Our method, in brief, is to apply a Water Resource System (WRS) model developed to work with the IGSM framework [ 14 ]. We use 400-member ensembles of climate projections previously developed with the IGSM [ 8 , 9 ] complemented with the pattern-scaling approach of [ 15 ] to develop a new 6,800-member ensemble of climate change projections, including variations in the regional pattern of climate change as represented by General Circulation Models (GCMs). The climate projections drive changes in surface water supply through changes in runoff and irrigation demand, and the IGSM economic ensemble projections provide the necessary parameters to estimate changes in water demands for industry and municipal use. A water management module within the WRS allocates, stores and releases water over each year, regulated by a management decision scheme that sets priorities among uses. This allows a distribution of water stress, indicating risks for river basins and sub-basins within our target region of Asia. We project water stress out to 2050. We could apply this same method out to 2100, as other studies have done, when changes in water stress, especially through climate change, are likely to be more substantial; however, for the usefulness of the this study, 2050 will serve as a more applicable planning horizon.

Black contours delineate Assessment Sub Regions (ASRs) defined for the Water Resource System (WRS) within the IGSM-WRS framework. The color shading indicates the economic regions that are resolved in the Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model.

To test the approach we focus on a portion of Asia that includes China, India and Mainland Southeast Asia ( Fig 1 ). This region covers emerging economies constituting almost half of today’s global population, as well as diverse climates that create varied water resource issues involving both surface and ground water. Previous studies in this region have found moderate effects of climate change, some positive and some negative, but raise serious concerns about socioeconomic effects on water-intensive economic sectors [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ]. These regional studies, like the previously mentioned global studies, are constrained to a limited number of climatic and socioeconomic scenarios provided by Climate Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIPs) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

We draw on probabilistic projections of global population, economic growth, emissions and climate developed using an Integrated Global Systems Model (IGSM) developed at MIT [ 8 , 9 ]. Advantages of this approach are (1) likelihoods are explicitly quantified; (2) scenarios are self-consistent, in that a climate scenario drawn from these projections was produced from an emissions scenario driven by an associated population and economic growth scenario (recoverable for our projection of water demands and resource uncertainty); (3) underlying uncertainties in drivers of both economic and earth system response are sampled; (4) cascading uncertainties, as pertaining to climate and economic projections, are properly addressed, while additional uncertain variables increase uncertainty in final outcomes, unless the underlying parametric uncertainties are highly correlated (in which case they have a strong tendency to offset one another).

Without quantified likelihoods of future outcomes, it is difficult to determine which scenarios should be seriously considered when planning new investments. Here we develop and test an approach to provide regional projections of changes in water supply and demand, and the potential for changes in water stress.

Previous literature has included many assessments of the impacts of climatic changes and socioeconomic drivers on water supply and demand ([ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]; among others). These studies have focused on a limited number of future scenarios, providing valuable insights on the potential changes that may arise from a few plausible futures; however, there is no ability to assess where these courses of events and the subsequent water impacts may lie in terms of a distribution of outcomes–i.e. a risk-based lens to the analyses. Given the complexity of the system, critical questions remain such as:

There is rising concern about the impact of climate change and socioeconomic growth on the future of our water resources, e.g., [ 1 , 2 ]. The global climate system and population as well as the local and global economy determine regional and local water supplies and demands–and these forces can result in complex interactions that require deeper understanding in order to provide actionable information to decision makers for strategic planning in a changing and growing world. An emerging need is evident for modeling tools to capture these complex linkages–especially global-to-local hydro-climatic relationships, managed water systems, and population and economic growth.

For only the municipal and industrial sectors, water requirements included in TW are represented by consumptive use in the model.—with additional consideration for reuse within the basin to assess total withdrawal. To estimate withdrawal, we use common ratios that represent the fraction of consumption over withdrawal. Inflow to any given ASR is a consequence of flow regulated from upstream ASRs; therefore WSI is an evaluation metric of the managed water system as simulated by WRS. Irrigation receives its total withdrawal, with its return flow credited to the downstream ASR (see [ 14 ] for details). We characterize the severity of water stress according to [ 38 ], which classifies an ASR’s water use as slightly exploited when WSI < 0.3; moderately exploited when 0.3 ≤ WSI ≤ 0.6; heavily exploited when 0.6 ≤ WSI ≤ 1; overly exploited when 1 ≤ WSI < 2; and extremely exploited when WSI ≥ 2. Similar water-stress indices are computed in other studies and generally consider a threshold of 0.4 to indicate severe water limitation [ 7 ]. Fig 8 shows the WSI for the baseline scenario. As shown, a large portion of northern China as well as India and the Indus River systems experience at least moderate to extremely exploited water conditions.

The second measure, a Water Stress Index (WSI), is used to assess the stress on the water resource system for each ASR. For this, we use the metrics adopted for other applications of the IGSM-WRS [ 14 , 37 ]. Our WSI, similar to that developed by [ 38 ] is based on input water flows (from surface runoff and upstream ASRs) and desired withdrawals, as a measure of the pressure that human water uses exert on renewable surface fresh water. This measure does not calculate unmet requirement; instead, it gauges stress on the natural water system through its accounting for withdrawal and consumptive uses. WSI is calculated as the ratio of each ASR’s mean annual total withdrawal (TW), which by definition includes consumptive loss, to the mean annual runoff (RUN) generated within the ASR, plus inflow (INF) from any upstream ASR that flows directly into it, as described by [ 14 ]:

In the global WRS model, total water requirement is an estimate of the amount of water that would be consumed given socio-economic factors, climate conditions, and current infrastructure, if water were an unlimited resource. For example, if the total water requirement—irrigation, industrial, and municipal—is 100 billion cubic meters (BCM) and the system can only deliver 90 BCM, the UWR would be 10%. A UWR of 0% indicates that all crops (as well as the other water requirement sectors) are without water stress. The WSM module allocates domestic and industrial consumption requirements to be satisfied first (given sufficient water supply) and the agriculture sector must absorb the loss. Since irrigation is by far the highest requirement for water, it is extremely rare that domestic and industrial sectors absorb any loss from the water limitations. Furthermore, since crops are irrigated depending on their value and water availability, many crops are partially irrigated on a regular basis, which is why we see unmet requirement in the baseline scenario (see Fig 7 ). Partial irrigation complicates the interpretation of UWR in the baseline scenario, so we focus on changes in UWR, assuming that these changes indicate additional stress in a given region. For instance, an increase in unmet requirement would likely decrease the supply from the agriculture sector, which could increase food prices.

We use two measures of stress to understand the impacts of changes in climate and growth. The first measure, Unmet Water Requirement (UWR), is the percentage of the total water requirement that is not met by the system. UWR is the main component of the objective function in WSM and is a direct aggregate measure of water stress in each ASR. We calculate UWR as follows:

The solid lines show the values for the full 6,800-member ensemble. Dashed lines are the Gaussian Quadrature subset distributions for comparison. The solid vertical lines on the CMI plots (a to e) show the baseline CMI values.

Fig 6 shows the distribution of the 14 variables for the full ensemble. In this figure, plots a) through e) show the CMI of the 5 regions for the two time slices. In these CMI plots, the dark black line marks the base CMI value. Plots f) and g) show GDP for China and India in 2050 as a percent change from the year-2000 value, and plots h) and i) show population for China and India in 2050, also as a percent change from the year-2000 value. The distributions of the resulting subset are shown as dashed lines. As shown, the Gaussian Quadrature procedure successfully reproduces the original 6,800-member ensemble with a sub-sampled set of 551 members. We then use this sub-sampled ensemble to perform our water resource assessment.

We calculated CMI for each of the 6,800 climates for 5 regions based on the Koeppen-Geyger climatic zones (shown in Fig 5 ) and for two 10-year time slices: a mean over 2025 to 2034 and a mean over 2041 to 2050, in order to match the time slices used in the Results discussed later. In the CMI calculation, we use the modified Hargreaves equation to calculate PET [ 36 ], which uses a relationship between precipitation and temperature. Since WRS also accounts for changes to GDP and population, we add four more indices: year 2050 GDP and population for both India and China. This leaves us with 14 indices total: 10 for climate (5 regions over 2 time slices) and 4 for socioeconomics.

CMI may range from +1 to -1, with wet climates showing positive CMI, and dry climates negative CMI. [ 35 ] demonstrated that changes in CMI are highly correlated with changes in runoff and irrigation demand. Thus, CMI is a single, simple to calculate index that is highly correlated with major impacts of interest in this study.

Two key impacts on water resources are runoff and irrigation demand. These impacts integrate many aspects of different climate scenarios including precipitation and Potential Evapotranspiration (PET). [ 34 ] developed the Climate Moisture Index (CMI), which uses the ratio of annual precipitation (P) to annual PET as follows:

Due to computational limitations, running the full ensemble of 6,800 members is infeasible. For this reason, we use a Gaussian Quadrature approach, as described in [ 32 ], to produce a subset and respective weights that represent the full ensemble. The Gaussian Quadrature approach identifies a set of indices for the ensemble members, and then identifies a subsample of simulations for which the values of the identified indices are distributed similarly to that of the full ensemble. Thus, we select a series of indices—or summary statistics—that characterize relevant differences among the ensemble members. The number of statistics used determines the size of the resulting subset (i.e., more statistics results in a larger subset) related to the number of equations to solve in order to obtain the Gaussian Quadrature (originally proven in [ 33 ]), with more detail for the specific application in [ 33 ].

The combined effect of growth and climate are then explored in combination through WSM. The IGSM-WRS is integrated to 2050 for all cases. The following analyses will focus on the ability of the ASRs to meet water demands [ 14 ] and the relative stress that these demands place on renewable surface water and water available within the managed system.

The IGSM monthly zonal anomalies of each climate forecast scenario are further interpolated using a polynomial of degree 3, with a least-squares fit, to produce a smooth time series (removing rapid changes in gradient in the vicinity of the data points). This is performed for all the near-surface meteorological variables, except that the zonal precipitation anomalies go through the additional bias correction (as described before) prior to the interpolation procedure. A similar downscaling technique [ 15 ] is used to map the interpolated IGSM monthly climate across longitude. These anomalies are then added to the detrended 3-hourly baseline climate to construct the future 3-hourly atmospheric forcing (so called “delta method”), which is used to drive the CLM offline from 2001 to 2050 to simulate the runoff.

To account for the uncertainty in regional climate change, a downscaling technique [ 15 ] is employed to expand the IGSM monthly zonal anomalies of precipitation and 2 m air temperature of each of 400 climate forecast scenarios across longitude at 2.5° × 2° by applying longitudinally-resolved patterns, from observations and from climate model projections archived for the IPCC AR4. The observed patterns for precipitation and temperature are derived from the 31-year (1979–2009) monthly GPCP v2.1 data set [ 31 ] and the 20-year (1981–2000) monthly Princeton data set, respectively. The pattern shifts in response to human-forced change are derived based on the same 17 GCM simulations from the IPCC AR4 SRESA2 emission scenario. The resulting meta-ensemble (400 × 17 = 6,800 members) of the 2.5° × 2° IGSM monthly anomalies (precipitation and temperature) is used for the Gaussian quadrature procedure presented later.

In the assessment of regional climate change impact on water resource management in Southeast Asia, we use a simple downscaling method, or delta method [ 29 ], to construct a series of atmospheric forcing to conduct our ensemble simulations. The method is based on applying the interpolated monotonic changes in climate from the IGSM projections to the baseline climate, accounting for any bias (or trend) in the baseline climate under future climate change. This method assumes that changes in climates (i.e. multi-year anomalies) are most relevant in the IGSM projections, and that the relationships between variables in the baseline climate–including periodic and irregular fluctuations in variables–are likely to be maintained. The zonal anomalies (delta) are derived for the IGSM monthly time series of 2001 to 2100 with respect to the 20-year (1981–2000) climatology for each meteorological variable and each of the 400 climate forecast scenarios. There exist some biases in the IGSM-simulated zonal precipitation of potential climate change as compared to the CMIP-3 GCM projections, and we correct such biases based on the monthly zonal precipitation climatology of three periods (2011–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100) from the SRESA2 simulation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4 th Assessment Report (AR4) [ 30 ]. The monthly zonal precipitation climatology from each of the 17 GCMs in the SRESA2 scenario has been analyzed to examine the impact of model structure in bias correction.

The MIT IGSM is designed to quantify various sources of uncertainty in climate projections. The fully coupled IGSM is forced from 1861 to 1990 by observed changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, and from 1991 to 2100 by emissions of greenhouse gas and aerosol precursors projected by the EPPA model [ 8 ]. Our 400-member climate forecast ensemble was conducted based on different value combinations of three key climate parameters: effective climate sensitivity, ocean heat uptake rate, and net aerosol forcing [ 8 ]. The value of each parameter is sampled from its probability distribution obtained by comparing the twentieth-century simulations with observations of surface, upper-air, and deep-ocean temperature changes [ 28 ]. The climate forecast ensemble is calculated for each of five emission pathways: Unconstrained Emissions (No Policy) and four greenhouse-gas stabilization levels (Level 1, Level 2, etc.). In this study, only the results for Unconstrained Emissions are presented.

This study considers changes in GDP and population obtained in the unconstrained emissions (UCE) ensemble analyzed by [ 16 ]. The UCE policy uses the global ensemble of population projections described in [ 27 ]. To be consistent with the IGSM uncertainty formulation, socioeconomic projections are provided by EPPA region ( Fig 2 ). To provide these population projections at the ASR scale, the EPPA regions’ rate of population changes are mapped to the ASR regions within each EPPA region, following the technique used in Strzepek et al. (2013). ASR-based population projections use the growth rates from EPPA, with the current populations at the ASR level developed by IPFRI [ 25 ] (see Fig 4 ).

The procedure is applied for six near-surface meteorological variables (near-surface air temperature, wind speed and specific humidity at the lowest atmosphere level, total precipitation, shortwave and longwave radiation). The IGSM monthly precipitation is partitioned into 3-hourly based on the observed number of precipitation events within that month and amount of precipitation per each event in the derived 3-hourly baseline precipitation time series.

Six near-surface meteorological variables have been processed: 2 m air temperature, total precipitation, shortwave and longwave radiation, wind speed, and specific humidity. Then, we remove underlying linear trends in the data in order to build a “clean slate” on which to apply future trends. To detrend the 3-hourly forcing, the data is aggregated monthly, then regridded to a 2.5° × 2° resolution. The linear trend is estimated for each of twelve months at each grid over our study region based on the 50-year (1951–2000) period. To bridge the potential gaps between the detrended baseline climate in the last year and the derived future climate (discussed in the following section) at the beginning of the future simulations, for each of the twelve months, we add the 20-year mean (1981–2000)—same years used in developing the future changes discussed in Section 2.2.2—to the monthly residual across the 50-year, then calculate the ratio of this sum to the aggregated monthly time series. The detrended 3-hourly data at each grid are then obtained by scaling the original 3-hourly time series with this monthly ratio. Note that the same ratio is applied across each of the 3-hourly time steps within a specific month. The resulting climate, which is detrended and beginning at the year 2000 mean is our baseline scenario run through the WRS suite of models as discussed in Section 2.1. This procedure is mapped in Fig 3 .

A long-term dataset of near-surface meteorological variables—the Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset (GMFD) [ 26 ]—provides the baseline climate in this study. The data is constructed by combining a suite of global observation-based datasets with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis. The GMFD data spans the years 1948 to 2008 at the 1° spatial and 3-hourly temporal resolution.

Our projections are designed to distinguish effects on water use of economic and population growth separate from that of future climate change. We create three ensembles of 50-year simulations (2000–2050) of water resource supply and use. In the first, we utilize forecasts of the socioeconomic drivers of water demand to create an ensemble as if only the economy changed (no climate change), which we hereafter refer to as the Just Growth ensemble. In the second, we utilize the same economic scenarios and associated emissions, simulating their effect on climate to create another ensemble as if only the climate changed, which we hereafter label the Just Climate ensemble. Finally, we develop a large ensemble including both climate change and economic growth, which we hereafter label the Climate and Growth ensemble. These ensembles allow us to separately identify the relative importance of climate change and growth, study the combined effect of these changes, and compare them against a baseline ensemble (as if neither climate nor socio-economic drivers changed). The Just Growth, Just Climate, and Climate and Growth ensembles are all generated on the assumption that there are no policy constraints on greenhouse gas emissions. This policy results in a median scenario (of the 400-member ensemble) closest to the A2, used in the AR4, in terms of both GHG concentrations and net radiative forcing, although slightly lower, by 2050. Analyzing mitigation effects, i.e. comparing results with the stabilization ensemble runs, in this region will be handled in a future study.

Our method is to construct numerous ensembles that incorporate the uncertainty in future hydrology and water resources, as affected by uncertainty in climate and economic drivers of water use. We gauge the changes simulated in these ensembles with respect to a single baseline scenario. The baseline scenario represents a 50-year IGSM run with year-2000 water requirements from agriculture, industry, and municipalities and a mean year-2000 climate with 50 years of recent historical inter-annual climate variability. We compare resulting changes in supply, requirement, or water stress with the baseline result to isolate the effect of the long-term mean change in climate. For baseline domestic and industrial water requirements, we use data from [ 25 ] that are also used in the global IGSM-WRS, described in detail in [ 14 ].

These methods have been described in detail in [ 14 ], where the WRS suite of models is compared to observations. As this is an exhaustive exercise, we refer the reader to this study and do not attempt to reproduce it here.

Based on recent evidence over the past decade, global growth in irrigated land area has slowed considerably (e.g., [ 20 , 21 , 22 ]) even though global food production has steadily increased [ 23 ]. This indicates that rising global food demand is being met by increased rainfed agriculture and intensification of existing irrigated land. Given the complexity of interactive socio-economic drivers and environmental pressures, as well as global and national governance that will affect future decisions regarding irrigation expansion (i.e. new dams and reservoirs, e.g., [ 24 ]), the irrigated area is held constant (equal to current estimates from FAO and IFPRI) and irrigation efficiencies are also static (see [ 25 ]) in these experimental simulations; we focus on whether there is adequate water to meet needs associated with changes in ASR-scale socio-economic activity and climate.

For this study, the WRS is configured to represent 54 ASRs over a large region of Asia (see Fig 1 ). The ASRs are defined by major river basins and parts of river basins contained within a country. For each ASR, available reservoirs are aggregated into a single storage unit that receives water from runoff within the ASR and remaining flows of upstream ASRs. The stored water is allocated to serve human water sector requirements and a required environmental flow. Non-irrigation requirements (for municipal, industrial, and livestock uses) are driven by socioeconomic factors on the assumption they are not significantly influenced by climate; irrigation requirements, on the other hand, are determined by environmental conditions, calculated by CliCrop.

Downscaled precipitation and temperature are also input to the CliCrop [ 19 ] component of the WRS, a daily crop water deficit model which projects irrigation requirement. The multiple water demands are inputs to the Water System Management (WSM) component of the WRS that allocates water for consumption and assesses the adequacy of water supplies in light of changing water availability at the ASR level. We use previously published and archived ensemble IGSM runs that consider underlying uncertainty in both climatic (climate sensitivity, ocean uptake and aerosol effects) and economic parameters (labor and energy productivity growth, population, resource availability, technology costs, pollution emissions and substitution elasticities) as described in [ 9 ].

The same EPPA scenarios provide greenhouse gas and other pollutant emissions to the MIT Earth System Model (MESM), which produces latitudinally-resolved climate projections; the IGSM sub-model of atmospheric dynamics and chemistry is 2-dimensional (altitude and latitude) and is coupled to a mixed layer ocean component. As discussed in [ 9 ], an ensemble of futures is produced using a Monte-Carlo type framework as well as a Latin Hypercube, which is used to reduce the sample size to 400 members for each ensemble (discussed in more detail in Section 2.2). The parameters sampled to produce the ensembles include 9 related to economics (via EPPA) and 5 related to climate (via MESM). The zonal resolution of the MESM makes it feasible to produce the 400-member ensembles necessary to reasonably resolve the distribution of future climate outcomes [ 9 ]. MESM outputs are rescaled to 2° latitude by 2.5° longitude using a pattern-scaling technique [ 15 ] based on archived CMIP-3 Climate model simulations. These precipitation and temperature results are used to drive the Community Land Model (CLM) version 3.5 [ 18 ] to produce the runoff for each ASR. The CLM, which explicitly represents soil thermal and hydrologic processes, is also implemented within the IGSM as its land surface scheme. The simulated runoff is bias corrected, using a modification of the Maintenance of Variance Extension (MOVE) procedure to ensure that projected flows in each basin are a realistic representation of natural flow conditions, details in [ 14 ].

The WRS is driven by economic and climatic projections from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) described in [ 16 ]. Economic projections are driven by the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a regionally resolved general equilibrium model of world economies (described in [ 17 ]), which provides inputs for econometrically estimated relationships of industrial and municipal water requirements based on changes in population and gross domestic product (GDP) [ 14 ].

Within the IGSM, the EPPA model produces economic projections, calculating population and GDP for each ASR. These determine municipal and industrial demands for water. Climate results from MESM are projected longitudinally via pattern scaling with archived GCM data. CLM determines runoff, and CliCrop calculates irrigation demands. Water demands and surface-water supply are fed into the WSM to optimize the routing of water across all ASRs. The resultant routing is then analyzed via water stress indicators.

Our analysis focuses on the impact of socioeconomic growth and climate changes on the future availability and management of water resources resolved over large watersheds—Assessment Study Regions (ASRs)—across South, Southeast, and East Asia ( Fig 1 ). The basic structure of the WRS as applied here is illustrated in Fig 2 , with greater detail provided in [ 14 ].

3. Results

3.4 Mapped Changes in Water Stress As previously discussed (Section 2.4), we assess changes in water stress via two measures: UWR and WSI. We will also evaluate these changes across three ensembles: Just Growth, Just Climate, and Climate and Growth. For the Just Growth ensemble, we run the model with the baseline climate, changing only the growth parameters—population and GDP—which affect domestic and industrial water requirements. With this ensemble, we isolate the effects of growth by removing the effects of climate. In the Just Climate ensemble, we keep the growth parameters constant at the year-2000 value, and provide the model with a different future climate projection for each scenario. With this ensemble, we remove the effect of growth and focus on the effect of climate change. In reality, growth and climate occur simultaneously; however, for policy decisions, distinguishing growth effects from climate change effects is important since policy rarely targets both growth (e.g., population or wealth) and climate (GHG mitigation) simultaneously. We are also interested to assess the degree to which the effects of growth and climate interact non-linearly. Hence, we run a final ensemble, Climate and Growth, which combines the two effects, and represents the future we face under an “unconstrained emissions” pathway. In Fig 25 the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of UWR point-wise distribution are mapped for each of the three ensembles. As shown, UWR rarely decreases in the future. For the Just Growth ensemble, we see UWR increasing or remaining constant, even in the 10th percentile, although there are some basins that are affected by growth changes more than others, especially much of India where increases are the most substantial. In the Just Climate ensemble, driven by the changes in runoff and irrigation requirement, UWR increases for much of China (especially in the north), Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as northern India. For the Climate and Growth median case, we find a fairly consistent increase across the region with only a few ASRs showing no change. Essentially, this third ensemble appears to be a simple sum of the two above, where, for example, in India, growth has larger effects in the south and climate in the north resulting in a relatively evenly distributed stress across the country. UWR, which is based on the ratio of consumption over demand, will behave this way (i.e. as a simple summation) when the modeled basin management is not able to increase consumption even though demand increases. This result implies that adaption or mitigation to water shortage will be a necessity in the region. Appendix A shows the distribution of scenarios using the population-weighted change in UWR and the example maps around specific points in the distribution using that single metric.

Changes are based on the baseline (Fig 6) to the future scenarios averaged over 2041–2050 and shown for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles for each ASR. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0150633.g025 Fig 26 shows series of maps for the WSI similar to that shown for UWR in Fig 24. Results for the three ensembles are mapped for every ASR based on specified exceedances—10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles. In the Just Growth ensemble we find that northern China and southern India are most prone to increased stress caused by growth. And we see a similar pattern in the Just Climate ensemble, although for India the climate effect is fairly evenly distributed. Increases in stress are also prominent in the west, in Pakistan and Afghanistan. We see these same patterns emerging, although more pronounced, in the final ensemble, Climate and Growth. WSI, as apposed to UWR, does not change directly by changes in demand, but responds to changes consumption and changes in water supply. So, if consumption cannot increase by better reservoir management, WSI will respond only to changes in runoff. By comparing these results to the changes in runoff shown in Fig 12, we can see that for northern China, as well as for Pakistan and Afghanistan, where runoff decreases are more substantial, this appears to be the case. For much of India, however, these changes in WSI appear to be driven by an increase in consumption rather than changes in runoff, and therefore the water resources are further exploited by more efficient basin management.
