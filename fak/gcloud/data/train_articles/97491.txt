Canadian Airports Council
Canada’s Airports: Working Together, Moving Forward

The Canadian Airports Council (CAC), a division of Airports Council International-North America, is the voice for Canada’s airports. Formed in 1992, as the devolution of airports to local control was beginning, the CAC has established itself as the reliable and credible federal representative for airports on a wide range of significant issues and concerns.

Canada’s airports are engines for economic development in the communities they serve and one of their most important elements of local infrastructure: Our communities’ vital links to intra-provincial, national and international trade and commerce. Our 51 members represent more than 100 Canadian airports, including all of the National Airports System (NAS) airports and most passenger service airports in every province and territory.

Together, CAC members handle virtually all of the nation’s air cargo and international passenger traffic and 90% of domestic passenger traffic. The economic impact of CAC member airports is staggering. In 2012, Canada’s air transportation industry had a $34.9 billion economic footprint, supported 405,000 jobs, and federal taxes of more than $7 billion.

There is no doubt that air transportation is an economic growth enabler and airports are the essential link that connects communities and air travel. From safety and security to facilitation and infrastructure to economic issues, Canada’s airports speak with one voice through the CAC.
