S2018 E14: 7th Congressional District Democratic candidates | On the Record
On the Record with Michael Aron

On The Record spotlights New Jersey's political newsmakers--how they voted, what theyâ€™re trying to accomplish, what their values are, and where they come from figuratively and literally. Some weeks the program focuses on a leader; other weeks it takes apart an issue with advocates and experts representing two or more sides. Sitting governors periodically appear to defend their records and promote their initiatives.
