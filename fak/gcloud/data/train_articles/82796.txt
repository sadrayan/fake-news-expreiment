OVERTAKES PIRATES TO BECOME THE BIGGEST DVD OF ALL TIME IN THE UK! MAMMA MIA! - The Movie has become the biggest selling DVD of all-time in the UK, the Official Charts Company announced earlier this month.



The release, which was issued in mid-November, racked up enough sales during the Christmas break to become the first disc to sell more than 5m DVDs - and overtake Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl as the biggest-selling DVD of all time in the UK.



MAMMA MIA! - The Movie was by far the biggest selling DVD of 2008, selling 5.005m copies, ahead of The Dark Knight's 1.514m. In total, nine DVDs sold 1m units or more in 2008.



On the all-time list - which covers all sales from the launch of the DVD format in spring 1998 right through to the end of 2008 - the Abba-themed movie disc also overtakes The Curse Of The Black Pearl release's 4.7m units, to become the biggest ever. The two movies are the only two DVDs to have sold more than 4m units in their lifetime, with The Lord Of the Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring in third on the all-time list with 3.9m.



The success of the MAMMA MIA! DVD in 2008 follows an extraordinary year for the franchise. Besides the DVD landmark, the movie has also become the highest grossing movie in UK history, turning over more than £69m. [Universal Pictures announcement, December 2008]



In turn, the movie soundtrack has been confirmed as the the biggest selling compilation of 2008 (selling 1.0m units), while MAMMA MIA! mania also saw three other Abba-linked albums selling more than 100,000 copies - Abba Gold (the 19th biggest album of 2008, with sales of 410,000), the London stage recording (85th, 182,000) and Abba 18 Hits (120th, 134,000).



Official Charts Company managing director Martin Talbot says, "Right from its release, MAMMA MIA! has been a record breaker - when it was issued on DVD, it became the fastest seller of all time."



"This latest landmark further underlines the popularity of the movie, which is now 'officially' the British public's favourite DVD of all time - with one-in-four British households owning a copy." [Based on 21.66m households, according to the 2001 Census (c National Statistics)]. "THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC..." On 26 January, MAMMA MIA! has its last show in Berlin and also in Germany. MAMMA MIA! opened its first foreign language production in German at the Operettenhaus in Hamburg in 2002, followed by Stuttgart in 2004, Essen in May 2007, and then Berlin in October 2007. Now, having been seen by over 5 million people in more than 6 successful years in the country, we say goodbye MAMMA MIA! and thank everybody who worked for the show, and for their great support and passion during the past years.
