Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence – Gun Law Information Experts
In recent years, Americans have been shocked to see images of gun-toting individuals openly carrying firearms in public places like coffee shops, restaurants, public parks and at political rallies. Many of these people identify themselves as part of a growing “open carry movement,” a collection of grassroots groups nationwide whose confrontational style has drawn criticism even from the mainstream gun lobby.

While most states have adopted licensing systems to regulate the concealed carrying of firearms, the recent surge in open carrying has exposed weak state laws around the country that permit this dangerous conduct.

Open carry advocates seek to normalize the carrying of firearms in public places, and often use open carrying to protest what they see as unjust state firearms laws. While members of the open carry movement argue that they are just “exercising their rights,” the open carrying of firearms intimidates the public, wastes law enforcement resources, and creates opportunities for injury and death due to the accidental or intentional use of firearms.

Open carrying poses particular challenges for law enforcement officers who must respond to 911 calls from concerned citizens about people carrying guns in public. A press release issued by the San Mateo County, California, Sheriff’s Office describes the significant challenges that open carrying creates:

Open carry advocates create a potentially very dangerous situation. When police are called to a “man with a gun” call they typically are responding to a situation about which they have few details other than that one or more people are present at a location and are armed. Officers may have no idea that these people are simply “exercising their rights.” Consequently, the law enforcement response is one of “hypervigilant urgency” in order to protect the public from an armed threat. Should the gun carrying person fail to comply with a law enforcement instruction or move in a way that could be construed as threatening, the police are forced to respond in kind for their own protection. It’s well and good in hindsight to say the gun carrier was simply “exercising their rights” but the result could be deadly. Simply put, it is not recommended to openly carry firearms.

Claims that open carrying is needed for self-defense are belied by the available research. Even when a gun is used in self-defense, which is rare, research shows that it is no more likely to reduce a person’s chance of being injured during a crime than various other forms of protective action. One study suggests that carrying a firearm may actually increase a victim’s risk of firearm injury during the commission of a crime. Instead of improving safety, open carrying needlessly increases the likelihood that everyday interpersonal conflicts will turn into deadly shootouts. Because open carry laws make it more likely that individuals will have ready access to firearms in times of mental crisis, these laws have also been shown to correlate with significantly higher rates of suicide. States that do not restrict the open carrying of handguns have 36% more suicides and 71% more firearm suicides per capita. This correlation is unchanged even after controlling for the effects of poverty, population density, age, education, and race/ethnicity. After controlling for these variables, open carry laws were associated with 23% more suicides and 36% more firearm suicides per capita.

In addition, in states that allow open carrying without a permit, law enforcement officers may be prohibited from demanding identification when stopping an individual who is openly carrying a firearm.



Federal law does not restrict the open carrying of firearms in public, although specific rules may apply to property owned or operated by the federal government.

Three states (California, Florida, and Illinois) and the District of Columbia prohibit the carrying of any firearm openly in public. Another two states (New York and South Carolina) prohibit the open carrying of a handgun, but not a long gun, and another three states (Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New Jersey) prohibit the open carrying of a long gun, but not a handgun. In the remaining states, the open carrying of firearms is generally allowed, although some states require the person to first obtain a permit or license.

Please note that open carry laws frequently have exceptions. In states that allow open carrying, most still prohibit open carrying in some specific locations such as schools, state-owned businesses, places where alcohol is served, and on public transportation, among many other locations. The lists below are meant only to reflect whether open carry is generally allowed or prohibited.

Description of State Laws Governing the Open Carrying of Firearms

1. Open Carrying of Handguns: Only five states, California, Florida, Illinois New York, and South Carolina, as well as the District of Columbia, prohibit the open carrying of handguns in public places.
