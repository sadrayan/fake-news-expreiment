The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m., in Room SD-342, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Lieberman, Akaka, Carper, Collins, and McCain. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN LIEBERMAN Chairman Lieberman. Good morning. Thank you all for being here. The attacks on America by Islamist terrorists on 9/11 took place almost a decade ago, but the memories of that day are still searing. The attacks ended thousands of lives, changed families forever, and forced our country into another worldwide war. We all remember that morning, and I know we will until the moment we leave Earth. The Nation watched on television as those extraordinary mighty twin towers of the World Trade Center collapsed into a pile of smoking rubble, taking so many innocent lives with them. American Airlines Flight 77 smashed into the Pentagon and set it ablaze. And in the fields near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, we saw the smoldering crash of United Flight 93, whose brave passengers had fought to retake the plane from the terrorists who had targeted Washington, DC--probably targeted this very place where we are, Capitol Hill--and by their heroism saved hundreds if not thousands of additional lives. But even as we mourned--and we did--we began to ask--and when I say ``we,'' I mean not just those of us privileged to serve here, but people throughout the country and particularly the families of those who were lost on 9/11--how those attacks could have happened and what could we do to make sure to the best of our ability that nothing like that ever happened again. And so we created the 9/11 Commission to investigate what did happen on 9/11. What were the flaws in our homeland security and what could we do to protect our Nation against another such attack from Islamist terrorists or anyone else who would want to carry out such a dreadful act? Coming to the leadership of that Commission were two extraordinary Americans--gifted, able, and extremely patriotic--Governor Tom Kean and Congressman Lee Hamilton. We are really privileged to have them with us as our witnesses today. The Commission they led and its staff reviewed 2.5 million pages of documents, interviewed 1,200 individuals in 12 countries--including every relevant senior official of both the Clinton and Bush Administrations--and held 19 days of public hearings across the country with 160 witnesses testifying. The Commission's recommendations were sweeping and they were definitive. They were not just general conclusions, but they were specific recommendations for both immediate actions we needed to take to defend ourselves against further attack, but also long-term actions we could take to blunt the terrorists' message and dry up their recruitment. In response to the Commission's recommendations, this Committee authored--and I am honored to see that not only Senator Collins is here but also Senator McCain, three of the four original sponsors of the legislation--the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 that adopted not all but most of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, including the creation of a Director of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center, which I thought, and I believe the Commission thought, were the two most substantial and significant recommendations for change it was making. That Act was the most sweeping reform of our government's intelligence apparatus and, together with the adoption of the Homeland Security Act a couple years before, represented the most significant changes in our governmental framework since the end of World War II. This Committee was privileged to be deeply involved in drafting these and other pieces of counterterrorism legislation to implement the Commission's recommendations and further strengthen our security against terrorism. But a lot of the hard work in identifying, recommending, and then adopting the specific reforms was done by the two gentlemen who are testifying before us today: Then the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, now the co-chairmen of its successor, the Bipartisan Policy Center's National Security Preparedness Group. I thank Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton for being here today, for their hard work and dedication to public service throughout their lives, and for providing our Nation with a most compelling reminder of how much we can accomplish in public life when we put party labels aside and work together for the national good. Today, in the exercise of our Committee's responsibility to constantly evaluate and investigate our homeland defenses, and also mindful of the approaching 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, we are beginning a series of oversight hearings on all that we attempted to accomplish after 9/11. Today we are very privileged to have Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton here to help us begin our review with their opinion of the state of America's homeland security. We have already scheduled four more subject matter hearings for May, June, and July that will look, among other things, at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the effectiveness of our aviation security reforms, what we have done to try to keep terrorists out of the United States, and how we are progressing on the goal that we all said we had to improve, which is emergency communications among law enforcement and associated personnel. I want to say how grateful I am for the prepared testimony that the two of you have submitted to the Committee, which will be included in full in the record. You have touched on some of the concerns that the Committee has and will deal with in coming hearings. One of the most significant is with regard to the Director of National Intelligence and how that office has done and whether it needs further support to help it achieve the goals that you had for it. Personally, I believe it is essential to have a strong Director of National Intelligence who can marshall the full capabilities of the intelligence community. I am encouraged by some of the recent changes that the current DNI, General James Clapper, has carried out toward further integration, but I must say I am also concerned about some of the continuing bureaucratic resistance from other components of the intelligence community, which, under our vision and I believe yours, were supposed to be under the supervision of the DNI. I know from your testimony that you both share some of those concerns, and I am interested in hearing your comments on those. I note with appreciation that you have also talked about the importance of moving more rapidly toward better interoperable communication systems and that one of your recommendations is that we set aside the so-called D Block of the broadband spectrum for funding those public safety improvements. Senator McCain and I sponsored legislation to accomplish that in the last session, and we are working to introduce a similar bill in this session. So to summarize an awful lot very briefly, I would say that since the 9/11 Commission reforms were adopted, we have seen a very significant improvement in our homeland security. We have had many victories in our battles with terrorists, many plots broken and attacks planned against America thwarted. We have also had some close calls such as the case of the Christmas Day bomber and the other case of the Times Square bomber. And we have had some tragic failures like the homegrown radical Islamist Major Nidal Hasan who murdered 13 Americans at Fort Hood. So we want to continue to learn from our successes and our failures, and that is the intention of this series of hearings that we are beginning today. May I say finally that we are very proud and grateful to be joined this morning by some family members of 9/11 victims who went on to become leading advocates for the creation of the 9/ 11 Commission and the implementation of its recommendations and have continued to play a wonderful oversight role in that work. Mary Fetchet and Carie Lemack are two of the most likable pests we have around Capitol Hill. [Laughter.] Really, I would say lovable and committed. The Commission would not have been created without their advocacy. We would not have passed its legislative recommendations without their most effective lobbying. And its implementation would not be as good as all of us want it to be if they had not stayed on duty as they have. So I cannot thank you enough. I know I speak for everybody on the Committee when I express my gratitude and admiration for your personal strength, your skill, and your continuing commitment to America's homeland security. Senator Collins. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLLINS Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This year, we will commemorate the worst attack ever on the United States. In doing so, we must ask ourselves, ``Are we safer?'' Or are we just safer from the tactics that terrorists already have tried? Is our intelligence community better at fitting together these complex puzzle pieces? Or have we just been lucky? Are we anticipating the next threat, such as a cyber attack or the use of poisons? Or are we just looking backward, reacting to previous plots? Undoubtedly, compared to where we were on September 10, 2001, we have greatly improved the framework for information sharing among our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. But sometimes it has been an inept bomb maker or a faulty fuse that has spared American lives. Once again, the two extraordinary leaders of the landmark 9/11 Commission, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Kean, are appearing before our Committee as we evaluate our progress in securing our Nation. In September of last year, their ``Assessing the Terrorist Threat'' report warned of an increasingly wide range of U.S.-based militants who do not fit any particular ethnic, economic, educational, or social profile. The American melting pot, the report said, ``has not provided a firewall against the radicalization and recruitment of American citizens and residents, though it has arguably lulled us into a sense of complacency that homegrown terrorism could not happen in the United States.'' This report correctly called 2009 a watershed year in U.S.- based terrorist plots, with 43 American citizens or residents aligned with violent Islamist extremists charged or convicted of terrorist crimes in that year alone. This Committee first sounded the alarm about home-based terrorism 5 years ago and has held 15 hearings on this topic. We found that individuals within our country, in both our prison system and our communities, are being inspired by al- Qaeda's violent ideology to plan and execute attacks, often acting as ``lone wolves'' without direct orders or ties to al- Qaeda. As Senator Lieberman has indicated, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which we authored, did much to improve the management and performance of our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement agencies. This most sweeping reform of our Nation's intelligence community since just after World War II would not have happened without the leadership of our witnesses and the advocacy of the families of the victims. The resulting increased collaboration and information sharing have helped our Nation prevent numerous attacks. There have been untold successes. In many cases, the intelligence community and law enforcement have quietly connected the dots and thwarted plots. In other cases, alert citizens have reported suspicious behavior to the authorities just in time. Challenges still remain, however. We continue to see troubling examples of the pre-9/11 stovepiped mindset from some of our intelligence and law enforcement officers. For example, as documented in our Committee's recent report on the Fort Hood attack, the Army and the FBI collectively had ample information to have detected Major Hasan's radicalization to violent Islamist extremism, but they failed to act on the many red flags signaling that he had become a potential threat. Major Hasan and others seem to find motivation and ideas online. Technology is transforming our culture, our economy, and our world in many beneficial ways. Yet we must also be alert to the fact that terrorists are seeking to exploit the Internet's potential as well. We have recently witnessed that the Internet can serve as a platform for extremist propaganda on the one hand and peaceful revolution on the other. Other Commission recommendations have not yet come to fruition, and, of course, the most obvious example of that is Congress' failure to reform itself. But there are others as well. We must make more progress, as the Chairman has indicated, in enhancing first responder communications. Gaps also remain at our borders and in our cargo inspection systems. As the news today indicates, the potential to plant an explosive somewhere within the millions of pieces of air cargo shipped around the world each day is a real vulnerability. It is also troubling that the Border Patrol does not have the ability to detect illegal activity across approximately three-quarters of the Northern Border. DHS must continue to work to find a balance that opens our border to our friends while closing it to those who would do us harm. Nevertheless, there have been real accomplishments: The biometric system for screening foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States, the creation of a consolidated terrorist watchlist, and the dedicated DHS and State and local law enforcement employees all deserve recognition. But even in these areas of progress, improvements are needed. Biometric screening must be expanded to include foreign nationals leaving the United States. Screening technology must be improved to keep up with changing threats and to ensure that the safest possible screening equipment is deployed. I hope that this year we can expand protection against lawsuits for citizens who report suspicious behavior indicating potential terrorist activity. We must also pass legislation to ensure that key U.S. intelligence officials are consulted following a foreign terrorist's detention in the United States. That did not happen in the case of Abdulmutallab. And, finally, I continue to have deep concerns that this Administration refuses to acknowledge that violent Islamist extremism is the ideology that fuels such attacks. The Administration should have an overarching national strategy to counter this growing threat within our own country. Ten years ago, nearly 3,000 lives were lost on that terrible day. We cannot become complacent or let our guard down when every single intelligence briefing that I have ever attended always warns that the enemy remains determined to attack our country. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you very much, Senator Collins, for that excellent statement. Normally we limit opening statements to the Chairman and the Ranking Member on the Committee, but Senator McCain was, as you two know, the original sponsor of the legislation that created the 9/11 Commission, so, Senator McCain, I would invite you to make an opening statement if you would like. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MCCAIN Senator McCain. I would just briefly like to thank our witnesses. I think what they did was one of the reasons why this country has not been attacked since 9/11. They are two dedicated public servants, an example of bipartisanship, and I think it is very appropriate that on the 10-year anniversary, we get their continued input. Thank you again for your service to the country. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you, Senator McCain. Before we go to the witnesses, I just want to briefly introduce Charles Dowd, Deputy Chief of the New York Police Department for Communications. He has been a very strong proponent of allocating the D Block to public safety, and we appreciate the fact that he is committed enough to this that he is here in the room today. Governor Kean, welcome, and we look forward to your testimony now. TESTIMONY OF HON. THOMAS H. KEAN,\1\ FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TERRORIST ATTACKS UPON THE UNITED STATES Mr. Kean. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Senator Collins. We are very pleased to have the opportunity to be here with you once again today. Nobody has been more important than you all have been at the center of defending this country from the terrorist threat that we face. We are deeply grateful for your sustained support of our 9/11 Commission recommendations and your leadership in continuing to reform our national security institutions. Over the last decade, you have done much to ensure that we are taking the difficult steps necessary to confront this determined enemy and protect Americans, our allies, and, for that matter, people throughout the world. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The joint prepared statement of Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton appears in the Appendix on page 364. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Today, we are appearing in our capacity as co-chairmen of the Bipartisan Policy Center's National Security Preparedness Group. That is the successor organization to the 9/11 Commission. Drawing on a strong roster of national security professionals, we work as an independent, bipartisan group to monitor the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations and to address other emerging national security issues. Let me begin by describing the changes in our government since 9/11, the current threat, and perhaps updating you on some of our Commission's recommendations. Lee Hamilton will then continue assessing the status of the implementation of a number of these recommendations. So now nearly 10 years after the tragic 9/11 attacks and 7 years since we finished our report, it really is, as the Committee has decided, a very appropriate time to see just where we are in national security reform and how we are doing. The terrorist attacks, as everybody knows, had a profoundly dramatic impact on our government, on the private sector, and, for that matter, on our daily lives. The suddenness of that attack on American soil and the loss of so many lives I think made a lot of us feel vulnerable in our homes and caused us to question whether or not our government was properly organized to protect us from this kind of lethal threat. The economic damage resulting from the attacks was severe. Businesses in all sectors have adapted in one way or another to this new reality. Over the past 10 years, our government's response to the challenge of transnational terrorism has been equally dramatic. We have created major new institutions--the Department of Homeland Security, Cyber Command, and in 2004, with the leadership of Senator Collins and Lieberman, Congress created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center to make sure we had a unity of effort in the intelligence community. Now, despite all this progress, some major 9/11 Commission recommendations still remain unfulfilled, and we would suggest today that these require urgent action because the threat from al-Qaeda, related terrorist groups, and individual adherents to violent Islamist extremism persists to this day. Al-Qaeda and related terrorist groups continue to pose a serious threat to all of us. Al-Qaeda Central has been diminished, but its leadership, Osama bin Laden and al- Zawahiri, as we know, are still at large. Although a devastating 9/11-type attack we believe is less likely, the threat is more complex and diverse than at any time in the last decade. Al-Qaeda and its allies continue to have the intent and the reach to kill dozens or even hundreds of Americans in a single attack. There is a high risk of attacks, but we believe that they will likely be smaller. A key change in recent years is the increasingly prominent role that a number of U.S. citizens and residents have taken in the leadership of al-Qaeda and aligned groups. Another development is the increasing diversification of the types of U.S.-based jihadist militants. Some are individuals inspired to engage in attacks on their own while others have been actively recruited by overseas terrorist groups. Indeed, these would-be jihadists do not fit any particular ethnic, economic, educational, or social profile. The operations they mount, or attempt, range from shootings, to car bombs, to suicide attacks, to in-flight bombings of passenger aircraft. We have seen a pattern of increasing terrorist recruitment of American citizens. In 2009, there were two actual terrorist attacks on our soil. You referenced the Fort Hood shooting, which claimed the lives of 13 people, and one U.S. military recruiter was killed, another wounded, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Many counterterrorism experts talk about 2010 and name it the ``year of the homegrown terrorist.'' Self- radicalization is an alarming development. Our group issued a report, as you have mentioned, last fall on radicalization, and we are going to follow up this spring with a set of recommendations for dealing with this important and very sensitive problem. We also face new threats, like the discovery in October 2010 of explosives packed in toner cartridges, addressed to synagogues in Chicago, and shipped on FedEx and UPS cargo flights from Yemen. The cyber threat is also increasingly severe and poses a real danger to our critical infrastructure. Defending the United States against such attacks must be an urgent priority. So we would like to offer our assessment today of where the government is in implementing 9/11 Commission recommendations. On emergency preparedness, we have made some progress toward establishing a unity of command--in other words, one person responsible for coordinating efforts in a disaster. But having said that, our recommendations are still a long way from being fully implemented. We have found too many community leaders and first responders who have mentioned to us that many metropolitan areas still have not solved the problem of having a unified command structure. Moreover, it is unacceptable that the government still has not allocated the additional 10 megahertz of radio spectrum, the D Block that you mentioned, to public safety so that our first responders can communicate with each other in a disaster. Now, I recognize the efforts and the leadership that you have shown through your bill. I believe the President supports such a recommendation, and Congress needs to act. There have been improvements in transportation security, but technology still lags in screening passengers for weapons concealed in their bodies and for detecting explosives contained in bags. The GAO continues to find holes in virtually every single security layer that we establish. Border security remains a top national security priority as terrorists continue to exploit our border vulnerabilities to gain entry into the United States. Several attempted attacks over the past 2 years were perpetrated by terrorists who could have been detected by the U.S. immigration system. We require a more streamlined terrorist watchlisting capability and better sharing of information between intelligence agencies and immigration authorities. One area of progress is the deployment of the biometric entry system known as US-VISIT. We still lack, however, any comprehensive exit system. We do not know, in other words, when people leave the country. The Commission recommends that the government standardize secure identification and the Federal Government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and driver's licenses. The REAL ID Act established these standards by statute. About one-third of the States have complied with this first- tier benchmark. The deadlines for compliance have been pushed back now twice. Delay in compliance creates real vulnerability and makes us less safe. We would ask that no further delays should be authorized. Now I will ask my friend and partner, a man I admire as much as anybody in this country, Lee Hamilton, to continue. TESTIMONY OF HON. LEE H. HAMILTON,\1\ FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TERRORIST ATTACKS UPON THE UNITED STATES Mr. Hamilton. Thank you, Mr. Kean. Good morning. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The joint prepared statement of Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton appears in the Appendix on page 364. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I want to begin simply by endorsing what Mr. Kean has said with regard to the leadership not only of this Committee but specifically of the three Senators in front of me. I can remember coming to your offices shortly after the 9/11 Commission report was made. Mr. Kean and I spoke to each one of you. You were very courteous and receptive. But beyond that, you acted with genuine political leadership, and the country is very grateful to you. I think there are a lot of reasons why the 9/11 Commission had a favorable response, but two of them: First, the families who gave sustained, sophisticated support for our recommendations; second, specifically the political leadership embodied by the three of you was just really quite extraordinary. And Mr. Kean and I are very grateful to you for what you have done. And when the Chairman a moment ago outlined your continuing hearings and investigations, I was immensely pleased to hear that because I think having been on the inside and on the outside, you have powers that we do not have in terms of getting people before you to provide tough oversight, and that continuing effort by this Committee is just hugely important because, as we will say often this morning, so much more needs to be done. With respect to intelligence reform, the DNI has made progress in several areas: Increased information sharing, improved cooperation among agencies and of the analysis of intelligence, and sharpened collection priorities. Genuine progress, no doubt about it. Still, it is not clear to us that the DNI is the driving force for intelligence community integration that the Commission envisioned. Some ambiguity probably remains with respect to the DNI's authority over budget and personnel, although that can be disputed, I guess. Strengthening the DNI's position would advance the unity of intelligence effort that we think is still very much needed. I do not anticipate new legislation--you would know more about that than I on this subject--in the very near future. So we have to live with the statute that we have for an extended period of time. It may very well be that in the future some legislation could fortify the office. Repeated indication from the President that the DNI is the unequivocal leader of the intelligence community, I think, would be greatly helpful. The FBI has gone through dramatic change. I think it is moving in a positive direction, but in some sense incomplete. It has had, I believe, very strong leadership from Director Robert Mueller. It shifted resources to collect and analyze intelligence to prevent terrorism. That is an enormous cultural change, as you all know, away from its former focus strictly on law enforcement. Its progress has been significant but uneven. The Fort Hood shootings highlight the lingering problems. Your report, which I have looked over quickly, has spelled that out, I think, in a very persuasive and compelling way. Analysts do not appear to be driving intelligence within the FBI, nor have they achieved status on a par with the special agents who traditionally rise to management of the Bureau. FBI headquarters components did not play a direct role in analyzing the threat posed by the person who later allegedly did the shootings. There were miscommunications, as Senator Collins has indicated in her opening statement, between the field offices, so the shift taking place within the FBI is still very much a work in progress. Congress needs to continue to help the FBI with its difficult transformation. The CIA has improved its intelligence analysis and removed barriers between its analysts and operations officers. Our sense is that there has been more talk than action with respect to improvement in the CIA's human operations. Acquiring well-placed sources is very difficult business, particularly in closed societies and among close-knit terrorist cells. More money and more personnel do not necessarily result in better agents. While the CIA has attempted to recruit officers qualified in the languages of the greatest interest, that, too, is very hard. Part of the problem is that young people in our country, with some exceptions, of course, do not gain proficiency in foreign languages. Congress can help on that. The CIA then must continue to rebuild. It will require strong support from Congress and the Executive Branch. We want the Agency to take calculated risks to protect the country. Congressional oversight must be depoliticized so that when the Agency fails, as it occasionally will, it is not inappropriately blamed for taking the necessary risks. Improving information sharing across the Federal Government and with State and local authorities was a major recommendation. In some ways, I think the government is doing better. The Joint Terrorism Task Forces and Fusion Centers across the country have certainly improved information sharing. The National Counterterrorism Center has analysts and other officers from all agencies of the intelligence community working side by side and sharing information with their home organizations. There have been some failures, as has already been indicated. There is no question that WikiLeaks' unauthorized publication of sensitive government documents has raised some genuine and real concerns. Those are legitimate. But the need to share information we think still remains highly important, and we should not backslide on that. Congress has to help the government strike the right balance between the need to protect unauthorized disclosures and the need to share information to defend ourselves against the threats we face. Among our major disappointments has been that the Administration has not empaneled the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. This was a major recommendation very strongly supported by all the Commissioners. I am informed--I am not sure I am quite up to date on this--that the Administration has nominated two individuals for the panel. I know one of them personally. As far as we know, they have not yet been confirmed, and the panel certainly has not met. The Administration, I believe, needs to push this on a priority basis because that board has a lot to do, and I think this Committee can be helpful in pushing the Administration. We are equally disappointed that Congress has not reformed itself along the lines we recommended. We recommended that Congress create a Joint Committee on Intelligence or create House and Senate committees with combined authorizing and appropriation powers. Those recommendations may be a bridge too far. Last week, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced a decision to include three members of the House Appropriations Committee to participate in House Intelligence Committee hearings and briefings. That appears to us to be a positive step, but obviously there is more to do. Oversight of the Department of Homeland Security is fractured. That massive Department will be better integrated if there is better integrated oversight. I know the concerns you have expressed about that. It is in our country's security interest that Congress make committee reform a priority. Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons must be a national priority. The Administration hosted a major nonproliferation summit last year and announced a new initiative to secure all nuclear materials by 2013. It plans to spend $14.2 billion over the next 5 years to secure nuclear and radiological materials. May I say outside my statement that because of other responsibilities I have dealing with nuclear power, I have recently had the occasion to listen to some highly qualified people within our government, and I believe the access to nuclear materials and the ability to use those materials and to explode them is much greater than people generally think. And so I hope the Congress will keep a hard, sharp focus on this question of nuclear proliferation. I know there are some suggestions to cut some of these important programs. Money is not everything here, but we must not weaken or underfund what President Bush and President Obama have both said is the highest priority security need. Now, at the outset of his Administration, President Obama issued Executive Orders that brought the United States into line with international norms for the treatment of detainees. That fulfilled part of our recommendation. We believe there is a conflict between the rule of law and holding detainees indefinitely without resolving their cases. Both Presidents Bush and Obama have really wrestled with this problem. It is a tough one. President Obama took a step forward by requiring periodic reviews of the status of detainees, but there is an awful lot more to do. The Congress and the Executive Branch simply have to agree on a statutory base to give us a comprehensive approach to dealing with the detainees. Congress and the Executive Branch need to agree on the rules of evidence and the procedures that should be applied in determining how to deal with these detainees. I do not think this is a problem that can just simply go on and on and on. You need a statutory basis--and I do not suggest it is easy to reach it--on how to deal with these potentially very dangerous detainees. We had a number of foreign policy recommendations in the report. Events today in the Middle East and North Africa clearly indicate that the region is in a state of upheaval, and it is quite unclear to any of us how it will emerge. We addressed the role that U.S. foreign policy plays in counterterrorism, but we did it, to be honest about it, with considerable modesty. We believe that although the countries share a common religion, their people have many cultural, national, ethnic, and tribal differences, and therefore, we have to deal with them on a country-by-country basis. We want our country always to advance its core values, but a pragmatic approach for each country, one that supports an agenda of opportunity for the Islamic world, we think is necessary. So, to conclude, significant progress has been made since 9/11, and our country is undoubtedly more secure. Yet important 9/11 Commission recommendations remain to be implemented, and over the next few years, a lot of heavy lifting still needs to be done. As Mr. Kean mentioned just a moment ago, the fact that we have not resolved this radio spectrum problem and have not resolved the unity of command is just really distressing to us. Those are two no-brainers with regard to the safety and security of the country. Some progress has been made in both areas, but not nearly enough. Congress has resisted reorganizing its own institutions, and streamlining congressional oversight of the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security would go far toward advancing unity of effort in the intelligence community and within DHS. Also the DNI needs a clear-eyed appraisal. I think it is functioning reasonably well. Likewise the FBI. We have concerns about each, and our goal really should be to strengthen both the DNI and the FBI. The terrorist threat will be with us far into the future, demanding that we be ever vigilant. Our national security departments require strong leadership and attentive management at every level to ensure that all parts are working well together and that there is innovation and imagination. Our agencies and their dedicated workforces have gone through much change, and we commend them for their achievements in protecting the American people. But there is a tendency toward inertia in all bureaucracies, and vigorous congressional oversight is just imperative to ensure that they remain vigilant and continue to pursue needed reforms. So our task is challenging and difficult. We constantly have to assess our vulnerabilities and anticipate new and evolving lines of attack. We have done a lot. We can look back with some satisfaction, but there is an awful lot more to do. We are very grateful to you for the opportunity to testify before this Committee, which has provided longstanding leadership on these issues, and we will do our best now to respond to your questions. Chairman Lieberman. Thank you both for those thoughtful opening statements. I think you really helped us get some perspective on where we have come in the last several years, certainly since 2004, when the 9/11 Commission Act was enacted. But you have also given us a clear statement of unfinished business and priorities for the future, and I appreciate that. Before I begin my questioning, I want to note the presence since we began of Abraham Scott, whose wife, Janice, died at the Pentagon on 9/11, and he is another one of those family members who have continued in the battle to do everything they can to make sure nothing like this happens again. I thought both of you summarized well where we have come and also noted that the steps we have taken to improve our homeland security, including those very significant steps that were part of your recommendations that we adopted, have strengthened our security, but that the nature of the threat has changed. We can never say never, but certainly our defenses against a sophisticated 9/11-type attack are way up and, therefore, the prospects of that happening are down, thank God. There is a high risk right now of smaller attacks than 9/ 11, particularly of attacks that come from within the country because that has become a focus of al-Qaeda and all the other international Islamist terrorist groups. I wanted to begin by asking you, Governor Kean, just to talk a little bit more about the inadequacy of unity of command at this point and what you think we can do about it. Mr. Kean. Well, this was one of the real problems on 9/11. Who was in charge? Chairman Lieberman. Right. Mr. Kean. And so our recommendation very strongly to all communities has been there has to be one leader. Now, New York City made a lot of progress in that regard by putting everything under the police department. Some cities have followed that pattern and some have not, and so there are still a number of communities, some of them fairly sizable, where people tell us there is still that question. If something really happens, who is in charge? Businesses have made more progress. I think almost all major businesses I know now have somebody who is in charge if something happens. They know what they should do. They know where employees ought to go. All that is in place in a lot of major businesses. But in communities, not as yet, and we think it is a very serious problem and one that we have to address and make it, as best we can, a requirement that somebody be in charge. Chairman Lieberman. Well, I am really interested that you have focused on the local or metropolitan level, and I think we have to do some thinking about that to see whether we cannot create some requirement or incentive to bring about that unity of command at the local level, perhaps by making it a condition of some of the homeland security or other grants. Let me take you to the national level. I am reading from Section 13.1 of the Commission's report on Unity of Effort Across the Foreign-Domestic Divide, and this section of the report notes specifically that during the Commission's hearings, members of the Commission often asked, ``Who is the quarterback? The other players are in their positions doing their jobs. But who is calling the play that assigns the roles to help them execute as a team?'' To respond to this need, in my interpretation of the Commission's report, you recommended creating a National Counterterrorism Center with the responsibility to develop counterterrorism plans that integrate all the instruments of national power, and that was, I think, one of the most significant recommendations and one of the most significant components of our legislation. So as you look back nationally now, are you satisfied there is clarity and unity of command at the national level and that we now have a quarterback? And is it the National Counterterrorism Center? Mr. Kean. Well, it is the National Counterterrorism Center and, of course, the DNI. Chairman Lieberman. Right. Mr. Kean. In combination. They are the quarterback. Now, whether they are being implemented as the quarterback, whether or not they really have the power that you intended when you wrote the law and that we intended when we made recommendations, I do not know. Chairman Lieberman. Yes. Mr. Kean. Because the signals sometimes are mixed. And we have to have unity of effort in that regard. We have to have the quarterback. And I would suggest that you would probe that area and find out whether or not the quarterback is in place and whether or not the quarterback has the powers that you intended him to have in the legislation. Chairman Lieberman. There is no question that the National Counterterrorism Center has created unprecedented cooperation between components of our security and intelligence communities. In that sense, the dots are all on the same board now. One of the problems, I say in passing, that we have noted in some of our earlier hearings and it was a cause of some of the cases that we have studied that were not as we would want is that the problem now is there are so many dots on the same board that it is hard in real time to separate them out to connect the ones that ought to be connected, but they are not on separate boards anymore. Mr. Hamilton. Mr. Chairman, may I say a word about it? Chairman Lieberman. Yes, please. Mr. Hamilton. You have two problems there. You have raised both of them. One is the scene of the disaster. Chairman Lieberman. Right. Mr. Hamilton. And there it is kind of a no-brainer, too, for me anyway, that someone has to be in charge. Now, that creates difficult political problems because the governor wants to be in charge, the mayor wants to be in charge, county officials want to be in charge. And that is the reason it has not been resolved because the politicians are unwilling to address the question because it is a tough one to say who is in charge. Now, I do not know whether that barrier can be overcome or not, but in terms of saving lives, it is an easy question to answer. You have to have one person making decisions with regard to sanitation, public health, food, housing, and transportation. Chairman Lieberman. Right. Mr. Hamilton. They have to make thousands of decisions within a matter of a few hours, really, at these scenes. And if you have confusion of command at that locale, you lose additional lives. So that is why we think it is an important matter. I really do not know how well different metropolitan areas around the country have addressed this problem, but I am very uneasy about it, and I do not really think it has been solved in most areas. Now, the second problem relates to a unity of effort in the Administration, which is the broader question. Chairman Lieberman. Right. Mr. Hamilton. Who is the quarterback? I follow this reasonably carefully. I do not pretend to know everything about it. I do not know who the quarterback is. And I will give you my impression. My impression is that the number one official within the White House is John Brennan on these matters. That makes me a little uneasy--not because of him. He is an extremely dedicated, important, capable man. But he is right in the center of the policy world at the White House. He is not removed from it like I generally want intelligence officials to be. And so I am not sure whether he is the right person to do it. But if he is, then it seems to me there ought to be a very clear designation that he is in charge of homeland security and counterterrorism. Today, quite frankly, from where I sit, it looks to me like a number of different people are involved in it, including Mr. Brennan, including the Director of National Intelligence, including the DHS Secretary and several others. I do not know who the quarterback is, and I can identify the Commissioners who raised that question all the time in the meetings we had, Mr. Kean. Mr. Kean. That is right. Mr. Hamilton. My guess is those same Commissioners would be raising the same question today, who is the quarterback? Chairman Lieberman. That is very helpful commentary, and I agree with you that we have the combination--and I am simplifying here--of the critical role of intelligence in counterterrorism and homeland security, but also then the other roles, which are different, of preparedness and prevention and response. And I agree with you, Mr. Hamilton, that the top person today in our government is John Brennan, the Deputy National Security Adviser for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. And, again, I have great respect for his ability, etc. Whether that is the right place for that role to be is an important question. Mr. Hamilton. The President should have the right to organize his White House he wants to organize it. Chairman Lieberman. Right. Mr. Hamilton. And maybe the President is comfortable with this. Chairman Lieberman. Yes. Mr. Hamilton. As an outsider here, who looks at it fairly carefully, it is not clear to me that the lines of authority are precise. Chairman Lieberman. Yes, and I think you have quite accurately identified the key players. It is the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center. And, of course, there are others--the FBI Director---- Mr. Hamilton. Yes. Chairman Lieberman. But more than anyone else, Mr. Brennan seems to us day to day to be coordinating that effort. There are different roles here, although you could pick one of those other players and make that person the coordinator. It might be the Secretary of Homeland Security who has both operating and intelligence authority. You have given us a good charge for our review during this year. My time is up. Thank you. Senator Collins. Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me pick up on this very issue of who is in charge. To me, it was very clear when we passed the Reform Act in 2004 that we wanted the DNI to be in charge. That is why we created this new quarterback position. And yet I completely agree with Congressman Hamilton that in this particular Administration, the person who is in charge is Mr. Brennan at the White House. And putting aside his enormous capabilities, which we all agree to, the problem with that situation is there is no accountability to Congress. It is a member of the President's staff, so we cannot call Mr. Brennan to testify before us. We cannot hold him accountable for decisions. And I think that is another very big problem. The other area of confusion of command, as Congressman Hamilton has said and Governor Kean well knows, is when a disaster strikes or there is a crisis situation. And we saw this with Abdulmutallab where there was tremendous confusion over who was in charge and who should make decisions. In that case, it ended up being the Attorney General who made the decision on how to treat Abdulmutallab without any consultation whatsoever with the DNI, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or any top intelligence official on whether or not Abdulmutallab should be questioned about whether there were further plots, and that was a lost intelligence opportunity. Are these problems that we can fix through legislation? Or are they problems that depend on an individual President setting up who is truly going to be in power? The reason I ask this question is when I go back and review the language creating the DNI, it is pretty strong language. Now, we tried to get it to be even stronger in the area of personnel, but in fact, the DNI has strong authority to set priorities for the intelligence community, to oversee the budget formulation, to make some personnel decisions. Is this really a case where we need to strengthen the law? Or is it a case where the President needs to empower the person we intended to be empowered? I would like to hear from both of you in either order on this question. Mr. Hamilton. I think the latter--the President has to step in here. Now, any law, as we all know, can be strengthened. But as I suggested, this law is not going to be changed in the immediate future. It took you several years to get it on the statute books, so maybe in the future it will be clarified. But, Senator Collins, I basically agree with your comment that there is sufficient authority in present law. We envisioned, of course, that the DNI would be the central powerful driver of the intelligence community. I do not think he has been. Now, I want to say here, too, you know I have known all of these men that have held that position. It is a very tough position. We have had very good men in that position. They really have been quite strong. But that line of authority is not as clear as it should be, and so I think given the circumstances that you now have, your second choice, that is, the President has to step in and make it very clear with regard to his authority in the intelligence community, over budget and over personnel and over transfer of funds within the budget. And so far as I can see, that really has not been done. Now, having said that, the DNI deals with some pretty powerful players--the Secretary of Defense, the CIA Director-- and if they get a decision within the bureaucracy they do not like, they will go directly to the President. Fair enough. So the DNI may have authority and he may try to exercise it, but he has to exercise that authority with extraordinary skill and discretion. And these are all major players within the Administration, and so that power has to be very skillfully exercised. But I personally think the system is going to work a lot better if you have someone at the top of it who is the driving force, who is recognized as the center of power, who has the authority, and obviously has to have the support of the President, to do the things that need to be done to get unity of effort. Senator Collins. Thank you. Governor Kean. Mr. Kean. Yes, I remember when the bill was going through. It was weakened a bit in the House, and I remember talking to Mr. Hamilton about it at the time, and he said, ``Do not worry because in the end it is the President. And if the President gives the DNI the authority, the DNI will be just the way you want it to be. If not, the law is not going to help.'' And that is where we are. My own belief is the law says the DNI ought to be the top intelligence operative, I think it will work better that way, and that is probably how it ought to be. But if this President wants somebody else, then my only recommendation would be that he make that clear and that both publicly and within the Administration everybody knows where the lines of authority are, and if somebody else is going to be in full charge, let us say who that person is, and then everybody knows, because the worst thing of all is a vacuum or confusion or lines that are not clear. The President is the only one who can make those lines clear, and the President is the only one who could make it happen. Senator Collins. I agree that the President's response is absolutely clear and needs to be clearer here, and that if the President does not empower the DNI, we can write all the language in the world, and the DNI is not going to truly be in charge. But I also remain very concerned about the lack of accountability to Congress and the public when it is a member of the President's staff who is running the intelligence community. Mr. Hamilton. I just want to support what you said. I think that is terribly important. Mr. Kean. Very important. Mr. Hamilton. The person who is in charge, whoever it is, ought to be accountable to Congress at all times. That is just fundamental, it seems to me, to the way this place ought to operate. Senator Collins. Thank you. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks very much, Senator Collins. Of course, I agree with you, and it strikes me that ultimately the DNI has ample authority--not as much as any of us wanted, but ample authority in the current statute, but it really requires the President to make clear that the DNI is the person in charge of the intelligence community. We all expected that coming in as a new position to oversee existing agencies, which have a real life of their own and a constituency of their own, would be difficult. And it is interesting that General James Clapper--really to just amplify a bit on what I said in my opening statement--I think because of his background in the military and credibility at the Pentagon, has actually negotiated an agreement with Secretary Robert Gates, which will enable the DNI to have much more authority with regard to intelligence budgeting, appropriations, than was the case at the beginning of the office, and that is good. The question of who is on top overall in the counterterrorism effort is a complicated one because there is not only the intelligence community but all the others--the operators, the preventers, and the responders. But I, again, agree that it has to be somebody at the top--nothing negative about Mr. Brennan--who is accountable to Congress and the public. And we have to think about how to deal with that problem. Mr. Kean. Yes, I think that is very important. When we first talked about the position, I think what we envisioned was a man or woman who would step into that position and stay 5 or 6 years and develop the position, strengthen it and all of that. We have had this rotating door, really, of very good people, but in and out. Chairman Lieberman. Right. Mr. Kean. And that has been one of the problems with the DNI, and hopefully we have one now who will stay for a while. Chairman Lieberman. I hope. Thank you. Next in order of arrival, Senator Akaka and then Senator Carper. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR AKAKA Senator Akaka. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing, and I would like to welcome Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, and thank you for being here today. Although many of the information-sharing and intelligence shortfalls that the 9/11 Commission identified have been addressed, critical work remains to ensure that we have an agile and well-coordinated response to terrorist threats, and you have been discussing this. Supporting our Federal workers at DHS, the intelligence community, and other agencies who make daily sacrifices to keep us safe is essential to this effort. Additionally, we must never lose sight of the privacy and civil liberties implications of our efforts to protect the Nation. In particular, I agree with our witnesses' comments that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board must be set up immediately. Congressman Hamilton, as you know, I believe that GAO could assist our efforts to strengthen oversight of the intelligence community. In response to my question in 2007, you stated that GAO should have the same authorities within the intelligence community as it has in other agencies. Key principles of my Intelligence Community Audit Act were included in the Intelligence Authorization Act last year. Under this legislation, the Director of National Intelligence must issue a directive to facilitate GAO audits and evaluations of the intelligence community. What elements should be included in the DNI directive to promote effective oversight? Mr. Hamilton. Senator, I am not sure I understand the question. What elements should the DNI insist upon for oversight? Senator Akaka. To include in the directive to promote effective oversight. Mr. Hamilton. The DNI's oversight of the intelligence community or congressional oversight? Senator Akaka. Well, either one. Mr. Hamilton. Well, I am not sure I have the thrust of the question in mind, but I am deeply impressed that only you folks in the Congress can effectively oversee the intelligence community. The press does not know what is going on. Those of us outside Congress do not have the information that you have and your staffs have about what is going on. So unlike most other areas of our government, the only really effective independent oversight of the intelligence community can come from the Congress. Now, you have the President's Intelligence Advisory Board. I serve on that. But they are all appointed by the President, and they are not really an independent group. So in all of the recommendations we made, we thought that the strengthening and persistence of congressional oversight was just absolutely critical to the success of the implementation of the recommendations. Now, I know that there is a lot of internal oversight that takes place within each agency, and I think within the DNI's office as well, and that can be important to oversee it. But that is not an independent oversight. That can only come from Congress. I support giving the GAO ample powers to review the intelligence community, and I agree with you, Senator Akaka, that GAO should have a key role. The DNI should issue directives to intelligence agencies requiring their cooperation with GAO. I do want to pick up on your observations about the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board because this has been a source of enormous frustration to Mr. Kean and to me. I just cannot figure it out. I do not know what President Bush and President Obama think. They just have not put an effective board in place, and I cannot understand why. Now, this is urgently needed because in homeland security and intelligence matters, you have greatly accelerated surveillance. All kinds of provisions are written into the law that expand the powers of the FBI and the intelligence agencies, understandably in most cases, I think, to check on what the American people are doing. And I think somebody needs to be out there to keep their eye on these folks in a very aggressive way because the security people within an agency almost always win the arguments, and you need an independent source to really keep your eye on them. So we favored a strong, robust oversight of civil liberties and privacy with the power to issue subpoenas and a power to call people in front of them and keep a watchful eye because I think there has not been enough attention to the question of civil liberties and privacy in general with regard to homeland security. Mr. Kean. I might just add that Mr. Hamilton is right. Nothing has frustrated me more, of almost all our recommendations, than the lack of progress on civil liberties and the board, and I do not know what problems the administrations have with the bill that you passed. But if there is a problem with it, if there is something wrong with the structure, if they think it is intrusive or something, then tell us and maybe you will change it. But to not appoint members and to be almost 2 years into an administration which has not even nominated enough members to make a quorum is frustrating and makes no sense to me and leaves a big hole in what we should be doing. So again, I do not understand it. I am frustrated by it. But if there is a problem, I wish they would tell us what the problem is. Senator Akaka. Thank you for those observations. I really agree with you that we need to set that up immediately. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Lieberman. Thanks, Senator Akaka. Senator Collins and I were talking. We can address a letter to the White House to ask what is going on here because I do not think there is any policy or ideological opposition to the board. I suppose it is always possible that there are elements within the intelligence community that do not like the idea, but I actually have not heard that either. I think we will address a letter right away and see if we can get you a response.\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The letter referenced by Chairman Lieberman appears in the Appendix on page 387. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Hamilton. Thank you. Mr. Kean. Thank you very much. Chairman Lieberman. Next is Senator Carper. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CARPER Senator Carper. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, we have gathered before us today two of my very favorite people in public life: Mr. Kean, a great governor of New Jersey, our neighbor across the Delaware River, and someone for whom we have huge respect in our State; and Mr. Hamilton with whom I was privileged to serve for 10 years. I was privileged to think of him as one of my mentors. And it is just great to see both of you still so active, vibrant, and contributing on so many different levels. About once a month I am asked what is wrong in Washington, and one of the things I always talk about is the lack of trust--sometimes a lack of trust between parties, sometimes a lack of trust between the Executive and Legislative branches, sometimes a lack of trust between Committee chairs and ranking members, and this Committee is an example of what you can get done when you have a trusting relationship, with Senators Lieberman and Collins. Every month I talk about the trust that the two of you developed when you assumed your positions as the leaders of the 9/11 Commission and how you provided an example through that trust to the other members of the Commission and achieved extraordinary consensus and came to us and enabled us, with your leadership, to reflect and to follow that example. So I just wanted to lead off by saying that. I am fortunate to chair a subcommittee of this Committee. It has a long name, but it is called Federal Financial Management for short. We poke in almost every nook and cranny of the Federal Government to see if there are ways that we can get better results for less money. In this hearing room yesterday, we heard from, among others, the Department of Defense and GAO, and we were looking at the GAO report that came out yesterday that cited major weapon systems cost overruns for 2010 of $402 billion, up from $42 billion a decade earlier. In this room, we have had hearings in the last month on improper payments--not fraud, but just mistakes, overpayments for the most part. We have a new number for improper payments for last year--$125 billion--not counting the Department of Defense, and not counting the Medicare prescription drug program. We have had hearings on surplus property. We have thousands and thousands of pieces of surplus property we do not use, we need to get rid of, and they are just a burden on us, $300 billion, plus tax gap monies that are owed and not being collected. Those are the kinds of things we focus on in this room. With that spirit of trying to change the culture around here or at the Department of Defense or in the Legislative or Executive Branch throughout the Federal Government, to move from what I call a culture of spendthrift to a culture of thrift, would you join with us today maybe just to think about it and then to come back to us in writing? I know there are things we are doing, entitlement programs, we have had many hearings on those as well, and domestic discretionary spending programs and defense programs, things that we are doing where we can get a better result for less money or a better result for not a lot more money. With that spirit in mind, can you just think out loud with us for a minute or two here today about if there is some way that we can get a better result in this area of national security and homeland security without spending more money or even spending a little bit less? Mr. Hamilton. Well, no, my impression, Senator, is in the area of homeland security and intelligence--I know this is not the Intelligence Committee--the whole question of cost effectiveness rarely arises. Senator Carper. That is true. Mr. Hamilton. We have been set on a course, for understandable reasons, since 9/11 to create enormous increases in intelligence budgets and a massive new Department, DHS, and everybody has hit the full-speed-ahead button. I do not have the specific figures, but you have had an enormous increase in the total amount of money spent in intelligence just in the last few years, for reasons we all understand. So when you began your comments on cost effectiveness, getting better results for less money, my response was, ``Bravo,'' because I think you need a hard-headed business attitude, if you would, in this area, which has been totally absent for 10 years. There is probably a little exaggeration in what I have just said, but I think cost effectiveness here would be important and making these fellows come in who head these agencies and not only hold their feet to the fire with regard to homeland security and stopping terrorist attacks, but making sure this money is being wisely spent. It makes a lot of sense to me. So I think you perform an enormously important service as you push the whole business of cost effectiveness. Senator Carper. All right. Mr. Kean. I think there is no question, whether it is public or private sector, if you ramp up as fast as we felt we had to ramp up after 9/11, you are going to have problems. You are going to overspend. You are going to waste some money. And I am sure that has been done. Spending on non-military intelligence, that number is now public. I guess the military intelligence spending is not public yet. I assume, combined, we are somewhere around $80 billion, I would guess. And that is a lot of money, and a lot of it ramped up in a great hurry. So I think what you are doing is very important. We need not only to do this well, we need to do it efficiently. Senator Carper. If I could, I am just going to ask you two to think about this for a while and maybe respond on the record after you have given it some more thought. One last question, if I may, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Lieberman. Please. Senator Carper. Going back to the early 1990s, we have seen a couple of countries come back and forth across our radar screen. They include Somalia and Yemen. Both countries have been in almost perpetual decline for, it seems like, a couple of decades. And as a result, we have seen two very different dangerous groups that are proving a clear and present danger to our country. They are al-Shabaab from Somalia and al-Qaeda from the Arabian Peninsula operating in Yemen. Both have been directly and indirectly responsible for the December 25th Christmas Day bombing attempt, the Fort Hood attacks, and Alabama and Minnesota terrorism cells. And it is clear that if these two countries implode, they will not only pose a more severe threat to us, but maybe to the rest of the world. Could either of you please describe your thoughts on the threat that these groups pose to the United States and if our Federal Government is doing enough to prevent these two specific terrorist groups from growing into a more powerful global entity? Mr. Kean. You are right. It is interesting how this business has evolved. Years ago, we used to worry about urban areas and powerful countries and so on. Those were the threat. Now it is the ungoverned areas of the world. It is the wild areas. It is t
