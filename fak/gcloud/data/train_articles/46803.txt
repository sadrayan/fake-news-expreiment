Under Wire, House Passes Big Package of Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan expressed annoyance on Thursday at the $1.1 trillion year-end spending bill now on the House floor. “You know I don’t like this process, right?” he told reporters. “I mean you know we inherited a process, a cake that was pretty much more than half-baked.”

The accompanying $650 billion tax-cut measure is another matter. Until becoming speaker, Mr. Ryan was chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, and he remains his party’s leader on tax policy.

By a vote of 318 to 109, the House on Thursday approved the tax-cut package, which will add more than a half-trillion dollars to the deficit, and supporters and critics alike said that the bill represented Mr. Ryan’s deeply held belief that tax cuts ultimately pay for themselves by fostering economic growth.

The approach also fits with his long-term vision for a more sweeping overhaul of the tax code that would lower rates for corporations and individuals and, according to some skeptics, would leave less money in the budget to spend on government programs.
