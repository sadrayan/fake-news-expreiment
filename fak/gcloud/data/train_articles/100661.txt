Wishes galore on social media for Sachin Tendulkar on birthday
Birthday wishes of current and former colleagues poured in on social media as iconic cricketer Sachin Tendulkar turned 42 on Friday.

Having bid an emotional adieu to the game in November 2013 at Wankhede, Tendulkar continues to rule the hearts of millions of his fans. Tendulkar, who is chief mentor of IPL side Mumbai Indians, is in Mumbai ahead of the team's game against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

The batting maestro's former teammate and spin legend Anil Kumble, who is still with Tendulkar as MI mentor, wished the World Cup-winner on Twitter.
