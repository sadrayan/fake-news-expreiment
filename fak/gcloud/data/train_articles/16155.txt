Subject: Fresh inquiry for a fact check

Jim:

We are checking the claim you asked about per Adler and City Hall. Do you have factual information you think we should consider?

I am interested if Adler has served on city boards or commissions or if heâ€™s otherwise participated in city government. Also, has he lobbied for anyone or otherwise represented clients at City Hall?

Thanks.

Steve has never lobbied City Hall for anyone. He has represented clients whose land was being condemned by the city, but never in front of the council.

Also:

He served on the Leadership Committee and participated in Create Austin.

As Chair of the Anti-Defamation League, he helped conceive of and serves on the city-led Hate Crimes Task Force:
