Canadian Council for Refugees
Refugees resettled to Canada must pay for their medical exam and their travel to Canada. Since most refugees of course can’t afford these expenses, Canada offers them a loan. As a result, refugee families start their new life in Canada with a debt of up to $10,000. They must repay this loan with interest.

These loans undermine refugees’ ability to integrate and to contribute to their full potential in their new home. Refugee youth are forced to work long hours while going to school, or even postpone further education, because of the need to pay back the debt.

Join in the call on the Canadian government to eliminate the loan burden on refugees. Absorbing the costs of transportation and overseas medical expenses for refugees is a good investment for refugees and for Canadian society.
