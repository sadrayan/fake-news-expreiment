Social Issues FAQ
Girl Scouts constantly reviews our materials based on feedback and suggestions we receive from our members, and we update our materials on a regular basis. As a result of this process, upcoming reprints of Journeys materials will not include playwright Josefina Lopez or links to the Women's Media Center or Media Matters. Councils will be notified of changes that are made in the future, and information on changes will be posted on our corporate website. We also are making changes on our corporate website to ensure appropriateness of content.

It is important to note that our materials feature more than 200 women and girls from many walks of life who have worked to make a difference in the world, and while we may not agree with the opinion of everyone featured, we believe they embody the commitment to leadership that we strive to teach our girls.
