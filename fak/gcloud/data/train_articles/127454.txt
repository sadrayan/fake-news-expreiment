There’s a Petition Demanding Melania Trump Move to the White House or Pay for Trump Tower Protection
Shortly after President Trump was elected, it was revealed that Melania Trump was not planning to move to the White House with her husband . Instead she would stay in New York City until their son, Barron, finished his school year. The first lady’s decision to remain at Trump Tower quickly raised concerns regarding taxpayer dollars. Then, last month, The New York Times reported that it costs the New York Police Department between $127,000 and $146,000 per day to provide protection for Melania and Barron when they stay at Trump Tower.

And now, Fortune reports, a petition is circulating online that calls for Melania to either move to the White House or pay for her own Trump Tower protection. “The U.S. taxpayer is paying an exorbitant amount of money to protect the First Lady in Trump Tower, located in New York City,” the petition reads . “As to help relieve the national debt, this expense yields no positive results for the nation and should be cut from being funded.” At publication time, the petition has already gathered 266,761 signatures, nearly matching its goal of 300,000.

Melania isn’t the only member of the Trump family to raise concerns about taxpayer dollars. When Eric Trump went on a business trip earlier this year, he racked up a bill of almost $100,000 in hotel rooms for Secret Service and other staff. And then there’s the president himself, who could be costing taxpayers millions of dollars with his weekend trips to Mar-a-Lago. Incidentally, a government watchdog will soon examine the cost and expenses associated with the president’s trips to Florida.
