Stirewalt Compares Obama & Reagan’s Responses to Downed Planes
Tonight on “The Kelly File,” Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt discussed President Barack Obama’s reaction to the Flight MH17 crash, compared to former President Ronald Reagan’s response back in 1983 when Korean Airlines Flight 007 was shot down by Soviet Union fighters.

The Korean Airlines flight was shot down en route to South Korea by Soviet Union fighter pilots when it drifted into Soviet airspace, killing 60 Americans, including a congressman.

Reagan ended his California vacation and flew back to Washington, D.C.

In a speech four days later, Reagan said, “This was the Soviet Union against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere. It was an act of barbarism born of a society which wantonly disregards individual rights and human life, and seeks constantly to expand and dominate other nations.”

Stirewalt said that Reagan and his Secretary of State George Shultz immediately went on the offensive following the downing of the plane.

“They turned the tide on the discussion of the Cold War and on the discussion of Reagan’s plans by making clear what kind of conduct that was,” Stirewalt said.

However, Obama only briefly addressed today’s tragedy, and then he headed off to two fundraisers in New York City.

“His endless talking, his endless fundraising, his endless effort to control every 15 minutes of every news cycle saps him of the ability to speak with authority and resolution when he needs to,” Stirewalt said.
