Imran Awan, Ex-Congressional I.T. Worker, Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud
A former technology worker for the House of Representatives accused of data theft by conservative news outlets pleaded guilty on Tuesday to an unrelated charge of making false statements on a loan application.

The worker, Imran Awan, 38, was arrested last summer as he tried to board a flight to Pakistan. He had been at the center of a swirl of allegations that he and several associates had conspired to steal hardware, data and perhaps even Democratic National Committee emails published by WikiLeaks.

President Trump had tried to heighten the intrigue, posting tweets claiming a media cover-up of a “Democrat I.T. scandal” and referring to Mr. Awan as a “Pakistani mystery man.”
