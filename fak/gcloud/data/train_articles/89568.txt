Trump Royale Trumps Previous Record

Largest Residential Concrete Mat Pour Achieved in Southeast FloridaSTURTEVANT, Wisconsin (February 1, 2006) – Say the name “Donald J. Trump” and one conjures up visions of the hot reality TV show “The Apprentice”, along with a man synonymous with premier real estate properties worldwide.Trump buildings are known for their spectacular views, prime locations and luxurious amenities, and the $180 million Trump Royale on Sunny Isles Beach, Florida will be no exception. Soon to be among the tallest oceanfront towers in the Miami area, the swanky condominium project is destined to feature 391 units, ranging from 914 sq. ft. to 11,000 sq. ft. and priced from $600,000 for a one-bedroom condo to a hefty $25 million for select penthouses.Beyond its super-contemporary design and elegance, Trump’s condo project has also recently gained notoriety in the construction world. On January 7, 2006, the foundation of this 55-story residential building was successfully pumped using 13,511 cubic yards of concrete in a 20-hour continuous pour, averaging 676 cubic yards an hour. As a result, the general contractor is claiming it to be the largest ever concrete placement in the Southeast and possibly a world record for a residential mat pour.Once the monolithic concrete placement approach was chosen as the most cost-effective and logical choice for the foundation, four Florida-based companies joined forces to accomplish the major feat. They were Coastal Construction Group, the general contractor in Miami; C&C Concrete Pumping, the pumping contractor near Miami; Rinker Materials, the concrete supplier headquartered in West Palm Beach; and Mello Concrete Services, the finishing company in Miami.Together, these companies executed the concrete placement of an eleven-foot thick foundation slab measuring 138 ft. by 270 ft. and containing 3.2 million lbs. of high strength reinforcing steel.Coastal’s superintendent Mike McTee and C&C’s owner Pepi Cancio, Jr. orchestrated the tactical plan, developing a complex diagram with exact boom pump dimensions for precise equipment setup. The plan also included the skillful staging of ready mix trucks for an expedient flow, while also ensuring appropriate safety practices were employed.On the Saturday of the pour, Coastal placed a four-foot tall stuffed gorilla on a crane above the job site to greet the first wave of ready mix trucks that arrived at 2:15 am in the morning. This was a tie-in to the movie King Kong, which was showing in theaters.Welcomed by the towering beast overhead, Rinker Materials Corp. dispatched the 7,000-psi concrete using 150 trucks from their seven closest batch plants. A special mix with distinct super plasticizers was used for placing the concrete with a nine-inch slump while keeping a constant water to cement ratio. Coastal’s QC team inspected every sixth truck, rejecting only one for slump. Meanwhile, the Mello Concrete Services crew maintained a strong yet steady pace in expertly finishing the foundation in record time.For the grueling 20-hour pour, C&C Concrete Pumping provided seven concrete boom pumps, half of them reaching over 52 meters. As the largest owner of Putzmeister equipment in Southeast Florida, C&C relied upon this equipment for the pour. The equipment ranged in size from 38 meters to 58 meters and was capable of outputs up to 260 cubic yards an hour – the industry’s highest. Two additional boom pumps and a mechanic were also on site as backup but were not needed as all pumping equipment performed flawlessly.Understanding the significance of dependable equipment performance for greater customer satisfaction, C&C owner Pepi Cancio, Jr. has built a rapidly growing concrete pumping business with customer referrals as his most powerful form of advertising. Having started with only two small trailer pumps in 1993, the company has grown to include a large and impressive fleet of over 30 boom pumps, 20 separate placing booms and 40 small and large line trailer pumps.Highly knowledgeable about the equipment’s performance, Cancio says, “Although the general contractor had a goal of 800 yards of concrete an hour, we could have easily pumped 50 percent more than that with the high volume capabilities of our Putzmeister equipment.”In fact, during the first two hours, the concrete pumps did gulp down over 2,000 cubic yards of the special concrete mix. However, due to inevitable traffic problems, the final output averaged about 700 yards an hour.Overall, the most challenging aspect of the large pour was the tight confines afforded the job site. The boom pumps were expertly positioned by big pour professionals Cancio and his director of operations, Gabriel Couto. Together they have handled six major pours, each between 4,000 to 6,500 yards – and all within just the past four months.The pumps were strategically placed around the foundation’s perimeter with four of them criss-crossing their already compact outrigger spreads to take advantage of precious space. The long 188 ft. reach of C&C’s BSF 58-Meter boom even soared over top of discharging ready mix trucks in order to effectively place concrete within the jam-packed area.“The trend toward buying bigger booms is evident in Florida,” says Jim Henegar, co-owner of Thomas Machinery, the authorized Putzmeister equipment dealer in Miami, Florida. “C&C’s expansive fleet was highly equipped and more than capable of meeting the contractor’s need for longer reaching booms up to 188 ft.“Every inch of space on the job site was fully utilized to fit seven concrete boom pumps and 32 mixers at any one time,” says Cancio. “The master plan also included two locations developed to allow 30 seconds for wash-out by ready mix trucks along with a separate testing station that would not interfere with the process.”“Over 1,500 people were involved with the record-setting pour that resulted in a substantial amount of concrete placed in a tight space for a long time,” says Peter Clemente, Sales and Safety Supervisor at C&C. “To many, it revealed the amazing capabilities of pumping. To us, it was another long yet highly successful day on the job.”Slated for completion in 2007, the Trump Royale is part of the $700 million Trump Grand Ocean Resort and Residences. This eleven-acre enclave is located at the midpoint of the Miami Beach - Ft. Lauderdale corridor and includes the 278-unit Trump Palace and a 372-unit Trump International Sonesta Ocean Resort Condo-Hotel.The entire project is being developed by Donald J. Trump along with father-son team Michael Dezer and Gil Dezer of Dezer Properties in New York, NY. It was designed by Sieger Suarez Architectural Partnership, Inc. of South Miami, FL.Donald J.
