AB Volvo Offers Assistance to New York

The Honorable Rudolph W. Giuliani

Mayor

City Hall

New York, NY 10007



Dear Mr. Mayor:



On behalf of The Volvo Group, I want to express my deepest sorrow to the people of New York and The United States on this tragic event.



I happened to be in our New York office in Manhattan when the tragic events of this morning started.



We at Volvo, if possible, would like to extend a helpful hand since we have an extensive network of factories and dealerships in this region, including a wide array of Volvo and Mack heavy duty trucks and construction equipment, such as wheel loaders, dump trucks, excavators, motor graders, etc. We are offering the immediate use of these vehicles and equipment, at our expense, to the City Government for use in emergency rescue and recovery operations. We will make these vehicles available whenever and wherever needed to assist New York City.



The thousands of people of Volvo in the United States and the Volvo Group worldwide stand together with the people of New York and The United States in this difficult hour of need. We are available to you, Mr. Mayor, and to the Office of Emergency Management to provide all possible assistance.



Please contact Tomas Ericson, President of Volvo Group North America, Inc., at 212-418-7430 to make the appropriate arrangements.



Sincerely,



Leif Johansson

President of AB Volvo

& CEO of the Volvo Group

Gothenburg, Sweden
