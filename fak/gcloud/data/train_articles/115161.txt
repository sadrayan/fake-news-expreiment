Missing Minot girl not forgotten by police
LOADING

MINOT (AP) - Police Chief Jeff Balentine says authorities are still looking for clues in the May 2006 disappearance of then 3-year-old Reachelle Smith.



"I've asked BCI (Bureau of Criminal Investigation) to come in in February or March and organize a task force to re-go through all the evidence, statements, re-interview people," he said. "We're going to try to solve that case. We have to."



Reachelle was last seen May 16, 2006, when she went to bed in her Minot home. She was reported missing six days later by her aunt, Stephanie Smith, 25, the child's legal guardian.



Reachelle was believed to have been with Leigh Cowen, a man wanted on a parole violation who had been living with Smith. He claimed to be Reachelle's father even though police say DNA tests proved he was not.



Cowen's body was found May 23, 2006, in a van in the Upper Souris National Wildlife Refuge northwest of Minot. Authorities said he apparently killed himself. They found no trace of Reachelle.



Authorities have conducted numerous searches for the girl since her disappearance, and even have called in FBI behavioral scientists and psychics.



Balentine said authorities had hoped that clues would turn up during fall hunting seasons, but that did not happen. He said his department will work with Ward County on organizing another search in the spring.



"The disappearance of Reachelle Smith is still on the minds of my investigators," Balentine said. "We'll try to put out some information to keep that in the foremost mind of people. We still have to find that little girl."
