Great Lakes Restoration Initiative
Current grant opportunities

How much money has been provided under the GLRI for Great Lakes restoration?

GLRI received approximately $2.56 billion from FY 2010 to FY 2017.

How does the money fund restoration projects?

EPA and its partner agencies agree on program and project priorities to implement the GLRI Action Plan.

The money is appropriated to EPA. EPA provides funding to other federal government agencies. In turn, those agencies (and EPA, too) use that money to fund restoration projects. Since the start of GLRI, EPA has provided more than half of the funds appropriated to its partner federal agencies.

Agencies undertake projects themselves; they also fund projects performed by other entities such as:

states

tribes

local governments

universities

nongovernmental organizations

Agencies that receive GLRI funds use several kinds of funding mechanisms, including:

interagency agreements

fund transfers

competitive grants

capacity-building grants

Agencies provide notice of funding opportunities in accordance with their regular practices, such as posting competitive announcements through grants.gov.
