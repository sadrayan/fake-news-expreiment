[14:30:00]



DONALD TRUMP, GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's the oldest play in the Democratic playbook. When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument: You're racist, you're racist, you're racist. They keep saying it. You're racist.



It's a tired, disgusting argument. And it's so totally predictable. They're failing so badly. It's the last refuge of the discredited Democrat politician. They keep going back to the same well.



But you know what? The people are becoming very smart. They've heard it too many times before. The well is dry. The well is dry.



(APPLAUSE)



This is the year the American people, who believe in much better and much more honest politics say the word "enough," "enough."



(APPLAUSE)



This is the year that the people who have been betrayed by Democratic policies, including millions and millions of African American and Hispanic American citizens, reject the politicians who have failed them over and over and over again, for 50 years, for 75 years, without break, for even in some cases 100 straight years.



They failed them, and you're going to vote for a change. It's time.



(APPLAUSE)



As I've discussed for many days now, Democratic politicians have run nearly every inner-city in America for the 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 years. Their policies have produced only more poverty, total joblessness, and failing schools.



(APPLAUSE)



Every policy Hillary Clinton supports is a policy that has failed and betrayed communities of color in this country. But she doesn't care. She's too busy raking in cash from people and rigging the system and taking the African American vote and the Hispanic vote and saying, "We're going to do a great job." And right after the election, it's "bye-bye, I'll see you in four years."



(APPLAUSE)



Nothing happens. Nearly four in 10 African American children live in poverty; 58 percent of African American youth are not working; more than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago this year alone. These are the consequences of Hillary Clinton's policies and the policies of people that think like her.



She has brought nothing but pain and heartache and broken promises to your inner cities. On top of that, she wants to raise taxes on African American-owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now.



(BOOING)



I am lowering taxes very, very substantially. She is asking for a major tax increase.



(APPLAUSE)



We should be helping these businesses grow and expand, create jobs. But Hillary Clinton is virtually trying to shut them down. She opposes school choice. (inaudible) education is a disaster. She supports open borders that violate the civil rights of African Americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully.



She supports trade policies that have closed factories in African American communities and put millions of African Americans and others, all of us, out of work.



So many people out of work. She supports radical regulations that puts Americans out of a job, and that raise the price of their



So many people out of work. She supports radical regulations that puts Americans out of a job, and that raise the price of their energy bills -- you all see it -- beyond anything that you thought would ever, ever happen.



She supports policies on crime that make communities less safe, and that make it harder to raise your children in security and in peace. You see it all the time. The inner cities, parents walking with their beautiful child, and they get shot. They're shot, their child is shot, often killed. Folks, what do you have to lose? What do you have to lose?



Donald Trump will fix it. We're going to make it better. We're going to help education. We're going to straighten out crime. We're going to create jobs. We're going to bring our companies back. What the hell do you have to lose? It can't get any worse than what it is right now.



(APPLAUSE)



AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!



TRUMP: You know, I said this a few weeks ago and I mean it so deeply in my heart, we will fix it. We will get it fixed. They're never going to do it for you. It's words, it's politicians. You know what I always say about politicians? All talk, no action. They're controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests and their donors.



Me, I put up my money. I'm into this thing for a lot of money, I want to tell you. Nobody's going to be calling me and asking for favors. We want to move a company to Mexico, please make sure it happens. Let me tell you, I'm going to make sure just the opposite. I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen.



I believe every single parent in this country, and especially in the inner cities, has to right to raise their children in safety. Walk down the street in safety. Not be shot at. This is one of the great civil rights issues of our time. And people don't talk about it that way. This is a civil rights issue.



The Democrats have run your inner cities. They're making a fortune for themselves, and they're destroying, they're destroying. Remember this. The people that live there, they are destroying those people. This is actually a civil rights issue. And it's a disgrace, and they should be ashamed of themselves.



But Hillary Clinton doesn't want to talk about any of this. She can't defend her record. She's got a horrible record. And, as Bernie Sanders said, she's got very, very bad judgment. She really does. All you have to do is look at what she's done.



She doesn't have one single proposal that hasn't been tried and failed. She doesn't have one idea that does anything but destroy jobs for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans in our country. It's going to be a disaster. Her trade deals were a disaster. This will be catastrophic for our country.



So what does she do when she can't defend her record? That's right. She lies. She lies. And she smears. And she paints decent Americans, you, as racists.



She bullies voters who only want a better future and tries to intimidate them out of voting for a change. I'm for change. She doesn't want change. As I discussed yesterday these are the same tactics, the establishment power is used to try to scare the British people out of voting for change also. It didn't work there, and it's not going to work here.



Call me Mr. Brexit. The American people are ready to vote for freedom, opportunity and justice. They are ready to take back control of their own futures. You have to take it back. We will take it back. The movement will take it back together. It's time the Clintons were held accountable for their inappropriate conduct ...



(APPLAUSE)



Thank you. You can see the feeling in this country. You can see by this, by these outbursts, you can see the anger, the anger at what she got away with but maybe she won't get away with it. But you can see the anger when law enforcement allows her a free pass on something that was so bad.



You can see the anger in this room. You can see the anger all over the country. Great, great institutions - the FBI, the Department of Justice - they've taken a hit in our country and throughout the world like nobody ever thought would be possible. Nobody.



According to the book "Game Change," Bill Clinton shockingly said about President Barack Obama that a few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee. That's what he said. And we've all seen the cringeworthy comments from Hillary Clinton which I won't get into here but we know what they are. You've heard them.



Here's the central point that I want to get across today. Hillary Clinton isn't just attacking me. She's attacking all of the decent people of all backgrounds - doesn't matter - of all backgrounds - who support this incredible once-in-a-lifetime movement. Never seen anything like it.



(APPLAUSE)



We can't let that stand. We can't. Voters used to the old game where failed politicians like Hillary who did lose to Barack Obama rather decisively - an election she was supposed to win easily - please don't forget that - where she falsely smears Republicans with the charges of racism and other things.



Republicans then always have a tendency to back down and be defensive and look bad. Not Donald Trump.



(APPLAUSE)



Democrats then continued to push policies that are devastating to communities of color and devastating to lots of other communities.



We must break this corrupt cycle. We're going to. And we are going to break it beginning today in New Hampshire.



(APPLAUSE)



So let me make some very clear statements before this whole country, including all of those many cameras back there.



First, on the border. The people of this country who want their laws enforced and respected -- respected by all, and who want their borders secured, are not racists. If you want to have strong borders so that people come into our country, but they come in legally through a legal process, that doesn't make you a racist. It makes you smart. It makes you an American.



(APPLAUSE)



They're all patriotic Americans.



(APPLAUSE)



We will build the wall 100 percent and Mexico will be paying for the wall. We will build it 100 percent.



(APPLAUSE)



I see all this stuff given out over the last three or four days by the media that Trump doesn't want to build the wall. Folks, we are building the wall. OK?



(APPLAUSE)



And remember this also, I have great respect for Mexico's leaders because frankly they're smarter, tougher and more cunning than ours. But remember this also, Mexico is making an absolute fortune dealing with the United States. Not only on the border, but with trade: a $60 billion trade deficit we have with Mexico.



Remember what I say, Mexico will pay for the wall. Remember.



(APPLAUSE)



These are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs protected, and their country kept safe. It's very simple. They want to have their country kept safe. I will never apologize for pledging to enforce and uphold every single law of the United States. We will uphold those laws for our people.



(APPLAUSE)



I will never apologize for making it my -- and this is, I will tell you -- for making it my priority, but is it your priority also? I think so.



(APPLAUSE)



So I will never apologize for making it my priority on immigration to protect American citizens above every other single consideration. We have to protect our people. We've lost sight of that.



(APPLAUSE)



We will end illegal immigration and we will restore the constitutional rule of law. It will be restored.



(APPLAUSE)



Next, on national security, people who speak out against radical Islam and who warn about refugees are not Islamophobes. They're not. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our value as a tolerant society and who want to keep the terrorists' hell out of our country.



(APPLAUSE)



If the choice is between saving lives or appeasing politically correct censors in Washington, D.C., that is the easiest choice you and I will ever have to make.



(APPLAUSE)



We will always choose saving American lives.



(APPLAUSE)



We have thousands and thousands of people being brought into our country from the Middle East, from Syria. We don't know where they are or where they're coming from. They don't have paperwork. There's no reliable source that can vet these people. It could be the all- time great Trojan horse. Thousands -- and Hillary Clinton wants to increase that number by 550 percent a year.



(BOOING)



Not going to happen, folks; not going to happen. Not on my watch, that I can tell you.



(APPLAUSE)



Now on crime. People who support the police and who want crime reduced and stopped are not prejudiced. They're concerned and loving citizens and parents whose heart breaks every time an innocent child is lost to totally preventable violence.



(APPLAUSE)



There is no compassion in tolerating crime, and poisonous drug dealing, and the killings all over our streets in so many different cities. I will work to dismantle the criminal gangs and cartels and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and violence and poverty and fear.



(APPLAUSE)



To Hillary Clinton and her donors and advisers, pushing her to spread smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words. I want you to remember these three words: Shame on you.



(APPLAUSE)



When you're like the Clintons getting -- think of this one -- getting $69 million in political contributions from Wall Street and big banks -- and I think I got $16,000. You saw that?



(LAUGHTER)



And I don't know who the poor guy is that gave me the money, because he's not going to get anything for it.



It's easy to look down on the so-called little people, which is the way she views the people of our country. It's easy to ignore the devastation caused by our open borders when you spend all of your time with wealthy donors and Hollywood celebrities who...



(AUDIENCE BOOING) It's easy to ignore the heartfelt concerns of communities about radical Islam entering our country when you spend your time hanging out with foreign dictators in their lavish palaces and homes. And it's easy, no doubt, for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to the ravages of crime when she has her own personal armed security force.



Now she wants to essentially dismantle our Second Amendment. I think the first thing she should do is call up Washington and immediately request that her great Secret Service agents drop all weapons. Let them walk around with no weapons. And let's see how she feels about that when she wants to take away your guns. But this is how the system is rigged.



For decades the American people have demanded that their immigration laws be enforced, and that their jobs be protected from out of control immigration.



[14:53:17] But the special interests, who only want cheap labor, have stopped it from happening. They've totally stopped it. They're putting up tremendous amounts of money. For years, the American people have worried about letting radical Islam spread. But elites, who only want to raise more money for global corporations --



BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: So Donald Trump wrapping up right here. We've taken pretty much the whole thing. Listen, he is basically sticking to script. We have the prepared remarks here. And really hammering home on similar themes we've been hearing, that Hillary Clinton is corrupt, again talking about the controversy swirling around her and her private e-mail server and the Clinton Foundation, calling it Watergate, she's being protected by our government. Talking again about immigration, and the crowd chanting, "Build a wall," and he stopped and said, "I'll build a wall." Though a couple of nights ago he acknowledged his softening stance on Immigration. He's speaking next week in Phoenix on that. And he also, interestingly, a bit of a prebuttal to Hillary Clinton's Alt-Right, or Alternative Right, speech coming up in minute.



What struck me is the fact that he said she's hearing all of you. So he's not just saying it's about me, it's about all of you.



I've got David Catanese, senior politics writer for "U.S. News & World Report."



David, you've been listening this whole time. What do you think?



DAVID CATANESE, SENIOR POLITICS WRITER, U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT: I think Trump hit his marks on this speech. Noticeably he deleted the bigot reference which I do think was a big problem and I think he went too far characterizing Hillary Clinton as a bigot. I didn't hear it the 45 minutes that we were just listening to. But most of the rest of the speech was similar to what he said last night. But I think he was very smart to keep the story on the Clinton Foundation. He spoke at tremendous length about that, hammering Clinton on that for integrity, ethics, calling into question her dealings with donors at the Clinton Foundation. And he did a prebuttal, but didn't completely take the bait. He says this is an attack on you, my supporters, which I think was a smart way to go about it for Donald Trump.



[14:55:31] BALDWIN: Peter Emerson was just seated. He's a "Huffington Post" contributor, involved with every Democratic presidential campaign since 1972, a Hillary Clinton supporter here.



I'm curious, on his note ahead of Hillary Clinton's speech on Alt- Right that, she's smearing all of you, that could be a smart strategy for Mr. Trump?



PETER EMERSON, HUFFINGTON POST CONTRIBUTOR & HILLARY CLINTON CONTRIBUTOR: It could be, but only temporarily. I'd like to argue that the Alt-Right label is a terrible mislabel. It is a sanitization of racism, of white supremacy, of anti-Semitic thoughts and writings. Most of all, it is anti-American values.



BALDWIN: Which is what she'll be pointing out in a matter of minutes.



EMERSON: Exactly.



BALDWIN: What will separate her? Speech? I've had Trump campaign folks saying, listen, you've had a horrible week with everything that's happened with the e-mails coming out and also with this A.P. story from earlier in the week. She's just trying to turn the page.



EMERSON: Well, at this stage in the campaign both are going to try to dismiss one another. It is dueling speeches and dueling appearances. At the end of the day, Trump has a very solid base. Probably he's going to get 50 million, 55 million votes. Romney got around 61 million votes. So the game isn't so much about a broad mass peal, it is more about specific states and winning the election in November.



BALDWIN: OK.



Andre is the Trump supporter.



I noted -- because we had the conversation before he spoke about how he called her a bigot last night. He did not do that today. But he said she's calling us racists, it is so predictable. My question would be, if he has called her a bigot, to use his word, why isn't that predictable?



ANDRE BAUER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I'm not sure what you're asking me on that.



BALDWIN: If he's saying that Hillary, pre-butting her speech, is calling Donald Trump a racist, and that he's dismissing it as predictable, if he's calling Hillary Clinton essentially the same word, bigot, why isn't that predictable, too?



BAUER: You know, to me, this is tit for tat, and it really doesn't move the ball forward, I think, for either one. The fact that now he has engaged minority communities and it is not one-party rule anymore, the real benefactor is folks that can now go out and say, what is each candidate going to really do for me, and they need to start delineating out what they'll do to make their community better. Today he talked and said I want to liberate our poor citizens. I like that message.



BALDWIN: You agree with David that it was a strong speech, he hit his mark?



BAUER: It was a good speech. It wasn't his best one. He's had some in the last few days that were better than this. He stuck to message, which I like. I like that he steered clear of calling her names. And he focused on what I think is a highly vulnerable area, in the e-mails and in the Pay-to-Play. But I like a better message of how I'm going to take you from where you are now to where you can go. I want to see an uplifting speech where, America, I want you to be excited about come out to vote for me, not how bad the other candidate is. I want you to say, this guy can change my life. And so the more he can direct his speech towards that, I think he broadens the tent.



BALDWIN: OK.



Let me ask everyone to stand by.



And a reminder, Anderson Cooper is sitting down with Donald Trump. Make sure you tune into this interview, tonight, "A.C. 360," 8:00 p.m., here on CNN. Do not miss that.



Everyone, stand by.



We've just heard from Donald Trump. In a matter of minutes, we're going to take you live to Reno, Nevada, where Hillary Clinton is there. She will be giving this speech where she will essentially argue that Donald Trump is embracing this Alt-Right racist philosophy. That's coming up.
