Bachelor tax: KZN men made to pay annual fee for staying single
It was the great poet Beyonce who once said: “if you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it”. However, the implementation of bachelor tax in Nquthu may just encourage single men to propose so they can avoid a new type of annual debt.

What is bachelor tax?

The extraordinary law is apparently already in force up in the northern KZN settlement, where unmarried men are asked to pay an additional surcharge for living the single life. As eNCA report, locals are up in arms about the dubious legislation.

Provincial Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs officials met with the local iNkosi -Thathezakhe Ngobese – and his council on Tuesday to discuss the matter. They want to establish what legal grounds regional authorities have to enforce this rule.

What bachelor tax costs

Some parents told the broadcaster that they are having to pay for their sons’ bachelor tax, as none of them can afford to cover the costs – one mother even stated she had to fork out for all three of her boys every year. It’s estimated that the tax costs R50 per person.

Where it comes from

The tax has its origins from Ancient Rome, where subjects who weren’t married – or those who practised celibacy – were asked to make a donation to their leaders. It first surfaced in South Africa during the 20th century, as Mzansi attempted to match the white population growth with that of black citizens.

The 1919 proposals did not take off, however. Despite the law being initiated, it was soon abandoned, allowing single fellas to go about their lives peacefully once more. Needless to say, when South Africans heard about this charge, they were less than impressed…
