German state TV series features woman teaching boy how to pray to Allah
This clip is from 2006, but it is still illustrative of a tendency. When was the last time a German state TV series featured instructions on Christian prayer? My bet is never. Multiculturalism = Islamic supremacism. German state TV is working to prepare the German people for their future.

“Is this what it looks like? Brutal German state propaganda to encourage children to be muslims?,” by Eeyore, Vlad Tepes, January 13, 2018 (thanks to The Religion of Peace):

While we are waiting on an answer for that one, the one below is most definitely state TV propaganda to make muslim illegals be the victims somehow, after they murder German people.

UPDATE: From Oz-Rita:

And no, it was not satire!

German State TV Series: “Lindenstraße” Episode 1084 “Islam”

Murat (Erkan Gündüz is surprised how much Lisa (Santje Peplow) is defending Islam

That little schmaltzy video was a scene from a German State TV series, broadcast in 2006, one year after Angela Merkel became chancellor, and when she was still pretending to be for Germany and a “Conservative”. Then she met Sorros [sic], Erdogan, Obama etc….and the rest, as they say, is history. The number of Muslims in Germany then was around 3.3 million. While exact statistics today seem unreliable, a conservative estimate of over 4.7 million Muslims as of 2015 is said to be conservative.

The series was called “Lindenstrasse” and the young woman who “converted” – or “reverted” as Muslims call it – played the role of a young mother, Lisa, engaged to a Turkish Muslim, Murat, who was working very hard to earn the money for the wedding. I watched that episode and a few that followed, until I came close to a saccharine overdose. You got a taste of it in the video above.

[ “Lindenstraße” I believe is the show]…
