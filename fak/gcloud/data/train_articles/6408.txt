Miami Dolphins: Stadium Taxes Are Too High!
While the Miami Dolphins are on a helmet-in-hand charm offensive to convince taxpayers to fund some of the $400 million-renovation of Sun Life Stadium, owner Stephen Ross is maneuvering to lower the NFL team’s property taxes!

According to records Jeffrey Mandler, one of Ross’ favorite real estate lawyers, has notified the county’s Value Adjustment Board that the team will be appealing the $3 million it was charged in property taxes last year.

In an unusual arrangement, the Fins pay property taxes even if the county owns the stadium land.

No records indicating how much the Dolphins think they should pay, or what Mandler bases his request on will be available until a late May hearing takes place before an independent appraiser.

At the meeting, Mandler will be able to argue why he thinks that the Miami-Dade County Property Appraiser’s assessed value of the facility, $128,058,879, is unfair.

It’s the second year in a row that Mandler notified the board of an appeal, according to records. Last summer, however, he withdrew the Fins’ appeal for the 2011 taxes.

Mandler did not respond to a call and an email for comment.

VAB Manager Robert Alfaro told Gossip Extra that about 40 percent of the property owners who appear before the board have their taxes lowered.

Said Ron Book, one of the Dolphins’ lobbyists: “We’re the only sports team in the country that pays property taxes and gets nothing in return. We pay for our own police, fire, EMT and waste haul. Plus, we pay a water surcharge.”

He declined comment on the team’s appeal.
