Washington, DC – Committee for Our Children’s Future (CCF), a 501(c)(4) organization, today launched a $1.5 million-dollar television campaign to promote New Jersey’s reform movement. The new ad is airing on New York and Philadelphia broadcast and New Jersey statewide cable stations.

CCF is an independent organization advocating policies that will restore long-term fiscal health and solidify the economic foundation for future generations.

“Washington is moving in the wrong direction. From runaway spending and record debt to gridlock, our federal government is not working. Meanwhile, in New Jersey things are moving in the right direction two balanced budgets, a billion dollars in wasteful spending cut and millions of dollars in new education funding,” said Brian Jones, spokesperson, Committee for Our Children’s Future.

“New Jersey should serve as a national model for government leaders across the country. It’s time for a better economic future for taxpayers, working families, and our children. We must protect our children’s future and keep the New Jersey reform movement going.”

CCF believes elected officials must:

Prioritize and reduce government spending

Keep taxes low

Secure our economic future with pro-growth policies.
