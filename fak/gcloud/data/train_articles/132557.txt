Mayor Mark Chambers â€“ Carbon Hill, Alabama
Mayor Mark Chambers

205-544-1799 I decided to get involved in our city because it was not going in a positive direction. As Mayor, I believe in hard work, dedication, and making fair decisions for the city. I know that as a whole we can make Carbon Hill a better and safer place to work and live. My parents, Diane and John Chambers raised me along with my two brothers Jason and Jeremy in Carbon Hill. This community has always been a part of me as well as a part of my family. My wife, Ronda, and I chose to raise our three girls Brittany, Karlie, and Hanna here because of that reason. I am very proud to be the Mayor of this city and you have my word that I will try my best to make this community prosper.
