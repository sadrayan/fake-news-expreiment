Border Security by the Numbers
The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S.744, or the Gang of Eight bill) establishes a 90 percent “effectiveness rate” as a goal for each of the nine separate sectors along the southern border. Originally, the bill only required this to be achieved in high-risk sectors, or one “in which more than 30,000 individuals were apprehended during the most recent fiscal year.” At Senate Judiciary Committee Markup, the first amendment Senator Grassley filed struck all references to high risk sectors. This amendment passed by voice vote, meaning these changes will be incorporated into the legislation as it moves to the Senate floor.
