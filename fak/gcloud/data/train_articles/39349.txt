U.S.-Mexico Cross-Border Trucking Pilot Program
Overview

Between October 14, 2011, and October 10, 2014, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) conducted the United States-Mexico Cross-Border Long-Haul Trucking Pilot Program to evaluate the ability of Mexico-domiciled motor carriers to operate safely in the United States beyond the municipalities and commercial zones along the United States-Mexico border.

The Pilot Program was part of FMCSAâ€™s implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) cross-border long-haul trucking provisions. The Pilot Program allowed approved Mexico-domiciled motor carriers to operate throughout the United States for up to 3 years. United States-domiciled motor carriers were granted reciprocal rights to operate in Mexico for the same period.

The Mexico-domiciled motor carriers that participated in the Pilot Program were required to complete a Pre-Authorization Safety Audit (PASA) before being granted operating authority. In addition, they were required to successfully complete a compliance review, if they participated in the Pilot Program for 18 months.
