US slapped sanctions on Russia not due to Syria or Ukraine, but to deter Moscow — Lavrov
SOCHI, August 21. /TASS/. Washington has introduced sanctions against Moscow only because of the wish to promote the policy of deterring Russia, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday.

"Everyone understands that the sanctions against Russia were launched not because of Syria and not because of Ukraine or Crimea, or whatever, but only because of the wish to use the methods of unfair competition and promote the absolutely dead-end policy of deterring the Russian Federation," Lavrov noted.

"Problems with the Syrian settlement and the Ukrainian settlement are rooted not in Russia’s position, but in the unwillingness of certain circles - both in Syria and around it - to implement [UN Security Council] Resolution 2254, and regarding Ukraine - the inability of Ukraine’s authorities to implement their obligations under the Minsk accords."

US President Donald Trump earlier told Reuters that he will be ready to discuss the possibility of lifting American sanctions against Russia if Moscow starts taking joint measures with Washington, including on the settlement in Syria and Ukraine.
