Motion to Invoke Cloture: House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 195 -- GovTrack.us
This was the second procedural vote to pass H.R. 195, the vehicle for passage for short-term continuing appropriations through Feb. 16, 2018, in the Senate. This was a vote on cloture, to end debate, which required 60 votes. The vote failed hours before federal government funding expired at the end of Jan. 19, sending the federal government into a shutdown on Jan 20.

A "yea" vote was to proceed to a final vote on short-term government funding. The details of what the final Senate bill would have included were not known at the time of the vote but reportedly would have included an extension of the children's health insurance program CHIP, reinstatement of deferred action for childhood illegal immigrants DACA, as well as border security provisions such as a southern wall. A "nay" vote was to delay a final vote to continue negotiations.

(H.R. 195 has had its text replaced in whole twice before. The bill was previously Kevin and Avonte's Law of 2017 and before that a bill to save $1 million annually by ending the printed publication of the Federal Register. See the bill for details.)
