Gardner, below is a table of data from our Wildlife Division showing Aerial Wildlife Management Permits issued by our agency. 2016 data are not shown below—for the current year, so far we’ve had 16 new permits issued and 89 permits renewed, and there are a few dozen more that we expect to renew by year’s end, making up the current total of 140 AWM permits that are active/valid as of today.

Subject: RE: Inquiry for a fact check

Thanks. Can you provide a list of the permit recipients? Is this count an indication there are about 140 businesses that enable helicopter hunts of feral hogs?

This indicates there are 140 people or entities that have permits, does not necessarily mean 140 businesses, but you might surmise that these permit holders represent people running aerial wildlife mgt businesses.

Also, what’s the distinction between permits issued after the 2011 law took effect and before?

4:17 p.m.

ARM permits issued before and after 2011 cover basically the same type of activity, no difference in type of permit or activity regulated. Main difference created by the “pork chopper” bill was it allowed “agents” other than permit holders to be able to participate, meaning people who could pay to take part in aerial hunting/mgt.

Gardner, below is the commercial vs non-commercial breakout for 2009-2015. Be aware this not a complete listing of all AWM permits, only those for which we show commercial vs noncommercial status in our system.

Also, attached is a file showing basic info for all current AWM permit holders. NOTE that in the column headed Commercial, there are three types—yes (operations/applicants identified in our system as commercial), no (operations not identified as commercial), and Null (operations for which we have no status either commercial or noncommercial).

Gardner, here are answers for your follow up questions.

What does this total reveal about the number of businesses devoted to feral hog hunts from helicopters?

We/TPWD are not able to determine with certainty whether holders of aerial wildlife permits (AWMs) we issue are running businesses for profit. We can say that AWM holders with a commercial status have the ability to charge money/receive payments from people who wish to take part in aerial wildlife mgt. A logical inference could thus be made that most if not all of these are businesses. But you, not us, would be making that inference—note below there are other reasons people hold these permits. You are correct that 135 new AWM permits have been issued since 2011. There are 140 currently active permits—five of these are renewals, people who have renewed permits. Of the 140 currently active permits, 133 have either a commercial or non-commercial status indicated—for the remainder we have no status on file. Of those 133, 29 are non-commercial and 104 are commercial.

What other reason or reasons would an individual or business have for seeking the permit?

The AWM permit is issued to count, photograph, relocate/capture or take/kill native wildlife and exotic animals by aircraft. Some permit holders are private landowners such as ranchers who have an AWM permit, so they can perform wildlife surveys or remove hogs on their own property. The AWM permit is often used for wildlife surveying (particularly white-tailed deer and feral hog counts), and even alligator nest counts. Some permit holders also do a fair amount of exotic game capture (such as possibly axis deer or blackbuck antelope). In the fall, the AWM permit is used quite a bit for other TPWD deer management activities including our TTT (Trap, Transport, and Transplant) and DMP (Deer Management Permit) permits. We also have an AWM permit for commercial drone use.

Has the agency analyzed the number of businesses devoted to feral hog hunts?

Feral hogs reported killed on the AWM quarterly reports are shown below. I realize you are fact-checking a specific statement, but I would note this shows that the number of feral hogs taken by air has increased in recent years, and from our agency’s perspective, this is a good thing, as it helps control a rampant nuisance species.

We/TPWD track feral hog harvest data from aerial wildlife mgt permit holders, what you were asking about earlier. Below is that data for the past five years, showing total feral hogs killed per year by all AWP permit holders TPWD tracks. As you can see, this is only a fairly small percentage of the estimated 750,000-plus feral hogs harvested statewide.
