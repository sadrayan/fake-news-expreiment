Valerie Jarrett Confronted Over Unequal Pay for Women in White House
Possible presidential candidate Carly Fiorina confronted President Obama's top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, over the White House paying female employees less than their male counterparts:

"Good morning, Valerie," Fiorina said, speaking to Jarrett on MSNBC's Morning Joe. "I think, certainly, every woman on this panel and every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required. I also think it's just a fact that laws exist on the books today, and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender, she should use the full extent of that law. I am struck by the fact the president hasn't really led in this regard. He's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House. And I am also struck by the fact that the single greatest impediment to equal pay for equal work is this seniority system, which pays not on merit, not on performance, but on time and grade. And who is it who supports the seniority system? Unions, government bureaucracies, the vast majority of constituencies that the Democratic party represents and who support the Democratic party. So why wouldn't the White House take on the seniority system and say let's pay women by merit and by their results? Because based on my own experience, in those scenarios, women will be paid equally."

Jarrett responded with a whopper: "Let's unpack your question a little bit. So, first of all the first question and last question, let's weave them together: in the White House women do earn equal pay for equal work."
