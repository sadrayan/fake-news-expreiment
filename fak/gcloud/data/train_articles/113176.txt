Sally listens:

I saw a Sally's On Your Side that gave a few tips on how to tell if your mate is cheating. Can you list them for me?



Sally Sez:

*Change in behavior &/or habits:

The biggest clue is a change in normal behavior and or habits. This includes starting to exercise, showering when he or she gets home, wearing a new scent, buying new clothes, especially underwear, suddenly having to *“work late” a lot.

*Wants less or more sex:

Wanting less sex seems logical, but sometimes the cheater will want more.

*Emotional withdrawal:

Withdrawing emotionally. Being more critical, cold, or insensitive.

*Unexplained absences and phone calls:

Unexplained time away from home and furtive or anonymous phone calls. Also, a new pager or cell phone.

*Things in the car don’t add up:

Check his or her car. Is the passenger seat in a different position? Are there strange cigarette butts in the ashtray? Is the mileage more than it should be?

Sally listens:

Rumor has it that the president of Procter and Gamble appeared on your show and said that he was associated with the Church of Satan. I would appreciate more information if you have any, perhaps a tape of the show if available. If this is a hoax, please let me know.



Sally Sez:

The rumor going around that the president of Procter and Gamble appeared on The Sally Show and announced he was a member of the church of Satan is not true. This a hoax that's been going around in one form or another for the past 20 years...only originally, it concerned the Phil Donahue Show...then evolved to the Jenny Jones Show...and now it's evolved to The Sally Show. The president of Procter and Gamble has NEVER appeared on The Sally Show...NEVER. Nor has any other person in authority at P&G.; Any president of a multi-national corporation (including the head of P&G; or Liz Claiborne) would be immediately fired by the board of directors if he or she did such a thing. Also, profits from any such corporation go to the stockholders...not a church designated by the president. Do not send money in to get a transcript. We do not provide transcripts or video tapes of our shows to the public. Frankly, this thing has gotten out of hand. If we had this man on our show, and he had said what it's alleged he said, we would have scored a broadcasting scoop and would have trumpeted it to all the newspapers. It would have been to the show's advantage. But there was no scoop, and there were no headlines.

Sally listens:

On your show Is Your Child Safe, you listed a bunch of websites where we could get more information, but the list wasn't up long enough for me to write them down. Can you give me the complete list?

Sally listens:

How can I contact Richard Simmons and how can I find out about making reservations for his Cruise-to-lose program?



Sally Sez:

I don't have Richard Simmons e-mail address, but you can go to his web site (www.richardsimmons.com) and probably find it there. Cruise-to-lose reservations: (800)637-8124

Sally listens:

I been writing you for the longest time and you haven't wrote me back and I don't understand why. Please tell me.



Sally Sez:

Stephanie, you keep writing me and you keep forgetting to include your e-mail address. So there's no way I can answer you.

Sally listens:

Do you really sit down and answer these questions or is someone else answering them for you?



Sally Sez:

I do answer the questions. My webmaster downloads them and passes them on to me. I tell him how I want to answer them and he puts them on our website.

Sally listens:

I have written and e-mailed you several times and never received an answer. Can you tell me why not?



Sally Sez:

I get close to a thousand e-mails and entries from my advice page every day. It's impossible to respond to all. That's why it says on my advice page that I will answer only three advice questions each weekday and that's why is says under my e-mail address on various pages of my web site that I can't answer all e-mails. I wish I did have the time to write to each and every one of you, but if I did that there would be no show. Also, a lot of the entries either have a wrong or an incomplete e-mail return address.

Sally listens:

Can I get a tape or transcript of a particular show?



Sally Sez:

I'm afraid not. Currently we do not have the facilities to make transcripts or enough copies of shows to satisfy the demand.

Sally listens:

Are guests paid to come on your show?



Sally Sez:

No, but all of their expenses for their trip to New York, including airfare and hotel room, are paid.
