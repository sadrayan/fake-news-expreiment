So I kinda called this? : conspiracy
I can’t really remember what I was reading or how I got on the subject in the first place. My girlfriend and I got drunk and started talking conspiracies. The night ended with me writing on my white board “las Vegas” secondary to what someone had posted here before. A buddy of mine had mentioned the McGregor mayweather fight was coming up and we both that something might happen during that time period. Long story short I ended up erasing “las Vegas maybe ehh 3 weeks ago” think well never mind I’m nuts. And bam.

Any ideas on this? I can’t remember for the life of me what had me thinking that. Was it a crisis actor post or something?
