Cory Booker unveils 'sweeping' but 'simple' gun violence prevention plan
(CNN) Sen. Cory Booker will unveil a suite of proposals Monday to reform the nation's gun laws in what his campaign describes as "the most sweeping plan ever put forth by a presidential candidate" to address gun violence.

"My plan to address gun violence is simple," the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement. "We will make it harder for people who should not have a gun to get one."

Gun violence is poised to be a prominent issue in the Democratic presidential primary, with the party's voters overwhelmingly in favor of expanding background checks and banning high-capacity magazines and assault weapons. Booker's plan would push those reforms.

The proposal would make gun licenses the federal standard, similar to a driver's license or a passport -- requiring fingerprints, an interview, and completion of a gun safety course.

His plan also calls for banning assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks; expanding background checks to include purchases from unlicensed sellers, and closing the "Charleston loophole" that enabled Emanuel AME Church shooter Dylann Roof to purchase a gun when the FBI did not complete his background check during the mandatory three-day waiting period.
