NBA Trade Rumors: 3 Best Destinations for Anthony Davis
Despite Davis’ incredible performance, the New Orleans Pelicans have 0-5 and they are the worst team in the league right now.

They will be probably better than Philadelphia 76ers at the end of a season, but is that enough for Anthony Davis?

“Definitely frustrating,” Davis said after Tuesday’s 117-113 defeat. “We can’t get a win. It’s frustrating.”

Most people blame GM Dell Demps because he didn’t surround Anthony Davis with quality players who could help him to compete against the best team in the Western Conference.

The Unibrow is in the league 5 years and he played only once in the NBA playoffs. I even count this year because he will not play in the playoffs again.

When I look at their roster, they don’t even have a good bench. Just check the starting lineup with Tim Fraizer, E’Twaun Moore, Solomon Hill and Dante Cunningham. They are good for the D-League, but not for the Western Conference. Common, Demps, what did you achieve so far for the Pelicans? Almost nothing.

Even if you add two Anthony Davis in their starting lineup, that wouldn’t be enough to play against Golden State Warriors or San Antonio Spurs.
