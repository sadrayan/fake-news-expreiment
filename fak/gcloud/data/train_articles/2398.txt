Crist: Thrasher hearing things on tenure bill
Sen. John Thrasher, sponsor of the so-called teacher-tenure bill, was clear last week about where Gov. Charlie Crist stood on SB6: “He told me he’s going to sign it. I take him at his word.”

There’s one thing odd about Thrasher’s statement: Crist seldom says anything so clearly. One notable exception was this morning, when we asked if Crist promised Thrasher he’d sign the bill.

“No,” Crist said.

Q: Thrasher said you promised him.

Crist: “I just said no.”

Q: Is Thrasher lying?

Crist: “I said no. Sometimes people hear what they want to hear.”

UPDATE: "I have no response," Thrasher said when asked to respond to Crist's comments. "He said he liked the bill and he couldn't wait to get it."
