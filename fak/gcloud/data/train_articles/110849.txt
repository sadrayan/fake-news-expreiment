have you seen this FB "secret sister" gift exchange crap?
Post by wannabe on

i've seen this pop up on my feed from, like, a dozen people:



I am participating in a Secret Sister gift exchange. I need at least 6 ladies or more who would like to participate . You only have to send a gift worth $10 to one person, and you will receive 36 in return. ???? It's in the spirit of giving and supposed to be fun! If you're interested let me know. Location doesn't matter. I'm excited! Who doesn't love gifts or mail??



WTF? maybe i'm being all scrooge-like, but is this some lame ass chain letter-esque shit or what?
