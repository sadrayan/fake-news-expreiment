Student Enrollment Reports
When entering a district number, use all six digits. For example, enter 057905 for DALLAS ISD. Capitalize district names and include ISD as appropriate.

When entering campus numbers, use all nine digits. For example, enter 227913101 for LAKE TRAVIS EL.



When entering campus names, you may enter all of the name or only part of the name to get a selection list. Capitalize the campus names or name fragment that you enter. Avoid using descriptors such as "HS" or "EL" that may be entered in a variety of ways. A high school may be on the database with "H S", "HS" or "HIGH SCHOOL"; an elementary school may be on the list with "E L", "EL" or "ELEMENTARY". For example, we recommend entering "AUSTIN" rather than "AUSTIN HS".
