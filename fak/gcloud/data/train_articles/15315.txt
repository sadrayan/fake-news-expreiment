Email, William R. King, Ph.D., professor of criminal justice, College of Criminal Justice, Sam Houston State University, May 2, 2017

6:54 p.m.

Dr. Watkins at LEMIT forwarded your email onto me. I just read the summary of Wong's study at the web address below:

https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2017/01/26/297366/the-effects-of-sanctuary-policies-on-crime-and-the-economy/

The methodology is very rigorous. He uses ICE's definition of sanctuary counties (instead of applying some other criteria to define which counties are sanctuary counties). The crime data (FBI UCR) are the most recent, and the best for comparing counties across the U.S. The Census data (ACS 2015) are solid, and the variables he uses are solid indicators of community well being. The analysis looks solid. And he reports his n's, coefficients, and statistical probability for all the variables.

â€¦

Sincerely,

Bill
