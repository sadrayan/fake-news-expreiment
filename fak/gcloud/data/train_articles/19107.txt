Rep. Joe Heck Statement on Latest Continuing Resolution Votes
WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Joe Heck (NV-03) today issued the following statement after the House passed a continuing resolution (CR) that funds the government until December 15, delays not yet implemented parts of the health care law for one year, and repeals the medical device tax.



"The House has once again voted to fund the government while delaying and dismantling the flawed health care law. This continuing resolution controls spending, delays not yet implemented portions of the law while maintaining important consumer protections, and repeals the medical device tax that will stifle innovation, increase the cost of healthcare, and cost our economy jobs it can ill-afford to lose. The House continues to listen to the American people who do not want to see ObamaCare fully implemented because of the burdens it will place on them, their families, and their businesses. Once again, it is up to the Senate to act to keep the government open."
