Statehouse ceremony remembers fallen soldiers from Ohio
Josh White recalled the last phone conversation he had with his sister, Army Lt. Ashley White Stumpf, before the Canton-area woman was killed in Afghanistan in fall 2011. "I've come to the realization that she was simply a scared, young woman in a dangerous place that she could not possibly understand," said White, speaking as part of Gov. John Kasich's annual memorial wreath-laying ceremony yesterday at the Statehouse.

Josh White recalled the last phone conversation he had with his sister, Army Lt. Ashley White Stumpf, before the Canton-area woman was killed in Afghanistan in fall 2011.

�I�ve come to the realization that she was simply a scared, young woman in a dangerous place that she could not possibly understand,� said White, speaking as part of Gov. John Kasich�s annual memorial wreath-laying ceremony yesterday at the Statehouse.

�I think that�s the case with many of our nation�s young fallen heroes,� said White, now a detective with the Maryland State Police. �And what a perfect illustration of courage.�

The governor�s annual wreath-laying event honored 10 Ohio soldiers who had died in combat since last Memorial Day and two who died in 2011. Immediately before the wreath ceremony, a joint session of the General Assembly distributed the Ohio Military Medal of Distinction to 16 families of fallen Ohio soldiers. The medal recipients� list was slightly longer this year because the medals were delayed from November to align with the wreath ceremony, which always coincides with Memorial Day.

The four soldiers honored with medals this year who were remembered in last year�s governor�s wreath ceremony were all from the Columbus area: Army Staff Sgt. Christopher L. Brown, a South Side resident who was killed April 3, 2012, while on patrol in northeastern Afghanistan; and Master Sgt. Shawn T. Hannon of Grove City, Capt. Nicholas J. Rozanski of Dublin and Master Sgt. Jeffrey J. Rieck of the Northwest Side, who all died April 4, 2012, in the same suicide bombing in Afghanistan.

Families of the fallen soldiers met beforehand privately with Kasich in individual, often emotional encounters. Those emotions carried over to the wreath-laying ceremony.

�When I look at the families who�ve lost people, they will leave here today with very, very heavy hearts,� Kasich said.

He asked for a moment of silence in honor of the victims of a tornado that ripped through Moore, Okla., on Monday, killing at least two dozen and injuring hundreds. He also spoke often of faith.

�The families that came in to see me today, every single family said the same thing,� Kasich said. �My loved one, my husband, my son died doing what they wanted to do and what they were called to do. And that my faith sustains me.�
