Did Kurt Russell call President Trump "relentless"
A quote from a Twitter account using Kurt Russell’s face as its profile picture seems to have been inadvertently attributed to the actor himself.

The below quote is spreading across social media –

“President Donald J. Trump is relentless. I’ve never seen a man so dedicated & determined. I’d like to think I would be as courageous as he is, but I just don’t know. The world is after him & he stands there in the face of pure evil, rock solid & ready to fight for us. God bless this brave man.” … Kurt Russell

However, the words were not uttered by the actor. In fact, in what could possibly be a case of mistaken identity, the first instance of this post that we can see comes from a Twitter account called Snake Plissken.

That account has the username WyattEarpLA, and its profile picture is of Kurt Russell. It’s possible that these facts led to the quote being wrongly attributed to Russell himself, when that was not the case.
