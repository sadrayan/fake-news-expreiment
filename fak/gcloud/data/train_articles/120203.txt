Stop this insanity - IronMountainDailyNews.com
EDITOR:

I went to the VA Hospital in Iron Mountain today on business. While there I stopped at the Chapel and found pinky-purple curtains with mesh at the top, covering the altar. (You know the type. They use them between sick patients in the hospital).

I stopped in my tracks, shocked at what I saw. I peeked behind the curtain, and found what used to be the welcoming part of the chapel, the Cross, a picture of Jesus, and other Christian icons familiar to the majority of Americans.

I found Chaplain Bob Mueller, to ask what the meaning was of this change. This is what he told me.

"A couple of months ago, an order came down from Washington DC to cover all things associated with Christianity in the VA. Their solution is to cover everything in all the VA Chapels across the country."

Chaplain Bob went on to say, "A few weeks ago an official from the Madison VA came down here to tell me to 'stop talking about Jesus, and to stop reading Scripture out loud.'"

Chaplain Bob also said that the rest of the Obama plan is to send more curtains to cover the rest of the stained glass windows, because there are Christian symbols on the stained glass.

These photos reveal future plans by the White House.

To use the same phrase President Obama so 'eloquently' used concerning other matters at the VA, 'I'm mad as hell..."

As Americans, we need to stand together to stop this insanity.
