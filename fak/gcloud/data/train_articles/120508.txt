50ft crustacean, dubbed Crabzilla, photographed lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable
Pictures of Britain's so-called biggest crustacean, dubbed Crabzilla, have emerged in Whitstable.

Aerial images of what is said to be a giant sea creature have appeared on supernatural website Weird Whitstable set up by Station Road artist Quinton Winter.

But it has left doubters racking their brains as to how the image might have been created - and how likely such a huge shellfish is in our waters.

Crabzilla was spotted lurking beneath the water

The shadowy figure has been estimated to be 50ft long as it dwarfs fishing boats resting on the pier.

According to the website, the discovery was made in July last year in a popular crabbing spot by two young boys.

Is this the Britain's biggest crustacean?

The website reads: "This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend.

"The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passersby shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water, into the dark, sideways."

But graphic artist Ashley Austen remained sceptical.

He said: "The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop.

"All the 'artist' had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters to it to get the realistic look."

The website is described as an exhibition of phantoms, mysteries, tall tales and artefacts.
