CES Current Employment Statistics
The Current Employment Statistics (CES) program estimates nonagricultural employment by industry based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). These estimates represent jobs by place of work and are generated from a monthly survey of businesses in Florida. Monthly tables include estimates for the current month, previous month, and the current month a year ago, along with monthly and annual changes.

All employee hours and earnings are also developed for the state and selected metro areas on a monthly basis.

Statewide employment by industry data are available both seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted. Sub-state areas are available seasonally adjusted for the total nonagricultural employment level only. Sub-state areas are available by industry for not seasonally adjusted.

These employment, hours, and earnings estimates are developed by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics.

Geographic Coverage: Statewide, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), and Metropolitan Statistical Divisions (MDs)
