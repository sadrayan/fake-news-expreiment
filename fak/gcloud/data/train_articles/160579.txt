The South African
First established in 2003 by Blue Sky Publications Ltd, thesouthafrican.com has evolved to become one of the most read websites in South Africa.

We cover a wide range of topics from politics to sport. We believe what sets us apart is that we deliver news differently. While we hold ourselves to the utmost journalistic integrity of being truthful, we encourage a writing style that is acerbic and conversational, when appropriate.

With a growing readership – averaging four million unique readers* per month and over 12 million page views per month, thesouthafrican.com has evolved rapidly.

Having started as a print edition targeting expats in the United Kingdom, thesouthafrican.com is now run entirely online with our largest readership footprint based in South Africa.

We are independently owned by a private company with no affiliation to any other media group (or political party or religious organisation) and funded mainly through advertising revenue.

We have won a Bookmark Award and have multi-award winning journalists contributing on a regular basis.

The Southafrican.com subscribes to the Code of Ethics and Conduct for South African Print and Online Media that prescribes news that is truthful, accurate, fair and balanced. If we don’t live up to the Code, please contact the Public Advocate at +27 (0) 11 484 3612, fax: +27 (0) 11 4843619.
