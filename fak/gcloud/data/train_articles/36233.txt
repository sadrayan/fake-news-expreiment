Notes: Production capacity for 2018. An operating status of Operating indicates the in-situ-leach plant usually was producing uranium concentrate at the end of the period. Hobson ISR Plant processes uranium concentrate that came from La Palangana. Hobson and La Palangana are part of the same project. ISR stands for in-situ recovery. Christensen Ranch and Irigaray are part of the Willow Creek Project. Uranerz Energy has a tolling arrangement with Cameco Resources. Uranium is first processed at the Nichols Ranch plant and then transported to the Smith Ranch-Highland Operation plant for final processing into Uranerz’s uranium concentrate. CPP stands for central processing plant.
