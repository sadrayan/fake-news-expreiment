H.R. 3697 – Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act
(House Rules)

STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY

H.R. 3697 – Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act

(Rep. Comstock, R-VA, and four cosponsors)

The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act. Consistent with President Donald J. Trump’s priorities, the bill strengthens law enforcement’s ability to fight transnational criminal gangs, such as MS-13, and counter the violence these dangerous groups bring to communities and neighborhoods across the Nation.

H.R. 3697 would promote public safety by providing law enforcement needed tools to help ensure that criminal alien gang members are deported quickly and never again allowed to enter the United States. The legislation would deny criminal alien gang members admission to the United States and make them ineligible for asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, temporary protected status, and, with limited exceptions for law enforcement purposes, parole.

The Administration is committed to strengthening the Nation’s immigration laws in order to improve domestic security, support law enforcement, and restore public safety. This legislation is an important part of these efforts.

If H.R. 3697 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.
