Mark Sanford: Don’t spend money we don’t have
Third, recent government action in our economy undermines part of what made this country great — government’s traditional role in setting the underlying rules by which business operates, not picking who wins and loses. In this regard the string of seemingly arbitrary bailouts we’ve seen are damaging because business people don’t invest or make plans when government is constantly changing the rules. Unilateral action in the economy, in government now firing CEOs or requiring banks to take TARP funding, will equally undercut what has been our ultimate source of economic stimulus — the American worker and entrepreneur.

Second, history is quite clear on the fact that a country cannot spend its way out of a recession. It didn’t work in Japan in the 1990s, when 10 stimulus packages implemented over an eight-year period failed to prevent the “lost decade.” Nor did it work during our Great Depression, when FDR’s own treasury secretary lamented the fact that massive spending had brought little in the way of increased employment and much in the way of debt.

First, on neither the state nor federal level should we be spending money we don’t have, yet that’s precisely what the federal government is doing. According to Bloomberg, our government has now “spent, lent or committed” $12.8 trillion in its attempt to blunt the recession. We’re running deficits we’ve not seen outside World War II when we were literally fighting for our lives — deficits that will play no small part in doubling our national debt over the next 10 years. Families and businesses in South Carolina can’t afford to operate that way, and I’m sure the same holds true in Illinois. Why should it be any different for government?

Respectfully, I think the course I’m advocating makes the most sense for our state — and for taxpayers in yours. Or said more plainly, here is why I believe both pundits and policy-makers in Washington are wrong on stimulus.

In both instances, they took me to task for standing against stimulus money as I have, and what I thought fascinating was their approach. One thing I’ve found throughout my time in public life is when those who disagree don’t want to engage in a debate on the merits, the first place they turn is to your motives — and this indeed was their approach. They basically say I don’t believe what I believe, and it’s just politics driving my opposition.

I find it somewhat odd to be writing a response in a paper so far from home, but having seen my actions referenced twice in a week in these pages by the likes of national media pundits Steve and Cokie Roberts and Donna Brazile, here goes.

In fact, the private sector can’t be helped when we print money we don’t have and jeopardize the value of the American dollar, and by extension insure future inflation and higher taxes in paying for these borrowings.

These dangers are common to all states, but given the specific needs and differences of each state, why shouldn’t we also tailor the stimulus I am not fond of to our individual states? Why doesn’t it make sense to make lemonade out of the lemon that I believe the stimulus ultimately represents? Washington experts are wrong in suggesting that we just do as Washington says.

I fought with every tool available to a stop the stimulus, but we lost and we are now left with the practical question of what to do — and what we have proposed bothers the likes of Mr. and Mrs. Roberts and others.

We proposed not spending it all because common sense dictates that when you’re in a hole, it’s vital you stop digging. South Carolina is currently fourth in the nation in what we spend on debt payments rather than government service — so why would we want more debt? Yet requiring our state to spend beyond its means to be eligible for all the stimulus money guarantees we will dig an additional $740 million financial hole. It also means hard decisions that ought to be made to root out waste in many parts of government won’t get made as we paper over these difficult state budget times with this windfall of new federal money.

For these reasons, we’ve proposed taking about 10 percent and applying it to paying down our state’s high debt. If a prudent family won the lottery they wouldn’t spend every dime; they would set some aside to pay down the mortgage or credit cards — and to me there is nothing political about asking government to be just as prudent.

One last thought — if you agree with these thoughts I’d ask you call your representative and ask they make a stand on financial sanity that seems to irk the Robertses, Brazile and others! Thank you.

Mark Sanford is the governor of South Carolina.
