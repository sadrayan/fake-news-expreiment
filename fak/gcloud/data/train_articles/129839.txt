Micro Chip Applications and 32M
What is it we are doing?

• Three Square Market (32M) is offering implanted chip technology to all employees.

• Company employees will have the option to voluntarily implant a RFID micro chip between the thumb and forefinger underneath the skin.

• RFID technology or Radio-Frequency Identification uses electromagnetic fields to identify electronically stored information.

• The RFID chip will allow employees to make purchases in the company’s break room market, open doors, login to computers, use copy machines, among other things.

• As with a proximity card, the chip implant works in a similar fashion – by holding the chip up to the device reader, the unique serial number associates the user with the software, the software then performs the requested function.

• For employees interested in the technology, but not the implant, they can place the microchip in a RFID wristband or a RFID/Near-Field Communication Smart Ring.

• Three Square Market’s partnership with Biohax Sweden is focused on privacy & integrity, ethical development, and sustainability.

Is the chip trackable?

• The chip is not trackable and only contains information you choose to associate with it. This chip does not have GPS capabilities.

• RFID readers are proximity readers and can only be read with a few inches of an appropriate device.

• The implant uses near-field communication (NFC); the same technology used in contactless credit cards and mobile payments.

How safe is the chip?

• Will the device will harm your body?

This device is FDA approved dating back to 2004.

The device is only inserted through licensed professionals.

The device is easily removed, similar to a splinter.

• Is there concern regarding identity theft

The data on the chip is encrypted, like the technology used in a credit card.

At Three Square Market, we pride ourselves on being leaders in technology and responsible innovation
