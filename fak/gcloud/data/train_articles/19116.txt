Importing hemp products into the U.S.
Can I import hemp products into the United States?

Hemp seeds are allowed to be imported into the United States (U.S.) if sterilized. Non-sterilized hemp seeds remain a schedule I controlled substance and therefore may only be imported into the U.S. with a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Application for Permit to Import Controlled Substances/Domestic and/or Scientific Purposes form. For fill out the application, click on DEA Form 357 and follow the instructions.

Federal law prohibits human consumption and possession of schedule I controlled substances. Products containing tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), the hallucinogenic substance in marijuana are illegal to import. Products that do not cause THC to enter the human body are therefore legal products.

The following hemp products such as clothing hats, shirts, shoes, cosmetics, lotion, paper, rope, twine, yarn, shampoo, and soap, (containing sterilized cannabis seeds or oils extracted from the seeds), etc. may be imported into the U.S.

The importation of this merchandise may be subject to additional requirements or restrictions imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and DEA.

We strongly advise you to contact these agencies for more information.
