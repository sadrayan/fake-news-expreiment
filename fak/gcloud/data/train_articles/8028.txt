An emerging economy is a country that is not as rich as the United States or Canada, but is going through rapid economic growth because of changes in markets, technology, business culture and social practices. The four largest emerging economies in the world are commonly referred to as “the BRIC countries.” They are Brazil, Russia, India and China.
