For those of you who haven't seen these boats, the State of Texas has 6 of them, all 900 horsepower speed boats armed with 50 caliber machine guns, and armored. They had to be purchased to protect Texas law enforcement along the Rio Grande from armed attackers on the Mexican side. Don't listen to the liars who say we don't have a problem on the border, or that it is not dangerous there.

Turns out those aren't 50's. They're SAWs

I originally saw these boats in a publicity shoot for DPS, they were advertised as having 50 caliber machine guns. The ones in this post (according to a close personal friend who is a sergeant with DPS) these guns are actually SAWs. Seems like some people on this post like to argue about semantics.
