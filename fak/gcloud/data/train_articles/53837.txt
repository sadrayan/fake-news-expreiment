Rubio Hails Dismissal of Frivolous School Choice Lawsuit in Florida
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement regarding a Florida appellate court's 3-0 ruling to dismiss a lawsuit challenging Florida's tax credit scholarship program‎"For 15 years, Florida's school choice scholarship program has been a great success story that has helped tens of thousands of Florida's most economically disadvantaged schoolchildren get a better education. Florida's program has been so successful that I used it as a model for legislation I've introduced at the federal level to further encourage giving parents more choices and freedom to send their kids to better schools."‎This frivolous lawsuit against Florida's successful school choice scholarship program was destined to fail, and I'm glad it did. Our kids deserve the best education possible, instead of being trapped in under-performing schools where they can't fully realize their potential. This ruling is a victory for parents and children who deserve every opportunity to achieve the American Dream."In 2014, Rubio announced his opposition to this lawsuit.
