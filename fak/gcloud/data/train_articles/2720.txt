Congressman Paul Broun, M.D.
U.S. Congressman Paul Broun, M.D. (GA-10) today released the following statement after the passage of his amendment to H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. The Broun amendment would increase transparency and strengthen accountability by requiring the Secretary of Education to include in a report to Congress the average salary of employees of the Department according to their job function.

“I thank my colleagues for supporting my amendment, which is a first step towards creating greater transparency and accountability within the Department of Education,” said Rep. Broun.

“Each year, the government spends $70 billion of taxpayers’ hard-earned money to fund the Department of Education, where fat-cat bureaucrats, many of whom have never taught a child to read, are getting paid an average salary of $101,000 a year. That’s twice as much as the average teacher makes in Georgia. My amendment would hold the Department of Education accountable for their costly salaries, and force the government to take a closer look at how scarce education dollars ought to be spent. In light of the recent developments surrounding the IRS, NSA, and Benghazi, the American people deserve a fair look at exactly how their taxes are being put to use, and I intend to provide that transparency with this amendment.”
