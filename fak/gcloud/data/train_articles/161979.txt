General Education & Training (Grades R - 9)
Most commonly asked questions by parents on the education of their school-going children - The South African Schools Act of 1996 requires all children between the ages of seven and 15 to attend school. Parents and guardians must make sure that all learners of this age are registered to go to school. As a parent, your relationship with the school starts on the day that you decide to register your child with a particular school. This relationship is defined by a set of rights and responsibility towards the school.
