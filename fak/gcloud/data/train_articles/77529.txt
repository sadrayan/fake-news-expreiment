#FoodBankNYCChallenge

Every New Yorker CAN DO something to end hunger. We challenge you to walk in the shoes of 1.7 million New Yorkers who rely on SNAP (formerly Food Stamps) by taking the #FoodBankNYCChallenge or making a donation to #CanDoNYC today.

Mario Batali issues the #FoodBankNYCChallenge to his friends Gwyneth Paltrow, Sting, and Deborah Harry

What is the #FoodBankNYCChallenge?

Attempt to live on a food stamp budget for one week. That's only $1.38 per meal.

Why now?

Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013 , and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors. New Yorkers can’t afford any cuts to SNAP - learn more about the cuts here. The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.

How do I take the challenge?

Use $29 per person for all your food for 7 days. Share your experience, challenge a friend, and challenge Congress to strengthen food stamps. For more info, check out our Challenge Toolkit.

Do: Make a budget and shopping list, use coupons

Don’t: Rely on food from others, use food you’ve already bought, give up

This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store—what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week. pic.twitter.com/OZMPA3nxij — Gwyneth Paltrow (@GwynethPaltrow) April 9, 2015
