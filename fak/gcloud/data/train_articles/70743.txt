Cross-reactivity between caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus and type 1 human immunodeficiency virus
Cross-reactivity between surface glycoproteins gp120 (HIV-1) and gp135 (CAEV) was specific. Positive reaction of human sera to CAEV gp135 was more intense than that of goat sera to HIV-1 gp120. Surface glycoprotein sequences of the two viruses were compared by Lasergene® software (Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA, USA). Three homologous regions were identified: the first in the internal domain of gp120; the second in the β3 loop, and still another—with the greatest homology—in a short sequence of the proximal region of the external domain of gp120 between loops β4 and β8.
