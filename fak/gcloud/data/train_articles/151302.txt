Giuliani Signs Bill on Apartment-House Sprinklers
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signed a measure into law yesterday requiring sprinkler systems to be installed in most new residential buildings in the city.

The Mayor signed the legislation even though he said he believed it was not strong enough, but he said he would appoint a task force to develop stricter fire safety regulations.

The new law requires sprinklers in every unit and every common hallway of new residential buildings with four or more units. It also requires the installation of sprinklers in existing residential properties that undergo renovations costing 50 percent or more of the building's value.

But Mr. Giuliani, who signed the law during a ceremony at City Hall, said sprinklers should be required in all homes, not just those that house four or more families.

''I would like to see us go further,'' Mr. Giuliani said. Recalling the two deadly fires that led to the legislation, he added, ''I do not want us to lose the momentum that has come off these terrible tragedies.''
