CARIBE
Welcome to the CARIBE Refugee Program

The CARIBE Program is an Adult Education project that provides English language, GED, and Hi-Tec vocational training to recent Cuban, Haitian, and other entrants with legal, documented refugee or asylee status. With an original goal of 200 student enrollments, this grant funded-program has counted over 12,000 individual enrollments since its inception, and has served students from more than 23 countries. Our goal is to recruit and serve all eligible adult refugees and entrants in Hillsborough County.

The CARIBE Program maintains four classroom sites in the county, each with a state-of-the-art computer lab, utilizing on-line resources to assist students with English language acquisition and workplace readiness skills instruction.

Eligible students may receive vocational training, tuition, materials and fees for programs offered at Brewster, Erwin, Leary, Aparicio-Levy, and Tampa Bay Technical Centers.
