Volcanoes in Hawaii
Hawaii’s Active Volcanoes

Hawaii emerged from the sea millions of years ago, forged by the power of volcanoes. Over time, volcanoes have formed some of our most iconic landscapes. Today, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Island of Hawaii is one of the few places in the world where visitors can come face to face with an active volcano—a truly unforgettable experience.Hawaii’s main volcanoes are “shield” volcanoes, which produce lava flows that form gently sloping, shield-like mountains. A good example is Maunaloa, the most massive mountain on earth, deceptively covering half of Hawaii Island. Standing with this sleeping giant beneath your feet will give you a greater respect for earth’s ever-changing landscapes.The State of Hawaiʻi's active volcanoes include: Kīlauea, Maunaloa, Hualālai, Haleakalā (Maui), and Maunakea. Maunaloa last erupted in 1984, and Kilauea has been continuously erupting since 1983. Loihi is located underwater off the southern coast of Hawaii Island. Erupting since 1996, this emerging seamount may eventually break the surface, adding a new island to the Hawaiian chain.Other notable volcanoes include: Leahi (Diamond Head) , Oʻahu - hiking; Haleakala , Maui - watching the sunrise; Maunakea, Hawaiʻi Island, guided stargazing tours.
