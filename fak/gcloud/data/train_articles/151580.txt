The Carr Fire, the 7th Most Destructive in California History, Rages On
The Carr Fire is the largest of 17 wildfires now raging in California. It is heading west after tearing through Redding, a city about 200 miles north of San Francisco, killing six people and displacing tens of thousands. The fire is now considered the seventh most destructive in the state’s history, according to Cal Fire, the state agency responsible for fire protection.

It grew so intense that it created its own weather systems, including a tornado-like fire whirl.

Here’s some background on the Carr Fire — which was named after a spot in Whiskeytown National Recreation Area — and a look at its current state.

How big is the blaze?

The fire, which the authorities said was caused by a mechanical failure in a vehicle, has grown to cover some 110,000 acres — roughly the size of New Orleans. Emergency responders have been able to contain about 27 percent of the blaze, according to Cal Fire.

Since the beginning of this year, fires have scorched more than 430,000 acres in California, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Nearly three-quarters of that land has been burned in Northern California.
