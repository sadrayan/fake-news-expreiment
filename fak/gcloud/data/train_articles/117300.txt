Halal Certification On Our Food - Also See Our Hoax Information Below

We have received a number of letters from people asking if we will be putting the Muslim Halal logo on our food.



To acquire Halal certification, payment is required to the endorsing body and involves a number of site inspections of both our growers and processors in order to ensure that our practices comply with the conditions of Halal certification. It is important to note that this does not reflect the quality of the food being processed or sold – it only means that the products are approved as being prepared in accordance with the traditions of the Muslim faith.



We are aware of an increasing number of large companies both in Australia and overseas, such as Kraft and Cadbury, who have obtained accreditation to use the Halal logo. We don’t believe they have done this because of any religious commitment but rather for purely commercial reasons. Perhaps these large organisations can afford to do this. While we have a choice however, we would prefer to avoid unnecessarily increasing the cost of our products in order to pay for Halal accreditation when this money would be better spent continuing to support important charitable causes where assistance is greatly needed.

Update 18 December 2014 - HOAX EMAIL



Please be aware that there is a hoax email being distributed on social media networks. It has been circulating for some time now and although most people are aware that it is hoax. There are others who believe it to be true and keep sharing it. Our view on Halal certification is as stated above only. Please help us put a stop to this hoax by advising anyone who shares it that it is not Dick Smith's view on the subject. Thank you.
