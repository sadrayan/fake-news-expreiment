CLINTON FENCE HAS NEIGHBORS CROSS
" The zoning board also gave approval for a 4-by-6-foot guardhouse - with a turret - just inside the gate. While residents criticized the Clintons' plans for the house, no one showed up at the meeting to protest, said board chairman Gabriel Rosenfeld. "The Secret Service agent who presented the Clintons' case said he spoke to the neighbors surrounding the property and all expressed support for the variances," Rosenfeld said. The Clintons will have to apply for an extension in five years if they want to keep the guardhouse and fence. They will also have to come before the board yet again if they want to turn the barn on their property into a housing for Secret Service agents or an office, he said. The Secret Service has been busy installing additional security for the house, and Hillary Rodham Clinton said she plans to move in shortly after the new year, while the President continues living in Washington. The Chappaqua address gives the First Lady the New York residency she needs to run for the Senate.
