New Passport Rule Could Prevent Millions of Travelers from Entering U.S.
All told, the U.S. and the U.K. have a relatively amiable relationship: Despite jokes about accents and what, exactly, a chip is, London remains a popular destination for American travelers, and the Royal Family holds a special sort of allure for those of us without a monarchy . Recent policy changes, however, may have put a strain on this relationship: new immigration rules from the U.S. mean that some British citizens may not be allowed entry into the country—yes, even if they have a valid passport .

The rule is not meant to be discriminatory against our English-speaking neighbors; rather, it's part of a wider U.S. rule pertaining to those visiting the country under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), which allows citizens of 38 participating countries to travel to the U.S. for business or tourism for up to 90 days without a visa. A policy tweak, put into effect by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on April 1, refuses to allow travelers into the country via the VWP unless they have e-passports, which have a digital chip containing biometric information about the passport owner and enhanced security features .

Biometric passports began being issued in October 2006 in Britain, which means that given a passport's ten-year shelf life , this change primarily affects a smaller number of a greater whole. Still, The Independent calculated that as many as 80,000 British travelers are at risk of being denied boarding, and The Telegraph put that number higher— in the millions . Thus far, many travelers unaware of the new rule have arrived at the airport, only to be turned away and have their trips ruined .
