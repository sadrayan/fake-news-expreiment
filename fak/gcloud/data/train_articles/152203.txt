Repeat After Me: You Can’t Get HIV From Food!
The internet rumor mill just won’t quit. Remember those fake news stories about children getting HIV from eating Walmart bananas? Nothing but clickbait. Well, a new version of that story is making the rounds. This latest rumor makes the outlandish (and scientifically impossible) claim that a worker at a Cadbury candy factory was arrested for contaminating products with his HIV-positive blood and that people should therefore avoid eating the chocolates or risk contracting the virus.

This rumor is baseless on many levels. No arrests have been made nor have any warnings about contaminated products been issued, according to fact-checking website Snopes.com. In fact, the rumor is nearly identical to a previous one involving Pepsi.

More important, Snopes points out: “HIV is unable to reproduce outside its living host; it does not spread or maintain infectiousness outside its host. Therefore, were HIV-tainted blood to be mixed into foodstuffs or beverages, the virus would neither survive nor while it was still viable multiply and so replenish itself.” And where does Snopes get its info? No less an authority than the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Now, about the rumors concerning all that sugar in a Cadbury Creme Egg? You don’t need Snopes for that one—just read the nutrition labels.
