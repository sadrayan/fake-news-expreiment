Did Sarah Palin Just Say ‘F%@# You’ To Michael Moore?
A photo of Sarah Palin was posted to Facebook on Friday showing the former Republican vice presidential nominee holding a sign that read “Fuc_ You Michael Moore.”

Palin was pictured alongside two men, one of whom appears to be Sgt. Dakota Meyers, a Medal of Honor recipient, and the person who apparently posted the image.

Meyers posted the image with the caption “Here’s a tribute to you Michael Moore. Share it and make it trending ‪#‎michaelmoore‬.”

Both instances of the letter “o” in Moore were replaced with what appeared to be crosshairs in the handmade sign shown in the photo.

Michael Moore has received criticism from conservatives for his scathing comments on “American Sniper” a movie based on the autobiography of former Navy SEAL and sniper Chris Kyle.

Mediaite received the photo on Friday via a tip, which Editor in Chief Andrew Kirell shared on Twitter:

The photo landed as Palin has been considering a 2016 presidential bid. When asked by an ABC News correspondent whether she’d consider entering the race for the Republican nomination, Palin said, “Of course.”

“Yeah, I mean, of course, when you have a servant’s heart, when you know that there is opportunity to do all you can to put yourself forward in the name of offering service, anybody would be interested,” Palin said.

Palin received flak in March 2010 for a Facebook post of a map with crosshairs showing Democrats who had voted for health care reform in conservative districts, including Gabrielle Giffords’ district. After Giffords was shot in the head at an event in Arizona, an aide of Palin’s was forced to explain that her map wasn’t meant to represent gun sights and that blaming her was “obscene” and “appalling.”
