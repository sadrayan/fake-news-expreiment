Frequently Asked Questions: Schlesinger v. Ticketmaster
In 2003, the Schlesinger v. Ticketmaster class action lawsuit was filed, alleging that Ticketmaster failed to fully disclose to consumers all aspects of its UPS and order processing fees. While vigorously defending the lawsuit, Ticketmaster settled the case in 2013, with the court granting final approval of the settlement in February 2015.

The settlement class generally includes all consumers who purchased tickets on Ticketmaster.com between October 21, 1999, and February 27, 2013 (the “class period�?).

2. Why do I have discount codes and ticket vouchers?

As part of the Schlesinger v. Ticketmaster settlement, Ticketmaster agreed to provide:

To each class member, one discount code (worth $2.25 off a future purchase of primary tickets) for every purchase made on Ticketmaster.com during the class period, up to 17 discount codes per person. To class members who used UPS delivery during the class period, one $5 UPS discount code for every purchase made on Ticketmaster.com that included UPS delivery, again up to 17 UPS discount codes per person. To each class member, one ticket voucher (potentially redeemable for two eligible general admission tickets for select events at Live Nation owned or operated venues, subject to availability and limitations) for every purchase on Ticketmaster.com during the class period, up to 17 vouchers per person. The Settlement Agreement limits the value of vouchers that are to be redeemed in a given year. Please be aware that due to high demand and limited availability, we expect these tickets to be redeemed quickly.

3. How many codes and vouchers do I get?

Each class member received one discount code for each Ticketmaster.com purchase made during the class period, up to a maximum of 17 discount codes. Each class member who used UPS delivery for a ticket order during the class period also received one UPS discount code for each UPS delivery he or she paid for over the class period, up to a maximum of 17 UPS discount codes. Each class member also received one ticket voucher for each Ticketmaster.com purchase the class member made during the class period, up to a maximum of 17 ticket vouchers. This voucher is potentially redeemable for two eligible general admission tickets for select events at Live Nation owned or operated venues, subject to availability and limitations. The Settlement Agreement limits the value of vouchers that are to be redeemed in a given year.
