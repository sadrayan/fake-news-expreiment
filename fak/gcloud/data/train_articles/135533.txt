Petition · The NSW Police force: Stop Supporters of 'Legal Rape' Roosh V Advocates meeting in Sydney · Change.org
Supporters of known 'legal rape' advocate and 'neo-masculinist' misogynist creator of 'Return of the Kings' Roosh V will congregate for the first time in Sydney this Saturday.

According to the Australian - "Women, transgender men and homosexual men are banned from the meeting of “neomasculinist” supporters, who have been urged to travel in pairs or groups using indirect routes to avoid “green-haired female activists or male feminists” following them."

The "tribal meetings" will occur on February 6 in Sydney as well as Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, as well as in 43 other countries.

Australia already has a widespread problem with rape, abuse and violence against women and does not need any more encouragement to harm women from people like Roosh V and his followers.

What these men are advocating is, and should legally be considered, a hate-crime. Not only should the police stop this event from occurring - they also need to inspect the men attending this event.

1 in 5 women will get raped in their lifetime and the large majority of the perpetrators will be men that they know.

We need to send the message that rape is not ok, that supporting a misogynist like Roosh V is not ok and that violence against women is not ok!

Sign the petition to let the NSW Police Force know that we are absolutely livid that this sort of misogynistic form of terrorism will occur this Saturday. It should not be allowed or acceptable in Sydney or Australia in general. We want this event to be cancelled.
