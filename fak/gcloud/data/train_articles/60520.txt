Trump and Clinton both have a soft spot for single-payer health care
Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for comments she apparently made about a single-payer health-care system, citing the leaked transcript of one of Clinton’s speeches in 2013.

“She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster,” Trump said in the townhall debate in St. Louis Sunday night. “She wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.”

In a single-payer system, the government reimburses hospitals and doctors for providing medical treatment to all patients. The private insurance industry, which currently provides insurance for the majority of Americans, would be largely replaced by the government — although clinics and hospitals would remain in the private sector.

Proponents say that patients would save money with a single-payer system, because the government would be able to negotiate reduced prices with providers and pharmaceutical companies, and administrative costs would be decreased.

“If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down,” Clinton had said, according to the transcript, which was apparently revealed as a result of a hack into the Democratic National Committee’s servers.

Clinton also said that some single-payer systems offer fewer treatments or require patients to wait longer to receive care, noting a common objection from opponents of these systems.

Trump himself, however, has also been supportive of the single-payer system in the past.

“It’s certainly something that in certain countries works. It actually works incredibly well in Scotland. Some people think it really works in Canada,” Trump told MSNBC last year.
