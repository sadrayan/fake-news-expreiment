BPOM Uncovers Two Formaldehyde-Tainted Noodle Factories in Bogor
Bogor. The Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) along with officers from the National Police confiscated 50 kilograms of formaldehyde, known locally as formalin, and hundreds of kilograms of noodles produced using the hazardous substance during a raid in two noodle factories in Bogor’s subdistrict of Bojonggede, West Java, Saturday.

“According to temporary investigations, the two factories produce up to six tons of noodles in one production cycle,” said Mustofa, director of hazardous products and materials for the BPOM. “It is known that the noodles contain over 1.5 milligrams of the hazardous substance, which is definitely a threat to one’s health.”

Formalin is an aqueous form of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. The substance is often illegally used as a preservative in several food items such as chicken, fish, noodles and tofu in Indonesia.

The raid follows a two-month-long investigation by a team from the agency, Mustofa said.

The factories reportedly employ up to 20 people and own four cars used to market the products to traditional markets and noodle vendors within the Greater Jakarta area.

Mustofa added that the factories had been in operation for three years, with noodles being sold for Rp 45,000 per five kilograms, a price said to be cheaper by up to Rp 20,000 ($1.60) compared to noodles that do not contain formaldehyde.

Lilik, owner of the factories who reportedly buys formaldehyde from a drugstore in South Tangerang, is charged with the 2012 Food Law, which sees a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a maximum fine of Rp 10 billion.

Mustofa has called on the public to avoid consuming food containing formaldehyde, emphasizing it could lead to digestive disorders and paralysis.

“Noodles containing formaldehyde are typically brighter in its color and are tougher,” he said.
