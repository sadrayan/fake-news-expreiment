I'm a historical sociologist studying development and social change in the global South.

My first book, A Social Revolution: Politics and the Welfare State in Iran, is published by University of California Press.

My current research projects focus on:

Welfare politics in low and middle-income countries

Business-state relations in Iran

History of social policy in West Asia and North Africa

Class and social mobility in Iran before and after 1979
