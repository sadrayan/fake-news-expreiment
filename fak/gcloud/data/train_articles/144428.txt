Updated: Kenya didn’t remove pockets from police uniforms to fight corruption
Reports have it that authorities in Kenya are planning to remove

pockets from police uniforms as part of President Kenyatta’s

fight against corruption in the country.

The new set of police uniforms will have no pockets.

It is believed that the proposal, if implemented, would make it

difficult for Kenyan police officers who take bribes on the roads,

to keep the cash they collect.

However, sources within the Police Command say the officers will

resist any attempt to make their uniforms pocketless, because the

pockets also beautifies the total appearance of a police officer.

Africa Check asked Joseph Boinnet, Kenya’s inspector general of police, if there was any truth to the Afrikan-Daily.com story.

“There is nothing like that,” he said.
