Mary Marchant
Dr. Marchant leads a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary research team that includes national and international experts on Chinese agricultural policy and trade who study U.S. agricultural competitiveness in Chinese markets. Agricultural exports to China represent 20 percent of U.S. farmers’ incomes, making China the United States’ largest agricultural export market and playing a key role in the economic wellbeing of U.S. agriculture. The overall goal of Dr. Marchant’s research program is to examine and model China's agricultural trade policies and promote U.S. market access to China. Methods used to accomplish this goal include reviewing Chinese trade policy; interviewing U.S. agribusiness leaders operating in China; incorporating policy instruments into existing trade models; and innovatively disseminating results. These processes help Dr. Marchant’s team determine U.S. market access impediments and success stories, which are then used to deliver critical insights to stakeholders to enhance U.S. agricultural market access

Role of Graduate Students



Graduate students have been instrumental in my research projects over the past 25+ years in my career. One of my goals is to work with graduate students to enhance their professional development by publishing papers in academic journals and presenting research at professional meetings. Results include over 50 student co-authored referred publications and over 45 student co-authored presentations at professional meetings.

Future Research

I plan to continue my research on China and am also working with colleagues within the Center fro Agricultural Trade on a new grant on barriers to trade.
