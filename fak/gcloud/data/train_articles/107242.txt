A man is in stable condition after he was allegedly attacked with a hammer early Thursday morning.

A man was found in the parking lot of the Mac's convenience store at 5th Street and 11th Avenue S.W.

He was bleeding from the head and taken to hospital in serious non-life threatening condition.

Two people were taken into custody for questioning and released.

Police say the attack was not random and charges are pending.
