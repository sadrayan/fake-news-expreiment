The 10 Richest Counties in America
Teton County, Wyoming, tops the list for highest average income in the United States, according to updated Tax Stats data just released by the IRS.

The average income in Teton—known for hiking, skiing, and multimillion dollar Jackson Hole ranches—is nearly $300,000. Compare that with $62,483 for the average American household.

Of course, average income figures don’t give you a good picture of how much a typical resident makes, since super-rich outliers can skew the data (median figures were not released), but this list gives you a good idea of where many of America’s millionaires and billionaires hang out.

Sterling, Texas, places second on the list and carries yet another distinction—the highest average tax liability in the country. Only 600 returns were filed in the county, but the average tax owed was a whopping $97,387.
