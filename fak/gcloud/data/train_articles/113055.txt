News flash: 'Oprah' massacre NOT coming to Mayflower

Residents of Mayflower Residence Hall can rest easy this Halloween now that a rumor asserting a massacre would occur there has been quashed.

Many UI students reported Wednesday that they had heard a psychic appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show earlier in the week foretold a mass murder transpiring on Halloween in a Big Ten dorm, which was shaped like an "H" and was near a graveyard.

Some students even said the psychic narrowed the possible site of the slaughter to either the UI or the Indiana University.

Most students who heard the rumor said Mayflower was going to be the scene of the tragedy because of its "proximity" to Oakland Cemetery, 1000 Brown St., and its shape, which closely resembles an "H" backwards.

"I don't know where (the rumor) came from, but everybody's talking about it," said Sara Nash, UI freshman and Mayflower resident. "It kind of freaked me out."

Fortunately for the fearful and susceptible students among Mayflower's populace, a spokeswoman for the Oprah Winfrey show quickly dismissed the rumor.

"We never had such a show. There was never such a thing said," said Audrey Pass of Harpo Productions.

Every student who was asked where he or she found out about the massacre story said, "I heard it from a friend."
