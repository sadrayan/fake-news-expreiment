TEPCO : Tritium Density Result of Water Quality Survey inside the Port of Fukushima Daiichi NPS (Follow-up Information 29)
Fukushima Daiichi NPS Prompt Report (Aug 05, 2013) Tritium Density Result of Water Quality Survey inside the Port of Fukushima Daiichi NPS (Follow-up Information 29)

This is follow-up information on the latest situation concerning the detection of high densities of Tritium and Strontium in the observation hole at the east side of the Unit 1-4 Turbine Buildings of Fukushima Daiichi NPS.

We would like to make an announcement on measurement results of the γ nuclide and all-β densities in water sampled today (on August 5) from the groundwater observation hole No.1-5 (west of the groundwater observation hole No.1-3), as we obtained the results.

The γ nuclide and all-β densities this time were all detected higher than the previous densities.

<Groundwater observation hole No.1-5>

- Sampling on August 5:

Cesium-134 310Bq/L

Cesium-137 650Bq/L

All-β 56,000Bq/L

- Sampling on July 31 (previously announced):

Cesium-134 21Bq/L

Cesium-137 44Bq/L

All-β 1,200Bq/L

We will sample water in this observation hole again tomorrow (on August 6) and analyze the water.

We are continuing to tackle this problem in such manners as to intensely bring forward implementation of contamination prevention measures such as foundation improvement work to the bank protection, and comprehensively intensify the monitoring by using the results of additional boring to drill additional locations, and the analyses results on seawater at such locations as the port interior and the water outlets.
