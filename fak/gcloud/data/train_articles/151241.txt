More refugees flee to Uganda than across Mediterranean
Need to scale up

However, aid agencies urgently need to scale up humanitarian assistance. Public infrastructure must be improved, more schools built and families provided with basic support, until they are able to make a living for themselves. Last year’s refugee aid response plan for Uganda was only 36 per cent funded. This left families without clean drinking water and children without education.

“Uganda has done what all countries should do. It has provided civilians fleeing war with security, and an opportunity to become a resource, instead of locking the displaced into a situation of aid-dependence and uncertainty,” said Egeland.

He is not surprised to see a low-income country among the largest refugee recipients:

“Populist politicians are stirring up fear, creating a distorted picture of all refugees wanting to head towards Europe or North America. This could not be further from the truth. Low- and mid-income countries are housing nine out of ten displaced. Most people fleeing want to stay as close to their home country as possible, wishing to one day be able to return,” Egeland said.
