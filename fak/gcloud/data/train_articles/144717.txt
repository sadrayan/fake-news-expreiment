Trump denies making 'shithole countries' comment
Story highlights Trump also denied demanding that Haitians be removed from negotiations about protected status

Sen. Dick Durbin, who was present at the meeting, confirmed Trump's remarks

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Friday denied describing certain nations as "shithole countries" during a meeting in which he rejected a bipartisan deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

He also denied demanding that Haitians be removed from negotiations about protected status for people from certain countries.

"The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!" Trump tweeted.

Trump's response Friday morning was particularly notable after White House spokesperson Raj Shah did not deny the "shithole" remark on Thursday evening. And it prompted senators who were present at the meeting to answer questions Friday about their recollections of the startling remarks.

Trump later tweeted Friday morning that he "Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.' Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!"
