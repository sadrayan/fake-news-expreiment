Syrian humanitarian aid: which countries give what?

The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has been keeping track of who is donating to Syria's humanitarian crisis and how much - we've produced this interactive to show the numbers.



The US has boasted of being the largest donor so far - which is true - but the donations look a little different when considered as a proportion of the donor's economy. We've done the calculations and, when stacked as a percentage of GDP, Kuwait emerges as the largest donor.



The graphs below are coloured to indicate how much of the aid money pledged has already been sent to relief efforts. The darker the blue, the closer the money is to being directly in the hands of aid workers. UNOCHA distinguishes between contributions (actual payments) commitments (contractual agreement) and pledges (non-binding agreements). Switch between tabs at the top and click on a circle to see the actual values from each country.
