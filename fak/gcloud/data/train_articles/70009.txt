Faculty Compensation Survey
Results of the AAUP's annual Faculty Compensation Survey are published as the Annual Report on the Economic Status of the Profession in the March-April issue of Academe, the official magazine of the AAUP.

Data from the survey are also available in several custom formats: results portal, complete datasets, peer compensation reports, and survey report tables. Results portal access is available for institutions to create and save peer lists and conduct fully customizable analysis on specific variables not included in peer compensation reports. Complete datasets are provided in Excel and include all of the report appendix institutional listings plus additional fields. Reports and data will be provided to active AAUP chapters and state conferences in good standing at no cost. Order data or find out more here.

Institutional respondents to our annual Faculty Compensation Survey will find current information for submitting and reviewing data at https://research.aaup.org/order.
