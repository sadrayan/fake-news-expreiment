Subject: Austin reporter, fresh urgent PolitiFact Texas inquiry

Dr. Hayhoe:

Hello again from Austin.

I write afresh from the Austin American-Statesman and on behalf of PolitiFact Texas because we are checking a candidate’s claim that the last three years have been the hottest on record.

The candidate offers as backup NOAA’s February announcement and I am aware too of what NASA announced the same day.

How would you analyze the accuracy of this claim?

Any caveats or other data considerations?

Of course, and as before, I’d be happy to field your comments for our story by email or in a telephone interview. I am hoping to complete our review soon.

Appreciated,

g.

True, and I'm surprised you need to ask - the evidence is easy to find on google, you don't need my opinion!

"On record" refers to the instrumental record measured by thermometers at weather stations around the world, dating back to the 1800s
