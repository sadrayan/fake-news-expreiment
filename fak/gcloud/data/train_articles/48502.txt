3 Miami Dolphins stage protests before preseason opener
Dolphins wide receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson appeared to kneel during the national anthem before Thursday’s preseason opener against the Tampa Bay Bucs.

Defensive end Robert Quinn also held a right fist high into the air during the anthem. Quinn appeared to be shaking his head.

Stills has previously kneeled in protest of social injustice. He said in the spring: “When the time comes where I have to make a decision, I’ll make a decision."

Dolphins newcomer Quinn has raised a fist in protest in the past. Quinn said recently that he will retain his right to freedom of speech.

Dolphins Laremy Tunsil and Jordan Phillips have participated in protest in the past. Former Dolphins special teams captain Michael Thomas, an outspoken activist, is now with the New York Giants.

Coach Adam Gase said recently that he would not give his players any instruction regarding the anthem.

The NFL has put on hold a decision requiring players who are on the field to stand for the national anthem.

The NFL and NFLPA are having further discussions.
