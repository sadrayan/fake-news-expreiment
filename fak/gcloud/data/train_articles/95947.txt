Buckeye passes final budget
The Buckeye City Council approved the fiscal year 2015-16 final budget of $258 million at its June 16 council meeting.

The budget is $73 million more than the fiscal year 2014-15 budget, which was $185 million.

According to City Finance Director Larry Price’s budget presentation, this year’s increase is largely a result of the city’s $62 million Global Water acquisition, which will allow the city to provide water services to the nearly 7,000 residential and commercial customers who previously were served by the private water company.

“ Global and the city felt that the customers could be served by one system, so, the city plans on being able to provide better service,” Price said.

Another main priority for the city is enterprise expenses, which includes water, sewer and sanitation.

Councilman Craig Heustis said enterprise costs would increase with the purchase of Global Water and additional employees.

Although the city’s Capital Improvement Plan is decreasing from $37 million to $35 million, the city has a few road projects lined up, including the extension of Watson Road to Rainbow Road, Heustis said.

In addition, Buckeye will hold its Truth in Taxation hearing to discuss the city’s tentative property tax rate at 6 p.m. July 7 at the Buckeye City Council Chambers, 530 E. Monroe Ave., Heustis said.

The city proposed a property tax rate at $1.80 per $100 of assessed property value, which has remained the same for the past three years. A house valued at $100,000 would cost $180 a year in taxes. If approved, the increase would take effect on July 1.
