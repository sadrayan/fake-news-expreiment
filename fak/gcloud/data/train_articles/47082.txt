New York Times Co.’s Decline in Print Advertising Tempered by Digital Gains
Precipitous declines in print advertising rocked the newspaper industry last year. And while The New York Times Company recorded significant growth in subscriptions and promising increases in digital advertising, it nevertheless has not avoided the inevitable.

The company said on Thursday that its print advertising revenue in 2016 fell 16 percent, driving a 9 percent drop in total advertising revenue. For the quarter, print advertising revenue declined 20 percent.

The story on the digital side was positive, underscoring the diverging financial narratives for print and digital that have emerged at the company.

Digital advertising revenue rose 6 percent last year, to $209 million. The Times Company added 514,000 net digital-only subscriptions for its news products during the year, bringing its total to 1.6 million. Buoyed by readers’ intense interest in the presidential election, the company added 276,000 net digital-only subscriptions to its news products in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined.
