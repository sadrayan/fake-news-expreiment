KUWAIT, Feb 3 (KUNA) -- Kuwait Friday categorically denied media reports that it planned to stop issuing entry visas for some nationalities, affirming that issuance of visa was a "sovereignty matter." The foreign ministry "categorically denies these claims and affirms that these reported nationalities (which he did not mention) have big communities in Kuwait and enjoy full rights," Sami Al-Hamad, Assistant foreign Minister for Consular Affairs, said in a statement to KUNA.

Al-Hamad said citizens of those countries mentioned by social media visited Kuwait regularly through direct commercial flights.

Businesspeople from Kuwait and those countries are bound to commercial relations, he explained.

"The State of Kuwait believes that granting of visa is a sovereign matter, and is not linked to terrorism or violence or nationality or faith," he said. (end) bs
