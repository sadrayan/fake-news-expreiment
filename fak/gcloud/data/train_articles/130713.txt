ADW: Ratufa indica: INFORMATION
The distribution of Ratufa indica is restricted to peninsular India. With increasing deforestation in the region, the geographic range of R. indica continues to decrease (Nowak 1999).

Ratufa indica is arboreal, spending most of its time in trees. It makes its shelter within holes in trees. Moving from tree to tree, R. indica can leap 6 meters or more. Giant squirrels rarely leave the trees, usually only to chase other squirrels during the breeding season. Giant squirrels are found primarily in moist tropical forests (Nowak 1999).

Ratufa indica has dorsal coloration that varies from deep red to brown, the ventral fur is white. They have short, round ears, a broadened hand with an expanded inner paw for gripping, and large, powerful claws used for gripping tree bark and branches. Females can be distinguished from males by their three sets of mammae. Total body length varies from 254 to 457 mm and tail length is approximately the same as body length. These squirrels weigh approximately 1.5 to 2 kg (Nowak 1999).

Reproduction

Little is known of mating behavior in R. indica. Males actively compete for females during the breeding season and pairs may remain associated for longer periods of time (Nowak, 1999).

Reproductive behavior of R. indica is poorly known. There is some evidence that breeding occurs throughout the year, or several times during the year. Litter size is usually 1 or 2 young, but may be as many as 3. Gestation period in a close relative, Ratufa bicolor, was recorded to be 28 to 35 days in length.

Range number of offspring 1 to 3

Average number of offspring 1 AnAge

Range gestation period 28 to 35 days

Ratufa indica build eagle-sized nests in the branches of trees and raise the young there until they begin to emerge from the nest and gain independence (Borges, 1992; Nowak, 1999).
