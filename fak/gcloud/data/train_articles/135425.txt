Healthcare in Sweden
Decentralised healthcare

Sweden is divided into 290 municipalities and 20 county councils. Swedish healthcare is decentralised – responsibility lies with the county councils and, in some cases, local councils or municipal governments. This is regulated by the Health and Medical Service Act. The role of the central government is to establish principles and guidelines, and to set the political agenda for health and medical care.

County councils are political bodies whose representatives are elected by county residents every four years on the same day as national general elections. Halland, Skåne and Västra Götaland county councils – as well as Gotland municipality – are called regional councils and have assumed responsibility for regional development from the state.

Local and regional responsibilities

Swedish policy states that every county council must provide residents with good-quality health and medical care, and work to promote good health for the entire population. As of 2019, county councils also cover dental care costs for local residents up to the age of 23. Dental care from the age of 24 is subsidised by the state.

Sweden’s municipalities are respons­ible for care for the elderly in the home or in special accommodation. Their duties also include care for people with physical dis­abilities or psychological disorders and providing support and services for people released from hospital care as well as for school healthcare.
