Subject: Seeking information for a PolitiFact Texas fact-check

Good afternoon. I write because we’re fact-checking Austin resident Roger Falk’s recent published claim that the Austin school district “enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts after recapture.”

Falk told us that one way he reached this conclusion ties to the Texas Education Agency's “most recent, complete year financial compilation report (2016/2017).” He provided the table below showing district and post recapture total revenue per student, he wrote. Based on the data, he said, AISD is second highest of the 12 districts and Dallas is first. He said he got the presented figures starting from: https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/school.finance/forecasting/financial_reports/1617_FinBudRep.html

DISTRICT TEA Revenue/Student AUSTIN $10,949 ALDINE 10,166 ARLINGTON 9,465 CORPUS 9,431 CY FAIR 9,874 DALLAS 11,377 EL PASO 9,524 FT WORTH 9,591 HOUSTON 9,580 KATY 10,732 SAN ANTONIO 10,422 YSLETA 10,059

Falk said he otherwise pulled numbers from each district's 2018 budget and current enrollment data (two standards exist PEIMS vs FSR to make things more confusing, he wrote us). Falk said he used a "proposed" budget number for AISD, as it wasn't adopted at the time he did his research. He also said that to his knowledge, a final budget hasn't been released, as it was previously for 2017 https://www.austinisd.org/sites/default/files/dept/budget/docs/FY2017_Austin_ISD_Official.pdf . Falk told us his rationale for moving Dallas from the top spot was that it had less proportional student loss than AISD and a budget decline, while AISD's budget increased and lost students.

From the education agency’s vantage point, do these methodologies bear out the claim we’re checking? Why or why not?

Is there other data on point to making the per-student funding comparison?

Any other considerations or recommended resources?

As ever, we seek attributable on-the-record information. I am hoping to complete our review early next week.

Here you go.

Please let me know if you need anything else or have followup questions.

From the School Finance staff:

TEA confirmed the rankings are correct for the districts in the table provided using the 2016-17 budgeted data submitted to PEIMS

· This data however does not include federal funds as districts don’t submit budgets for federal funds to the TEA

· When we used the most recent actual audited revenue data available for the 2015-2016 school year (which includes federal funds) Austin slipped to 8th place out of 12

· Actual 2016-2017 data will be available in March of 2018

If the posted figures don’t include federal data, then why are there totals shown for per-student federal spending on each district’s entry?

They don’t include the majority of the federal money

Staff has shown the differences on this spreadsheet.

The main point is -its really only a good idea to use actual data rather than budget and doing so can lead to very different results on rankings.
