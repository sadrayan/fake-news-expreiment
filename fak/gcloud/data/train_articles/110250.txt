UC San Diego Neurosurgery
Scott E. Olson, M.D.

Dr. Olson specializes in treating patients with complex problems of the blood vessels of the brain including aneurysms, stokes, and vascular malformations, whether congenital or acquired.

He grew up in Ohio and graduated Magna Cum Laude from Grove City College in Grove City, PA with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science degree in Biochemistry. While at Grove City, he was a multi-year letterman in both soccer and tennis. Dr. Olson received his Medical Doctorate from the University of Cincinnati and completed an internal medicine internship and neurology residency at the University of Arizona, where he was Chief Resident during his last year.

It was during his residency that Dr. Olson saw the devastating impact cerebrovascular disease has on its victims and their families. He was encouraged when he saw that recent advances in technology were offering great hope for treatment of the previously untreatable. This passion led him to pursue and obtain a coveted fellowship at the University of California with pioneers in the stroke (Dr. Patrick Lyden) and endovascular neurosurgery community (Drs. Charles Kerber and Wade Wong). He became one of the first neurologists in the country trained in the new complex, image guided, minimally invasive therapies.

Following his fellowship, Dr. Olson stayed on faculty at the University of California, San Diego for 6 years before going into private practice for 2 years. In 2014, he was delighted to join the newly assembled multidisciplinary neurovascular team back at UCSD. He is glad to be part of a team of sub-specialty trained physicians and nurses from different backgrounds (neurosurgery, neurology, radiology, critical care) who share his passion for treating this disease and have combined their expertise to function as a dedicated team to provide the highest level of care.
