Amazon.com: The Ultimate Quotable Einstein (9780691160146): Albert Einstein, Alice Calaprice, Freeman Dyson: Books
This a comprehensive collection of quotations by Einstein, along with some quotations about him, filling almost 600 pages (I read all of them). The quotations have been carefully selected and authenticated, which makes this collection perhaps the most authoritative available source for Einstein quotations.



The topics of course cover physics, but they also range into philosophy, and extend further into religion, politics, and much else. I think this range of topics shows the dual nature of Einstein, a man who valued solitary investigation into the nature of the universe, but was also willing and able to passionately engage in the social world.



I've read a few biographies about Einstein, but hearing him speak in his own words offers a different and valuable perspective which is essential if you really want to get to know what kind of person he was. I think you'll find confirmation that he was indeed a uniquely profound genius whose towering reputation is entirely warranted, while also being subject to the imperfections and limitations which are inherent in being human.
