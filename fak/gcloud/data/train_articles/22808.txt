Sen. Bob Graham undergoes successful heart surgery
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Bob Graham of Florida underwent heart surgery Friday and is expected to take a month to recuperate before deciding whether to seek the Democratic presidential nomination.

Capitol physician Dr. John Eisold, Graham's attending doctor, said the "uncomplicated procedure" went well and the senator was in stable condition in the cardiac intensive care unit at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.

The 66-year-old Graham "is resting comfortably," Eisold said. "We anticipate a full recovery."

During the operation, the doctors replaced the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart's left ventricle into the aorta, the main artery carrying oxygen-rich blood through the body.

The surgery was performed by Dr. Alan Speir of Annandale, Va. Speir replaced Graham's aortic valve with a heart valve from a cow. Doctors had planned to give him an artificial valve, but changed their approach and used a "bioprosthesis" because a mechanical valve would have required him to take blood-thinning medication for the rest of his life, Graham aides said.
