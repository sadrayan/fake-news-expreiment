Jake Tapper Asks Israeli Spokesman About Palestinian Children Killed In Gaza
Jake Tapper spoke to Israeli spokesman Mark Regev on Tuesday in a tense reprise of their previous discussion about Israel's conduct in Gaza.

Tapper told Regev that Israel has killed more Palestinian children in the past three weeks than "the total number of Israeli soldiers killed in military operations since 2006."

"That is a lot of dead children," he said. "At what point does the Israeli government say, enough, we're killing too many innocent children?"

"We don't want to see innocent civilians caught up in the crossfire between us and Hamas," Regev said. "It's not just the crossfire," Tapper interjected.
