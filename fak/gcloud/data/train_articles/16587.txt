Subject: Fresh urgent query, PolitiFact Texas

Hello again. I write afresh seeking Mike Collier’s backup for his claim in this tweet that no pending recapture dollars will go to public education. I tried to call a moment ago without getting through.

As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

We hope to complete this fact-check this week.

Thanks,

g.

Hi Gardner,

This is Mike’s reply that he sent me:

What I say specifically is that the increase in recapture, $500 million, does not go to any school.

If you go to page III-1 of the budget, you will see that the state funding of public education declines by $1.6 million, This is the general revenue line ($19.1B in 2018 and $17.5B in 2019). At the same time, recapture payments increase from $2.0B in 2018 to $2.5B (this is appropriated receipts in other income line). So despite higher recapture payments, overall funding is down.

The only way anyone could argue that $500 million increase in recapture payments was staying in schools would be to show an overall increase in school funding by $500 million.
