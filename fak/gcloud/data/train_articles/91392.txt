State budget impasse still hurting schools
The state's nearly two-year budget impasse continues to hurt schools' bottom lines despite the promise last summer by lawmakers and the governor to fully fund K-12 education.

The backlog of bills for the Springfield School District has reached $8 million, it's $1.3 million in Chatham, while in smaller districts, like Auburn, the figure has eclipsed $476,000.

The bills are known as categorical payments, which the state is supposed to reimburse districts for to cover costs that include transportation, state lunch requirements and special education.

But since there’s little in the state till, the Illinois comptroller cannot pay most bills on time, forcing school superintendents to rely more on stopgap measures, such as taking out a higher line of credit, selling working-cash bonds and dipping into reserves to meet payroll.

In December, the comptroller’s office released last school year’s June categorical payments, but area superintendents say they haven’t received any of the payments for the fiscal year that began July 1.

According to Jamey Dunn, spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, the first mandated categorical payments for the current fiscal year should go out in late spring.

Dunn said the comptroller’s office has prioritized general state aid payments, which school districts have been receiving.

But Matt Brue, superintendent of the PORTA School District in Petersburg, said he and other school leaders have their doubts that any of the four categorical payments due this year will be issued because of the state’s financial mess.

Also hanging over his head, Brue said, is the possibility of a local property tax freeze that Gov. Bruce Rauner touted in his budget address last week.

The prospect of no additional property tax dollars compounds an already bleak financial situation, Brue said, with school districts like his passing deficit budgets, precipitated by years of the state underfunding education.

The PORTA school board has cut spending, but Brue said he anticipates the district will still run nearly a $1 million deficit by the end of the year.

If the state doesn’t come through with any categorical payments, that deficit would double, Brue said, cutting what is now a $4 million reserve fund in half.

“It basically means we have one more year before things really start falling apart,” Brue said. “And we’ve already made all the cuts we can possibly make without decimating our curriculum and offerings to students.”

Misleading claim

School districts entered the 2016-17 school year with added hope when the state pumped more than $300 million into general state aid.

The extra money meant schools were once again funded at the statutory foundation level -- a number that has remained at $6,119 per pupil since fiscal 2010. For years, schools were pro-rated at 89 percent of the foundation level.

For Springfield, full funding means an extra $2.9 million, Ball-Chatham gets another $670,706, Rochester $406,069 more and Auburn an additional $412,776, for example.

But any gains in general state aid have been outpaced by losses in categorical payments, superintendents say.

Auburn Superintendent Darren Root said the claim the state fully funded education is misleading. What actually happened, Root said, is it simply shifted money around from other coffers to general state aid.

“They are re-arranging the chairs on the Titanic and coming up with the same dollar amount and calling it fully funded,” Root said. “The bottom line is this will never get fixed without any new revenue.”

In his budget address Wednesday, Rauner again pledged to increase education funding, noting that Republican leaders plan to introduce standalone appropriations bill for early childhood education and K-12 schools.

The governor also vowed that the state would fully fund grants for state transportation reimbursements to schools.

Root, however, is skeptical of any talk he’s heard from state officials because, he said, he’s heard it before.

While any proposals to change Illinois' education funding formula could be a step in the right direction, he added, schools will continue to struggle unless the state collects more revenue.

“Is it going to take school districts having to close their doors and not have any cash on hand for something to change?” Root said.

School districts in different shape

While all school districts are feeling the crunch, some are better off than others.

Both Springfield and Ball-Chatham passed balanced budgets this year.

Jennifer Gill, superintendent of District 186, said after a recent board meeting that the district continues to monitor the situation at the Statehouse.

If categorical payments do not arrive, she said, the district has the option of issuing working-cash bonds to cover expenses.

In Chatham, Superintendent Douglas Wood said the district has $4.3 million in the education fund and could borrow money to make ends meet if need be. Chatham also is lucky, he said, because the community continues to grow.

But like other superintendents, Wood said, he remains worried nothing will change at the state level and could get worse if a property tax freeze goes through.

“Schools have been put in a no-win situation,” he said.
