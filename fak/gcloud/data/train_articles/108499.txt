LONGVIEW, Wash. (KPTV) — Investigators in Washington State are attempting to identify the last unidentified person buried in Cowlitz County, and it’s possible the woman could be from Missouri.

Nearly 23 years after the unidentified woman was killed in a fiery crash while riding in a semi, her remains have been exhumed from an unmarked grave at the Longview Memorial Park and Cemetery in Washington state.

According to KPTV, FOX 12 in Oregon, the woman was killed in May 1991 when she was riding in a semi on Interstate 5 near Kalama, Oregon. Police said the driver, Lester Harbol, slammed into the back of a second semi that was stopped for roadway construction.

The truck burst into flames, destroying any identification she may have been carrying. Harbol was also killed.

Harbol had driven from Missouri and just dropped a load off in Tacoma. Police told Seattle station KCPQ that he had a girlfriend back in Missouri.

Washington State Patrol detectives have attempted to identify her through the years, but without definitive success.

Now, her remains have been sent to King County for facial reconstruction by a forensic anthropologist. From there, they will go to the University of Northern Texas for DNA extraction and entry into DNA databases.

“This is somebody’s sister, somebody’s daughter who has been unidentified now for over 22 years as a result of a motor vehicle collision and the Washington State Patrol would like to identify who this person is so we can notify the family,” Washington State Patrol Detective Greg Wilcoxson told KPTV.
