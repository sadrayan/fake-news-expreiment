Bill Status
To the Members of the California State Senate:



I am returning Senate Bill 1463 without my signature.



This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to prioritize areas that have increased fire hazard associated with overhead utility facilities.



Since May of last year, the Commission and CalFire have been doing just that through the existing proceeding on fire-threat maps and fire-safety regulations. This deliberative process should continue and the issues this bill seeks to address should be raised in that forum.



Sincerely,







Edmund G. Brown Jr.
