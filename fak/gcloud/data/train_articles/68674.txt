Percentage of Gun Owners for Each State
By Deborah White

Updated October 05, 2016 .

This article lists individual gun owners as a percentage of each state's population, as of 2007.

This data is relevant to national and state elections, particularly the 2012 presidential election, as it clearly explains why candidates President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney refuse to meaningfully address gun control and ownership issues, at least before the November 2012 election day: thirteen of fourteen 2012 battleground states have gun ownership rates of 30% or more.

Interestingly, all ten of the states with the highest gun ownership rates (all 50% or more) are considered staunchly Republican-red states. And nine of the ten states with the lowest gun ownership rates (all less than 30%) are considered staunchly Democratic blue states. The sole exception is Florida, a battleground state with a 24.5% gun ownership rate.
