Mission Continues
At The Mission Continues, our mission has always been about empowering veterans to serve their country in new ways. For the past six years, we have challenged our Fellows to take stock of their past, to identify their fears and to set goals, and to push the limits of their experiences as they transition home.

Itâ€™s time we do the same.

As we look to the future, rebranding offers us an opportunity to build on our progress and empower even more veterans to serve their country here at home. This website, our new logo, the new brochures and t-shirts, they are all an extension of this transition.
