Votes by Ted Cruz, Beto O’Rourke for disaster relief scrutinized as Hurricane Harvey is remembered
WASHINGTON — As the first anniversary of Hurricane Harvey’s landfall approaches, Sen. Ted Cruz has ramped up attacks on his challenger, highlighting Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s vote against a bill that included tax breaks for storm victims.

But Cruz has drawn criticism for opposing federal relief after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. His attack on O’Rourke glosses over the El Paso Democrat’s support for several other measures aimed at helping Texans recover after Harvey.

And O’Rourke has hit back, noting that Cruz sought to block some funding this year from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Disaster relief may seem like an unusual friction point for a Senate contest. But Harvey was one of the most devastating disasters in recent history. Damage tallies were second only to Hurricane Katrina. Five feet of rain fell in parts of southeast Texas.
