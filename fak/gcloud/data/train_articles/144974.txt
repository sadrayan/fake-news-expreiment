What is forbearance?
Your servicer may grant you forbearance if, for example, you recently lost your job, suffered from a disaster, or from an illness or injury that increased your health care costs. Forbearance is a type of loss mitigation.

If you are unemployed, you may qualify for assistance under Hardest Hit Fund programs that grant temporary relief to homeowners who have lost their jobs. The deadlines to apply for assistance under the Hardest Hit Fund programs vary by state .

For help in exploring your options reach out to a housing counselor. Use the CFPB's "Find a Counselor" tool to get a list of counseling agencies approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can also call the HOPEâ„¢ Hotline, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at (888) 995-HOPE (4673).
