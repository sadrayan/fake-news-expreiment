Strickland releases tax returns, asks Kasich to do same
Gov. Ted Strickland released his federal tax records today and challenged his Republican opponent to do the same, saying Ohio voters deserve that information to ensure there are no conflicts of interest.

John Kasich's campaign replied that he already has disclosed more financial information than Ohio law requires.

Gov. Ted Strickland released his federal tax records today and challenged his Republican opponent to do the same, saying Ohio voters deserve that information to ensure there are no conflicts of interest.

John Kasich's campaign replied that he already has disclosed more financial information than Ohio law requires.

Strickland and his wife, Frances, reported earning $166,321 last year, mostly from his $142,357 salary as governor and $31,668 congressional pension, records show.

The governor also produced records that showed the adjusted gross income for him and his wife was $163,135 in 2008, $163,036 in 2007 and $157,308 in 2006.

Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich, by comparison, made nearly $1.4 million in 2008, including $587,175 as a Columbus-based managing director of Lehman Brothers' investment-banking division.

Kasich's 2008 income from speaking fees alone was slightly less than the two Stricklands earned all of last year.

Although Strickland released his past four years of tax returns today -- and also released six previous years' returns when he ran in 2006 -- Kasich allowed reporters to view only his 2008 return.

Strickland challenged Kasich to release his past 10 years of returns and said at a press conference he would settle for six years. His campaign also issued an e-mail appeal to sign a petition to "demand that Congressman Kasich fully release his tax returns and details of his employment at Lehman Brothers to the public."

The Dispatch also has requested that Kasich release his tax returns for the eight years he was employed by Lehman, but the campaign said the 2008 tax filing was generally reflective of his earnings for those years and declined to release more.

The Ohio Democratic Party long has speculated that Kasich profited handsomely when Lehman collapsed, and Strickland said today that he thinks "the people of Ohio need to know if the man who would be governor was a part of that culture."

But Kasich has continually said that he was not involved in the high-level decisions that brought down Lehman, and that he lost money when the firm went under. He voluntarily released his 2008 returns to blunt attacks that he excessively profited from Lehman.

The returns showed that Kasich was paid a $182,692 salary in 2008 from Lehman, along with a $432,000 bonus and $2,250 in other benefits. The bonus, paid on Jan. 31, 2008, was for Kasich's performance in 2007.

Strickland said Kasich owes it voters to release more information to show there are no conflicts and to better explain what companies Kasich represented, what deals he was involved in, and how much he profited from his time at Lehman Brothers.

When pressed, Strickland said he was not accusing Kasich of any conflict of interest but said the public won't know unless he fully discloses his financial records.

"Given both the great honor and the great responsibility that comes with being the governor of Ohio, I believe that it is incumbent upon all candidates to be fully transparent with the people of Ohio, especially on matters of income," the governor said a press conference today.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said Kasich has reported more than he is legally required to disclose, and he criticized the state's 11 percent unemployment rate and 426,000 jobs lost since Strickland has been in office.

"If I had a record as weak as Ted Strickland's, all I would be doing is flinging mud also," Nichols said. "Rather than issuing challenges and attacking John, he should be doing his job and helping Ohioans who are hurting so deeply."

Strickland reported that he and his wife, who file a joint return, reported a federal tax liability of $21,571 with $23,598 in taxes withheld or payments, leaving them with a federal refund of $2,027.

The governor and his wife also reported that they paid $11,489 in state and local income taxes last year. They took $30,749 in charitable deductions, including $11,208 to the foundation for the Governor's Residence and garden and $3,819 to the Bureau of Public Debt for debt reduction to offset the cost of the federal-health care coverage they received.

Kasich, who lives in the Westerville area, was a member of the U.S. House from 1983 to 2001. He left Congress after a short-lived bid for president in 2000, joining Lehman and Fox News as an on-air commentator.

Kasich's tax returns show that he is a millionaire. He and his wife, Karen, who made $19,777 in 2008 primarily from investment earnings, had a combined income of $1,386,648. After deductions, they had a taxable income of $1,145,156, and paid taxes totaling $463,288. They donated $27,326 to charity.

On his 2009 financial-disclosure form filed with the Ohio Ethics Commission, Kasich reported 43 investments worth more than $1,000 as of Dec. 31, including 23 that are held as part of a living trust. Exact amounts don't have to be disclosed.

Kasich also listed 32 sources of income in 2009. His tax returns reveal that Fox News paid him $265,000 in 2008, and that among other income, he earned $121,922 in interest and dividends from investments and $165,719 in fees for speeches around the country, primarily to business audiences.

"I'm grateful that I've been blessed with good opportunities and the ability to turn them into success for my family and myself," Kasich has said in a statement about his tax return. "I hope every son of a postman can do as well, but I fear those odds are slim unless we can undo the damage that Ted Strickland has done to our economy and get Ohio back on track."

Strickland listed four sources of income besides his state salary on his 2009 financial disclosure form: his congressional retirement, interest on savings and an IRA, and a federal tax refund. His investments were the IRA and savings account.

The governor told reporters that what he is doing is "not an attack on wealth or wealthy people" but rather an effort to ensure voters can make informed decisions.

"I'm not implying that being wealthy is bad," Strickland said. "All I'm saying is, if you're seeking to be the governor of the state of Ohio, you ought to respect the voter enough to make your tax returns available to them so that they can be fully informed."

Strickland also released six years' worth of income-tax returns in 2006 when he was running for governor -- while his opponent then, Republican J. Kenneth Blackwell, declined to do so.

Strickland's previous returns showed that he and his wife had an adjusted gross income of $152,998 in 2005, largely from Strickland's congressional salary of $150,488. Strickland paid $21,431 -- 14 percent of his income -- in taxes.

The governor also has pointed out that since his election to Congress in 1992, he has declined in-term pay increases, and he and his wife have refused to accept public health-insurance benefits, paying for coverage out-of-pocket.
