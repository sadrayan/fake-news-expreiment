Ask Evan: Is it true that you can tell the gender of a bell pepper by counting the number of bumps on the bottom?
In short, no! When I saw your question I immediately emailed David Karp. He is a pomologist with UC Riverside and writes the Market Watch column for the LA Times. He explained, "The supposition that there are male and female peppers is a common canard, but untrue. Peppers grow from flowers that have both male and female parts. The fruits do not have a gender."

In short, no! When I saw your question I immediately emailed David Karp. He is a pomologist with UC Riverside and writes the Market Watch column for the LA Times.

The fruits do not have a gender.”

He attached the below pdf, which is an excerpt from The Encyclopedia of Fruits and Nuts describing the pepper’s reproductive biology. The Capsicum (pepper) entry was written by Paul Bosland who Karp describes as “arguably the world’s leading pepper scientist.”
