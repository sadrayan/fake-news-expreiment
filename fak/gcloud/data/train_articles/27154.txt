Reason Why Democrats Don‚Äôt Want Border Wall? The DNC and Clinton Foundation Both Reportedly Paid Off by Mexican Cartels

We reported earlier that the former Mexican President has been aligned with Mexican cartels. He‚Äôs accused of taking millions from the cartels ‚Äì

Former Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto accepted a $100m (¬£77m) bribe from drug cartel kingpin Joaqu√≠n ‚ÄúEl Chapo‚Äù Guzm√°n, a witness has testified.

Alex Cifuentes, who says he was a close associate of Guzm√°n for years, told a New York City courtroom that he had told authorities of the bribe in 2016. Guzm√°n is accused of being behind the Sinaloa drug cartel, which prosecutors say was the largest US drug supplier. Mr Pe√±a Nieto served as the president of Mexico from 2012 to 2018. Guzm√°n, 61, has been on trial in Brooklyn since November after he was extradited from Mexico to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs as leader of what the US has called the world‚Äôs largest drug cartel.

The timing of the former Mexican President being connected with Mexican cartels is rather significant. A former Democrat believes the real reason Democrats don‚Äôt want a wall on the US ‚Äì Mexican border is related to the story above.

Jeffrey Peterson says the real reason the Democrats will never support the border wall ‚Äì is that they are being paid off by the Mexican cartels.

Peterson may very well be right. We know that a big time lawyer for the Mexican cartels donated to Hillary Clinton. We also know that it was reported that Julian Assange reported that he had evidence that the Clinton Foundation received $15 million from the Mexican cartels. On 9 January 2017, the web site Times.com.mx published an article reporting that Mexican Drug kingpin Joaqu√≠n ‚ÄúEl Chapo‚Äù Guzm√°n had donated millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign, claiming that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had broken the news.

Don‚Äôt forget el chapo donated 15 million ( that we know about) to the Clinton cartel foundation before his transfer to the US ‚Äî rahm (@alongadingdong) January 27, 2019

No wonder the Democrats don‚Äôt want a wall. They reportedly are receiving money from the cartels to leave the border open!
