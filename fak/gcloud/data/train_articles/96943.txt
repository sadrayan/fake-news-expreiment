Wyomingâ€™s Congresswoman wants to reform the Endangered Species Act.
In September a Congressional subcommittee will hold a hearing in Casper as Congress takes another crack at reforming the Endangered Species Act.

Wyoming Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis has for years been supportive of reforming the ESA. While she is quick to acknowledge that it has been a good law, Lummis is frustrated that once something gets on the endangered species list it rarely comes off. She joins Bob Beck to discuss this.
