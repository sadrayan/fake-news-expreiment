Thomas Rid
Background and Education

Thomas Rid is a Professor of Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS and brings more than a decade of experience in international security and intelligence studies. He previously served as a Professor of Security Studies in the Department of War Studies at King’s College London, where he developed a Cyber Security module that bridged the gap between technological and political debates.



Rid has published numerous articles and books, most recently Rise of the Machines (2016), a history of how cybernetics, a vintage theory of machines, came to incite anarchy and war. Among his books are Cyber War Will Not Take Place (2013), Understanding Counterinsurgency (2010), and War and Media Operations (2007). His article, “Attributing Cyber Attacks,” in the Journal of Strategic Studies explored the identification of network breaches. He closely tracked the election interference in 2016, and was one of the first named sources to call out the hack-and-leak as a Russian intelligence operation, only one day after details became public.



Rid has recently shared his expertise on information security through testimony before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as insights on intelligence with the German Bundestag and the UK Parliament.



He has held positions at the RAND Corporation in Washington, the Institut Français des Relations Internationales in Paris, and served as a visiting scholar at Hebrew University and Shalem Center in Jerusalem. From 2007 to 2008, Rid served as a Visiting Scholar at the Center for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins SAIS. He holds a PhD and MA in Social Science from Humboldt University in Berlin.
