Boy’s Body Discovered at New Mexico Compound Where 11 Malnourished Children Were Found
The body of a young boy has been found at a compound in New Mexico where 11 malnourished children were discovered last week living without fresh water or plumbing , the authorities announced on Tuesday.

While the authorities said they were waiting for positive identification of the child, Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe of Taos County noted that the body was found on Monday, which would have been the fourth birthday of Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, a Georgia boy whose disappearance last December eventually led the authorities to the compound in Amalia, N.M.

Sheriff Hogrefe said at a news conference on Tuesday that the body had been discovered in an inner part of the compound at about 11 a.m. Monday, after they received information that led them to believe the child may still have been on the property. He declined to provide further information, citing the continuing investigation.

Donald Gallegos, the eighth judicial district attorney, said that each of the five adults found on the compound, including Abdul-Ghani’s father, Siraj Wahhaj, is facing 11 third-degree felony charges of child abuse. The charge carries up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine, he said.
