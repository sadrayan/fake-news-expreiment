Is St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch Helping Raise Money for Ofc. Darren Wilson?
A clear conflict of interest

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch

In what seems to be a serious conflict of interest, a T-shirt being sold to raise money for officer Darren Wilson, who gunned down unarmed teenager Michael Brown in a Ferguson street last month, appears to be associated with the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney, Robert P. McCulloch; here’s the page for the T-shirt: I SUPPORT OFFICER D. WILSON | Teespring.

“I SUPPORT OFFICER D. WILSON” is an officer inspired design to show support for officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri. Donations from purchases will be divided between a fund set up for Officer Wilson at gofundme.com as well as The BackStoppers Inc. organization which can be visited at backstoppers.org for more information.

And at the website of backstoppers.org, we find that the Vice President of this company is none other than Robert McCulloch:

According to an article at stltoday.com, McCulloch is now actually the President of Backstoppers, Inc.

McCulloch joined former St. Louis County Police Chief Ron Battelle in accepting a $292,000 check from the 27th annual Budweiser Guns ‘N Hoses event earlier today at city hall in St. Louis. McCulloch also will be serving as president of the board for Backstoppers in the 50th anniversary year of his father’s death.
