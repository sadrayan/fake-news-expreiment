Research on Socio-Economic Policy (ReSEP)
RESEP

RESEP is a group of researchers in the Department of Economics at the University of Stellenbosch. It developed around a long-term research focus on issues of poverty, income distribution, social mobility, economic development and social policy. This was further stimulated when Servaas van der Berg in 2008 became the South African National Research Chair in the Economics of Social Policy, financially supported by theNational Research Foundation (NRF). This led to further consolidation of research work in this area.
