Punjab Halal Development Agency
Since the original concept of Halal products is based on the divine law, “O Mankind eat what is available on the Earth but Halal & Tayab”. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and standardize shariah guidelines, principles, rules & regulations for the Research & Development of Halal businesses at local and global markets.

There is emerging segment of Halal Trade of 2.77 trillion estimated global value in the global markets, which is expanding rapidly under diversified areas of trade including Halal financing, tourism, hoteling, food beverages and personal care, etc. The Halal products especially food & beverages etc. are developed on the value chain basis (i.e.) production, processing and marketing.

The creation of PHDA has been termed a step toward making Pakistan as Halal hub by opening new vistas for entering the global Halal market while serving the domestic consumer market. The demand for healthy and safe agro-livestock food products is increasing rapidly with increasing population growth rate and socio-economic conditions. This will also open up new economic opportunities and employment for the youth and traders. PHDA, being a leading entity of government of the Punjab is established to prescribe standards and processes for Halal Certification of food & non-food sector in line with research and advanced laboratory testing facilities.
