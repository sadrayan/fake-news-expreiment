VINCI Construction Grands Projets
TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

The main technical challenge of the project was the marine subsoil in the area, which is not favourable for large-scale construction. To a depth of 60 metres below sea level, the subsoil consists chiefly of a cohesionless clay layer that is too soft for construction purposes sometimes mixed with sandy and silt-laden soil. Layers of rocky soil are to be found 500 metres below the subsoil. The only viable technical solution was to build piers with wide supporting caissons resting on the seabed. In addition, we had to reinforce the subsoil to a depth of 20 metres to ensure that the structures would withstand a potential 2-metre shift in the event of an earthquake. By strengthening the subsoil, we ensured that the piers would absorb the seismic shocks rather than collapse.

To build the bridge, each pier in the subsoil was reinforced with 25 to 30-metre hollow steel tubes entrenched in a layer of ballast. The supporting caissons, which are 90 metres in diameter, are the largest ever built. The piers can absorb seismic shocks that otherwise would make them tumble.

The deck was designed to swing to accommodate seismic movement. It is not anchored to the piers but is instead suspended from the cable stays. The deck is connected to the top of each pier by fuse restrainers designed to act as a rigid link to protect the bridge from the regionâ€™s strong winds and by dampers. In the event of an earthquake, the fuse restrainers yield, allowing the dampers to dissipate seismic energy and minimise movement.
