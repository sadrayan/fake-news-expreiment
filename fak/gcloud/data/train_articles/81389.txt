U.S. Senator for Virginia
Kaine Statement on Release of Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement today:

“I applaud the public release of the negotiated version of the Trans-Pacific trade pact. Contrary to claims that this is a ‘secret deal,’ the text is being made available – significantly earlier than required – for all to review and analyze in the coming months before it is subject to a vote in both houses of Congress. I look forward to having extensive dialogue with Virginians about the provisions of the deal.”
