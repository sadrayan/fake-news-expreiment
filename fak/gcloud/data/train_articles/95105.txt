What is Basel III?

Developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) in 2010, Basel III is an internationally agreed-upon set of reform measures to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital. Basel III is the latest in a series of bank capital standards issued by the Basel Committee. The first set of capital standards, known as Basel I, was published by the Basel Committee in 1988. Basel II was published in 2004.

Basel III increases the quality and quantity of regulatory capital through measures including, but not limited to, the following: increasing minimum risk-based capital ratios and introducing a new common equity risk-based capital ratio; introducing capital buffers above the minimum risk-based capital ratios; limiting the types of instruments that qualify as capital for regulatory purposes; introducing new regulatory adjustments to and deductions from capital, which focus regulatory capital on tangible common equity; increasing the capital charge for a certain types of assets, exposures and transactions; and introducing a leverage ratio that takes into account both on- and off-balance sheet assets and exposures.



What is the Basel Committee?

The Basel Committee is a committee of central banks and bank regulators from 27 major industrialized countries that meet under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland to develop bank capital and other regulatory standards and guidelines. The Basel Committee includes representatives from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The Basel Committee's standards and guidelines are not treaties and are not legally binding, but they are backed by the commitments of the senior officials who are members of the Basel Committee to implement those standards and guidelines in their home jurisdictions. The Basel Committee's capital standards are implemented in all major jurisdictions, including the U.S. and EU.
