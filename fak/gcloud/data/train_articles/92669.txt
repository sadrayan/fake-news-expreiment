Bill Nelson: time to work on bipartisan fixes to Obamacare
WASHINGTON - With the Senate health care bill in tatters, Sen. Bill Nelson said Tuesday it's time to work on bipartisan fixes to the Affordable Care Act, and floated an idea he contends could reduce premiums in Florida by13 percent.

"I'm working with Susan Collins right now," the Democrat told reporters. "In the case of the insurance company that has a catastrophic loss, you create a reinsurance fund. You insure the insurance company against the catastrophe. Same thing we did in Florida on hurricanes."

Collins, R-Maine, said earlier today: "I do not think that it is going to be constructive to repeal a law that at this point is so interwoven within our health care system and then hope that over the next two years we will come up with some kind of replacement. I think that would create great anxiety ..."

Nelson said the public backlash to the GOP health care effort has been overwhelming, describing his travels across Florida in recent days.

"People are coming out of the woodwork," he said. "People are begging, 'Please don't let them take away my health care.' People are on to this. They know what's happening."
