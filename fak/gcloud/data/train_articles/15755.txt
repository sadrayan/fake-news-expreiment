Gary Cobb was entrusted as lead trial lawyer, and Gary (and his trial team, other attorneys, investigators and support staff—that is, “we”) won the trial. The jury convicted Tom DeLay in 2010, the Republican court of appeals did not overturn his conviction until 2013. DeLay was a convicted felon during that time. Gary was not the appellate lawyer, which was another team. Trial lawyers often win a trial, and then that result might get overturned on appeal. That doesn’t mean that the trial lawyers didn’t win the trial. Newspapers reported then, and have since reported the historical fact that Tom DeLay was convicted and that Gary Cobb was the prosecutor in a criminal trial in a Travis County District Court.
