Tracking all of President Trump’s false or misleading claims
“The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover, Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!” Fact Check: The special counsel investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign and obstruction of justice continues, and no conclusions have been announced. All aspects of the investigation have widely been covered by the media and there's no evidence to suggest that it is a "witch hunt." The Justice Department inspector general's report suggests the texts slipped through the cracks but were not deliberately deleted. While the messages were initially not captured, they have since been recovered. There is no evidence Strzok and Page tried to prevent the FBI from collecting their texts, the report said.

“You know, we passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country.” Fact Check: Trump’s tax cut would be nearly 0.9 percent of the gross domestic product, meaning it would be far smaller than President Ronald Reagan’s tax cut in 1981, which was 2.89 percent of GDP. Trump’s tax cut, if enacted in law, would be the eighth largest tax cut — and even smaller than two tax cuts passed under Barack Obama.

“The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a 'profit making operation.'” Fact Check: Countries do not "lose" or make money on trade deficits. Trump is citing figures for trades in goods, but not including services. The United States had a trade deficit of $64 billion with Mexico when services are included. What's more important is the overall level of trade. U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico totaled an estimated $615.9 billion in 2017. Exports were $276.2 billion; imports were $339.8 billion. According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. exports of goods and services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.2 million jobs in 2015.

“We've helped them a lot by creating one of the greatest economies -- maybe the best economy this country has ever had.” Fact Check: Trump can be pleased with the state of the economy but calling it the “greatest ever” goes way too far, as it can’t top the late 1990s or the stellar growth in parts of the 1940s, 1960s and 1980s, according to key data. Wage growth is also disappointing compared with what it was in prior boom times, and the deficit has also surged, which experts warn could be a drag on the economy for years to come.

“We want to have strong borders in the United States. The Democrats don't want to let us have strong borders -- only for one reason. You know why? Because I want it.” Fact Check: Democrats generally do not advocate for illegal immigration, and have repeatedly put forth immigration bills that both include a DACA solution and new border security measures. It's silly for Trump to claim they "don't mind crime." Plus, as we've previously reported, most independent research contradicts the idea that illegal immigrants bring more crime.

“If you look at the employment and unemployment numbers for African Americans, for Asian Americans, for Hispanic Americans, they're at a historic high. … You look at all of the employment and unemployment numbers, they're doing the best they've ever done.” Fact Check: The black and Hispanic unemployment rates have been calculated only since 1972, so it's an exaggeration to say the current numbers are the lowest in history. The U.S. jobless rate for Asians has been around for less than 20 years. Although the black unemployment rate was at an all-time-low 5.9 percent in May, it had risen to 6 percent in September. That was still significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate of 3.7 percent.

“We cannot continue to lose $500 billion a year to China.” Fact Check: Trump claims to "know every stat" about China, but then goes on to mangle a basic fact: the size of the trade deficit. The U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China was $335.4 billion in 2017. Trump often uses $500 billion, which accounts only for goods and not services.
