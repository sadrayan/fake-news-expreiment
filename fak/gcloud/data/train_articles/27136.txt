Tlaib and Omar Co-sponsor Bill to Recognize Muslim Holidays as Federal Holidays
Freshman Congressmen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have wasted no time in shaking up the US House of Representatives. Early Friday morning, Omar and Tlaib introduced a bill adding Islamic holidays to the Federal calendar which has traditionally only recognized American holidays.

Omar and Tlaib’s bill would add Eid Al-Fitr at the end of Ramadan and the four-day-long celebration of Eid Al-Adha to the list of Federally recognized holidays, potentially granting reasons to banks, schools, and other businesses to remain closed for five additional days per year.

Omar and Tlaib justified their work as making America more inclusive of it’s Muslim-American population and moving us further away from our history as a primarily Christian nation. The women are also considering a last minute addition to their bill that would allow for regular Salah time breaks for school children and workers as well as a designated area in each public business where Muslims could perform Salah, the five daily prayers plus the Friday prayer, unmolested.

The House of Representatives Majority Leader, Steny Hoyer, is reviewing the legislation and determining if he can get the votes to pass the bill. Anonymous sources say Omar and Tlaib are threatening court action if Hoyer should choose not to acquiesce to their demands for immediate vote and consideration on the grounds of religious discrimination.

We predict that the next thing we can expect from this pair of women will be Sharia Law appearing as a rider to their legislation. Perhaps they should have stayed in the countries that they came from if they enjoyed Islamic culture so much!
