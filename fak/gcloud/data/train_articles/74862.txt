Sen. Cruz Files Amendments to Democrats Senate Budget
WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) today filed several amendments to the budget proposed by Senate Democrats, most notably an amendment to repeal Obamacare.

“Obamacare was passed with many promises and yet the reality is, it has not delivered. It is hurting young people, seniors, Hispanics, African-Americans, single moms and it’s hurting the economy. It should be repealed,” Sen. Cruz said. “I am proud that Senate Republicans once again stood united and unanimously voted to undo this devastating legislation. Our economy is stagnant right now – last quarter is was 0.1 percent – and sadly, every Democrat who voted, voted to continue implementing Obamacare even as the economy is gasping for breath. We must continue to revisit efforts to defund and repeal Obamacare to prevent the kind of impact that could send this country backwards into a recession, particularly at a time when so many are struggling.”

Eliminating corporate welfare

Scholarships for school choice

Limiting federal ownership of state lands

Transferring foreign aid from Egypt to U.S. missile defense

Creating a private right of action to challenge costly federal regulations

Prohibiting millionaires from receiving welfare

Restoring labor regulation to the states

“Bloomberg Big Gulp Amendment” prohibiting federal regulation of food and beverage size and quantity

“Finally after four years of an unwillingness to show any leadership on one of the most important responsibilities of Congress – to draft and approve a budget for the trillions of American tax dollars collected by the government every year – the Senate Democrats have brought a budget up for a vote. Unfortunately, it blatantly ignores the crucial need to lower taxes and reduce spending, adding $5.2 trillion in deficits, increasing spending by $645 billion an adding $1.5 trillion in taxes over ten years,” said Sen. Cruz. “We must start taking steps to restore economic growth, and the first step is to repeal Obamacare in its entirety. I am pleased to offer additional amendments that address and prioritize conservative principles that fortify Americans’ liberties and restrain an ever-encroaching federal government.”
