The Recovery Act
Page Content

On February 13, 2009, in direct response to the economic crisis and at the urging of President Obama, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- commonly referred to as the "stimulus" or the "stimulus package." Four days later, the President signed the Recovery Act into law. The three immediate goals of the Recovery Act are:

Create new jobs and save existing ones

Spur economic activity and invest in long-term growth

Foster unprecedented levels of accountability and transparency in government spending

The Recovery Act intended to achieve those goals by providing $787 billion in:

Tax cuts and benefits for millions of working families and businesses

Funding for entitlement programs, such as unemployment benefits

Funding for federal contracts, grants and loans

In 2011, the original expenditure estimate of $787 billion was increased to $840 billion to be in line with the President's 2012 budget and with scoring changes made by the Congressional Budget Office since the enactment of the Recovery Act.

To achieve the goal of transparency, the Act requires recipients of Recovery funds to report every January, April, July, and October on how they are using the money. All the data â€‹is posted on Recovery.gov so the public can track the Recovery funds.

In addition to offering financial aid directly to local school districts, expanding the Child Tax Credit, and underwriting the computerization of health records, the Recovery Act is targeted at infrastructure development and enhancement. For instance, the Act provides for the weatherizing of 75 percent of federal buildings and more than one million private homes.

Construction and repair of roads and bridges as well as scientific research and the expansion of broadband and wireless service are being funded.

There is no end date written into the Recovery Act because, while many of Recovery Act projects are focused on jumpstarting the economy, others are expected to contribute to economic growth for many years.
