Conflict of Interest: As City Press editor: He was found to have direct interests in a public relations company Rainbow Kwanda Communications that was paid millions by the Mpumalanga government to rectify its scandal-ridden reputation at the time.

Mona published a story handed to him by former Sunday Times journalist Ranjeni Munusamy (after being rejected by then Sunday Times editor Mathata Tsedu) alleging that former public prosecutions director Bulelani Ngcuka was an apartheid spy. This led to the Hefer Commission of Inquiry of 2003 where Judge Hefer found the allegations against Ngcuka to have no factual basis and stated that, with regard to Vusi Mona, “The result was that, when the cross-examination ended, his credibility had been reduced to nil.” and “I am satisfied that he has discredited himself to such a degree in the newspaper community, that he will not find it easy to procure employment in that field again.”

Mona eventually resigned as editor of the City Press due to his public relations links.

Recent reports have alleged that Mona has been involved in a bribery scheme where his company Rainbow Kwanda Communications paid a substantial amount of money to provincial officials in order to secure a R32 million public relations tender from the Mpumalanga Government during 2003.
