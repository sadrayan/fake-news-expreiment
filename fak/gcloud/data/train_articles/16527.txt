Hello again on behalf of the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project. Mindful of your work as cited here, I write today seeking the latest available institute information on how Texas ranks in health insurance coverage.

We are trying to assess this recent candidate claim: “One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S.”

Is this accurate? Why or why not? Other research recommendations?

I’d be grateful to hear back by phone or email. As ever, we rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

Thanks,

g.

See table 6 in https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.pdf. It shows that 16.6% of Texans were uninsured in 2016 (the most recent year we have data for – 2017 data comes out in Sept). it is the most uninsured state according to the table.
