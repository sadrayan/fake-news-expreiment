Indiana Congressional Intern says Speaker Paul Ryan is not to bl - Fox 28: South Bend, Elkhart IN News, Weather, Sports
At first glance, it just looks like House Speaker Paul Ryan snapped a quick pic using his selfie stick, after he spoke to congressional interns in Washington D.C. The picture -- taken Saturday -- is going viral, for what's NOT in the picture.

Ryan posted the picture on the his official Instagram account with the caption: â€œI think this sets a record for the most number of #CapitolHill interns in a single selfie. #SpeakerSelfie."

Many have criticized Ryan because there are very few minority interns in the picture, leading people creating and using #GOPsoWhite on Twitter -- referencing the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, which criticized the lack of diversity in the 2016 Academy Award nominees.

I skyped with RJ Khalaf, an intern under Indiana Representative Andre Carson from Washington, who says Ryan's speech was part of the Congressional Summer Intern Lecture Series, and adds the picture has both democrat and republican interns in attendance. However, Ryan shouldn't be the one everyone is pointing the finger at. Khalaf says, "People of color just don't have access to these high level internships like internships on the hill. This is a by-product of our society. This is what we as a society have to do to make an inclusive society for all. The hill is super white, and that's just something we have to address."

Khalaf says there was limited capacity to see Ryan's speech, so interns entered a lottery, where their names were randomly selected. Khalaf says he did enter the lottery, but Khalaf was not chosen.
