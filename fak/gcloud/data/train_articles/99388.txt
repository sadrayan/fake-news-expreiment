Massachusetts Police Confiscate Public’s Guns, Repeal 2nd Amendment
The Second Amendment has been repealed in Massachusetts as police officers begin confiscating guns and weapons from law-abiding American citizens.

This week, Governor Charlie Baker signed a bill giving police new powers allowing them to confiscate guns “at their own discretion,” without the need for due process.Under the new legislation, law enforcers are legally allowed to raid an individual’s home and confiscate their weapons, whether they committed a crime or not.
