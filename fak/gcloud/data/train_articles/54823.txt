Newsroom Statement on Trump Lifting Sanctions on Putin’s Intelligence Thugs

Washington, D.C. – Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the following statement after President Trump lifted sanctions on the FSB, the Russian Federal Security Service and successor to the KGB:

“U.S. intelligence agencies have thoroughly detailed the Russian security services’ brazen assault on American democracy in support of candidate Donald Trump. Less than two weeks after walking into the White House, President Trump lifts sanctions on the Russian Security Service. Vladimir Putin’s thugs meddle with an American election, and President Trump gives them a thank you present.

“I have been asking the same question for a while: what do the Russians have on President Trump? The FBI must accelerate their investigation into the financial, personal and political ties between Donald Trump and Russia. President Trump’s reckless and dangerous agenda is jeopardizing America’s national security.

“With every day that passes, the need for a bipartisan, independent, outside commission to investigate Russia’s intervention in our election becomes clearer and more urgent. We must understand how Russia hacked into our democratic institutions, and ensure it never happens again.”
