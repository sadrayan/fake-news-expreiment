Kelli Ward Senate run: Arizona senator seeking McCain's US Senate seat to step down
PHOENIX - Arizona state Sen. Kelli Ward is set to formally resign her seat to focus on her Republican primary challenge to U.S. Sen. John McCain.

Ward says in a letter to Senate President Andy Biggs that she will vacate her seat on Tuesday. The Dec. 2 letter says she plans to devote her energy to defeating the five-term senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee.

Ward is a physician from Lake Havasu City whose current district spans much of Mohave and all of La Paz counties.

Rep. Sonny Borrelli says he's hoping he's chosen to fill the remainder of Ward's term by the Mohave County Board of Supervisors. He's already running for the Senate seat next year.

Mohave County Republican Party leaders will forward three names to the board for consideration.
