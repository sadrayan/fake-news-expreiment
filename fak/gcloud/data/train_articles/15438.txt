Abbott claims there were "no problems whatsoever."

But throughout early vote and on election day, there were reports, some even covered by the media, where voters were disenfranchised. This list of voters includes Speaker Jim Wright and 117th District Court Judge Sandra Watts. Additionally, I have attached three separate lawsuits that have been filed as a result of the Voter ID law. Each lawsuit contains a list of people who are disenfranchised by the law. With all of this evidence of problems as a result of Voter ID, either Gregg Abbott doesn't care, or he is too incompetent to understand the ramifications of the law he defends and supports.

"I haven't ever seen anything that was overhyped as much as some partisan efforts to overhype concerns about this when, in reality, there has been no problems whatsoever," said Abbott, who defended the voter ID law in court.
