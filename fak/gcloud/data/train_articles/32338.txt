CLEVELAND, Ohio - When it comes to Ohio's jobs count in comparison to national trends, Gov. John Kasich's current term is a lot like the four years under his predecessor, Ted Strickland.

But in both cases, like every other period as long as Ohio has been electing governors to four-year terms starting 60 years ago, Ohio has done worse than the nation as a whole.

Ohio consistently has gained jobs at a slower rate than the country or - in bad times - lost jobs faster than the nation, when averaged during each gubernatorial term, cleveland.com research of federal jobs data found.

Ohio would have another 113,000 jobs if growth followed the national rate since Kasich began his second term in 2015. The gap was 105,000 during Strickland's term, when jobs numbers fell both nationally and in Ohio.

Yet, both terms under Kasich and the one term under the Strickland have been better versus the national trends than the 12 years before them - two terms under Bob Taft and the final term of George Voinovich.

More detailed data is below for each recent governor, but first some context.
