UT Brownsville Campus Closed By Cross-Border Gunfire
BROWNSVILLE (September 5, 2009)—The campus of the University of Texas Brownsville and Texas Southmost College will remain closed through the long Labor Day weekend after bullets from a shooting on the Mexican side of the border early Friday afternoon struck a wall of a recreation center and a car.

No one was injured, but the campus was closed down after the shooting.

An emergency posting on the school’s Web site says the campus, the new library and labs will be closed until Tuesday and classes have been canceled until Tuesday.

Soccer games scheduled Saturday were moved to the Brownsville Sports Park.

The shooting began around 1:30 p.m. Friday.

Area residents told The Brownsville Herald they heard gunshots and loud explosions for more than an hour.

Brownsville is across from Matamoros, Mexico.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection Field Supervisor Eddie Perez says there were no plans to close any of the international bridges between Brownsville and Matamoros.

The school, which serves more than 12,000 students, has been part of the University of Texas System since 1991.
