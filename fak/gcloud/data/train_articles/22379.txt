Secretary ExxonMobil? Reject Rex Tillerson!
Message

* Subject:

Dear [Decision Maker],

I urge you to oppose Donald Trump's appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.





* Personalize your message The secretary of state should represent the best interests of the American people -- not those of a major international corporation. ExxonMobil has engaged in a massive, long-term effort to hide evidence of climate change, and has pushed for expanded fracking despite its proven harm to our water and communities. More than ever, we need uncompromising leadership to protect our food, water and environment, and to safeguard our democracy from regressive policies that benefit only billionaires and multi-national corporations. I hope you'll provide that leadership and oppose the confirmation of Rex Tillerson.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
