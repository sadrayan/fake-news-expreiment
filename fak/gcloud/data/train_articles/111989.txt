The Austrian government arrived in Brussels on Wednesday to present the program of Austria’s presidency to the European Council. "Russia plays a crucial role in providing safety and stability in Europe and around the world, which is why Austria will direct its efforts to continue EU-Russia relations basing on five principles, and to strengthen the dialogue between Russia and the EU," the Austrian government’s program states.
