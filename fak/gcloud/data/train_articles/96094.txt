A long-term solution on transportation
Today, I am proud to stand with Governor Bob McDonnell to propose a bold and comprehensive long-term solution to Virginiaâ€™s transportation funding needs.

This package dedicates $3.1 billion in additional funding over the next five years and eliminates the need for crossover funding.

This is not a patchwork solution. This plan allows us to make the critical investments in our infrastructure that will keep Virginia competitive in a global 21st century economy.

Without a solid infrastructure, customers can not get to businesses, employees cannot get to work and businesses cannot transport their goods. By investing in transportation, we are renewing our commitment to creating jobs and making our state the most attractive place for business in the world. Simply, this is about jobs.

I enthusiastically support this plan and am looking forward to working with the Governor and Senate leaders on its passage.
