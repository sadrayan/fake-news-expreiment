American voters say 48 - 38 percent that the government could use the information from universal background checks to confiscate legally-owned guns, but voters still support universal gun background checks 91 - 8 percent, including 88 - 11 percent among voters in households with guns, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.





Gun owners believe 53 - 34 percent that universal background checks could lead to confiscation of legal guns, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds.





Support for same-sex marriage has reached a 50 percent milestone, with American voters in favor 50 - 41 percent, compared to 47 - 43 percent in a March 8 Quinnipiac University survey and a dramatic shift in public attitudes on the subject from July, 2008, when voters opposed such unions 55 - 36 percent.





Voters say 56 - 36 percent that the legality of same-sex marriage should be based on the U.S. Constitution rather than on laws in each state.





American voters are strongly opposed, 70 - 28 percent, to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plan to limit the size of sugary soft drinks to 16 ounces. Voters do support 59 - 39 percent Bloomberg's idea to require stores to keep cigarettes out of public sight to discourage smoking by young people.





"In every Quinnipiac University poll since the Newtown massacre, nationally and in six states, we find overwhelming support, including among gun owners, for universal background checks," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "American voters agree with the National Rifle Association, however, that these background checks could lead someday to confiscation of legally-owned guns."





"The question is how many of these voters fear confiscation as an abuse of government power and how many are hoping the government uses confiscation to get more guns off the street," Brown added.





Expecting gun confiscation are Republicans 61 - 25 percent and independent voters 51 - 36 percent, while Democrats say 54 - 32 percent there will not be confiscation. Men say confiscation is likely 52 - 37 percent and women agree 45 - 38 percent.





Health Care Reform





Americans voters disapprove 46 - 41 percent of "ObamaCare," the 2010 health care reform act, and say 37 - 15 percent the health care law will hurt rather than help them personally. Another 41 percent say the law won't affect them.





Increasing the number of people in their state eligible for Medicaid is a good idea, voters say 48 - 41 percent. Democrats say good idea 71 - 19 percent while Republicans say bad idea 65 - 24 percent, with independent voters divided 45 - 44 percent.





Immigration





Illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for citizenship, 59 percent of voters say, while 11 percent say they should be allowed to stay, but not apply for citizenship, and 25 percent say they should be required to leave the U.S.





Opposition to Bloomberg's proposed "Big Gulp Ban" is strong among all groups, except Hispanic voters who are divided 48 - 50 percent.





Support for the hidden cigarette proposal is small among some groups, but no group is opposed. There is a large gender gap as men are divided, with 50 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed, while women support it 66 - 32 percent. Voters 18 to 34 years old support the idea 70 - 28 percent with support dropping to 57 - 41 percent among voters over 55 years old.





"Mayor Michael Bloomberg gets one win and one big loss in his latest public health initiatives," said Brown.





From March 26 - April 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,711 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.4 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.





The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia and the nation as a public service and for research.
