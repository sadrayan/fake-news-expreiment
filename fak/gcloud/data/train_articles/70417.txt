House passes bill to ban smoking in cars with minors
Smoking in vehicles with people under age 19 would be banned under a bill that passed the Alabama House of Representatives tonight.

Rep. Rolanda Hollis, D-Birmingham, said she got the idea for the bill after riding in her husband's truck for a "date night."

Hollis said her intent was not to tell adults they can't smoke but to protect children who don't have any choice about riding in a confined space with a smoker.

"It's all about the health and safety of the children," Hollis said.

Violations would result in a fine of up to $100.

The House passed her bill by a vote of 41-30.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, eight states and Puerto Rico have restrictions on smoking in vehicles with minors. The states vary on the ages at which the bans apply.

California, Oregon and Puerto Rico, under 18

Maine and Utah, under 16

Arkansas, under 14

Louisiana, under 13

Vermont, under 9

Virginia, under 8

Hollis said her husband has stopped smoking in his truck.
