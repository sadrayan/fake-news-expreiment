Doug Jones, the Alabama Democrat who is angling for a Senate seat, released Wednesday a new ad that features the names and photos of the women who have accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct.

The ad lists out the names of Moore's accusers, who were all teenagers at the time of the alleged incidents: Leigh Corfman, Beverly Young Nelson, Debbie Wesson Gibson, Gloria Thacker Deason, Gena Richardson, Wendy Miller and Kelly Harrison Thorp.

"They were girls when Roy Moore immorally pursued them. Now they are women, witnesses to us all of his disturbing conduct," the ad says.

It then ends with a stark message: "Will we make their abuser a U.S. senator?"

The video is the latest ad from Jones' campaign that point to the sexual harassment and assault allegations against Moore. Earlier this week, the campaign released an ad that features disparaging quotes from Ivanka Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sen. Richard Shelby.

Moore has vehemently denied the allegations and continued to stay in Senate race for the seat once occupied by Jeff Sessions.
