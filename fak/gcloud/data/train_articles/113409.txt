Letters of Support for Procter & Gamble



August 16, 1999 To Whom It May Concern: There is no truth to the rumor that the CEO of Procter & Gamble appeared on the Sally速 Show and embraced satanism. Nothing about this rumor is true. Please do not send any money to the Sally速 Show or request a videotape, as this is a complete hoax.

August 6, 1999 To Whom It May Concern: It has come to our attention there is a rumor that the President of Procter & Gamble appeared on The Jenny Jones Show速 discussing satanism. This is absolutely untrue. Neither the President of P&G;, nor any other representative of P&G;, has ever appeared on The Jenny Jones Show速. I encourage anyone who hears of such a rumor to let people know this never happened.

April 5, 1995 To Whom It May Concern: It seems impossible that the rumor of an appearance by the President of Procter & Gamble on DONAHUE is still circulating after more than a decade. There is absolutely nothing to this rumor. The president of P&G; has never appeared on DONAHUE, nor has any other P&G; executive. Anyone who claims to have seen such a broadcast is either mistaken or lying. It never happened!
