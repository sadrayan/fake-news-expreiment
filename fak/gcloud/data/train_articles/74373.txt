Top condoms

Last reviewed: February 2010

We tested more than 500 samples of 22 condom models. An outside lab inflated them like balloons until they burst to test for strength and reliability. They also submerged them in saline solution zapped with electricity to check for holes. All passed our minimum requirements based on standards for reliability, holes, and packaging. but some of them held a lot more air than others before exploding—as much as 45 liters (the equivalent of about 23 party-size bottles of Coke!). models that aced the test are listed below in price order. Also, we didn't find a single hole or tear in any of our Smart picks; industry standards allow for a certain number of defects per batch.

LifeStyles Ultra Sensitive

LifeStyles Ultra Sensitive

Price per condom

71 cents (12 per box)

Why we like it

A nice combination of performance and simplicity, this untextured, unadorned model is a solid choice for couples who want a plain, reliable condom. It's among the thinnest we tested, possibly a plus if you're looking for extra sensitivity.

LifeStyles Warming Pleasure

LifeStyles Warming Pleasure

Price per condom

75 cents (12 per box)

Why we like it

Warming lubricant is claimed to heat up on contact. (It contains acacia honey, an ingredient in some "warming" or "tingling" adult products.) It's also described as thin, but it was about average in thickness.

Trojan Ultra Thin

Trojan Ultra Thin

Price per condom

84 cents (12 per box)

Why we like it

It's even thinner than the Lifestyles Ultra Sensitive but no less strong—and not to be confused with the Trojan ThinTensity (80 cents), which we also tested and is also a fine choice.

Trojan Magnum

Trojan Magnum

Price per condom

86 cents (12 per box)

Why we like it

A good choice for larger men, this condom was among the widest we tested. And it comes in a manly black box that any guy would be proud to present at the checkout counter.

Durex Performax

Durex Performax

Price per condom

96 cents (12 per box)

Why we like it

This condom is thinner than most and the lubricant on the inside contains benzocaine, a mild numbing ingredient that is marketed as a way to delay a man's climax. (No, we didn't test that.)

Trojan Her Pleasure Ecstasy

Trojan Her Pleasure Ecstasy

Price per condom

$1.10 (10 per box)

Why we like it

Creative design: It gets wider toward the tip, which may provide more comfort for the guy. And it's ribbed all around the base (the "her pleasure" part).

Trojan Ultra Ribbed Ecstasy

Trojan Ultra Ribbed Ecstasy

Price per condom

$1.10 (10 per box))

Why we like it

It's identical in shape to the Trojan Her pleasure ecstasy but with even more ribs, which are not just around the base but also around the top.

Not So Hot Night Light Glow-in-the-Dark Yes, it glowed in the dark but it was the weakest we tested: Fewer than half of the samples made it to 25 liters of air before exploding, which might mean a greater risk of breaking during use. And too many had holes.
