This 'masturbation booth' just popped up in NYC
A sex toy company created a tiny male masturbation fort in New York City. No, we don't condone it.

On Tuesday, Hot Octopuss erected what it called a "GuyFi" booth on 28th Street and 5th Avenue in New York City, where men could, in theory, go to "relieve stress."

The company simply put a cloth over a phone booth in what amounted to a marketing gimmick. Inside was a chair and a laptop.

Hot Octopuss was inspired by a Time Out survey, which concluded that 39% of the New York men it questioned admitted to masturbating while at work. A more expansive Glamour survey of 1,000 men in 2012 suggested 31% of its readers have done so.

Hot Octopuss created the booth so men can "take this habit out of the office and into a more suitable environment designed to give the busy Manhattan man the privacy, and the high-speed Internet connection, he deserves."

"We may be insinuating that these booths could be used in whichever way anyone would like to 'self soothe,'" a representative tells Mashable, "but the brand is not actively encouraging people to masturbate in public as that is an illegal offense."

The company claims approximately 100 men used the booth on its inaugural day.

After the success of the first booth, Hot Octopuss says it plans to continue with the idea and add more pop-up booths around Manhattan, in other major U.S. cities and in London, where the brand has a more loyal following.

To conclude, we're not suggesting you go to any old payphone with your iPad and do the five-finger shuffle, gentlemen. That's actually pretty illegal.
