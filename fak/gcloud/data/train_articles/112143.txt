It is not clear what prompted the move or what Sanders’ code name will be.

Carson and Trump each requested protection last year amid their turbulent presidential campaigns, and Clinton retained her detail from her time as first lady.

Trump's code name is "mogul," a nod to his status as a billionaire businessman, while Carson's is "Eli," a reference to the Biblical prophet. Clinton goes by "Evergreen."
