Parental Permission for Abortions
A bill requiring minors to get written permission from their parents before they could have an abortion passed a Florida senate committee. Bill sponsor Alan Hays says it’s harder for a student to get medication at school than it is for them to get an abortion.

“The state will not allow a school nurse or a school teacher to give that student a Tylenol or an Advil with out parental permission yet they’re willing to let them terminate a pregnancy without parental permission. I just find that completely unacceptable,” said Hays.

In 1999 the Florida legislature passed similar legislation, but the Florida Supreme Court said it violated a minor’s right to privacy.
