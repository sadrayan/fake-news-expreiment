WEBVTT UPFRONT AND OUR EXTENDED INTERVIEW WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS NOTION THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACKWARDS. YOU SAID IN YOUR SPEECH, PUTTING BACK DEMOCRATS BACK IN POWER. DEMOCRATS ARGUE, THAT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD THING. WE SAW THE STUDY THAT CAME OUT AND SAID IT SHOWED MINNESOTA, WHICH HAS SIMILAR DEMOGRAPHICS, IS DOING BETTER IN TERMS OF JOB GROWTH, INCOME GROWT POPULATION GROWTH. WHY SHOULD WE MAKE A CHANGE? ONE, IT IS A REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE. ANOTHER REPORT IN MINNESOTA CAME OUT THAT SAID THE OPPOSITE. IT SAID ON GDP, WHICH IS HOW YOU MEASURE COUNTRIES, I WOULD SAY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING I HAVE HEARD FOR YEARS -- LONG BEFORE I WAS GOVERNOR, MINNESOTA HAS CONSISTENTLY HAD A LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN. I KEPT HEARING THAT FOR YOUR SOME DETRACTORS THAT SAYS, LOOK AT MINNESOTA, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS LOWER THAN WISCONSIN. WE HAVE HAD AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 2.9%. THEY HAD 3.2%. WHEN I LAID OUT OUR PLAN TO HELP WISCONSIN WIN THE 21ST CENTURY, A HUGE PART WAS TO BUILD A WORKFORCE THROUGH INVESTMENT IN SCHOOLS, TECHNICAL COLLEGE, BECAUSE MY CHALLENGES I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WORKERS TO FILL THE JOBS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, LET ALONE THOSE IN THE FUTURE. YOU CANNOT CREATE ANY MORE JOBS AND TO YOU HAVE ENOUGH BODIES TO PUT INTO THOSE. MIKE: ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO FILL THOSE JOBS ARE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. THAT IS PART OF YOUR VISION FOR THE CENTURY. TO REALLY CHANGE THAT NUMBER, DON'T YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER IN THE MILWAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS? ABSOLUTELY. MIKE: SCHOOLS FACE SERIOUS FISCAL CHALLENGES. YEAH TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT, WE ARE NOT HAPPY OR ARE SURE WHAT HE WILL DO. YOU HAVE THE SUPERINTENDENT LEAVING. IS IT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO STEP IN? BY LAW, DEMOCRATS GAVE THE SUPERINTENDENT INSTRUCTIONS IN 2009 THE ABILITY TO TAKE OVER SCHOOLS. FOR WHATEVER REASON, THE SUPERINTENDENT FAILED TO DO IT. THAT PERSON HAS DIRECT AUTHORITY UNDER THE STATUTES TO LOOK BEYOND THAT. IF THE SUPERINTENDENT IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT, THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. MAYBE WE SHAKE THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT. THE MILWAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT, LIKE EVERY OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE, GOT AN EXTRA EXTRA $200 FOR EVERY STUDENT, EVERY SCHOOL IN THEIR DISTRICT. ANOTHER $204 ON TOP OF THAT FOR EVERY STUDENT ACROSS THE STATE THIS COMING FALL. MPS GOT ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR SUMMER SCHOOL. FUNDING FROM THE STATE IS NOT THE ISSUE. THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF THINGS TO DO THINGS ACROSS THE STATE. IT IS NOT THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY. THE QUESTION IS MAYBE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE. THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CHANGING BOUNDARIES. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT IN THE FUTURE. TOMMY THOMPSON TALKED ABOUT THAT YEARS AGO. I TALKED TO TOMMY NOT TOO LONG AGO, AND SAID THAT WAS ONE OF HIS REGRETS THAT THEY DID NOT GO FURTHER IN TERMS OF SHAKING UP THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. HISTORICALLY, A LOT OF STATES, IF THEY HAVE LARGE, URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE NOT SUCCEEDING, THEY LOOKED AT TURNING THEM OVER TO THE MAYOR OF THAT MUNICIPALITY. THE GOVERNOR TRIED TO DO THAT 10 YEARS AGO. EVEN DEMOCRATS SAID THEY DID NOT WANT TO GIVE IT TO THE MAYOR. MIKE: I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, BUT DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT MORE. IT IS THE SUBJECT OF LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA. WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON THAT RIGHT NOW? MANY DEMOCRATS WHO SAY THEY WOULD WORK TO LEGALIZE IT. I WOULD NOT. WHETHER IT IS INDEED COUNTY, ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL COUNTIES OR ANYWHERE ELSE ACROSS THE STATE, WHEN I TALK TO LAW- ENFORCEMENT AND TALK TO PEOPLE DEALING WITH THE CRISIS WE DEAL WITH WITH OPIOIDS AND DRUGS, WHETHER IT IS HEROIN OR OTHERS, I HEAR IT ALL THE TIME. DO NOT LEGALIZE MARIJUANA. AS IS A GATEWAY DRUG. IT OPENS UP OTHER PROBLEMS. MIKE: GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM. OUR EDITORIAL PARTNER WAS POLITICS.COM HAVE COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY CONVENTION THIS WEEKEND IN MILWAUKEE. YOU'LL FIND IT ON THE ELECTION BLOG AT WISPOLITICS.COM. COMING UP, THE REPORTER WHOSE STORIES HELPED LAUNCH THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. WHY SHE SAYS WE HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ACCUSERS. THAT IS NEXT ON UPFRONT. MIKE: THE F
