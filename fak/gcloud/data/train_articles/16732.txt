Subject: QUICK QUERY: MSA Population Projections?

Hello again from the Austin newspaper. I write with urgency to ask if the bureau has produced population projections by MSA extending to 2046 or later. I didnâ€™t spot as much here.

3:30 p.m.

The Census Bureau does not produce projections at the metro level. You may want to check with your state data center.

Thanks,

Virginia Hyer, Public Affairs Specialist, Media Relations Branch, Public Information Office, U.S. Census Bureau
