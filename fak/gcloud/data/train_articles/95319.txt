Work together for immigration solution
The president has indicated the extremes on immigration of being strong and weak. Hopefully, as a country, we can be smarter and Congress can address the issue. Since there are no quotas on the number of people who can apply and receive asylum, shouldn't there be one? In addition, shouldn't those seeking asylum first have to apply at a U.S. embassy in their country, just like they do for a visa? That embassy would have a better understanding of the need and provide legitimacy to the request.

All those seeking asylum at our borders would not be permitted to enter. The U.S. would still be compassionate toward those in need and reduce the current situation. A smart compromise by Congress from both parties would be great.
