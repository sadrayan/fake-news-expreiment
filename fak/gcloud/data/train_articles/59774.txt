Donald Trump: ‘I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools’
BURLINGTON, Vt. — Donald Trump said Thursday that he wants to eliminate gun-free zones at schools.

"I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases," Trump said, to scattered cheers during a campaign rally on Thursday night. "My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones."

Trump has repeatedly said that gun-free zones are a magnet for mentally ill shooters and that the recent mass shootings in Paris and California could have been prevented if more citizens were armed to protect themselves and others. For months, Trump has specifically called for the elimination of gun-free zones at military installments, but his call to do the same at schools appears to be a new stance.

The proposal raises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on grounds?

Trump's campaign manager and press secretary did not respond to requests for clarification.
