Subject: RE: Texas reporter, urgent inquiry

Hello.

We are not able to calculate how many victims of human trafficking there are in the United States or a single state.

With regard to your larger questions, we provide statistics in annual reports to Congress. They are prepared by the Department of Justice, accessible through here: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/publications-0. Here is a direct link to the Attorney General’s most recently published report.

We haven’t reported top recipient states because the information might be misinterpreted as the location of the trafficking, which is often not the case. Rather, we report the overall number of states to which we have sent letters:

In FY 2011, Certification and Eligibility letters were provided to victims or their representatives in 38 states, the District of Columbia, and Saipan. Certified victims came from 55 countries in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Europe.

We also report trafficking hotline information on the top states from which calls are made to the national hotline, which appears on p. 40 of the FY 2011 AG’s report:

During FY 2011, the top five states with the highest call volume were (in order by highest volume): California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois, together comprising 45 percent of the calls where the caller’s state was known.

I hope that information helps.
