UPDATED: Cuba’s Forgotten 51 Prisoners of Conscience
This post was updated on March 22, 2016 at 1:00pm.

Since Fidel Castro’s 1959 Revolution, the communist regime of Cuba has deliberately sought to silence those who criticize or threaten the status quo of their dictatorship. Some of these prisoners of conscience have been in jail for over 20 years. Others are continuously arrested detained, released, and rearrested as part of a cycle of intimidation and coercion intended to punish dissidents. During their detainment they are not given access to adequate medical care or family visitation, nor do they receive due process and a fair trial.

The Castro regime insists they hold no political prisoners. They attribute these detentions to common crimes and violations of Cuban law. Yet in 2015 alone, over 8,000 Cubans were detained for “political reasons.” And in January of this year, 1,474 people were detained.

While no one knows the exact number of Cuba’s prisoners of conscience, the following list of 51 prisoners compiled by Directorio represents thousands more who are oppressed and silenced by the repressive Cuban regime. Please take the time to sign and share this Change.org petition calling on the media to cover those who continue to suffer under the oppressive yoke of communism.

On Wednesday, September 30, 2015, Carlos Manuel Figueroa, a former Cuban political prisoner released earlier this year, made news over social media.

EFE news wire is reporting that the Cuban dissident is missing. The US embassy is refusing to confirm what transpired, citing security concerns.[18]According to the Associated Press, Figueroa was held on charges of violating a diplomatic site.[19]He was released on January 20, 2016.[20] David Fernández Cardoso José Daniel Gonzalez Fumero Ricardo González Sendiña Ariel González Sendiña Eglis Heredia Rodríguez Mario Alberto Hernández Leyva.

This case comes as a result of failing to pay a fine imposed on both activists when they were blamed for anti-government graffiti that appeared in Palma Soriano. In the past both activists were brutally beaten by Cuban agents when they were defending families that were being unjustly evicted from their homes.”[7]On January 22, 2016, Geovanys wife, Isora Torres Bicet, claimed that “her husband had called the guard, who said that he should stay there.” Geovanys defended the jailed man, so that he would die there, but the guard beat Geovanys, and smashed his head, poked his eye, broke his finger and his arm. “They didn’t tell me who beat him up, they only said that he had been attacked because he defended the convict.”[8] Rolando Erismelio Jaco García.Rolando Erismelio Jaco García was detained in the same events as Alexander Palacio Reyes and Felipe Martínez Companiones for recording them.

He was arrested then and there, and was beaten by two uniformed agents. The municipal tribunal of Old Havana took into account the “danger to society” his crime posed and the bad behavior that he had during the trial, at which he yelled “Long live human rights.” Due to all of this, he was assigned to serve his sentenced at the 1580 prison of the Guanabacoa county. Silverio Portal Contreras is 44 years old, and he is an active member of the opposition movement Alternative Republic, as well as a participant of “the Dissident” in the Central Park; he is also a devout Catholic and a businessman.[25],[26] After his release, he is still being threatened by state security. He was arbitrarily detained on October 19, 2015 “by police agents who suspected his activities to be against the government.”[27] Lourdes Esquivel Vieyto—secretary of the Opposition Movement for a New Republic and of the national executive of the Ladies in White—claimed that the political prisoners Mario Alberto Hernández Leyva and Silverio Portal Contreras have been transferred to punishment cells and are in isolation.
