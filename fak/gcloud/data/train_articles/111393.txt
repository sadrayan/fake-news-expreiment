Russia: Coast Guard detains three Ukrainian vessels after breaching Russian territorial waters
Russia's Coast Guard detained three Ukrainian vessels after they breached Russia's Black Sea waters on Sunday. The moment of collision between two vessels seems to have been captured in footage that appeared online shortly after.

Three Ukrainian vessels, including missile boat Nikopol, Gurza-class boat Berdyansk and Tugboat Yani Kapu, left the Mariupol port and headed towards the Kerch Strait.

According to the FSB, Ukrainian vessels "have crossed the state border of the Russian Federation, and they have unlawfully entered the temporarily closed area of the Russian Federation's territorial sea."

FSB initiated a criminal case against the crew of the Ukrainian vessels "for illegal trespassing of the state border."

Security services said that weapons were used to make Ukrainian vessels stop after 'dangerous maneuvering'. Three Ukrainian military members injured as a result of the incident received medical attention.

According to Ukrainian authorities, their vessels had a right to pass freely over the Kerch Strait based on international law. The Command of the Naval Forces of Ukraine placed the blame on the Russian side for "its aggressive essence."

The Verkhovna Rada is to discuss the introduction of the martial law after the incident, during a hearing on Monday.
