Jussie Smollett charged with filing false report of a hate crime The Empire actor had said he was the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime that left him briefly hospitalized.

Actor Jussie Smollett, known for his role on the TV show Empire, has been arrested and charged for allegedly filing a false police report after claiming he was the victim of a racist and homophobic hate crime.

In late January, Smollett, who is black and gay, claimed he was ambushed outside of a Chicago restaurant by two unidentified suspects who approached him yelling homophobic and racist slurs. Smollett said the two assaulted him, poured an unknown chemical substance on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck.

But in the weeks since the story first made headlines, the narrative has taken a number of twists and turns — from assumed tragedy to suspected hoax. In a news conference following Smollett’s arrest, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor was allegedly unhappy with his salary and the attack was staged for his benefit. Police say Smollett paid two men, one of whom he knew from Empire, $3,500 to fake the attack. Smollett stands by his initial claims. Meanwhile, the producers of Empire have said Smollett will no longer appear on the show.
