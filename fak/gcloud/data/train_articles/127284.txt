Carcass of baby goat that looks like human baby handed over to the Malaysian authorities
KOTA TINGGI (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The carcass of a baby goat, said to resemble a human baby, has been handed over to Malaysia's Veterinary Services Department.

The baby goat belonged to Federal Land Development Authority (Felda) settler Ibrahim Basir, who had refused offers of money from people interested in buying the carcass.

Instead, the 63-year-old has decided to hand it over to the department to enable it to carry out investigation on the strange-looking kid.

Mr Ibrahim, from Felda Sungai Mas in Malaysia's state of Johor, said he was initially shocked when he found out that one of his goats had given birth to a kid that had the features of a human baby.

He said he was earlier informed by his business partner Jamaludin Abdul Samad, 50, at around 11am last Friday that some parts of the baby goat looked like a human infant.

"When I went to check, I was quite shocked but fascinated too as its face, nose, short legs and even the condition of its soft body seemed like a human baby, but the light brown fur covering its whole body resembles that of a goat," he said yesterday.

He added that despite the features, the kid did not have any umbilical cord.

Mr Ibrahim said the kid was already dead when they found it, and was believed to have been trampled by its mother or due to other complications.

"We kept the kid's carcass in a polystyrene box filled with ice cubes before taking it to the district veterinary office at around noon yesterday," he said.
