One Nation
WASHINGTON, DC — One Nation, a public policy organization dedicated to promoting commonsense legislative solutions, today announced a new $1.2 million advocacy effort in Indiana focused on border security. It will run statewide on a combination of broadcast and cable television, radio and digital.

The ad, entitled “Dangerous,” calls on Senator Joe Donnelly to fight for increased border enforcement funding. The ad highlights Donnelly’s vote to provide amnesty to illegal immigrants despite sending out taxpayer-funded mailings as a Congressman pledging that he was “100% opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants.”

“As a Congressman, Joe Donnelly used taxpayer dollars to tell Hoosiers he was ‘100 percent opposed’ to amnesty, yet in the Senate Donnelly has been 100 percent in favor of amnesty,” said One Nation President and CEO Steven Law. “We encourage Donnelly to change course by finally fighting for increased border enforcement funding.”
