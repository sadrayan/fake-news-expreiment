LRAD 100X Long Range Acoustic Device
The LRAD 100X is a self-contained, hand-held, portable communications device for on-scene and tactical communications.



At 20-30 decibels (dB) louder than competing megaphones, the 100X is four to six times louder than systems of comparable size and weight . A s a portable communication system, it overcomes the background noise of vehicles, vessels, sirens and boisterous crowds to ensure each message is clearly heard and understood. Optimized driver and waveguide technology ensure clear and loud communication so every syllable is understood.



The warning tone provides a safe alternative to other non-lethal solutions, modif ying behavior and increasing response time to scale force escalation. NSN: 5830015784373 Features Clear Communication at up to 600 Meters
