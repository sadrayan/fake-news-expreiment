Rauner's tax returns: $91 million in taxable income for '16
Gov. Bruce Rauner had more than $91 million in state taxable income in 2016, a significant drop from the $188 million he and wife Diana reported for 2015, according to tax returns the governor’s office released Tuesday.

The Rauners paid $19.5 million in federal income taxes and $3.2 million in state income taxes for a total tax rate of 25 percent.

As he has done ever since he declared his candidacy in 2013, Rauner released only the Form 1040 and withheld the schedules and other attachments that could provide more details about his financial investments and earnings as well as tax breaks he might have taken advantage of.

Releasing tax returns is not required of candidates for office or elected officials. Two wealthy contenders for the Democratic nomination to challenge Rauner next year, J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy, have not released theirs despite a challenge to do so from opponent Evanston state Sen. Daniel Biss.

In December 2016, Rauner put $50 million into his campaign fund ahead of a 2018 re-election bid.

Rauner ran a private equity firm before he was elected in 2014. When he took office, Rauner tried to allay concerns about potential conflicts of interest by establishing what he referred to as a “blind trust” for his wealth. The arrangement gives management authority over much of his wealth to a New York investment adviser.

The Rauners’ income has varied over the years. In 2013, the couple reported earning $60 million, and their returns for 2014 showed an adjusted gross income of $57.5 million.

The governor’s office said the Rauner Family Foundation made charitable contributions totaling more than $6.6 million in 2016, but did not provide copies of the organization’s tax returns.
