Travel Bags
"I design for longevity not only by selecting the best materials, but also by putting them together in a way that they are least prone to fail, even after years of use. After 40+ years of making stuff, I've made enough mistakes to feel pretty confident in knowing what will work and what won't. And, of course, we test the heck out of all prototypes as well. The longevity of our bags also encourages me to be somewhat cautious in terms of aesthetics: you want a bag that's going to last for 10 or 20 years to be more or less classic." â€” Tom Bihn
