KENDALL COUNTY -- A doctor who had been missing for weeks has been found. His body was found inside his car outside of Boerne.

The Kendall Country Sheriff's Office had been looking for Dr. Curtis Clogston since March 15. On Tuesday, his body was found within a few miles of his Boerne home.

Dr. Clogston was found inside an overturned Mini Cooper located just outside Boerne. The Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed that Dr. Curtis Clogston was inside the car.

DPS believes the car crashed, hitting two trees before it came to rest in some brush. The car was found at 2:45 pm by a resident who lives at the 400 block of FM 474.

The road is the same one Dr. Clogston would have taken to and from his home just a few miles away from where the car was found.

The 68-year-old man was reported missing March 15. His wife, who lives north of Austin, hadn't heard from him in days. Neither had Clogston's co-workers.

He worked at the Visitor Physicians Association on the northwest side of San Antonio. The Department of Emergency Health Sciences at the UT Health Science Center confirmed he was an assistant medical director for the San Antonio Fire Department from 1980 to 1985 and was also an employee of the Health Science Center at the time.
