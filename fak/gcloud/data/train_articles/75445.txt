Nigeria Food Crisis
For almost eight years, conflict has shattered northern Nigeria killing more than 20,000 and forcing millions to flee for safer areas. Over two million people have fled their homes and are sheltering within the country, while others are living in poor conditions in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.

In the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe almost 7 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, more than half of these are children. Land mines and insecurity are keeping farmers from their farms and exacerbating the dire food crisis. It is expected that more than 5 million people will face serious food shortages this year.

The UN estimates that over the next 12 months an estimated 300,000 children in Borno state alone will suffer from severe acute malnutrition. With the ongoing disruption to basic services the likelihood of waterborne diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, is growing.

Some parts of the country are just too dangerous for aid agencies to operate. However, as government forces recapture towns and villages humanitarian agencies are increasingly able to reach people in need.
