Jews in the 112th Congress
by Lawrence Bush

As the 112th Congress convenes, we're publishing this list of Jewish senators (13) and representatives (27), based on research by Alyssa Goldstein, our magazine's intern at Bard College. The list includes their top five campaign contributors, the industries or interest groups that fund them most (this financial information comes courtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics), and their committee posts.

Why single out Jews in the Congress? Doing so may make some readers nervous about inviting anti-Semitism down on our community's heads, or annoyed by the implication that Jews should be especially interested in Jews (or that Jews in positions of influence are pushed in one direction or another by their Jewish identities), or wrestling with definitional issues about whether Jews constitute a religious group (as defined by the U.S. Census) or a national minority (as defined in the old socialist bloc) or a nation (as defined by the Zionist movement) or a people/civilization (as defined by the Reconstructionist movement, among others) — or all of the above. Of course, a listing of African-Americans in Congress, or of women in Congress, or of gay men or lesbians in Congress, would probably be of great interest to our readers and provoke little ambivalence. Perhaps the difference in reaction indicates something significant about the nature of Jewish oppression: that in the modern world, we are afraid less of powerlessness than of being perceived as having undue power. That is the anti-Semitism that was shaped and implemented by the Nazis, and it weighs heavily on Jewish heads today.

In any event, JC is a Jewish magazine, and we see it as a legitimate part of our work to report on the doings of Jews in Congress. One observation to make that brings us pride (or, for some of us, surprise): With the exception of Eric Cantor, the Republican majority whip in the House, all of the Jews in Congress are Democrats or independents, and the great majority are liberal. Despite the common misapprehension, especially among Jewish leftists, that the Jewish community is conservative — a perception shaped mostly by highly visible, conservative Jewish activism regarding Israel — the reality of tenacious Jewish liberalism is revealed here.
