Wisconsin’s Education and Library Broadband Infrastructure Buildout

Wisconsin’s Education and Library Broadband Infrastructure Buildout project proposes to directly connect 385 libraries, 74 school districts, and eight community colleges (including two tribal colleges) to the existing high-speed BadgerNet Converged Network by deploying 203 miles of new fiber-optic facilities to replace inadequate copper infrastructure in predominantly rural areas. The BadgerNet Converged Network is the largest state network of its kind in the United States and currently provides connectivity to more than 2,300 state and local government agencies, schools, libraries, and healthcare facilities. The additional fiber connections are expected to upgrade 17 percent of the state’s schools and 81 percent of the state’s libraries to broadband speeds of between 20 Mbps and 100 Mbps, strengthening their ability to serve underserved communities throughout the state.
