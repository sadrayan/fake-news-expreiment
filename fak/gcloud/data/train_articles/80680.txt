Stone Fires Opening Shot of 2014 Ad Campaign
(AUGUSTA, GA) – A Revolutionary War cannon shot opens the John Stone for Congress 2014 Ad Campaign, as the conservative Republican fires off against the inside-the-beltway establishment in the hotly contested Republican for Georgia’s 12th Congressional District Seat.

Stone, a former senior congressional aide and licensed gun collector, fires the cannon to start the commercial, then drives home the pledge to not just win the seat back from incumbent Democrat John Barrow, but to vote in all new Republican House Leadership.

Stone became the first House candidate in the nation to sign the Republican Trust Political Action Committee Pledge to vote for all-new GOP House leaders to end the on-going GOP civil war, which has become a defining issue among the five candidates in the Republican primary. Polling in the district and across the nation confirms over 70% over Republican primary voters support a clean sweep of House leadership.

The television theme is supported by similar radio ads, in which Stone calls for new leadership and policies in Washington, and a unique call for new and renewed economic development in the 12th District.

The 2014 Stone for Congress radio and television campaign starts Thursday district-wide.
