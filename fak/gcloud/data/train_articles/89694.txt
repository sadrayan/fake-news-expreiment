Voters Have More Faith in U.S. Elections These Days

Voters are now more confident than they have been in over six years that U.S. elections are fair to voters, though more than one-in-four still think itâ€™s too easy to vote in this country today.

A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 51% of Likely U.S. Voters now think American elections are fair to voters, up 10 points from 41% in early 2016 and the highest level of confidence in U.S. elections since a high of 57% last reached just before the 2012 presidential election.

Just a third of voters (33%) now believe U.S. elections are unfair to voters, down from findings in the 40s for the past five years. Another 16% are not sure how fair elections are to voters. (To see survey question wording, click here.)
