Canada's Economic Action Plan
Under Canada’s Economic Action Plan, the federal government proposes to increase the existing Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) for children under the age of six and expand the UCCB to children aged six through 17, starting in 2015.

About the Program

In 2006, the Government introduced the Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB), which provides all families with $100 per month for each child under the age of six. The UCCB currently provides direct federal support to approximately 1.7 million families with young children.

The Government is proposing to enhance the UCCB by providing $160 per month for each child under the age of six. In a year, parents will receive up to $1,920 for each child in this age group.

The Government is also introducing a new benefit of $60 per month for children aged six through 17. In a year, parents will receive up to $720 per child in that age group.

The enhanced UCCB will replace the existing Child Tax Credit for the 2015 and subsequent taxation years.

Who is Eligible

All families with minor children – approximately four million families – will benefit from the increase and expansion of the UCCB.

To qualify, parents have to complete the Canada Child Benefits Application form. Parents who had already completed this form to access other child-related benefits do not have to re-submit the form unless their family situation has changed.

Initiative Update

Enhanced payments for the UCCB will take effect as of January 2015 and will begin to be reflected in monthly payments to recipients in July 2015. The July 2015 payment would include up to six months of benefits to cover the January to June 2015 period.
