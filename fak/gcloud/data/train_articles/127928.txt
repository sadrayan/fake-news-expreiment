Deputy President responds to inaccuracies in Business Day report
Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has noted several inaccuracies in an article published today, 25 October 2017 in Business Day newspaper, titled ‘Cyril Ramaphosa in firing line in latest probe request’.



The article reports on a complaint to the Competition Commission that “implicates Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Shanduka Trust”. It states later that the complaint lists Shanduka Coal, “in which Ramaphosa held an interest in trust”.



We wish to put the following on record:



- Deputy President Ramaphosa disposed of his stake in Shanduka Group in November 2014, including all of Shanduka’s mining assets and investments in other ‘regulated’ sectors.

- He does not have an interest in Shanduka Coal or in any mining assets, either in a trust or in any other form.

- The Deputy President is not aware of any entity known as Shanduka Trust.



The Deputy President reaffirms his view that any credible allegations of uncompetitive behaviour should be thoroughly investigated and those responsible held to account.
