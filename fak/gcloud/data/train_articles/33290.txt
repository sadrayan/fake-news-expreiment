Giuliani says he's not sure collusion is a crime despite Mueller investigation
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Monday that he's not sure collusion with Russia would be considered a crime.

But legal experts have repeatedly said that anyone found collaborating with Russia on the 2016 election could be charged with other crimes, such as conspiracy -- and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is ongoing.

Asked about former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's upcoming trial, Giuliani told CNN "New Day" co-anchor Alisyn Camerota that Manafort "was not involved with intimate business relationships with Donald Trump."

"Four months, they're not going to be colluding with Russia, which I don't even know if that's a crime, colluding about Russians," Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, continued. "You start analyzing the crime -- the hacking is the crime. ... The President didn't hack."

In his wide-ranging interview on "New Day," Giuliani also said he didn't know if Trump's ex-lawyer under criminal investigation, Michael Cohen, would be pardoned by Trump and claimed that Mueller's team has been unresponsive to the Trump legal team's recommendations regarding a potential interview between Mueller and the President for more than a week.
