An Athens, Ga., Kroger store drew the gaze of the all-seeing eye of social media after a sign the store posted explaining why it has a unisex bathroom went viral.

"We have a unisex bathroom because sometimes gender specific toilets put others into uncomfortable situations," the sign reads. "And since we have a lot of our friends coming to see us, we want to provide a place for our friends who are:

Dads with daughters

Moms with sons

Parents with disabled children

Those in the LGBTQ

Adults with aging parents who may be mentally or physically disabled

Thank you for helping us to provide a safe environment for everyone!"

On Monday, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed heavily scrutinized legislation critics said would legalize discrimination against the LGBT community. The NFL had threatened to withhold a future Super Bowl from Georgia if the bill made it into law.

"Georgia is a welcoming state filled with warm, friendly and loving people," Deal said Monday. "Our people work side by side without regard to the color of our skin, or the religion we adhere to. ... That is the character of Georgia. I intend to do my part to keep it that way."

The original Facebook post about the Kroger bathroom sign has been shared nearly 40,000 times and "liked" more than 25,000 times. On Twitter, Kroger's account (@kroger) was being flooded with mostly positive reaction.
