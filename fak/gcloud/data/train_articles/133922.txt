Haiti earthquake: Televangelist Pat Robertson links quake to 'pact with the devil'
Reporting from Washington -- Conservative televangelist the Rev. Pat Robertson on Wednesday linked the earthquake in Haiti to a "pact with the devil" purportedly entered into by the Haitian people in the late 18th century in a bid to defeat French colonizers.

"Something happened a long time ago in Haiti, and people might not want to talk about it," Robertson said on his Christian Broadcasting Network show. "They were under the heel of the French . . . and they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said, 'We will serve you if you'll get us free from the French.'

"True story. And the devil said, 'OK, it's a deal,' " Robertson said. "Ever since, they have been cursed by one thing after another."

THERE'S MORE; READ THE REST.
