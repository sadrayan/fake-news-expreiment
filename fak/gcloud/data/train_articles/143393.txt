Amazon.com: US Flag Store Service Blue Star Flag Lapel Pin: Patio, Lawn & Garden
Verified Purchase

I wore this pin quite a bit, and I would always get questions or talk to someone about their prior service. All of the pins from the Online Store Inc are made very well, and are really sturdy. I never lost a pin because of the backing falling off (which happened to me with other pins that I purchased), and it fit to any of my clothes. If I was wearing a sweater, shirt or jacket the pin stayed on all day. If you like this pin, look at some of the others that they have, there are is a big selection of pins from this company and they are all made to last.
