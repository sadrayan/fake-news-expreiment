Cornyn, Cruz vote “no” on Senate immigration reform bill
Texas Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz both voted against the Senate immigration reform bill that passed this afternoon, 68-32.

Prospects for the bill are dim in the GOP-controlled House, which is developing piecemeal legislation that does not include a key element of the Senate plan — legal status for 11 million people in the country illegally.

Earlier today, both Texans also voted against bringing the bill to a final vote.

The votes were no surprise. Both openly opposed the bill. On Monday, both voted against an amendment to double the number of border agents from 20,000 to 40,000 and add 700 miles of fencing at a cost of roughly $38 billion.

“All of the concerns that have been repeatedly raised about this bill remain,” Cruz said in a statement. “It repeats the mistakes of the 1986 immigration bill; it grants amnesty first; it won’t secure the border; and it doesn’t fix our broken legal immigration system.”
