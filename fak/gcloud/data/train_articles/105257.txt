Trump to Deport Democratic Senator’s Family Because They are All Illegals
The Democrats are not immune to survive the huge pressure on them and their followers from the new laws for illegal immigrants. The DNC opposed every law which confronts their open borders agenda.

Kevin de Leon, a California Democrat State Senate leader admitted that with this new reform, half of his family is unlawfully on US soil.

His followers and rest of the liberal anti-fa savages don’t want to accept the fact that this is a country with law and order. The immigration laws apply to everybody and we have to respect them, especially the ones who want to get a green card.

This is what Kevin de Leon said recently:

“I can tell you half of my family would be eligible for deportation under [President Donald Trump’s] executive order, because if they got a false Social Security card, if they got a false identification, if they got a false driver’s license prior to us passing AB60, if they got a false green card, and anyone who has family members, you know, who are undocumented knows that almost entirely everybody has secured some sort of false identification. That’s what you need to survive, to work. They are eligible for massive deportation.”

Sometimes the truth is painful. It’s such a shame for the senator’s family and many others who make the decision to stay in the US illegally.

They commit the crime and we can’t turn a blind eye on that, or even support this. What do you think?
