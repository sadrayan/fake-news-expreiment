BREAKING: Queen Elizabeth II Dead At 94
Queen Elizabeth II of England, Ruler of the Britons, Matriarch of the Kingdom, Protector of the Realm and Second of her name succumbed to a stroke in her home in Windsor this afternoon. The news is slowly making its way out of Buckingham Palace, which is on complete lockdown until official word comes from the Royal Coroner.

According to a source close to the BBC, Her Royal Highness was awake and alert while the stroke was happening and managed to get out one final thought: “Don’t trust Donald Trump.” Shortly thereafter she passed.

Because of the time difference, the official word may not come until 7 or 8 AM Eastern. We’ll keep you updated on this developing story.
