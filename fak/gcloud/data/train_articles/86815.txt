Hillary Rodham Clinton: By the Book
The former secretary of state and author of “Hard Choices” keeps copies of Republican memoirs like “Faith of My Fathers” and “Decision Points” on her shelves.

What books are you reading right now?

I’ve got a pile of books stacked on my night stand that I’m reading — or hoping to get to soon. I’m usually working on more than one at a time. So right now it’s “The Goldfinch,” by Donna Tartt; “Mom & Me & Mom,” by Maya Angelou; and “Missing You,” by Harlan Coben.

What was the last truly great book you read?

I can’t stop thinking about “The Hare With Amber Eyes,” by Edmund de Waal; “The Signature of All Things,” by Elizabeth Gilbert; “Citizens of London,” by Lynne Olson; and “A Suitable Boy,” by Vikram Seth.

Who are your favorite contemporary writers? Are there any writers whose books you automatically read when they come out?
