Obama: Nothing Personal
ABC News' Rick Klein Reports: Sen. Barack Obama defended a recent comment by his wife that some interpreted as a dig at Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying that Michelle Obama's comments were aimed at emphasizing the "importance of family" and had nothing to do with the Clintons.

Last week, Michelle Obama said at a campaign event, "If you can't run your own house, you can't run the White House."

A Chicago Sun-Times columnist, Jennifer Hunter, saw the comments and wrote today, "She didn't elaborate, but it could be interpreted as a swipe at the Clintons."

Asked to respond in a conference call with reporters, Sen. Obama said, "She wasn't making any reference to that."

"Anybody who's been listening to Michelle on the stump," Senator Obama explained on a conference call with reporters, "She's talked about the importance of family, and the need for our family to be sure that we're thinking about our kids during the process of this campaign.

"She's repeated that in every stump speech, so there are no refrences behind her point that we have an administration that talks about family values but doesnâ€™t follow through on it. And that part of the challenge for us in this campaign is making sure that we are talking the talk, but also walking the walk. That's all it was referring to," Obama said.

The Obama campaign also distributed a more complete transcript of Michelle Obama's speech that backs up the senator's account.

Here's the full version:

"Our view was that, if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. So, so we've adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he's traveling around, I do day trips. That means I get up in the morning, I get the girls ready, I get them off, I go and do trips, I'm home before bedtime."
