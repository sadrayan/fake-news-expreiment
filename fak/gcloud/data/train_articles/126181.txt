FACT CHECK: North Carolina No Longer Accepts $20 Bills
On 22 April 2016, “satire” web site National Report published a fake news article reporting that the $20 bill was no longer considered legal tender in North Carolina:

The Obama Administration last week announced a change in the complexion of the $20 bill. The familiar portrait of Andrew Jackson, our nation’s 7th president and hero of the Battle of New Orleans, will be cut out of the bill and in its stead will be the likeness of Harriet Tubman, a former slave and smuggler during the abolition era. The North Carolina State Legislature has just passed a law that will ban the $20 bill from status as legal tender for any public or private debt. Governor Pat McCrory will allegedly sign the bill into law next week.

While Harriet Tubman’s inclusion on the $20 bill was met with mixed reactions, North Carolina has not passed any laws prohibiting payment with $20 bills in the state. National Report is a well-known entertainment and fake news site that does not publish factual stories:

National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.

The decision to include Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill spawned a number of rumors and hoaxes, such as a fake news story about Klan members committing suicide, an exaggerated claim that Tubman was a “gun-toting Democrat shooting” Republican, and at least one misattributed quote.
