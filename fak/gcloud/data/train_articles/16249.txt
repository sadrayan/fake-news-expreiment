Emails, Rafael Emmanuel González, research scientist associate, Office of the State Demographer, Texas State Data Center, Sept. 28, 2015

Thank you for contacting our office with your data request. Specifically, you requested information on the number of people who move to Texas each day. To get this information for you, we paired data from the Census Bureau’s 2014 Population Estimates of the Components of Population Change and the Census Bureau’s 2013 State-to-State Migration Flows.

Net migration is the number of individuals moving in minus the number of individuals moving out. This figure gives us an indication as to how migration is contributing to the population growth of the state. Between July 1, 2013 and July 1, 2014, on average a net of 239,104 individuals moved to Texas from other states and other countries. When we divide this number by 365 days in the year, we get a net migration to Texas of 655 people per day. Our net migration contributes approximately 53% of our total population increase between 2013 and 2014.

As for the actual number of movers into Texas, the most recent data available are for 2013. If we assume similar rates of people move in/out in 2014 as they did in 2013, we can apply this rate to the 2014 net migration data to estimate a daily move in/out figure for 2014. In doing so, we estimate approximately 949,152 individuals moved to Texas in 2014, or 2,600 per day, and 710,048 people moved out of Texas, or 1,945 per day, yielding a net of about 655 net migrants to Texas each day.

Please let us know if you have any questions or additional data requests.

Thank you,

Rafael

Mr. Selby,

I was checking these numbers just now, after coming back from lunch, and I knew something wasn’t quite right about them. In fact, these numbers reflect an older data set. The new numbers came out and the Office of the State Demographer is working on getting these numbers out to for you. If you could please give me about an hour or so, I will get this estimate to you. The information that I provided for you, is not reflecting the newer data which does contain some corrections on the old data.

We have to work, for our purposes here, from information public as of Sept. 10. The new data wasn’t out then, correct?

Mr. Selby,

Please see the email below.

The new dataset was released on August 25, 2015: http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-145.html

Subject: Data Request: Migration to Texas per day

Hi Rafael,

According to the Census Bureau’s State-to-State Migration Flows data for 2014, it is estimated 538,572 individuals moved to Texas between 2013 and 2014. We can divide this figure by 365 to get our daily move-in estimate of 1,476.

It should be noted that these data are drawn for the American Community Survey. These data are sample based, and the estimates have a margin of error associated with them. For instance, the estimate of 538,572 individuals moving to Texas includes a margin of error of plus/minus 22,996. So the more accurate daily estimate lies somewhere between 1,413 and 1,539.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Lila
