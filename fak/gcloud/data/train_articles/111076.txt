Latif Harris has contributed to the San Francisco/North Beach literary scene since 1959. In addition to his publications of poetry, articles, reviews and various anthologies, Harris has published 11 books of poetry, including A Bodhisattva’s Busted Truth. His skill, energy and devotion to the work is continually praised as seen in his editing and publishing of BEATITUDE GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY 1959-2009 – considered an unequaled anthology of Beat Literature – a classic work of contemporary poetry. He is currently working on a large “Autobiopoetic” collection of poems covering 50 years of his work.

Harris has always played a generous, though low keyed roll as a poet in the tradition of Surrealism and Buddhist practitioners, never seeking fame or fortune, always helping others into print – reaching out to a larger community of poets and poetry. From Harris’ comments in the BEATITUDE it is easy to see a personal ethic: “My reason for under taking this huge project … was nothing more than to give thanks to so many friends of the North Beach community and beyond who have given so much joy and meaning to my life. I am especially grateful to my friends at Rock Science, where they focus all day on high tech projects that engage huge data sets to find the meaning of life with the help of an expert data science consultant, not realizing that at night that manager most likely becomes a poet! Although I may seem to dwell in another world from them, my art and their tech are really one and the same in the eyes of the universe. And what inspires them to create great code is clearly related to what inspires great poetry, believe it or not!”

Yes the Time is Half Full

Because I too

could not stop for death

I turn to my forges of poetry

for words

and phrases

to stand on

my Blake’s key

handed to me

directly

Shelley

Keats

Whitman

H.D.

Paz

et Eluard

my family

in this time this

piccolo momento

like there are so many little dyings

it does not matter

which one you call death

and nothing is final

only parking lots

facing emptiness

I have day dreams

in floods falling asleep

through out the day

seeing into

the emptiness of

my aging

sometimes my play land

where I stand

sit then fall

onto my exhausted body

of degeneration

and the mind

rests in a fugue

of exquisite confusion

sliced by melodies

The woods are lovely dark and deep

But I have promises to keep

and miles to go

before

Erasure blends us forward

as what was there

has gone

somewhere

like dust blown

or else

we surmise it so

what a surprise

even though

we knew it would be so

and soon I will fall asleep

everything moving

at light’s speed or beyond

I find myself

seeming feeble

but the View is Perfection still

youth felt so good

when we were there

beneath a shower of rock & roll

in love fucking

lit by the tail of a comet

on the fields of

flying so high

you felt so cool with skin like silk

in my fading it is the same my love

somehow remembering still

so many forms my lovers took

how many

impossible to know

only Woody Allen as Zelig

escapes death in the fins of my swimming

in the movies of disguises

and paralyzed fear of dying

three sons and three wives

I’ve had

nightmares

moments come like

Marlon Brando

Pocahontas and me

In The Attics of my life

so stoned in our beautiful bodies

nude wound in the grasses

of Natchez Pass

New Orleans

and mountains of the Great America unbroken

broken mind holds to the odors

of these places where my semen dropped

eyes dazed

ears filled with

Suzanne down by the river

I told you I was a wanderer with a heart set

on the next place in this place unreal

UNCERTAINTY CURTAIN

Sometimes in the hollow air

of Holland

art rises

like funiculi

into a Gothic cloud

where the bride and groom

float with a fiddle

and a cow

Is this just my mind

traveling faster

than the speed of light

what I saw the day some men

landed on the moon

I am not in charge of your dog

does it sound familiar

my poems of sinew bone and heart does it

sound like an infomercial to you are you buying that

stuff on TV? It’s who you aced

nothing

take deep breaths then leave me alone I am

tired and old and out of breath moving closer to

big back door the feather duster of immortality

cannot brush you clean of the ultimate dust

collected in the cracks and folds

of your living body soon the door of this

finality will open wide poof you will shoot

thru bang!

the door will close

behind you, you are out of here

you might fall down you might

feel bliss

I have no idea what will happen to you

I have no wisdom nothing to share

with you

so many years in closets garages

back seat of old automobiles miles and

miles of motels poverty and sick children wars and revolutions

impotence

perpetuating evil

do not forget that

everything is emotional

and all emotions are wisdom

like Buddha-hood without Meditation

Refining Apparent Phenomena

was a time you were swimming

so freely travels in ancient countries

studying poems and buildings filling architectural

notebooks fishing for sweet women

who would lay down with me in day dreams

I am falling down

in these days of the ending trying to

remember

Old Age is

just a pack of cards thrown into a wind

storm and tears choke me with sorrow in a fog

of self pity

no erections

but huge desire when we bathe with

words trying to unload all the sounds my morning

dreams leak into the foggy canyons of my youth

waking into the dreams of dislocation nothing is

recognizable a series of hallways are waiting

chords in my arms The Buddha teaches I make

visits into so many dark closets will only waste

your days

there are fewer than more magic

entanglements become a circus when love

bites memories no longer cease

The scales of the python peel

away dropping into the tannin died river

sun drops gold

the purest of colors

on floating leaves reflected

in autumnal ochre and yellows

ripples of wind and mad bugs

ferry the eyesight down stream

Tie my chi to a tree

even though I am growing old

I still love rock and roll

Jump up in my living room

and shake whatever I’ve got left

to shake.
