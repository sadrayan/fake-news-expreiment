Introduced version
The bill would make no appropriation but could provide the legal basis for an appropriation of funds to implement the provisions of the bill.

Fiscal Analysis

The bill would amend the Government Code to require the Texas Veterans Commission (TVC) establish and implement the Veteran Entrepreneur Program to promote veteran entrepreneurship and business ownership. The bill would also require the TVC to make policy recommendations at the local, state, and national level to address issues affecting veteransâ€™ entrepreneurship and business ownership.

Methodology

It is assumed that TVC would require 3.0 new full-time equivalent (FTE) positions to operate the program totaling $135,000 out of the General Revenue Fund for salaries and wages each fiscal year. Benefit costs associated with those positions, and appropriated to the Employee Retirement System, would total $40,149 out of the General Revenue Fund each fiscal year. In addition, $12,207 out of the General Revenue Fund would be needed each fiscal year for other personnel costs. Travel related expenses for staff to attend meetings and training seminars would total $12,000 out of the General Revenue Fund each fiscal year. On-going operating costs, such as consumable supplies, would be $12,891 out of the General Revenue Fund each remaining fiscal year. A one-time cost in fiscal year 2014 totaling $6,654 out of the General Revenue Fund would be required for telephones, desks, and other office equipment. An additional one-time cost of $5,970 in fiscal year 2014 would be required to print brochures and other materials to promote the program.

The bill would take effect immediately if it receives a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. Otherwise, the bill would take September 1, 2013.
