E911
Government GPS/E911

The Global Positioning System/Emergency 911 (GPS/E911) requirement helps emergency response teams quickly and accurately determine the location of an incoming 911 emergency call where public safety answering points have compatible systems. Using the Global Positioning System (GPS) functionality in each Verizon Wireless voice device, you can zero in on the location of a 911 call, saving response time and without needing a description from the caller.

Verizon Wireless has devoted significant resources to upgrading its nationwide network to support the government GPS/E911 requirement when requested by Public Safety organizations.
