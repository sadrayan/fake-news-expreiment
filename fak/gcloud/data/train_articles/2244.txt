Brody File Exclusive: Donald Trump Explains Pro-Life Conversion
In an exclusive interview with The Brody File, Donald Trump explains why he changed his view from pro-choice to pro-life.

He says one of the main reasons was because one of his close personal friends chose to keep his child rather than have an abortion.

Trump is seriously considering running for President. The Brody File spoke exclusively with him at Trump Tower in New York City. The interview lasted over 30 minutes and includes lots of interesting answers about issues important to Evangelicals.

The full 5-minute piece on Trump will air across the country on "The 700 Club" next Thursday. Clips will begin to appear on The Brody File next week.

In addition, the entire 30 minute Brody File show will be devoted to Donald Trump next week. Read his pro-life answer below and watch the clip as well.



David Brody: “Evangelicals do want to feel secure that they’re going to have a nominee that’s going to at least be solid on those issues, those social issues. Someone that’s not just going to cut and move on.”

Donald Trump: One thing about me, I'm a very honorable guy. I'm pro-life, but I changed my view a number of years ago. One of the reasons I changed -- one of the primary reasons -- a friend of mine's wife was pregnant, in this case married.

She was pregnant and he didn't really want the baby. And he was telling me the story. He was crying as he was telling me the story. He ends up having the baby and the baby is the apple of his eye.It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.

And you know here's a baby that wasn't going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life.

David Brody: So those stories did change you, they came around and changed you?

Trump: They changed me. Yeah, they changed my view as to that, absolutely.
