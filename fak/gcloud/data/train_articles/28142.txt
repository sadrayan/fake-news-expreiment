Reese's Peanut Butter Cups: The Untold Story: Inventor, H.B. Reese: Andrew R Reese: 9780595491070: Books
I had the opportunity to hear about this book years ago when I worked with the author. I of course had asked him about his last name, which lead to he was writing a book. I did not mention at the time, of course that Reeses Peanut Butter Cup is by far my favorite candy. And then I see his book he once mentioned for sale on Amazon.



This book is a very interesting story about candy, the people and an area.
