Trump Camp Reassures Pastors After Abortion Ruling

The Hill

Following the Supreme Court’s first major decision on abortion in almost two decades, Donald Trump’s campaign comforted Christian leaders “upset by the Supreme Court’s latest abortion ruling,” according to a new Bloomberg report.

Mr. Trump’s Executive Evangelical Advisory Board said in a statement, “In an unprecedented meeting last week with American Christian leaders, Donald J. Trump promised to only appoint pro-life judges.”

In a 5-3 decision, The Supreme Court on Monday decided Texas cannot enforce one of the nation’s strictest abortion laws.

The decision halts Texas from two major segments of its 2013 abortion law—requiring “doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles,” and requiring that “clinics meet the stricter standards of hospital-style ‘ambulatory surgical centers.’”

Mark Burns, a member of Trump’s evangelical board stated, “This is exactly why many Christians across America are single issue voters this election. Their sole focus is the types of Supreme Court justices that each candidate will appoint.”
