For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov. This is a life-threatening situation. A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. Preparations to protect life and property should already be complete. Interests in southwestern Louisiana should continue to monitor the progress of this system.

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK ------------------------------ At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Harvey was located near latitude 28.2 North, longitude 97.0 West. Harvey has made a second landfall along the northeastern shore of Copano Bay, Texas. Harvey is moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). The hurricane is expected to slow down further during the next day or so, and it will meander over southeastern Texas through the middle of next week. Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher gusts. Harvey is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours while the center of Harvey is over southeastern Texas. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km). A Texas Coastal Ocean Observing Network station at the Aransas Wildlife Refuge recently measured sustained hurricane- force winds of 74 mph (119 km/h) and a wind gust to 98 mph (157 km/h). A National Ocean Service tide gauge at Port Lavaca, Texas, recently reported a water level of 5.9 ft above Mean Higher High Water. The estimated minimum central pressure is 942 mb (27.82 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- RAINFALL: Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 15 to 30 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 40 inches over the middle and upper Texas coast through next Wednesday. During the same time period Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 5 to 15 inches in far south Texas and the Texas Hill Country over through southwest and central Louisiana. Rainfall of this magnitude will cause catastrophic and life-threatening flooding. STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water is expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Port Aransas to Port O'Connor...9 to 13 ft Port O'Connor to Sargent...6 to 9 ft N Entrance Padre Island Natl Seashore to Port Aransas...5 to 8 ft Sargent to Jamaica Beach...4 to 6 ft Port Mansfield to N Entrance Padre Island Natl Seashore...3 to 5 ft Jamaica Beach to High Island...2 to 4 ft Mouth of the Rio Grande to Port Mansfield...1 to 3 ft High Island to Morgan City...1 to 3 ft The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the northeast of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. WIND: Hurricane conditions are occuring along portions of the middle Texas coast within the hurricane warning area and are spreading inland as the eye continues to move farther onshore. Tropical storm conditions are occurring in other portions of the hurricane and tropical storm warning areas. Tropical storm conditions are likely to persist along portions of the coast through at least Sunday. SURF: Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the Texas, Louisiana, and northeast Mexico coasts. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office. TORNADOES: Tornadoes are possible through Saturday near the middle and upper Texas coast into far southwest Louisiana.
