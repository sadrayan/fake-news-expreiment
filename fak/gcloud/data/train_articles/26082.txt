Upton on Updates to the American Health Care Act
U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, tonight released the following statement on positive updates made to the American Health Care Act:

“This week, I expressed my deep concerns with the AHCA as it was written to both President Trump and our leadership. We immediately got to work on a responsible fix.

“This amendment would provide additional funding, $8 billion over five years, to ensure a strong safety net and reduce premiums, or other out-of-pocket costs, for those with pre-existing conditions.”

“Obamacare is just not working for so many Americans. I’ve been on the record for many years in favor of repealing and replacing Obamacare with responsible solutions that improve affordability and access while protecting those with pre-existing conditions. I believe that with this new funding in place, we keep our promise to those with pre-existing conditions.”
