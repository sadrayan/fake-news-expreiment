Our back-up for the claim in our television commercial:

FY2015 budget (fee increase):

City of Austin Press Release Showing Fee Increases: http://www.austintexas.gov/news/city-council-adopts-fiscal-year-2014-2015-budget

Martinez has Voted to Raise Taxes and Utility Rates while Ending Free Bus Service for Seniors

In addition to FY2015 budget increasing taxes and fees…(just a few examples)

2012: Statesman-Austin City Council’s Budget Does Not Address Affordability: “If there were one message the public delivered loudly and clearly during recent Austin City Council elections, it was that Austin was becoming increasingly unaffordable for working income people…But City hall either didn’t get the message or chose to ignore it. That much is clear from the significant and unnecessary tax increase that six council members approved last week” (Leffingwell lone no vote)

Subject: Following up

How would Steve Adler have voted on the tax rate and utility rate increases adopted by the council in Martinez’s tenure and why? If he’d have voted against any particular increases, what would he have not funded or how would he have otherwise supported generating revenue?

Not to be difficult, but there is no quick or simple answer to your additional question.

For example (not meant to be exhaustive), the legislature recommended ending free fares for seniors unless or until Capital Metro reserves exceeded approximately $27 million. Seniors do not have free fares, yet reserves are substantially in excess of that amount. Steve does believes seniors should be getting free fares (recognizing that about 90% of the cost of the ride is paid with sales tax revenue and seniors participate in paying this cost together with the rest of us). The drainage fee charged on utility bills is unfair and improperly being charged and Steve would have supported changing this fee and lowering it for many renters.

Steve advocates for a 20% homeowners exemption to the city's property tax levy and had this been implemented it would have lowered taxes for homeowners below what was adopted. Steve believes fundamental change in the ultimate budget decisions made in the Fall are dependent on how the process develops and moves earlier in the year and that the city should be moving towards more interaction and involvement with the philanthropy and social bonding which could impact city spending.
