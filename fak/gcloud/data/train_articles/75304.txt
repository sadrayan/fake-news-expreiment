Congress has yet to extend popular Texas sales tax deduction
WASHINGTON — Texans could soon pay the price for congressional inaction.

Lawmakers left town Friday for a two-month recess without extending a popular income tax deduction for sales tax.

Nearly 1 in 5 Texas taxpayers used the provision last year. If Congress doesn’t restore it, they’ll owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April, according to the state comptroller.

In most states, taxpayers can deduct state income tax payments from their federal tax bill.

For the past 10 years, Congress has let taxpayers in states with no income tax — Texas and six others — deduct state and local sales taxes instead. But it has never made that option permanent.

In 2012, 2.3 million Texas filers used the sales tax deduction. The average for those who claimed it was $1,906, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts report released last week.

“As our population and economy grow, it will save taxpayers even more,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. “This is an issue of tax fairness.”

Lawmakers plan to take up the issue after the November elections, and Brady predicted strong bipartisan support to extend the sales tax deduction.

“The question is: Is it before the end of the year or after?” he said.

On the to-do list

Congress will consider the sales tax deduction along with a long list of other expiring tax breaks. Republicans and Democrats say they want to extend about 50 temporary tax breaks worth a total of about $85 billion.

Democrats blame Republicans for leaving the sales tax issue unresolved.

“Unfortunately, House Republicans have failed to act to extend this — while passing permanent extensions of a dozen other provisions at a cost of $825 billion,” said Caroline Behringer, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee.

House Republicans have said the tax breaks should be addressed piecemeal rather than all at once.

In April, the Senate Finance Committee passed a bill that extended the sales tax deduction, among a host of tax provisions. At the time, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, backed many parts of that package, including the sales tax deduction. But he voiced concerns over some elements of the measure, including ethanol subsidies.

“This is how bad legislation gets passed,” he said. “You bundle it together with a bunch of meritorious pieces of legislation and you try to pass it all as is.”

The full Senate hasn’t voted on that bill.

In Congress, the sales tax issue has generally united lawmakers along regional lines. Regardless of party, lawmakers from the seven states with no state income tax have worked to protect the deduction.

Anyone can choose the sales tax deduction when filing with the IRS, though that rarely makes sense for residents of states with an income tax. Texans claim the deduction at a higher rate than anyone outside Washington state and Nevada, according to the Pew report.

Past lapses

Congress allowed the sales tax deduction to lapse in 1986 but revived it in 2004, under legislation championed by former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. Since then, Congress has reauthorized the deduction one or two years at a time.

“It’s a legacy of past tax reform that this provision is temporary,” said Kasia O’Neill Murray, who studies the issue at Pew.

The deduction has expired before.

In 2013, it lapsed on New Year’s Day. Congress later reauthorized it as part of a deal to stave off the “fiscal cliff” — steep budget cuts and tax increases that were set to kick in.

For many years, lawmakers from Texas and its allies have sought to make the deduction permanent. But the coalition never managed to round up enough support.

“It’s not a broad enough issue for the federal government,” said Norton Francis, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute’s State and Local Finance Initiative.

Brady said the perennial need for Congress to address the sales tax deduction underscores the need for more lasting changes in tax policy.

“It really is way past time that we remove the temporary asterisk from these provisions and bring about real tax reform,” he said.
