Since the mid 1980's when the idea of anthropogenic global warming due to 'Carbon emissions" started to take on a political form, many nations in the free world have fallen victim to a nefarious scheme of taxation known as Carbon Taxing and Carbon Trading schemes or clean (green) energy subsidies, under a series of international binding agreements aimed at the reduction of CO2 emissions, such as the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Accord and the so called Paris COP21 accord.



The continued propagation of a false belief in anthropogenically induced climate change is an insidious form of cultism that has been adopted by governments in the free world, and one that must be challenged and exposed before all people become it's victims.



At its core this belief system is held in a state of manufactured reality by *Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)* which continues to churn out false and misleading annual reports and peer review papers aimed at its maintenance, via a vast network of online representation and public media propaganda including the banning of opposing views from being aired .



Advocates of Anthropogenic climate change (aka AGW) however have failed to convince the public of their claim that current climate events are caused by man-made emissions of what they term as "Greenhouse Gases", such as CO2.



Furthermore, in 2011 The United States Congress cut funding to the scientific panel which was mandated to investigate climate change (if any) and it's possible causes. The panel has repeatedly failed to convincingly place forward a set of scientific findings that can support the theory of man-made climate change beyond a reasonable scientific doubt and in line with geological evidence.



Moreover the political polarization of the IPCC has led to a widening gap within the scientific community in regards to man-made emissions having anything to do with climate temperatures at all.



Followers and contributors are encouraged to participate in posting and engagement in debates which refute the very nature of claims that implicate "man" as being responsible for earth's climate temperatures.



Specifically we would like to address the ultimate questions regarding why this claim exists, Who does it serve,how it must be challenged and long term implications involved with a blind following of this theory.
