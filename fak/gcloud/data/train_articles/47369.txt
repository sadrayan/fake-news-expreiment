F.B.I. Finds No Evidence of Attack in Death of Border Agent
Mr. Garland, who also had major head injuries and broken bones, was later released from the hospital.

Angie Ochoa, who was engaged to Mr. Martinez, said on Wednesday that she first learned of the autopsy results in a meeting with law enforcement officials two weeks ago, and was worried that investigators would move on from the case, even though the report was inconclusive.

“I was shocked, I was angry, I was disappointed,” Ms. Ochoa said, “because now I think that they are going to end the investigation and that’s it.”

The autopsy report noted that a barbiturate was found in his system. It can cause drowsiness and can be used along with other medications, such as acetaminophen, to treat headaches and pain.

Ms. Ochoa said she was shocked to learn that her fiancé had a barbiturate in his system when he died. “It doesn’t make sense because Roger never took anything; we had nothing at home,” she said, adding that he had not been to a doctor.

But Ms. Ochoa said that in the days before he died, Mr. Martinez had been complaining of headaches and neck tension. She thought it was possible that he could have accepted the medication from a friend or colleague without realizing how much of an effect it might have on him.

Chris Cabrera, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, said that despite the F.B.I.’s report and the autopsy results, he still believed that Mr. Martinez was attacked on the night of Nov. 18. He noted that the autopsy did not find injuries below his torso that could have indicated that the agents were hit by a vehicle or involved in an accident.

“It says that there is no evidence pointing it to being a struggle,” Mr. Cabrera said in an interview. “But then the F.B.I. still retains jurisdiction over it, and it doesn’t investigate accidents.”
