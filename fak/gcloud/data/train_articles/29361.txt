Revisions and Methodology Change: With the release of January 2019 data on March 15, job openings, hires, and separations data have been revised to incorporate annual updates to the Current Employment Statistics employment estimates and the JOLTS seasonal adjustment factors. Unadjusted data and seasonally adjusted data from December 2000 forward are subject to revision. Additionally, a new methodology for item imputation has been implemented. Tables showing the revisions can be found using this link: https://www.bls.gov/jlt/revisiontables.htm.

JOLTS Data by Establishment Size JOLTS staff are conducting research on the development of data by size class, and have produced a research series of size class estimates stretching back to December of 2000, when the JOLTS series began. These experimental size class estimates are now available upon request. These data are based on size of establishment and cover only the total private sector. This experimental series will be updated periodically, as resources permit. To obtain these data, please contact us by e-mail or (202) 691-5870. For information regarding the methodology used to develop the size class data please view our size class methodology.
