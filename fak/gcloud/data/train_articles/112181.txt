The Daily News said Trump played at Trump International early Sunday as part of two foursomes that were accompanied by Secret Service agents.

The newspaper added about 30 members were also dining or socializing at the club that morning, including Patrick Park, Trump’s choice for ambassador to Austria.

Trump was spotted twice at his golf course in West Palm Beach over the weekend following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago last week.

Trump hosted Xi at his resort late Thursday, with the pair of leaders conducting talks into Friday afternoon.

Trump said Friday that he had made “tremendous progress” with Xi, adding it was “very interesting” conducting his first in-person talks with the Chinese leader.

Xi’s visit to Mar-a-Lago was largely overshadowed by Trump’s decision to launch a missile strike on Syria.

Trump administration officials believe the strikes could force China into taking seriously the president’s threat of unilateral action against North Korea’s nuclear program.
