Arapahoe High School (Colorado)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Arapahoe High School is a public high school in Centennial, Colorado, United States.[1] Located in a suburb of Denver, it is the flagship of the Littleton Public Schools District as the largest of three high schools, with an enrollment of 2,229 students. It has been designated a Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.

Arapahoe consistently places "Excellent" on Colorado's statewide school accountability report, the only Littleton Public Schools high school to do so.[2]

The school is known for its affiliation with the Arapaho tribe of Wind River, Wyoming.

History [ edit ]

Arapahoe High School was built in 1964. Several additions have been made since then:

1965: A gymnasium, built by Morse, Dion & Champion, architects; and Hollister, general contractor

1967: An addition of a pool, classrooms and theater, built by Morse, Dion & Champion, architects; and Webco, general contractor.

1979: An addition of locker rooms, wrestling facilities and a gymnastics gym, built by Allred/Fisher, architects; and Frank Hall & Co., construction management.

1987: An addition of administration and counseling space, by Culbertson & Associates, who served as designer and general contractor.

1997: The school's aging interior library was replaced with classrooms, and a new library and media center were constructed on the north side of the building. Accessibility was improved with the construction of an elevator adjacent to second-floor classrooms and a student-designed east entrance with wheelchair ramps and automated doors, nicknamed "The Bubble."

2005: The school underwent significant remodeling. A new gymnasium was added, several classrooms were redesigned and walls were rebuilt to meet fire code standards.

2014: In the aftermath of a school shooting in 2013, in which parts of the library were burned, a remodeled library was constructed in the same space.

As of 2013 , the school has 70 classrooms.[3]

On December 13, 2013, a shooting occurred at the school. The gunman, an 18-year-old student,[4][5] entered the school armed with a shotgun, a machete, three Molotov cocktails, and 125 rounds of ammunition.[6][7] He requested to see the school librarian,[8] who was also the coach of the school debate team.[8] The shooter's demotion on the team was a contributing motive to the shooting.[9][10][11] One student was shot in the head and died eight days later.[12][13][14][15][16] The shooter attempted to start a fire with one of the devices he had carried with him and then shot himself in the head.[17][18][19]

Facilities [ edit ]

The 254,756-square-foot (23,667.6 m2) high school has two gyms, a weight room, a library, kitchen, a 647-seat theater, 70 classrooms, a pool, tennis courts, baseball, football, and two soccer fields, as well as a track.

Native American relationship [ edit ]

The school has a unique relationship with the Arapaho tribe.

After complaints about the pejorative depiction of Native Americans, principal Ron Booth sought a direct relationship with the tribe by travelling to the tribe's location in Wyoming for a personal meeting with tribal elders. After an extensive process, the tribe and Chief Anthony Sitting Eagle approved a relationship between the school and the tribe, establishing relationship methodology through a specific declaration.[20]

The original logo of Arapahoe High School more closely depicted a Pawnee Indian. On September 17, 1993 the Arapaho Nation and Arapahoe High School held the Arapahoe Warrior Assembly. This assembly dedicated the school's new, and current, Warrior mascot, created by Northern Arapaho artist, Wilbur Antelope.

Since then, the Northern Arapaho tribe has endorsed the name of the high school (as spelled with an "e" at the end) and its use of the current warrior mascot, provided by the tribe. The large gym was refinished and renamed the Sitting Eagle Gymnasium (this is now the second gym) on December 9, 1995.

According to the original agreement made by the school, the mascot is not to be put on the floor (where one could walk on it) or on any article of clothing.[20] However, whether through subsequent agreement or disregard on the part of the school, the mascot can be found on a wide variety of clothing. However, it is not found on any football uniform (where it may be rubbed into the ground), and the school does not portray a Native American Warrior at any sporting event.

Tribal members visit the school for important events, speaking every year at graduation, and every two years a larger group will visit the school to perform various traditional dances and speak about Native American culture.

Athletics [ edit ]

Arapahoe is part of the 8-team Centennial League that also includes Cherry Creek, Grandview, Cherokee Trail, Smoky Hill, Eaglecrest, Mullen, and Overland.[21]

Arapahoe athletics include baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, football, golf, lacrosse, marching band, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, volleyball, winter guard, and wrestling. All athletics at Arapahoe are competed at the 5A / world level.

Girls' golf won the Colorado State Championship in 2010.

The Arapahoe soccer program, known as ABK (Arapahoe Ball Kickers), holds 14 state championships; the girls' program has won nine state titles and the boys' program has five state titles. In 1997 and 1998, members of the ABK and friends formed the Jolly Green Men, supporters of the Colorado Rapids soccer club.
