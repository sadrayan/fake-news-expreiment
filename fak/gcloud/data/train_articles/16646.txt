Good morning. At the suggestion of Dennis Feltgen at the National Hurricane Center, I write seeking your help today in the wake of a claim by President Trump on Wednesday that last year when the Coast Guard rescued many from Hurricane Harvey, “people went out in their boats to watch the hurricane.”

As far as NOAA knows, did people do this then? If so, is there a solid count or federal reporting of this?

Generally, do people go out on boats to watch hurricanes?

What factual information otherwise best pertains to this claim?

We rely on attributable on-the-record information for our stories.

I would appreciate a response by phone or email soon.

Thanks,

I would say that's a question for the Coast Guard and/or local emergency management/rescue organizations who have firsthand knowledge of what residents may have been doing ahead of Harvey.

At NOAA, our National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center focus on the meteorology.
