Rated 5 out of 5 by Cliff from game changer berry I bought six plants this spring, early summer they started to produce a handful of berries, they were absolutely out of this world. I allowed the plants to start running and they produced over 1600 suckers, they are extremely prolific. I planted 1000 of them in late September along with 200 pollinator red strawberry's and they are all doing well. Hope to make a splash with them at the local farmers market.

Rated 1 out of 5 by SJYM from Disappointed in Burpee My daughter was so excited to grow this White strawberry with a pineapple taste. Well we were disappointed that it did not bear any fruit. So I looked online for information. I had to find out from another website that PINE-BERRIES ARE ALL FEMALE plants! No where on Burpee website does it say that you need to have a least two strawberry plants near it so it can pollinate it. So I will now purchase two plants next year from another place. I hope other people read this and are informed.
