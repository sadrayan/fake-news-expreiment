Status of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions: Interactive Map
State Summary of Activity

United States Coverage under the Medicaid expansion became effective January 1, 2014 in all states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion except for the following: Michigan (4/1/2014), New Hampshire (8/15/2014), Pennsylvania (1/1/2015), Indiana (2/1/2015), Alaska (9/1/2015), Montana (1/1/2016), Louisiana (7/1/2016), Virginia (1/1/2019), Maine (1/10/2019 with coverage retroactive to 7/2/2018), and Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah (to be determined). Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Ohio have approved Section 1115 waivers to operate their Medicaid expansion programs in ways not otherwise allowed under federal law. Arkansas continues to operate its expansion program through a waiver, however, the waiver provisions related to the work requirement and reduction of retroactive eligibility were set aside by court on March 27, 2019.

Idaho Idaho voters approved a ballot measure in November 2018 that requires the state to submit a state plan amendment (SPA) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to implement the Medicaid expansion within 90 days of approval of the measure. Idaho submitted a SPA for the Medicaid expansion in February 2019. On April 9, 2019, Idaho Governor Little signed a bill passed by the legislature that makes changes to the Medicaid expansion program approved by voters. The legislation directs the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek a Section 1115 waiver for multiple changes, including to add a work requirement as a condition of eligibility for coverage; implement a form of “partial expansion” in which the state would access the ACA enhanced match rate for the newly eligible population up to 100% FPL and individuals between 100-138% FPL who choose to opt-in to Medicaid coverage (the default for that population would be qualified health plan (QHP) coverage in the Marketplace with advance premium tax credits); and to use Medicaid funds to pay for substance use and/or mental health services in institutions for mental disease (IMDs). The legislation specifies that if the waivers are not approved by January 1, 2020, then all individuals up to 138% FPL will be enrolled in Medicaid.

Kentucky On March 27, 2019, the court set aside the reapproved Kentucky HEALTH waiver. In its previous decision, the court had set aside the original waiver approval, and on November 20, 2018, CMS reapproved the Kentucky HEALTH waiver with minor technical changes. Unless and until HHS issues another approval that passes legal muster or prevails on appeal, the work requirement, monthly premiums up to 4% of income, coverage lockouts for failure to timely renew eligibility or timely report a change in circumstances, heightened cost-sharing for non-emergency ER use, and elimination of retroactive eligibility and non-emergency medical transportation will not be implemented. The separate “institution for mental disease” substance use disorder payment waiver was not set aside and was allowed to go into effect. Kentucky’s expansion program was originally implemented and continues to operate under SPA authority.

Maine Maine implemented expansion on January 10, 2019. Maine adopted the Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative in November 2017. After former Governor LePage delayed implementation of the expansion for months, new Governor Mills signed an executive order on her first day in office (January 3, 2019) directing the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to begin expansion implementation and provide coverage to those eligible retroactive to July 2018. CMS approved the state’s plan retroactive to July 2, 2018 on April 3, 2019.

Montana On April 18, 2019, the Montana Legislature passed a bill (which was signed by Governor Bullock on May 9, 2019) to continue the state’s expansion program with significant changes until 2025. This action came after Montana voters voted down a measure on the November 2018 ballot that would have extended the Medicaid expansion beyond the June 30, 2019 sunset date and raised taxes on tobacco products to finance the expansion. The approved bill directs the state to seek federal waiver authority to make several changes to the existing expansion program, including adding a work requirement as a condition of eligibility and increasing the premiums required of many beneficiaries. The legislation directs the state to submit a Section 1115 waiver proposal with these changes to CMS no later than August 30, 2019.

Nebraska Nebraska voters approved a Medicaid expansion ballot measure in November 2018 and the state submitted a state plan amendment (SPA) for the expansion on April 1, 2019. The SPA delays Medicaid expansion implementation until October 1, 2020 to allow time for the state to seek a Section 1115 waiver to implement expansion with program elements that differ from what is allowed under federal law.

Utah Utah voters passed a ballot measure in November 2018 that required the state to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) beginning April 1, 2019 and increased the state sales tax to finance the expansion. On February 11, 2019 Governor Herbert signed legislation that made significant changes to the version of expansion that voters approved. The legislation directs the Utah Department of Health to request Section 1115 waiver authority to make a number of changes to the expansion program, including to use ACA enhanced federal matching funds for a partial expansion to 100% FPL, to add a work requirement as a condition of eligibility, to cap enrollment in expansion coverage, and to incorporate a per capita cap on federal reimbursement. CMS approved a demonstration waiver in Utah to adults with incomes up to 100% FPL beginning on April 1, 2019 using the state’s regular Medicaid match rate, not the enhanced ACA match rate. The state has authority to close enrollment for this group if projected costs exceed state appropriations. Non-exempt individuals in this group will be subject to a work requirement, which is set to begin no sooner than January 2020. As explained in Utah’s Medicaid expansion implementation toolkit, the state is expected to submit another Section 1115 waiver amendment to CMS in Spring 2020 that would request additional program changes, including authority to use the ACA enhanced match rate for the partial expansion population up to 100% FPL as well as a per capita cap.

Virginia The Virginia General Assembly approved Medicaid expansion as part of its FY 2019-2020 budget on May 30, 2018; Governor Northam signed the budget into law on June 7, 2018. Expansion coverage became effective under state plan amendment (SPA) authority on January 1, 2019 after enrollment began on November 1, 2018.
