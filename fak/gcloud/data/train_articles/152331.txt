The History Behind The Sad Keanu Meme
One fateful day in 2010, Keanu Reeves sat down on a bench in New York to enjoy a sandwich. Well, perhaps enjoy is not the right word, as the actor looked absolutely miserable at the time. A nearby photographer snapped a photo of the star, and thus began the history of the Sad Keanu meme.

While memes can live and die in a single day thanks to the breakneck pace of the internet, few have managed to make as big an impact as the Keanu Reeves meme. Upon first discovery, the joke was quickly picked up by hundreds of thousands of people, up until the DMCA began issuing takedown notices to prominent meme pages. Even compared to past Keanu memes, this one grabbed the attention of the public in a way that was absolutely unprecedented.

The true story behind the Sad Keanu Reeves meme is one for the history books. From the legal backlash, to the outpour of support from fans who believed the star was a wonderful person, don't be surprised if this tale goes on to serve as the inspiration for a future "Best Picture" Oscar nominee.
