Humanity First
It's hard for me to take them seriously after one of their guys came to my home town to find out why no gay people lived in the county. He came during hunting season and there were a lot of out of town hunters there wearing camo. He assumed we dress l

ike that all of the time. He incorrectly reported that the National Guard Armory was our school with bars on the windows and a cannon out front. He outed my gay uncle on CNN and even posted a pic of the store he owns and called him pot belly because he's is overweight. Several inconsistencies. He even snarked about our national forest. He came to dig, insinuate, humiliate, and poke fun at people without even seeing the beauty all around him. What a freaking joke!!!! The ppl could have put they were gay on the census, just chose not to. Whose business is it anyway????
