Marijuana laws in all 50 states

(Editorâ€™s note: This is part of "The United States of Weed," a series on the movement to legalize marijuana for recreational use in New Jersey, and the potential impact it could have on Staten Island.)

STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Should New Jersey legalize recreational marijuana use, it would become the 10th state to do so.

Recreational marijuana use is currently legal in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. A law legalizing it in Vermont will go into effect July 1.

It also is legal in Washington, D.C.

Here are the medical and recreational marijuana laws -- as well as the legal limits -- for all 50 states and Washington, D.C.
