Chopra Denounces McDonnell's Proposed Abortion Ban Amendment

ARLINGTON, VA - Candidate for Virginia Lt. Governor Aneesh Chopra spoke out today against Governor Bob McDonnell's proposed amendment to HB1900/SB921 that would prohibit Virginians participating in healthcare exchanges from purchasing insurance plans that cover abortion services. This amendment not only interferes with a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, but also hampers insurance companies with needless restrictions on the coverage they can offer in the marketplace. Currently, nearly 90% of private insurance plans offer basic abortion coverage.

"Once again, we have lawmakers forcing themselves into women's private healthcare decisions," Chopra said. "Prohibiting insurance coverage for safe and legal medical services is irresponsible and reckless. We must end this cycle of politicians putting the health of Virginia women at risk to score political points. We should focus on moving towards a healthcare system that focuses on caring for our sick neighbors in a more coordinated way and lowering costs by reducing waste and inefficiency."

Chopra urges that the amendment be rejected, saying "this extreme amendment would deny many Virginia women the choice to purchase comprehensive medical coverage with their own dollars. That is unacceptable and would set a dangerous precedent -- allowing extreme ideologies to overrule medically sound decisions made between a woman and her doctor."
