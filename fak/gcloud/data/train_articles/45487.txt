2 GROUPS OPPOSE SOUTER AT HEARING
The leaders of two major abortion rights groups urged the Senate Judiciary Committee today to reject the nomination of David H. Souter for the Supreme Court, but several Senators told them that Judge Souter was probably the least hostile nominee they could expect from the Bush Administration.

The executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, Kate Michelman, told the committee, ''After listening to Judge Souter's testimony, we remain intensely concerned that, if confirmed, he would destroy 17 years of precedent and cast the deciding vote to overrule Roe v. Wade.'' That 1973 ruling established a constitutional right to obtain an abortion.

She was joined in opposing the nomination by Faye Wattleton, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.

They were quickly challenged by several Senators who said that Judge Souter's statements before the committee did not provide sufficient reason to oppose his confirmation to the Supreme Court. In his three days of testimony, Judge Souter refused to hint as to how he would vote on any challenge to Roe v. Wade, but said that he would approach such cases with an open mind and that he had no personal agenda on abortion.

'It Is Not Realistic'

''I just think it is not realistic to expect that if Judge Souter is turned down we will find a nominee who will pass your test - that is, a commitment to uphold Roe v. Wade,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who supports abortion rights.
