1985



Caldwell v.

Baldwin v. Alabama 472 U.S. 372: The Court held that Alabama’s death penalty statue, which required jurors to return a non-binding death sentence upon finding the defendant guilty of certain aggravated crimes, but allowed the trial judge to decide punishment after independent consideration of defendant and crime, did not violate the 8th Amendment.

Cabana v. Bullock 474 U.S. 372: The Court held that the fact-finding required to prove that the defendant killed, attempted to kill or intended that a killing take place or that lethal force be used, need not be made by a fact-finder at trial and sentencing, but can be made by trial Courts or state appellate Courts.

Turner v. Murray 476 U.S. 28: The Court held that a defendant accused of an interracial crime is entitled under 6th and 14th Amendments to have jurors informed of the race of the victim and be questioned on the issue of racial bias; refusal to do so would vacate the death sentence.

Booth v. Maryland 482 U.S. 496: The Court held that the introduction of a Victim impact Statement at the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial violates the Eighth Amendment, and therefore the Maryland statute is invalid to the extent it requires consideration of this information.

Lowenfield v. Phelps 484 U.S. 231: The Court held that a death sentence does not violate the Eight Amendment simply because the single statutory aggravating circumstance found by the jury duplicates an element of the underlying offense of first-degree murder.



1989



Hildwin v. Florida 490 U.S. 638: The Court held that the 6th Amendment does not require a jury which renders advisory sentencing verdicts to specify which aggravating circumstances justify imposition of death penalty.

Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302: The Court held that the the execution of persons with mentally retardation does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, but that state the capital sentencer must have a mechanism to consider and give full effect to mental retardation as a mitigating factor.

Stanford v. Kentucky 492 U.S. 361: The Court held that the imposition of capital punishment on an individual for a crime committed at 16 or 17 years of age does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.



1990



Walton v. Arizona 497 U.S. 639: The Court held that under the Sixth Amendment, a jury was not required to pass on the aggravated factors in order to impose a death sentence under Arizona law.

1992



Dawson v. Delaware 503 U.S. 159: The Court found that the introduction of evidence that tied the defendant to the Aryan Brotherhood violated the defendant’s 1st and 14th Amendment rights because the evidence had no relevance to the issues being decided in the proceedings.



Espinosa v. Florida 505 U.S. 1079: The Court reversed Espinosa’s death sentence, finding that the jury’s consideration of the crime as "especially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel," was an unconstitutionally vague statutory requirement.

1993



Arave v. Creech 507 U.S. 463: Court found that Idaho’s aggravating circumstance asking the jury to consider the “utter disregard for human life” was not vague, and thus, constitutionally permissible.



Johnson v. Texas 509 U.S. 350: The Court rejected Johnson’s claim that Penry v. Lynaugh required separate instruction on the question regarding his youth in the sentencing phase of his capital trial.

Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390: Leonel Herrera presented evidence from a variety of witnesses, including an eyewitness to the murder and a former Texas state judge, indicating someone else had committed the crime he was conicted of. However, the Court, while assuming that a claim of innocence raised a constitutional issue, held that Herrera's evidence was insufficient to merit a federal hearing, and noted he had recourse to the clemency process in Texas.



1994

Romano v. Oklahoma 512 U.S. 1: The Court held that the admission of a defendant’s death sentence in a prior trial during the sentencing phase of his second capital trial did not amount to a constitutional violation.

1995



Harris v. Alabama 513 U.S. 504: The Court held that the Eighth Amendment does not require the State to define the weight the sentencing judge must give to an advisory jury verdict.
