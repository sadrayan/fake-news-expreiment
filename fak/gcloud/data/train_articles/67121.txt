He had apparently told a friend before he was sworn in that he had given up the phone at the advice of security agencies.

Trump is known for tweeting personally from his device, an Android smartphone, often posting announcements or attacking his rivals.

After his victory last year, the president expressed concern that he wouldn't be able to continue using his Android cellphone when he assumed office.

The president told the Times on Tuesday the White House has the "most beautiful phones I've ever used in my life."

“The world’s most secure system,” he added. “The words just explode in the air."
