At First Glance You See Palestinian Martyrs Until One Needs To Scratch His Nose â‹† WayneDupree.com
Wayne, I'm surprised you've never seen anything this blatantly obvious captured on video. Paliwood has been cranking this stuff out for years. I remember the video P-38 describes below of the fake dead guy. My recollection is that he climbed back on the stretcher and they continued filming, sort of like they would cut that part out in the edit.

Another great Paliwood scene was when the IDF had the poor poor Palestinian freedom fighter pinned down and he was in a firefight for his life, one man against the combined strength of Israel. Then the camera pulled back to a wider angle that showed people on the street going about their daily routine as though nothing unusual were taking place.

I wonder if anything comes up if you google "the guy in the green vest". He was in a series of paliwood vids all filmed on the same day, all staged.
