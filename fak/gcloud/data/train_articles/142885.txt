I’m a little tired of black people in the ANC blaming apartheid for everything that is going wrong in SA- Thuli Mandosela
I’m a little tired of black people in the ANC blaming apartheid for everything that’s gone wrong in the past ten years in this country.

Playing the race card every time even though the evidence in front of you proves otherwise.

Don’t get me wrong, black people suffered greatly at the hands colonialist and so forth but we’ve had our democracy for far too long to still be crying about what went wrong instead of fixing what going wrong now.

Why aren’t you questioning our Affirmative action that isn’t being applied correctly?

The traditionalists within the Anc that have caused havoc in the last 7 years…

Under-qualified leaders in parastatals deployed by the Anc or the deployment policies themselves, why aren’t you questioning all of that?

White people may still have a hold on part of the economy in this country yes but that’s not our biggest problem – the problem is the inability to lead in a direction that is all inclusive and visionary for all who work hard.

Don’t you think maybe the fact that our president is under-qualified could be a factor?.

Have you not seen that the problems are largely with us.?
