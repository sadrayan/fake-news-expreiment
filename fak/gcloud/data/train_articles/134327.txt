Politics & Eggs - The New England Council
Politics & Eggs

“After 15 years it is without question THE must do event for every would-be President. It delivers great crowds, the national press loves it, and oh, those wooden eggs!!! Kudos to the NHIOP and the New England Council for keeping it going.” - WMUR's James Pindell on Politics & Eggs

Taking advantage of New England’s unique position as home to the nation’s first presidential primary in New Hampshire, the Politics & Eggs series was launched in 1996 as a forum for local business leaders to hear from presidential candidates in an intimate setting as they visit the Granite State to campaign and build early support.

Since its inception, the breakfast series has played host to nearly every major party presidential candidate and is today considered a “must-stop” on the presidential campaign trail.” In fact, Politics & Eggs made a cameo appearance in NBC’s hit show “The West Wing,” with candidates autographing the series’ signature wooden eggs.

In recent years, the series has expanded to include issues forums held in the years between presidential election cycles. These events feature nationally known political figures, analysts, and respected journalists. In addition, the series also often features candidates in U.S. Senate races in New Hampshire.

Politics & Eggs is a partnership between The New England Council and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics & Political Library at Saint Anselm College. Events held either on the campus of Saint Anselm College in Manchester, NH, or at the Bedford Village Inn in Bedford, New Hampshire, both just an hour’s drive from Boston and easily accessible from all parts of New England. Politics & Eggs events are open to NEC members, Event Sponsors, and their guests.
