Details Published: 23 October 2018

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia categorically rejects the allegations and qualifications presented in the comment published on 22 October 2018 by the Information and Press Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation as regards the passing of the proposal for constitutional amendments in the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia considers the allegations made in the comment to be completely unfounded and untrue, as well as presented with a clear tendency to compromise the political process which is of historic importance for the Republic of Macedonia and all its citizens. The MPs at the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, in full conformity with all democratic principles and proscribed parliamentary procedure, adopted a decision that reflects the decades-long commitment of the Republic of Macedonia to membership in NATO and the European Union as its strategic priority enjoying the widest possible social consensus and one which has long since been well known to our Russian friends.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia emphasises that, while remaining committed to Euro-Atlantic integration, the Republic of Macedonia will also continue to work on developing and advancing its relations with the Russian Federation, based on the traditional friendship between our two nations, as well as on the mutual respect and regard for the right to independently and freely choose oneâ€™s own future.
