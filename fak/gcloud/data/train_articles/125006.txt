Child sexual abuse disclosed in confession should be reported: royal commission
Priests would no longer be able to use the secrecy of the confessional to avoid reporting allegations of child sexual abuse, a royal commission recommends in its latest report.

In the wide-ranging report into the criminal justice system, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has made 85 recommendations aimed at better protecting children.

Failing to report information about child sexual abuse disclosed in confession should be made a criminal offence, a royal commission recommends.

One key recommendation is that failing to report information about child sexual abuse disclosed in confession should be made a criminal offence.

"The report recommends there be no exemption, excuse, protection or privilege from the offence granted to clergy for failing to report information disclosed in connection with a religious confession," it read.
