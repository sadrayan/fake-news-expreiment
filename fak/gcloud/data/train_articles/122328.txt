(8) Until the first rules made in pursuance of subsection (7) of this section come into force, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria shall not be entitled to engage in practice as a member of the legal profession otherwise than as a barrister, but nothing in this subsection shall be construed as precluding a Senior Advocate of Nigeria from entering into, or continuing in partnership with a legal practitioner who is not a Senior Advocate of Nigeria. 6.

(2) The Attorney-General may, after consultation with the Bar Council, by regulations provide for the enrolment of the names of persons who are authorised by law to practise as members of the legal profession in any country where, in his opinion, persons whose names are on the roll are afforded special facilities for practising as members of that profession; and, without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the regulations may- (a) require persons seeking enrolment by virtue of the regulations to pass such examinations and to pay such fees as may be specified by or under the regulations; (b) provide for the cancellation of enrolment having effect by virtue of the regulations where, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, the facilities aforesaid are altered or withdrawn. (3) Except in pursuance of a direction given under the following provisions of this Act by the Supreme Court or by the disciplinary committee established under those provisions, a person whose name has been struck off the roll in pursuance of a direction given either before or after the commencement of this Act by that court or in pursuance of a direction of the disciplinary committee shall not be entitled to have his name enrolled again. 8.

(2) No legal practitioner (other than such a person as is mentioned in subsection (3) of section 2 of this Act) shall be accorded the right of audience in any court in Nigeria in any year, unless he has paid to the registrar in respect of that year, a practising fee- (a) in the case of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, of N200; (b) in the case of a person of 15 or more years standing as a legal practitioner at the beginning of that year, not being a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, of N100; (c) in the case of a person of more than 10 but less than 15 years standing as a legal practitioner at the beginning of that year, not being a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, of N75; (d) in the case of a person of more than 5 but not more than 10 years standing as a legal practitioner at the beginning of that year, of N40; and (e) in any other case, of N20.

(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a person shall not be immune from liability for damage attributable to his negligence while acting in his capacity as a legal practitioner, and any provision purporting to exclude or limit that liability in any contract shall be void. (2) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section shall be construed as preventing the exclusion or limitation of the liability aforesaid in any case where a legal practitioner gives his services without reward either by way of fees, disbursements or otherwise. (3) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section shall affect the application to a legal practitioner of the rule of law exempting barristers from the liability aforesaid in so far as that rule applies to the conduct of proceedings in the face of any court, tribunal or other body. 10. (1) There shall be a committee to be known as the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee (hereafter in this Act referred to as "the disciplinary committee") which shall be charged with the duty of considering and determining any case where it is alleged that a person whose name is on the roll has misbehaved in his capacity as a legal practitioner or should for any other reason be the subject of proceedings under this Act. (2) The disciplinary committee shall consist of- (a) the Attorney-General of the Federation, who shall be chairman; (b) the Attorneys-General of the States in the Federation; (c) twelve legal practitioners of not less than ten years standing appointed by the Benchers on the nomination of the association. (3) The provisions of the Second Schedule to this Act shall have effect in relation to the disciplinary committee. 11. (1) Where- (a) a person whose name is on the roll is judged by the Disciplinary Committee to be guilty of infamous conduct in any professional respect; or (b) a person whose name is on the roll is convicted, by any court in Nigeria having power to award imprisonment, of an offence (whether or not an offence punishable with imprisonment) which in the opinion of the disciplinary committee is incompatible with the status of a legal practitioner; or (c) the disciplinary committee is satisfied that the name of any person has been fraudulently enrolled, the disciplinary committee, may, if it thinks fit, give a direction- (i) ordering the registrar to strike that person's name off the roll, or (ii) suspending that person from practice by ordering him not to engage in practice as a legal practitioner for such period as may be specified in the direction, or (iii) admonishing that person, and any such direction may, where appropriate, include provision requiring the refund of moneys paid or the handing over of documents or any other thing as the circumstances of the case may require. (2) Where a person whose name is on the roll is judged by the disciplinary committee to be guilty of misconduct not amounting to infamous conduct which, in the opinion of the disciplinary committee, is incompatible with the status of a legal practitioner, the disciplinary committee may, if it thinks fit, give such a direction as is authorised by paragraph (c) (ii) or (iii) of subsection (1) of this section; and any such direction may, where appropriate, include provision requiring the refund of moneys paid or the handing over of documents or any other thing, as the circumstances of the case may require. (3) The disciplinary committee may, if it thinks fit, defer or further defer its decision as to the giving of a direction under subsections (1) and (2) of this section until a subsequent meeting of the committee; but no person shall be a member of the disciplinary committee for the purposes of reaching a decision which has been deferred or further deferred unless he was present as a member of the committee when the decision was deferred. (4) It shall be the duty of the bar council to prepare, and from time to time revise, a statement as to the kind of conduct which the council considers to be infamous conduct in a professional respect, and the registrar shall send to each person whose name is on the roll and whose address is shown in the records of the Supreme Court relating to legal practitioners, by post to that address, a copy of the statement as for the time being revised; but the fact that any matters are not mentioned in such a statement shall not preclude the Supreme Court or the disciplinary committee from adjudging a person to be guilty of infamous conduct in a professional respect by reference to such matters. (5) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, a person shall not be treated as convicted as mentioned in paragraph (b) of that subsection unless the conviction stands at a time when no appeal or further appeal is pending or may (without extension of time) be brought in connection with the conviction. (6) When the disciplinary committee gives a direction under subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section, the disciplinary committee shall cause notice of the direction to be served on the person to whom it relates. (7) The person to whom such a direction relates may, at any time within twenty-eight days from the date of service on him of notice of the direction, appeal against the direction to the Appeal Committee of the Body of Benchers established under section 12 of this Act; and the disciplinary committee may appear as respondent to the appeal and, for the purpose of enabling directions to be given as to the costs of the appeal and of proceedings before the disciplinary committee, shall be deemed to be a party thereto whether or not it appears on the hearing of the appeal. (8) A direction of the disciplinary committee under subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section shall take effect- (a) where no appeal under this section is brought against the direction within the time limited for the appeal, on the expiration of that time; (b) where such an appeal is brought and is withdrawn or struck out for want of prosecution, on the withdrawal or striking out of the appeal; (c) where such an appeal is brought and is not withdrawn or struck out as aforesaid, if and when the appeal is dismissed, and shall not take effect except in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this subsection. (9) Where a direction is given under subsection (1) or (2) of this section for the refund of moneys paid or the handing over of documents or any other thing and within twenty-eight days of the date of the direction (or where an appeal is brought, on the dismissal of the appeal) the legal practitioner fails to comply with the direction, the disciplinary committee may deal with the case as one involving misconduct by the legal practitioner in his professional capacity. 12. (1) There shall be a committee to be known as the Appeal Committee of the Body of Benchers (hereafter in this Act referred to as "the appeal committee") which shall be charged with the duty of hearing appeals from any direction given by the disciplinary committee. (2) The appeal committee shall consist of the following seven members of the Body of Benchers, as may be .appointed by the Body of Benchers from time to time, that is- (a) as Chairman, a Bencher, who is a member of the Body of Benchers other than by virtue of section 3 ( 1 ) (g) of this Act; (b) two Attorneys-General in the Federation; (c) two Judges of the High Court of any State; and (d) two members of the association. (3) On any appeal against a direction of the disciplinary committee, the appeal committee may allow or dismiss the appeal in whole or in part, and if it is of opinion that any direction given by the disciplinary committee should not have been given or that a different direction should have been given by the disciplinary committee (whether more or less severe), the appeal committee shall revoke the direction of the disciplinary committee or, as the case may be, substitute therefore such direction as it thinks ought to have been given, being a direction which, under section 11 of this Act, could lawfully have been given by the disciplinary committee. (4) The appeal committee shall cause notice of any direction given by it under this section to be served on the person to whom it relates. (5) The person to whom such a direction relates may, at any time within twenty-eight days from the date of service on him of the notice of the direction, appeal against the direction to the Supreme Court; and the appeal committee may appear as respondent to the appeal and, for the purpose of enabling directions to be given by the Supreme Court as to costs of the appeal before that court and of proceedings before the disciplinary committee, the appeal committee shall be deemed to be a party to the appeal before the Supreme Court, whether or not it appears on the hearing of that appeal. (6) A direction of the appeal committee under subsection (3) of this section shall take effect- (a) where no appeal under this section is brought against the direction within the time limited for the appeal, on the expiration of that time; (b) where such an appeal is brought and is withdrawn or struck out for want of prosecution, on the withdrawal or striking out of the appeal; (c) where such an appeal is brought and is not withdrawn or struck out as aforesaid, if and when the appeal is dismissed, and shall not take effect except in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this subsection. (7) Subject to this Act, the Body of Benchers may make rules prescribing the procedure to be followed in the conduct of appeals before the appeal committee. 13. (1) Where it appears to the Supreme Court that a person whose name is on the roll has been guilty of infamous conduct in any professional respect with regard to .any matter of which the court or any other court of record m Nigeria is or has been seized, the Supreme Court may if it thinks fit, after hearing any representations made and evidence adduced by or on behalf of that person and such other persons as the court considers appropriate, give such a direction as is mentioned in subsection (1) of section 11, and the direction shall take effect forthwith; and except in the case of an admonition the court shall cause notice of the direction to be published in the Federal Gazette. (2) Where it appears to the Chief Justice that a legal practitioner should be suspended from practice, either with a view to the institution against him of proceedings under this Act before the disciplinary committee or while any such proceedings are pending, the Chief Justice may if he thinks fit, after affording the practitioner in question an opportunity of making representations in the matter, give such direction as is authorised by paragraph (ii) of subsection (1) of section 11; and in deciding whether to give such a direction in consequence of the conviction of a legal practitioner, the Chief Justice shall be entitled to disregard the provisions of subsection (5) of that section. 14. (1) Where either before or after the commencement of this Act the name of any person has been struck off the roll or a person has been or is deemed to have been suspended from practice, he may, subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, make an application for the restoration of his name to the roll or the cancellation of the suspension- (a) if the striking off or suspension was ordered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, to that court; and (b) in any other case, to the disciplinary committee. (2) A direction under subsection (1) of section 11 of this Act or subsection (1) of section 13 of this Act may prohibit an application under subsection (1) of this section until the expiration of the period specified in the direction; and where such an application is duly made to the Supreme Court or the disciplinary committee, the court or disciplinary committee may direct that no further application shall be made under subsection (1) of this section until the expiration of the period specified in the direction under this subsection. Remuneration of Practitioners 15. (1) There shall be a committee, to be called the Legal Practitioners Remuneration Committee, which shall consist of (a) the Attorney-General of the Federation, who shall be the chairman of the committee; (b) the Attorneys-General of the States; and (c) the president of the association and three other members of the association. (2) The quorum of the committee shall be three, of whom one shall be the chairman of the committee or some other member of the committee nominated by him to act as chairman of the committee on the occasion in question. (3) The committee shall have power to make orders regulating generally the charges of legal practitioners and, without prejudice to the generality of that power, any such order may include provision as to all or any of the following matters, that is to say- (a) the maximum charges which may be made in respect of any transaction or activity of a description specified by the order; (b) the ascertainment of the charges appropriate for any transaction or activity by reference to such considerations as may be so specified; (c) the taking by practitioners of security for the payment of their charges and the allowance of interest with respect to the security; and (d) agreements between practitioners and clients with respect to charges. (4) The committee shall not make an order under this section unless they have served a copy of the proposed order on the president of the association and have considered any representations in writing made to the committee by the association within the period of three months beginning with the date of service of the copy; and if the National Council of Ministers on any of the twenty days on which it sits next after the day on which an order under this section comes into force, resolves that the order be annulled it shall, except in relation to any thing previously done by virtue of the order, cease to have effect on the day next following the date of the resolution and be deemed never to have had effect. (5) Until the first order made in pursuance of this section comes into force, nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the law in force in any part of Nigeria with respect to the remuneration of legal practitioners. 16. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a legal practitioner shall be entitled to recover his charges by action in any court of competent jurisdiction. (2) Subject as aforesaid, a legal practitioner shall not be entitled to begin an action to recover his charges unless- (a) a bill for the charges containing particulars of the principal items included in the bill and signed by him, or in the case of a firm by one of the partners or in the name of the firm, has been served on the client personally or left for him at his last address as known to the practitioner or sent by post addressed to the client at that address; and (b) the period of one month beginning with the date of delivery of the bill has expired. (3) In any case in which a legal practitioner satisfies the court, on an application made either ex parte or if the court so directs after giving the prescribed notice- (a ) that he has delivered a bill of charges to a client; and (b) that on the face of it the charges appear to be proper in the circumstances; and (c) that there are circumstances indicating that the client is about to do some act which would probably prevent or delay the payment to the practitioner of the charges, then, notwithstanding that the period mentioned in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of this section has not expired, the court may direct that the practitioner be authorised to bring and prosecute an action to recover the charges unless before judgment in the action the client gives such security for the payment of the charges as may be specified in the direction. (4) The court may, if it thinks fit, on the application of a client- (a) order a legal practitioner to deliver his bill of charges to the client; (b) make an order for the delivery up of, or otherwise in relation to, any documents in the control of the practitioner which belong to or were received by him from or on behalf of the client, and without prejudice to the generality of the powers of the court to punish for contempt or to the provisions of this Act relating to the discipline of legal practitioners, the court may punish for contempt any practitioner who refuses or fails to comply with an order under this subsection. (5) The value of any consideration received by any person for anything done by a legal practitioner in his capacity as a legal practitioner shall, in so far as the value exceeds the minimum charges to which by virtue of this Act the practitioner is entitled in respect of that thing, be recovered from any person who received the consideration or from the practitioner by the person from whom the consideration moved either directly or indirectly. 17. (1) Except where a direction providing for the giving of security is given under subsection (3) of section 16 of this Act and security is not given in accordance with the direction, the court shall, on an application made by a client within the period of one month from the date on which a bill of charges was delivered to him, order that the bill shall be taxed and that no action to recover the charges shall be begun until the taxation is completed. (2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, the court may if it thinks fit, on an application made after the expiration of the period aforesaid by the legal practitioner or (except as aforesaid) by the client in question- (a) order that the bill shall be taxed; (b) order that until the taxation is completed no action to recover the charges mentioned in the bill shall be begun and any such action already begun shall be stayed, and an order under the subsection may be made on such terms (other than terms as to the costs of the taxation) as the court may determine. (3) No order shall be made under subsection (2) of this section- (a) in any case, after the period of twelve months from the date on which the bill in question was paid; (b) except in a case where the court determines that there are special reasons for making such an order, if twelve months have expired since the date of the delivery of the bill or if judgment has been given in an action to recover the charges in question, and an order made by virtue of paragraph (b) of this subsection may contain terms as to the costs of the taxation. 18. (1) The taxation of a bill of charges shall be in accordance with the provisions of any order in force under section 15 of this Act; and where no such order is in force or any item falling to be taxed is not dealt with by the order, the charges to be allowed on taxation of the item shall not exceed such as are reasonable having regard to the skill, labour and responsibility involved and to all the circumstances of the case. (2) If at the time and place appointed in pursuance of rules of court for the taxation of a bill one of the parties appears and any other party does not, the taxing officer shall proceed to tax the bill unless for special reasons he determines to adjourn or further adjourn the taxation so as to afford an absent party an opportunity to be present; and where he does so determine he may also determine by whom any costs of the adjournment or further adjournment shall be payable. (3) Where on the taxation of a bill it appears to the taxing officer that there are circumstances of the case which make it appropriate to refer the taxation to the court, he shall so refer it; and the court may either- (a) proceed itself to tax the bill and notify to the taxing officer the amount to be declared and stated in his certificate in pursuance of the next following subsection; or (b) refer the taxation back to the taxing officer with its direction in the matter. (4) On the completion of the taxation of a bill, the taxing officer shall forthwith declare the amount due in respect of the bill and shall file in the records of the court a certificate signed by him stating that amount; and any party to the taxation shall be entitled on demand to have issued to him free of charge an office copy of the certificate. (5) If any party to the taxation is dissatisfied with a determination under subsection (2) of this section or the amount stated in a certificate filed in pursuance of this section (other than a certificate stating the amount notified by the court under subsection (3) of this section), he may, within twenty-one days from the date of the determination or filing, appeal to the court. (6) The certificate of the taxing officer in respect of a bill of charges, or where the certificate is varied on appeal the certificate as so varied, shall be conclusive as to the amount of the charges payable in respect of the bill; but nothing in this subsection shall be construed as relieving a legal practitioner of any obligation to prove that a client is liable to pay a bill of charges, or as precluding a client from disproving that he is so liable. (7) Subject to the provisions of any order made by virtue of subsection (3) of section 17 of this Act, if the amount stated in a certificate under this section relating to a bill of costs, or in such a certificate as varied on appeal, is less than the amount of the bill before taxation and the difference is equal to one-sixth or more of the amount of the bill before taxation, the costs of the taxation shall be payable by the legal practitioner, and in any other case those costs shall be payable by the client. 19.

(2) For the purposes of the remuneration provisions, a bill of charges is delivered if it is served on or left for or sent to the client as mentioned in subsection (2) of section 16 of this Act and, in relation to a bill of charges, "deliver" and cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly.
