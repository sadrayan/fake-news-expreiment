Highlights from Scott victory speech
Believe it or not, Rick Scott is your Republican nominee for Florida governor.

Here are some highlights from his victory speech tonight in Ft. Lauderdale:

“Remember me, the handsome bald guy? With a deep sense of humility, I’m here tonight to accept the Republican nomination for the office of governor of our great state of Florida.”

“The Republican party will come together, and the reason we will come together is our shared devotion to values that make America great.”

“Voters took a chance on me today. They know I’m not a politician. I didn’t come up through the political ranks. They know it was not my turn to be governor. But the voters also know this, that our state and our nation have been headed in the wrong direction for quite a while. People know that government cannot continue to expand, cannot continue to spend more than you make, cannot keep piling up record debt each and every year. It’s a mistake.”

“In Tallahassee tonight, the deal makers are crying in their cocktails. Today’s vote rocked the political establishment in this state. The voters have a mind of their own and they found that out tonight.” “It’s sobering news for the special interest, they know I don’t owe them anything. They’re like my Democratic opponent. They play by her rules.”
