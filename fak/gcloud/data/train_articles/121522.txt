Police: Seaside High teacher believed to have accidentally fired gun in class
Seaside >> Police were called to Seaside High School on Tuesday afternoon after a report that a teacher accidentally fired a hand gun in a classroom full of students.

The teacher was identified as Dennis Alexander, a reserve police officer for Sand City, according to a press release from the Seaside Police Department. Alexander was believed to have been providing instruction related to public safety awareness when he fired a single shot from a semi-automatic handgun into the ceiling.

According to Seaside Police Chief Abdul D. Pridgen, a student was struck in the neck by debris or a fragment after the bullet ricocheted off the ceiling. The student was not seriously injured. Pridgen said class resumed after the incident was brought under control.

Alexander has taught the course in the past but Pridgen said he doesn’t know if he’d ever brought a live firearm to the school before. An investigation is ongoing and Pridgen said the police department will handle the situation like any other investigation.

“We’re looking into any violation of city ordinance or the penal code and we’ll determine whether or not there are any applicable charges,” Pridgen said.

An email was sent out by the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District to the parents, stating: “Upon learning of the incident, our Human Resources department, school site administration and the Seaside Police Department immediately began investigating the incident, including interviewing students in the class.”

The letter also stated that the school district is unable to share any other details other than Alexander has been placed on administrative leave for the duration of the on-going investigation.
