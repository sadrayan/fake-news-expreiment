Minimum wage laws have received much attention in recent weeks. Last Tuesday, New Jersey voters elected to raise the state hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.25. In SeaTac, Wash., residents voted on a ballot measure to raise the minimum wage to $15; those votes are still being counted, but if the measure passes it would create the highest minimum wage in the country.

On Thursday, Democrats met to consider a proposal that would raise the federal minimum wage to as much as $10.10 an hour. The Senate is poised to consider the measure as soon as next week.

Support for a higher minimum wage isnâ€™t isolated to Democrats; the poll shows that 58 percent of Republicans also approve of raising the minimum wage to $9. For comparison, 76 percent of independent voters and 91 percent of Democrats would vote in favor of such a law.

The survey of 1,040 adults was conducted Nov. 4-5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
