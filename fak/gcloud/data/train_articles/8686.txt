Governor Maggie Hassan Statement on Equal Pay Day
CONCORD – Governor Maggie Hassan released the following statement on Equal Pay Day:

“Many women are either the primary or co-breadwinners in their families, yet on average, women earn 79 cents on the dollar compared to what men earn for equal work.

“I was proud to sign the New Hampshire Paycheck Fairness Act of 2014 to strengthen our economic future and improve the financial security of working families by ensuring that Granite Staters would earn equal pay for equal work. This law eliminated loopholes, increased transparency in wages, gave workers more time to file claims, and helped ensure that all workers have the appropriate tools and resources to help them earn a fair and equal paycheck, without fear of retaliation.

“It is long past time for Congress to finally pass the federal Paycheck Fairness Act, which would build on our progress here in New Hampshire and strengthen our efforts to fight pay discrimination. It is extremely troubling that Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help ensure that women can earn equal pay for equal work. Last year, she even tried to cover up her record with a bill that would create loopholes that would continue allowing employers to prevent the sharing of salary information and keep women from determining when they are being paid less than their male counterparts. Granite Staters deserve a Senator who will always put the well-being of our women, children and families first.”
