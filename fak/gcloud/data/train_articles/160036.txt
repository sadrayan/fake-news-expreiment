Oil tanker explosion kills 200 in Congo
Dozens of mostly earth and straw constructed homes in the Congo village of Sange, 40 miles south of the regional capital Bukavu, were engulfed in the blaze after the accident.

A police officer based in Bukavu said the accident had been caused by the truck's "excessive speed."

"Some people were killed trying to steal the fuel, but most of the deaths were of people who were indoors watching the (World Cup) match," said Marcellin Cisamvo, governor of south Kivu province.

Roads in the area are notoriously bad after years of war and neglect in the vast central African nation.

"It's a terrible scene. There are lots of dead bodies on the streets. The population is in terrible shock - no one is crying or speaking," said Jean-Claude Kibala, South Kivu's vice governor

"We are trying to see how we can coordinate with (the UN) to manage the situation and how to take the wounded to hospital," he added.

Witnesses said the explosion started a fire that tore through houses near the road.

Congo's weak government has difficulty providing even the most basic services, so UN peacekeepers began airlifting some of the wounded to nearby hospitals and aid workers were called in to help with medical treatment.

"The national Red Cross is working on collecting the bodies and taking them to the morgue, but the priority is obviously to take the wounded to the hospital," said ICRC coordinator Inah Kaloga.
