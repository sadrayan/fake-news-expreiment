10 years ago: Politicians united for Hurricane Katrina victims This Forgotten Day in Houston

September 4, 2005: On this day, former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama came to Houston to visit the evacuees at Reliant Park.

Acknowledging that getting the Katrina victims back their feet was going to be a tough task, the political powerhouses weighed in on future issues the new Houston residents would face; like finding immediate work, housing, and getting their kids into school.

Presidents Bush and Clinton announced the establishment of the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, and by December the fund totaled more than $90 million in grants donated by millions that went to higher education, local and faith-based organizations and to the recovery effort in three Gulf Coast States.

In addition to local and celebrity efforts, dozens of other countries across the world offered relief aid to the U.S. by pledging millions of dollars and donating tons of medical and food supplies.
