Grayson jokes that GOP convention would include Confederate flag-raising, Bill of Rights burning
LAKE BUENA VISTA — Liberal firebrand Rep., D-Orlando, who recently likened the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan, joked to attendees at the Florida Democratic Party’s statewide convention this morning that a Republican convention would include a Confederate flag-raising, breakout sessions for “bigots,” “the paranoid” and “the gullible,” and a burning of the Bill of Rights — “except for the Second Amendment.”

Saying he had obtained “a leaked copy of the agenda for convention of the Republican Party of Florida,” Grayson mused that the meeting would also include a demonstration of a Kevlar chastity belt, a seminar on “the dangers of education” and “Rush Limbaugh speaking on how prescription drugs addiction has improved his life.”

Republicans denounced Grayson’s rhetoric, with Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman Susan Hepworth calling them “disgusting” on Twitter.

Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant dismissed the Republican criticism.

“They were typical Alan,” Tant said of Grayson’s speech.

Asked about Republican criticism, Tant said: “That’s the only thing they can say because this gathering is another indication of the enthusiasm we have as a party and the excitement, the sheer number of people – that’s the only thing they can say. It doesn’t hold any water.”

Grayson recently sent out a fundraising email that included a picture of a burning cross forming the “T” in “tea party.” Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she was “disappointed” in Grayson’s use of the KKK imagery.

Wasserman Schultz is attending this weekend’s conference, but was out of the room signing copies of her book when Grayson spoke.
