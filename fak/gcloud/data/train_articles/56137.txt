See Photos of the Obamas' New House
In 2016, T&C revealed that the Obama family was moving from the White House into a rented 8,200-square-foot house in the exclusive Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C. (Their neighbors include Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.)



In May 2017, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that the Obamas had decided to buy the home for $8.1 million (they have reportedly held onto their Chicago house as well), and TMZ reported that they are in the middle of installing an in-ground swimming pool.
