What Kind of Leader Is Marco Rubio? An Investigation.
On Septem­ber 13, 2005, Marco Ru­bio, then a 34-year-old state le­gis­lat­or from Miami, was of­fi­cially des­ig­nated the next speak­er of the Flor­ida House of Rep­res­ent­at­ives. He was the first Cuban-Amer­ic­an to win the job, and the Voice of Amer­ica beamed his speech to coun­tries around the globe, in­clud­ing Cuba. Nearly 200 people flew from Ru­bio’s ho­met­own to Tal­l­a­hassee to at­tend the ce­re­mony, which took place in the state House cham­bers. They wore lam­in­ated floor passes in­scribed with a quote from Ron­ald Re­agan: “There’s no lim­it to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn’t mind who gets the cred­it.”

Dur­ing his speech, Ru­bio—dressed in a dark suit with a red rose on his left lapel—asked House mem­bers to ex­am­ine their desks. In­side, law­makers found, wrapped in gift pa­per, a hard­cov­er book titled 100 In­nov­at­ive Ideas For Flor­ida’s Fu­ture. It was blank. Ru­bio then told his vis­ibly per­plexed col­leagues that they would fill in the pages to­geth­er dur­ing the run-up to his speak­er­ship. The ideas would come from or­din­ary Flor­idi­ans, he said, and mem­bers would col­lect them at town hall-style meet­ings called “idear­aisers.” The gam­bit quickly won rave re­views from na­tion­al fig­ures, in­clud­ing Newt Gin­grich, who called the concept “a work of geni­us.”

Clos­ing his speech with a pas­sage his ad­visers had counseled him to drop, Ru­bio asked his col­leagues to ima­gine a single moth­er, trapped in poverty and hold­ing her first­born child: “In her heart burns the hope that everything that has gone wrong in her life will go right for that child, that all the op­por­tun­it­ies she nev­er had, her child will.” Her suc­cess, Ru­bio con­tin­ued, would de­pend on the choices le­gis­lat­ors made. “If our pur­pose here is simply to win elec­tions or to use this place as a spring­board to oth­er of­fices, then her cause will be of little in­terest to us and her dreams for her child will have little chance,” he said. “But if we as­pire to be agents of change, if our goal is to make a last­ing and mean­ing­ful im­pact on our world, then her cause will also be ours.” The lines brought the crowd to its feet.

Sit­ting in the front row, Gov. Jeb Bush was clearly moved. He took to the po­di­um and de­clared, “I can’t think back on a time when I’ve ever been prouder to be a Re­pub­lic­an.” After en­cour­aging law­makers to pur­sue “big ideas,” he presen­ted Ru­bio with a golden sword “of a great con­ser­vat­ive war­ri­or.”

Ten years later, per­haps the biggest ques­tion fa­cing Marco Ru­bio’s pres­id­en­tial cam­paign is wheth­er he has enough ex­ec­ut­ive ex­per­i­ence to lead the coun­try. De­tract­ors of­ten com­pare Ru­bio to Barack Obama circa 2008—a young politi­cian who simply isn’t ready to oc­cupy the most power­ful of­fice in the world. To de­flect this com­par­is­on, Ru­bio has been talk­ing a lot about his lead­er­ship ex­per­i­ences in Tal­l­a­hassee. Obama, he told Fox News in March, “was a back­bench­er in the state Le­gis­lature in Illinois, and I was in lead­er­ship all nine years that I served there, in­clud­ing two as speak­er of the House.”

So how did Ru­bio fare dur­ing his years in the Flor­ida House? Did he live up to the ex­traordin­ary ex­pect­a­tions that were showered on him at his des­ig­na­tion ce­re­mony in Septem­ber 2005? I re­cently talked to 30 people who worked with Ru­bio dur­ing his years in Tal­l­a­hassee. My goal was simple: to fig­ure out what it looks like when Marco Ru­bio wields power.

JUST SEV­EN YEARS be­fore his des­ig­na­tion ce­re­mony, Ru­bio was knock­ing on doors in West Miami, the middle-class city of Cuban im­mig­rants where he grew up. Barely out of law school, the 26-year-old was seek­ing a seat on the city com­mis­sion. He won eas­ily. Then, less than two years later, a seat in Flor­ida House Dis­trict 111—a safe GOP dis­trict—came open when a state rep­res­ent­at­ive resigned early to run for the state Sen­ate. Ru­bio jumped in.

At a ce­re­mony in Septem­ber 2005, Marco Ru­bio was of­fi­cially des­ig­nated as the next speak­er of the Flor­ida House. “I can’t think back on a time when I’ve ever been prouder to be a Re­pub­lic­an,” Jeb Bush said at the event. (State Archives of Flor­ida/Flor­ida Memory/Mark Fo­ley Col­lec­tion)He cam­paigned as a mod­er­ate Re­pub­lic­an, preach­ing tax cuts and early-child­hood edu­ca­tion while leav­ing so­cial is­sues off the table. In the primary, he faced tough com­pet­i­tion from An­gel Za­y­on, a ra­dio and tele­vi­sion re­port­er pop­u­lar among Cuban ex­iles. But Ru­bio won a run­off by 64 votes, and, with the GOP nom­in­a­tion in hand, coas­ted to vic­tory in the gen­er­al elec­tion.

Ru­bio ar­rived to a Tal­l­a­hassee in trans­ition. In 1992, Flor­ida voters had passed a con­sti­tu­tion­al amend­ment lim­it­ing state le­gis­lat­ors to eight years. The meas­ure had sev­er­al pro­found ef­fects on state gov­ern­ment. First, it meant that Ru­bio’s vic­tory—eight years after the pas­sage of the ref­er­en­dum—roughly co­in­cided with a mass ex­odus of term-lim­ited law­makers. It also set up a very spe­cif­ic dy­nam­ic for the se­lec­tion of House speak­ers (who, from 1997 on­ward, have all been Re­pub­lic­ans). Now, law­makers had only a fi­nite amount of time to climb the lad­der to­ward House speak­er. It was akin to a class of high school fresh­men who ar­rive at their new school know­ing that, seni­or year, only one of them will be stu­dent-body pres­id­ent. In an ad­di­tion­al twist, tra­di­tion called for an as­pir­ing speak­er to se­cure the ne­ces­sary votes long be­fore be­ing named House speak­er-des­ig­nate—a ce­re­mony that took place about a year be­fore a new speak­er ac­tu­ally took the reins. As Dan Gel­ber, a Demo­crat who rep­res­en­ted Miami Beach and served as minor­ity lead­er, puts it, “The Re­pub­lic­ans choose their speak­ers based on an ul­tra­sound.”

What it all ad­ded up to was a strong set of in­cent­ives for fresh­men to move quickly upon ar­riv­ing in the House. Which was ex­actly what Ru­bio did. Be­cause he had won a spe­cial elec­tion—about 10 months be­fore the reg­u­lar elec­tions—he was already in of­fice when oth­er fu­ture mem­bers of his fresh­man class were still run­ning. In Oc­to­ber 2000, Ru­bio, a newly min­ted state rep, showed up at the down­town Fort My­ers law of­fice of Re­pub­lic­an House can­did­ate Jeff Kot­tkamp. Ac­com­pan­ied by a lob­by­ist, Ru­bio was bear­ing cam­paign checks from the cruise-line in­dustry and a gas­ol­ine dis­trib­ut­or. “He had a little bit of a head start” in the speak­er­ship race, says Kot­tkamp. “I didn’t know it at the time, but that’s what he was do­ing.” (Un­like a num­ber of the Flor­ida Re­pub­lic­ans I in­ter­viewed for this story, Kot­tkamp has not chosen sides in the Bush-Ru­bio face-off of 2016.)

Ru­bio com­muted back and forth to Miami; the of­fi­cial le­gis­lat­ive ses­sion was only 60 days a year, and he had an­oth­er job—he worked at a law firm spe­cial­iz­ing in land use and zon­ing—but by his own es­tim­ate he spent nearly half the year in Tal­l­a­hassee. And he took his new post ser­i­ously. Dur­ing the 2000 elec­tion crisis, the Le­gis­lature met in spe­cial ses­sion to de­cide wheth­er law­makers should ex­er­cise the “nuc­le­ar op­tion” and award the state’s 25 elect­ors to George W. Bush, but as the U.S. Su­preme Court waded in­to the re­count battle, most law­makers went home for the week­end. Ru­bio stayed, “in case he was needed, in case something happened,” says Nel­son Diaz, a former le­gis­lat­ive aide. Like­wise, when the state Cap­it­ol was evac­u­ated on 9/11, Ru­bio re­fused to budge. Diaz re­calls hand­ing him a note telling him that the World Trade Cen­ter had been bombed; au­thor­it­ies were con­cerned that Tal­l­a­hassee, home to the pres­id­ent’s broth­er, could be a tar­get. As oth­er law­makers left the build­ing, Diaz says, Ru­bio headed for the speak­er’s of­fice and asked, “What do we need to do?”

Nine months in­to Ru­bio’s le­gis­lat­ive ca­reer, Mike Fas­ano, the House ma­jor­ity lead­er, asked the fresh­man to be one of his two ma­jor­ity whips, a po­s­i­tion that typ­ic­ally re­quires sharp el­bows and arm-twist­ing. But Ru­bio took a dif­fer­ent ap­proach. “Marco al­ways used honey rather than vin­eg­ar,” Diaz says. “He was charm­ing. He knew the policy. He could con­vince you on a policy basis. “… It wasn’t your typ­ic­al you-have-to-fall-in-line kind of threat.”

Dud­ley Good­lette, an­oth­er GOP lead­er, called Ru­bio a “friendly en­for­cer.” His oratory was his best weapon. Many col­leagues re­call watch­ing Ru­bio scribble a few notes on in­dex cards, be­fore rising to de­liv­er a rous­ing speech on the House floor. “When he spoke, it was a ral­ly­ing call on an is­sue,” says Lind­say Har­ring­ton, a former Re­pub­lic­an state rep­res­ent­at­ive. “If you really needed something that was states­man­like, Marco would al­ways be the one to give that present­a­tion.”

“Any­time Marco would get up to speak, you could hear a pin drop in that cham­ber,” says Marty Bowen, a Re­pub­lic­an le­gis­lat­or who would be­come one of his top lieu­ten­ants. “He really com­manded a pres­ence, so people paid at­ten­tion to him.”

Ru­bio did not cloak his am­bi­tion. When Fas­ano resigned as ma­jor­ity lead­er after a flap with the House speak­er in Septem­ber 2001, the first call he re­ceived was from Ru­bio, who was already wrangling for the le­gis­lat­or’s old job. “It wasn’t, ‘How’s everything go­ing?’ It was, ‘Can you help me be­come ma­jor­ity lead­er?’ ” re­calls Fas­ano. (The former le­gis­lat­or is now sup­port­ing Bush for pres­id­ent.) “He had only been a mem­ber of the Flor­ida Le­gis­lature for a couple of years. He wasn’t think­ing about what good he could do for the Le­gis­lature, for his party, and for his con­stitu­ents. He was think­ing about what good he could do for him­self.” (Ru­bio de­clined to be in­ter­viewed for this art­icle.)

He didn’t get the ma­jor­ity lead­er post that time; the speak­er chose a more ex­per­i­enced law­maker. But an­oth­er op­por­tun­ity soon came along. In his second year in the Le­gis­lature, he vo­lun­teered to help a com­mit­tee tasked with the once-in-a-dec­ade ritu­al of re­draw­ing vot­ing dis­trict bound­ar­ies. It’s a te­di­ous task, one that in­volves man­aging the griev­ances of dozens of law­makers whose polit­ic­al ca­reers could end with the shift­ing of lines. John­nie Byrd, a Re­pub­lic­an lead­er on his way to be­com­ing speak­er, thought Ru­bio would be per­fect for the job. “He has this real abil­ity to com­mu­nic­ate with people all over the state,” Byrd says. “Many Miami-based le­gis­lat­ors don’t have that abil­ity to com­mu­nic­ate statewide, so I let him run with it.”

“Marco al­ways used honey rather than vin­eg­ar,” says a former aide. “He was charm­ing.”

Fueled by a steady diet of Moun­tain Dew and Cuban cof­fee, Ru­bio pored over the le­gis­lat­ive maps. He broke the state in­to five re­gions and met one-on-one with law­makers to help draw bound­ar­ies. “The most per­son­al thing a le­gis­lat­or ever has to deal with is their own dis­trict,” Byrd says, “and he was able to make them reas­on­ably happy. “… Ima­gine a fresh­man le­gis­lat­or in an or­gan­iz­a­tion driv­en by seni­or­ity and he cap­tiv­ates all of them, on both sides of the aisle, and brings it in for a land­ing.”

Ru­bio’s hustle en­deared him to lead­er­ship, and in late 2002, he was ap­poin­ted ma­jor­ity lead­er. At some level, it was a nat­ur­al step­ping stone to House speak­er. Yet Ru­bio’s sup­port­ers dis­cour­aged the move, say­ing it would kill his speak­er­ship am­bi­tions be­fore they left the cradle. “I would be in the vote-count­ing busi­ness, and would have to twist arms on dif­fi­cult votes, mak­ing as many en­emies as friends in the pro­cess,” he wrote in his mem­oir. His solu­tion? He per­suaded Byrd, the speak­er, to re­struc­ture the job—mak­ing him primar­ily the chief spokes­man for the House GOP while trans­fer­ring the more dif­fi­cult le­gis­lat­ive wrangling to the whip’s of­fice.

Ru­bio, it seems, un­der­stood that his main strength was his cha­risma and ex­cep­tion­al pub­lic-speak­ing abil­ity. And thanks to those as­sets, he was be­com­ing a star. A Miami Her­ald head­line in March 2003 de­clared him “a GOP won­der boy”; the art­icle cap­tured him cor­ner­ing the me­dia out­side a Demo­crat­ic press con­fer­ence on the state budget to counter the minor­ity party’s ar­gu­ments. “My brain was wired to do this stuff,” a beam­ing Ru­bio told the news­pa­per. “You have to en­joy the game.”

ON MONDAY NIGHTS dur­ing the 2001 and 2002 le­gis­lat­ive ses­sions, Byrd would rent vari­ous ban­quet rooms around Tal­l­a­hassee and in­vite con­ser­vat­ive lu­minar­ies to speak to the GOP caucus. Among the guests: Art Laf­fer, the sup­ply-side maven whose tax-cut the­or­ies single-handedly re­defined Re­pub­lic­an doc­trine, and Steph­en Moore, the eco­nom­ist who foun­ded the Club for Growth. “I made sure that Marco and all the Re­pub­lic­ans got a steady diet of free-mar­ket eco­nom­ics. I think they all began to un­der­stand what the real driv­ing eco­nom­ic is­sues were in the coun­try,” says Byrd, who is back­ing Ru­bio for pres­id­ent. “I think Marco ab­sorbed that, like everything else he was around.”

You can cer­tainly hear Ru­bio’s con­ser­vat­ism dur­ing this stage in his ca­reer. For in­stance, in Janu­ary 2003, he called out his more mod­er­ate coun­ter­parts in the Sen­ate in his weekly mes­sage to House mem­bers. “Over the last three years the Sen­ate, as a col­lect­ive body, has demon­strated an un­healthy fix­a­tion with rais­ing taxes,” he wrote.

But Ru­bio was not en­tirely a rock-ribbed con­ser­vat­ive. Some former col­leagues de­scribe him as a cent­rist who sought out Demo­crats and groups that don’t typ­ic­ally align with the GOP. Early in his ten­ure, for in­stance, he set up a meet­ing with farm­work­ers to dis­cuss their work­ing con­di­tions. He ad­dressed a crowd of about 50 one night in the hall of a mi­grant-labor hous­ing com­plex in Homestead, a farm­ing com­munity south of Miami; ul­ti­mately, he co­sponsored le­gis­la­tion that would have al­lowed work­ers to sue grow­ers in state court if they were cheated on pay. “The idea that any le­gis­lat­or, let alone a Re­pub­lic­an, would reach out to farm­work­ers was un­heard of. We were flab­ber­gas­ted,” says Greg Schell, man­aging at­tor­ney for the Mi­grant Farm­work­er Justice Pro­ject. In the years be­fore his speak­er­ship, Ru­bio would also co­spon­sor a bill that sought to award in-state tu­ition rates to the chil­dren of un­doc­u­mented im­mig­rants.

Today, Ru­bio has po­si­tioned him­self as a for­eign-policy hawk, but in the wake of 9/11, he struck a liber­tari­an chord on na­tion­al se­cur­ity mat­ters. As state law­makers con­sidered dozens of bills to strengthen law en­force­ment, he ex­pressed sus­pi­cion of meas­ures that sought to ex­pand po­lice de­ten­tion powers and sus­pend pub­lic-re­cords laws. “I can’t ig­nore the fact that a lot of people I rep­res­ent came to this coun­try be­cause of the freedoms that make it what it is,” Ru­bio said. “So many of these meas­ures that we are talk­ing about im­ple­ment­ing were the very same ones that were forced on the people of Cuba right after Castro took over.”

In 2002, Ru­bio led a suc­cess­ful charge to quash a Re­pub­lic­an bill that would have re­quired all col­leges to sub­mit the visa in­form­a­tion of for­eign stu­dents to the Flor­ida De­part­ment of Law En­force­ment. “I’m con­cerned,” he said, “that by the end of the ses­sion, im­mig­rant and for­eign-born people who are here in this coun­try leg­ally won’t be able to get mar­ried without a struggle, get a driver’s li­cense without be­ing hassled, and won’t be able to go to school without be­ing tracked.”

BY 2003, RU­BIO had formed a polit­ic­al ac­tion com­mit­tee—Flor­idi­ans for Con­ser­vat­ive Lead­er­ship—and em­barked on a re­lent­less cam­paign to win over fel­low law­makers in his bid for the speak­er­ship. “The key thing to be­com­ing speak­er is to help oth­er people. It’s more of a mind-set than tac­tics,” Byrd told me. “Rather than say­ing, ‘This is the way it’s go­ing to be,’ Marco was more dis­arm­ing, en­ga­ging, curi­ous about where you were try­ing to go. “… He is not want­ing to lord over people. He wants to make solu­tions that get buy-in from every­body.”

One by one, throughout 2003, rivals dropped out. By Novem­ber, only three re­mained, and Ru­bio and his team worked to poach sup­port­ers from rival camps, of­fer­ing key chair­man­ships and sup­port for fu­ture races. Even­tu­ally, all three op­pon­ents—in­clud­ing Kot­tkamp—quit the cam­paign. Ru­bio was now in line for the job.

But be­fore there was any cel­eb­ra­tion, there was dam­age con­trol. Ru­bio star­ted call­ing his former rivals, as well as their sup­port­ers. “I need to talk to you to­night,” he told Rep. Den­nis Bax­ley, who had backed an­oth­er can­did­ate. The law­maker re­spon­ded that he was busy hold­ing a fun­draiser in Cent­ral Flor­ida. “I’ll come to you,” Ru­bio said. The two met around 9 p.m. in a Bur­ger King off In­ter­state 4. “I think I already have the votes to be speak­er,” Ru­bio told Bax­ley, “but I think I need you with me.”

Bax­ley was an in­flu­en­tial so­cial con­ser­vat­ive, and his back­ing would en­hance Ru­bio’s clout and broaden his co­ali­tion. Over cof­fee, the two dis­cussed faith, fam­ily, and polit­ics. Bax­ley told me that Ru­bio was so ex­cited that “I don’t think he sat down the whole time.” Ru­bio asked Bax­ley to join his lead­er­ship team. The law­maker asked to sleep on it, but his op­pos­i­tion had be­gun to melt.

Around the same time, Ru­bio had a sim­il­ar late-night meet­ing in the lobby of a South Flor­ida hotel with Marty Bowen, a one­time rival who had earli­er dropped her bid. The two spoke for hours. “He wanted to make sure that when he was go­ing in­to the speak­er’s of­fice that we were all go­ing there with him,” she told me. “He didn’t want any hard feel­ings.”

It would be an­oth­er three years be­fore Ru­bio would of­fi­cially be sworn in as speak­er, and the con­straints of his job as ma­jor­ity lead­er left him little room to notch sig­ni­fic­ant policy vic­tor­ies. As the speak­er-in-wait­ing, “you don’t do a lot of le­gis­lat­ing on your own,” says Gel­ber. “Your job is to toe the com­pany line for the years be­fore your speak­er­ship, be­cause you ex­pect every­body after you to toe your line—and in fair­ness, that’s what Marco did.”

“My brain is wired to do this stuff,” a beam­ing Ru­bio told the Miami Her­ald in 2003. “You have to en­joy the game.”

Every ma­jor de­bate presen­ted an­oth­er op­por­tun­ity to strengthen or frac­ture Ru­bio’s care­fully con­struc­ted co­ali­tion of pledge-sign­ers, who wouldn’t be of­fi­cially com­mit­ted to him un­til they cast their votes in a form­al ce­re­mony in 2005. “You can’t just say, ‘You signed your name on the dot­ted line and now you’re in lock­step with me,’ ” Har­ring­ton says. “You still have the re­spons­ib­il­ity to make sure you are tak­ing care of those people. “… You’ve got to keep the crowd to­geth­er.”

Mean­while, Ru­bio’s rising status was pay­ing off mon­et­ar­ily. In June 2004, Broad and Cas­sel, one of Flor­ida’s top law and lob­by­ing firms, hired him at $300,000 a year—nearly three times his pre­vi­ous salary at an­oth­er firm. By law, he was pre­ven­ted from lob­by­ing, and the con­di­tions of his em­ploy­ment barred him from in­tro­du­cing le­gis­la­tion that would af­fect the firm’s cli­ents, but the new job raised eye­brows among some col­leagues and the state’s press corps.

HOUSE SPEAK­ER is one of the most power­ful po­s­i­tions in Flor­ida gov­ern­ment, but it has not tra­di­tion­ally been a suc­cess­ful launch­ing pad for high­er of­fice. Byrd, one of Ru­bio’s pre­de­cessors as speak­er, had self-de­struc­ted in the 2004 ses­sion. A lac­on­ic loner, Byrd spurned the le­gis­lat­ive cock­tail cir­cuit and lacked the per­son­al con­nec­tions that are the cur­rency of state­houses. As he geared up for a com­pet­it­ive U.S. Sen­ate cam­paign (which he would ul­ti­mately lose), he pur­sued a right-wing agenda and pun­ished law­makers for op­pos­ing his pri­or­it­ies. In the fi­nal hours of the ses­sion, some House Re­pub­lic­ans openly mocked Byrd and cel­eb­rated his de­par­ture. After ad­journ­ment, he found his state car plastered in the blue cam­paign stick­ers of one of his Sen­ate op­pon­ents.

Ru­bio wanted his speak­er­ship to be dif­fer­ent. He had spent years cul­tiv­at­ing re­la­tion­ships with House mem­bers—foot­ball was a fre­quent top­ic of con­ver­sa­tion—and was well versed in their griev­ances. He po­si­tioned him­self as the anti-Byrd, de­cent­ral­iz­ing power to an un­pre­ced­en­ted de­gree and cast­ing him­self as less a vis­ion­ary lead­er than a man­ager of ideas. “I would leave it to mem­bers to cre­ate and pur­sue policy pri­or­it­ies while I over­saw the man­age­ment of their agenda,” Ru­bio wrote in his mem­oir.

(RE­LATED: The Pres­id­en­tial Cam­paign Staff Fam­ily Tree)

Ob­sessed with the no­tion of lead­er­ship, he de­voured books on cor­por­ate cul­ture like Jim Collins’s Good to Great, and as­signed them to his team. He re­cruited sev­er­al of his former chal­lengers in­to his in­ner circle and held meet­ings around the state to talk about how to ac­com­plish their goals. (Later, he would ar­range for his­tor­i­an Dor­is Kearns Good­win to speak to the GOP caucus about her book Team of Rivals.) In a nod to Ru­bio’s Cath­ol­ic faith, the group was jok­ingly dubbed the “car­din­als.”

Keep­ing a busy sched­ule, Ru­bio trav­elled to all corners of Flor­ida in 2006, hold­ing “idear­aisers” with law­makers and their con­stitu­ents. Os­tens­ibly, the ef­fort was in­ten­ded to so­li­cit con­cepts for his 100 Ideas pro­ject, but the tour doubled as polit­ic­al road­show, ex­pand­ing Ru­bio’s Miami base and giv­ing the in­com­ing speak­er a statewide pro­file. Demo­crats, mean­while, were busy re­cruit­ing le­gis­lat­ive can­did­ates, hop­ing to notch a sym­bol­ic vic­tory of flip­ping one House seat. On Elec­tion Day, they won sev­en. It broke the minor­ity party’s 16-year los­ing streak and cost the GOP its su­per­ma­jor­ity in the House. In a par­tic­u­lar blow to Ru­bio—who, as speak­er-des­ig­nate, was re­spons­ible for over­see­ing the GOP’s elec­tion ef­fort—the win­ning can­did­ates in­cluded a Cuban-Amer­ic­an Demo­crat in Miami-Dade County. While Demo­crats had be­nefited from a na­tion­al wave, they won in Re­pub­lic­an-lean­ing dis­tricts that Ru­bio him­self had helped draw, of­ten fa­cing bet­ter-fun­ded com­pet­it­ors.

Dur­ing his two years as speak­er of the Flor­ida House, Ru­bio re­peatedly clashed with Gov. Charlie Crist. “I think Charlie Crist was his worst night­mare when it came to mov­ing the agenda that he wanted to move,” says one of Ru­bio’s former col­leagues. (AP Photo/Phil Coale)Some said Ru­bio’s per­son­al am­bi­tions had over­shad­owed the needs of his party. “He over­saw the single worst elec­tion cycle for Re­pub­lic­ans in state his­tory,” says Steve Schale, the strategist who ran the House Demo­crats’ cam­paign. “He was fo­cused on a lot of leg­acy-build­ing things and not re­cruit­ing good can­did­ates and run­ning good races.”

FOR EIGHT YEARS, Jeb Bush—who left of­fice in Janu­ary 2007, as Ru­bio was be­gin­ning his speak­er­ship—had taken a dom­in­eer­ing ap­proach to man­aging af­fairs in Tal­l­a­hassee. Ru­bio’s style of lead­ing turned out to be quite dif­fer­ent. In a sur­pris­ing de­par­ture from House pro­tocol, he gran­ted re­quests by Gel­ber (the Demo­crat­ic lead­er) to make his own ap­point­ments to com­mit­tees as well as to con­trol his caucus’s of­fices and park­ing spaces—the cudgels of le­gis­lat­ive power. Most im­port­ant, Gel­ber says, he honored Demo­crats’ right to voice op­pos­i­tion: “I would say, ‘I have an amend­ment that we’re go­ing to speak on and we’re go­ing to spend an hour call­ing you guys rat bas­tards,’ and he would say, ‘Do you think you could do it in 30 minutes?’”

While Ru­bio was not above yank­ing a dis­sid­ent mem­ber’s park­ing space or re­as­sign­ing someone to a closet-sized of­fice, re­tri­bu­tion was not routine. Un­like some of his pre­de­cessors, he was not cloistered in the speak­er’s of­fice. He made an ef­fort to eat with mem­bers in the cafet­er­ia and talk to them about their bills as well as their fam­il­ies. “That’s the first thing-when you can demon­strate a real in­terest in people and em­power them to be suc­cess­ful,” Bax­ley told me. “This is an at­mo­sphere where it’s easy to get caught in a cul­ture that says, ‘It’s all about me.’”

But it was the way that Ru­bio re­struc­tured the speak­er’s of­fice that sur­prised many cap­it­al in­siders. After spend­ing years to se­cure one of the most in­flu­en­tial po­s­i­tions in Flor­ida gov­ern­ment, he re­lin­quished his biggest power. For the first time, com­mit­tee chair­men—not the speak­er—would de­term­ine which sub­com­mit­tees would vet le­gis­la­tion, de­cisions that could dra­mat­ic­ally in­flu­ence a bill’s chances of passing. “I wanted the House to op­er­ate dif­fer­ently than it had in the past, when the speak­er had so much au­thor­ity that mem­bers could al­ways as­sign the blame for any fail­ure to the ‘fourth floor’—code for the speak­er’s of­fice,” Ru­bio wrote. “Un­der my speak­er­ship, com­mit­tee chair­men would have more power than ever be­fore, but a great­er share of re­spons­ib­il­ity as well, and great­er ac­count­ab­il­ity.”

Though pitched as a move to­ward demo­crat­iz­ing the House, it had a clear polit­ic­al be­ne­fit for Ru­bio: He could stay above the fray while his lieu­ten­ants ten­ded to con­tro­ver­sies. In 2007, for in­stance, the Na­tion­al Rifle As­so­ci­ation pushed le­gis­la­tion that would al­low em­ploy­ees to keep guns in their cars at work. Busi­ness groups op­posed the meas­ure. Ru­bio al­lowed Rep. Stan May­field, a top lieu­ten­ant and the chair­man of the En­vir­on­ment and Nat­ur­al Re­sources com­mit­tee, to take the lead. Sup­port for the bill had been shaky from the out­set, but the meas­ure be­came tox­ic after the Vir­gin­ia Tech shoot­ing, in which a stu­dent shot and killed 32 people on the col­lege’s cam­pus. Des­pite in­tense pres­sure from the NRA, May­field op­posed the bill. “Stan made sure the speak­er un­der­stood where he stood,” says Kev­in Sweeny, a former May­field aide. “Speak­er Ru­bio said, ‘Stan, I trust you to do what is right.’ “

While Ru­bio was all smiles and eager to win friends, his top ad­visers had grown up in the brass-knuckled world of Miami polit­ics. “Charm­ing miscre­ants,” Gel­ber says, de­scrib­ing them as a band of “Bor­is-and-Nata­sha-type fig­ures,” a ref­er­ence to the cun­ning spies in the Rocky and Bull­winkle car­toons. No one was closer to Ru­bio than Dav­id Rivera, a rep­res­ent­at­ive from Miami who had man­aged his speak­er­ship cam­paign. (Rivera did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.) The two formed a broth­erly bond in the trenches of Miami elec­tions, and they lived to­geth­er dur­ing le­gis­lat­ive ses­sions in a mod­est, three-bed­room home they bought in a Tal­l­a­hassee sub­di­vi­sion. In the Cap­it­ol, Ru­bio gave Rivera the House clerk’s of­fice, which was loc­ated just off the cham­ber floor, and knocked down a wall so they could have dir­ect ac­cess to each oth­er. He made Rivera the chair­man of the Rules Com­mit­tee, a power­ful post that gave him con­trol over which bills made it to the House floor for a vote.

Ru­bio’s re­la­tion­ship with Rivera was em­blem­at­ic of the new speak­er’s gen­er­al style: a tend­ency to del­eg­ate many of the toughest parts of polit­ics. Bob Levy, a long­time lob­by­ist, says he rarely vis­ited Ru­bio when he wanted something for his cli­ents. It was Rivera who took the meet­ings. “When you talked to Dav­id, you knew you were talk­ing to Marco,” Levy told me. “Rivera got things done,” Gel­ber says, “sort of like a fight­er pi­lot might plow the ho­ri­zon for the guys be­hind him—with a sim­il­ar amount of dam­age, I might add.” “There were times when Dav­id did things that Marco wouldn’t ne­ces­sar­ily sanc­tion, but he con­sidered that Dav­id’s choice—as long as they didn’t in­volve Marco dir­ectly,” Jill Cham­ber­lin, Ru­bio’s former press sec­ret­ary, told me.

AS HE HAD PUT the pieces of his speak­er­ship in place, Ru­bio had seemed to be try­ing to claim Jeb Bush’s mantle for him­self. In the fi­nal months of Bush’s ten­ure in 2006, Ru­bio had fired nearly a dozen vet­er­an House staffers and spent $2 mil­lion to hire some of Bush’s closest ad­visers, in­clud­ing his budget dir­ect­or, chief eco­nom­ist, and trans­port­a­tion guru. In fact, Ru­bio hired so many Bush aides—18 in all—that cap­it­al in­siders began call­ing his suite “the gov­ernor’s of­fice in ex­ile.” His chief of staff, Richard Corcor­an, was paid $175,212—$46,000 more than the gov­ernor. (Ru­bio ar­gued that the House had to pay com­pet­it­ive salar­ies to re­tain top ex­perts.)

The in­com­ing speak­er also spent more than $500,000 on renov­a­tions, in­clud­ing a private din­ing room for law­makers—a ne­ces­sity, he said, to help mem­bers eat without be­ing houn­ded by lob­by­ists. Jus­ti­fied or not, all of this spend­ing was a pub­lic-re­la­tions dis­aster. (Later, Ru­bio would also face cri­ti­cism for us­ing a state GOP cred­it card for per­son­al ex­penses; he said the charges were mis­takes that he ul­ti­mately covered him­self.) While most new speak­ers al­loc­ate money to ren­ov­ate their of­fices, Ru­bio’s spend­ing not only ex­ceeded his pre­de­cessor’s, it was also at odds with his im­age as a con­ser­vat­ive cham­pi­on of small gov­ern­ment. The irony of Ru­bio seem­ingly vi­ol­at­ing the first prin­ciple of his 100 Ideas mani­festo—”Do not un­ne­ces­sar­ily ex­pand the role of gov­ern­ment”—was me­dia fod­der for weeks. “What happened to smal­ler gov­ern­ment?” asked a Decem­ber 2006 head­line in the Miami Her­ald. “Memo to Mr. Ru­bio,” the Or­lando Sen­tinel de­clared. “You were chosen by your col­leagues to be speak­er of the House, not gov­ernor.”

“Marco, un­like Jeb, is not afraid of a col­lab­or­at­ive pro­cess,” says one Demo­crat­ic House col­league.

The per­son who had, in fact, been chosen as gov­ernor was Charlie Crist, a cent­rist Re­pub­lic­an. And he and Ru­bio would soon find them­selves in con­flict. As a former state sen­at­or, Crist had a nat­ur­al rap­port with the more mod­er­ate up­per cham­ber. Ru­bio, as the lead­er of the fiery and of­ten dog­mat­ic House, quickly found him­self the odd man out in a dy­nam­ic that would come to define his speak­er­ship. With­in months of tak­ing over as speak­er, he was balk­ing at a Demo­crat­ic-in­spired plan to over­haul the state’s in­sur­ance mar­ket by dra­mat­ic­ally ex­pand­ing the role of gov­ern­ment. Crist sup­por­ted the le­gis­la­tion; Ru­bio pushed back, but fear­ing a back­lash, he re­len­ted and shep­her­ded the meas­ure through the House.

“We were go­ing to be do­ing something dif­fer­ent than what our con­vic­tions on free en­ter­prise would tell us to do,” Bax­ley re­calls. “When you see you’re out­numbered, you have to fig­ure out how to make the best of the situ­ation.” Only two Re­pub­lic­ans voted no, and Ru­bio promptly stripped them of their com­mit­tee posts, an ac­tion at odds with the open en­vir­on­ment he had prom­ised.

Ru­bio soon re­as­ser­ted him­self, push­ing a “tax swap” plan that would elim­in­ate prop­erty taxes and re­place the rev­en­ue with an in­crease in the sales tax. Per­haps the bold­est of the 100 ideas, it was widely panned as a re­gress­ive scheme that would hurt the poor, but he moun­ted a statewide tour to pro­mote the plan, which won him na­tion­al at­ten­tion.

Crist pushed a much more mod­est ap­proach, based on his cam­paign prom­ise to double the state’s homestead ex­emp­tion, a pop­u­lar tax break for homeown­ers. The Sen­ate ig­nored Ru­bio’s plan, but the speak­er in­sisted on a spe­cial ses­sion to tackle the is­sue of prop­erty taxes. However, with little sup­port for his tax-swap plan, Ru­bio scrapped the idea and even­tu­ally, with vis­ible frus­tra­tion, agreed to smal­ler changes. “A speak­er’s leg­acy is achieved in his first year, and his in­flu­ence wanes in his second year,” Ru­bio wrote. “For bet­ter or worse, prop­erty-tax re­form would be my leg­acy, and it was in­com­plete, to put it char­it­ably.”

Be­fore the end of his first year, Ru­bio would sue Crist for by­passing the Le­gis­lature to ne­go­ti­ate a gambling com­pact with the Semi­n­ole Tribe of Flor­ida. “I think Charlie Crist was his worst night­mare when it came to mov­ing the agenda that he wanted to move,” says U.S. Rep. Dan Web­ster, who served as Sen­ate ma­jor­ity lead­er dur­ing Ru­bio’s speak­er­ship. Adam Has­ner, who served as Ru­bio’s ma­jor­ity lead­er in the House, told me only half-jok­ingly that talk­ing about this time peri­od makes him break out in hives. He de­scribes Ru­bio’s law­suit as an act of polit­ic­al cour­age. “You wer­en’t stand­ing up to a weak Re­pub­lic­an gov­ernor,” he says. “You were stand­ing up to a guy who people were look­ing at po­ten­tially as a vice pres­id­ent. I think it did take a lot of con­vic­tion and a lot of lead­er­ship for Marco to do the things that he did.”

In his second ses­sion, Ru­bio played hard­ball with Crist. Cli­mate change was one of Crist’s sig­na­ture is­sues, and he wanted the Le­gis­lature to pass a bill that would lay the ground­work for a Cali­for­nia-style cap-and-trade sys­tem to cut car­bon emis­sions. Ru­bio and House con­ser­vat­ives op­posed the idea, but pub­lic sen­ti­ment was with Crist. The House ul­ti­mately passed the bill, but Ru­bio’s team in­ser­ted a pois­on pill that pre­ven­ted the plan from go­ing in­to ef­fect. “I fully cred­it him with the gut­ting of the bill,” Gel­ber says.

By the end of his speak­er­ship, Ru­bio and Crist were on a path to con­front­a­tion—which would cul­min­ate in a de­cis­ive Ru­bio vic­tory in the 2010 Sen­ate race. In chal­len­ging and then de­feat­ing Crist, Ru­bio would be­come a hero to tea parti­ers across the coun­try. But Schale, at least, sug­gests that Ru­bio’s po­s­i­tion­ing on Crist’s right flank was partly a mat­ter of savvy strategy. Ru­bio “was not this tea-party, arch­con­ser­vat­ive type of guy,” he told me. “Marco saw the rise of Charlie Crist, who was re­de­fin­ing the Re­pub­lic­an Party as a more mod­er­ate, bi­par­tis­an pop­u­list type, and he had to carve out a dif­fer­ent space just to be heard.”

“I think you can call him a con­ser­vat­ive prag­mat­ist,” says Dav­id Sim­mons, a Re­pub­lic­an who served un­der Ru­bio in the House. “There was a need to be prin­cipled, but there was a need to be prag­mat­ic about what you can ob­tain. “… Throughout the time he was speak­er, I think that the view was we should not let the per­fect be the en­emy of the good in any piece of le­gis­la­tion.”

IN THE END, the center­piece of Ru­bio’s early speak­er­ship, his 100 Ideas, yiel­ded mixed res­ults. Though Ru­bio would boast that all 100 ideas passed the House and that 57 be­came law, Poli­ti­Fact Flor­ida found that just 24 be­came law while an­oth­er 10 were par­tially en­acted. The fact-check­ing web­site con­cluded that 23 ideas were either more goals than laws—a com­mit­ment to hav­ing a “Top 10” pub­lic uni­versity, for in­stance—or were not en­acted in the way Ru­bio in­ten­ded.

While Ru­bio can claim suc­cesses from his list of 100 ideas—from en­abling drivers to pur­chase mul­tiple-year car re­gis­tra­tions to ex­pand­ing a vouch­er-like school-choice pro­gram to re­quir­ing high schools to of­fer more vo­ca­tion­al train­ing in high-de­mand fields—few of his achieve­ments are the kinds of leg­acy items that defined pre­vi­ous speak­ers. Many of the people I talked to for this story could not read­ily re­call Ru­bio’s top policy achieve­ments. “I can give you the agenda for every speak­er I can re­mem­ber. For Marco, there was no agenda,” says Levy, the long­time Tal­l­a­hassee lob­by­ist. “It’s not like he came in and said, ‘I’m go­ing to get rid of growth man­age­ment, or re­form edu­ca­tion or crim­in­al justice.’ “… His agenda was the 100 ideas. His staff would divvy that up among chair­men and they would sink or swim based on mem­bers. “… I think it was cer­tainly very in­nov­at­ive and a great polit­ic­al idea, but I don’t re­mem­ber what happened with the 100 ideas. How im­port­ant could it have been if people don’t re­mem­ber?”

However, Ru­bio’s de­fend­ers (and even some crit­ics) point out that he had the mis­for­tune of presid­ing over the House in aus­tere times, just as the Great Re­ces­sion took hold and Flor­ida’s eco­nomy plummeted. There was little money in the budget to fund new pro­pos­als. Moreover, Ru­bio’s back­ers say the 100 Ideas book was nev­er in­ten­ded to be a polit­ic­al score­card. What mat­ters, they ar­gue, is how it in­ver­ted the top-down power dy­nam­ic that had defined law­mak­ing in the cap­it­al for dec­ades. “The whole concept of 100 Ideas was to em­power le­gis­lat­ors and em­power cit­izens,” Has­ner told me. “People for­get that Marco didn’t write the book. The whole point of the book was to be in­clus­ive and so­li­cit policy ideas for a con­ser­vat­ive agenda.”

“He wanted to make sure his speak­er­ship wasn’t viewed as some of the oth­ers be­fore where the speak­er wiel­ded the heavy hand of au­thor­ity,” Bowen told me. “We were all elec­ted the same way and we were all a team, and that’s the way he wanted his ten­ure as speak­er to be—that we were a team and that the mem­bers could use their dis­cre­tion on a lot of things. If some­body had a dif­fer­ence of opin­ion on things, he would al­ways get us to­geth­er and say, ‘Let’s look at your ideas and your ideas and be some­where in the middle.’ “… I con­sider him a great lead­er.”

In­deed, prob­ably the biggest con­sensus to emerge from my con­ver­sa­tions had to do with Ru­bio’s re­luct­ance to be a top-down man­ager. “There are or­gan­iz­a­tions where it’s all about one strong dy­nam­ic play­er, and I saw him as more of the team-build­er, someone who em­powered oth­er people,” says Bax­ley. Gel­ber, the Demo­crat, puts it this way: “Marco, un­like Jeb, is not afraid of a col­lab­or­at­ive pro­cess. He un­der­stands the no­tion of achiev­ing what you can.” In this re­spect, a Ru­bio pres­id­ency might prove to be a close ma­na­geri­al cous­in of the ad­min­is­tra­tion of George W. Bush, who was fam­ously com­fort­able del­eg­at­ing.

Where opin­ion splits is on wheth­er Ru­bio’s tend­ency to­ward del­eg­a­tion is a vir­tue or a prob­lem. While Byrd (a sup­port­er) praises Ru­bio as “a good listen­er” who “makes every­body have a part in what’s go­ing to hap­pen,” Fas­ano (a Jeb back­er) looks at the same in­stincts and says, “When con­fron­ted with an is­sue, with a prob­lem, he pretty much would throw it in the laps of his staff and want to take the road of non­con­tro­versy. To me, that’s not a lead­er.”

It was also clear from Ru­bio’s time in Tal­l­a­hassee that, while he is a genu­ine con­ser­vat­ive, he might not be quite as doc­trin­aire as the coun­try was led to be­lieve when he first emerged on the na­tion­al radar. “I be­lieve he’s will­ing to cross the aisle,” says Cham­ber­lin. “He is very loy­al to the Re­pub­lic­ans, but he doesn’t ex­clude the Demo­crats.”

He also ex­cels at the most polit­ic­al parts of gov­ern­ing: the speech-giv­ing; the de­bates; the pro­cess of per­suad­ing in­di­vidu­al le­gis­lat­ors to sup­port him. Obama has one of these qual­it­ies—like Ru­bio, he is an ex­cep­tion­al orator—but he has a no­tori­ously cold re­la­tion­ship with Con­gress. “My sense is that Marco would have a more tra­di­tion­al ap­proach to deal­ing with mem­bers of Con­gress than the cur­rent pres­id­ent does,” says Schale, who man­aged Obama’s cam­paign in Flor­ida in 2008. “I think he’d prob­ably be more en­gaged in con­gres­sion­al stuff.”

But was Ru­bio good at the policy, or just the polit­ics? The sym­path­et­ic view is that he deeply cared about ideas while lead­ing the Flor­ida House; he just faced a set of cir­cum­stances in which poli­cy­mak­ing was al­ways go­ing to be dif­fi­cult. “A lot of the time his own mem­bers would sup­port Gov­ernor Crist over what he wanted, par­tic­u­larly the first year,” says Kot­tkamp, who be­came Crist’s lieu­ten­ant gov­ernor. “Nobody wants to be side­ways with a gov­ernor with a 70 per­cent ap­prov­al rat­ing. I could sense the frus­tra­tion when I met with Marco. He had a lot of ideas and things he wanted to get done.”

The less-char­it­able ver­sion is that he was too fo­cused on polit­ics, es­pe­cially his own ca­reer. “Marco’s biggest li­ab­il­ity is that he is a young, am­bi­tious guy,” says Schale. “If there’s a thing that young, am­bi­tious guys have to watch out for, it’s be­ing overly cau­tious, overly scared, wor­ried about mak­ing that mis­step, and Ru­bio at times has let that am­bi­tion get in the way of pro­gress “… which is why I sus­pect he’s not go­ing to have a cam­paign that is based on big ideas. It’s go­ing to be based on really nice poll-tested clichés.”

This view isn’t con­fined to the Demo­crat­ic side. “There is a cer­tain safety to his man­ner of be­ing. He is not ne­ces­sar­ily a risk-taker,” says J.C. Planas, a former Re­pub­lic­an col­league in the Flor­ida House who is cur­rently sup­port­ing Jeb. “Marco is more of a politi­cian than he is a policy wonk.”

Now, as he heads in­to the thick of the 2016 cam­paign, Ru­bio is once again pitch­ing him­self as a can­did­ate of ideas—on everything from poverty to high­er edu­ca­tion. The ques­tion, of course, is wheth­er his lead­er­ship in­stincts—the ones he dis­played and honed over eight years in Tal­l­a­hassee—will al­low him to see these ideas through. “I know that I have not al­ways been right, … but I have al­ways done what I be­lieve to be right,” Ru­bio said dur­ing his good-bye speech to the Le­gis­lature in 2008. “I have al­ways been mo­tiv­ated by the hope that I can be an ad­voc­ate for what I be­lieve is right to do. And I’ll tell you something else: I leave here today with full peace in my heart be­cause I know I have done my best. The best that I could do, I have tried and done. I just hope it was good enough.”
