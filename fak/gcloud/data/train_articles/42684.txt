WEBVTT DEIRDRE: WITH THE BUTTE FINE OR CONTENT -- FIRE CONTAIN THE FOCUS SHIFTS TO REBUILDING AND RECOVERY. THE SECOND TIME, CORRECT. WE SEE THESE IMAGES EVERY DAY. LET’S YESTERDAY IT WAS A FOREST SERVICE SUPERVISOR. HE WAS A FORMER INFANTRY OFFICER IN THE MARINE CORPS. WE WERE IN FULL ASIA. THE MET OF DEVASTATION IS ON PAR WITH WHAT I SAW IN RAMADI AND FALLUJAH. THE DEVASTATION AND THE PAIN IN THIS COMMUNITY, THE IRONIC PART ABOUT IT, MUCH OF IT CAN BE MITIGATED. . WE CAN BE BETTER AT MANAGING OUR FEDERAL ESTATE. GETTING READ OF THE DEAD AND DYING TIMBRES. USING SCIENCE AND BEST PRACTICES . GOING FORWARD THIS IS A PRIORITY OF THE PRESIDENT TO MAKE SURE WE MANAGE OUR FOR SO THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. DEIRDRE: AS DAMAGING AS THE FIRE WAS WE’RE AT A POINT IN CALIFORNIA WITH SOME TOUGH CONVERSATIONS. THE RHETORIC HAS BEEN JUST AS FIERY. WHAT WORRIES YOU ABOUT THAT? >> OUR FORESTS, IT IS NOT A DEMOCRAT ISSUE. IT IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE. GOVERNOR BROWN AND THE PRESIDENT HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION. I HAVE TALKED THE GOVERNOR. WE WILL ENGAGE. THIS IS AN AMERICAN MOMENT T MANAGE OUR FORESTS. LOOK AT SCIENCE AND BEST PRACTICES AND MAKE SURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. THE TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN. THIS SEASON HAS GOTTEN LONGER BUT THAT DOESN’T RELIEVE YOU OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MANAGE. MAKE SURE THE FUEL LOAD IS DOWN. WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE FIREFIGHTERS TO MAKE SURE PUBLIC ACCESS AND ROADS ARE REOPENED. IN THE CASE OF PARADISE A COUPLE OF TIMES THE FIREFIGHTERS COULD NOT GET IN BECAUSE THE ROADS THAT HAD BEEN THERE WERE OVERGROWN, NOT MAINTAINED. ACCESS WASN’T THERE. TEO: LET ME BUILD ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID. WE JUST HAVE THE RELEASE OF THE FOURTH NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. 300 SCIENTISTS AS WELL. THE ACTIVITY IS LIKELY CAUSING OR ACCELERATING CHANGE IN OUR CLIMATE. PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE NO BONES ABOUT IT. HE IS A SKEPTIC. YOU AS THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR DEALING WITH RECORD-SETTING FIREFIGHTERS -- FIRES. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION? >> WE ARE LOOKING AT THE REPORTS. IT APPEARS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IT CLOSELY. THEY TOOK THE WORST IN REO’S -- THAN REO’S AND BILL PREDICTIONS UPON IT. IT SHOULD BE MORE PROBABILITY. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THE FIRE SEASON HAS GOTTEN LONGER. TEMPERATURES ARE ELEVATED. THE MOISTURE’S AND DROUGHT WAS PART OF THE FIRES. LECTURE WE HAD RECORD MOISTURE. THIS YEAR WE ARE IN A DROUGHT. THE CLIMATE REPORT I THINK IS A BACKGROUND. WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE OR NOT, IT DOESN’T RELIEVE YOU OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MANAGE THE FORCE. YOU CAN ACTIVELY MANAGE THE FOREST REMOVING DEAD AND DYING TIMBER. THERE IS THINGS WE CAN AND SHOULD DO. LOCAL COMMUNITIES STAY GOVERNMENTS AND NEED TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVE A FOREST SERVICE HOLDING OR BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT HOLDING AND YOU ARE NOT MANAGING YOUR PROPERTY AT THE STATE OR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WHO BECOMES A LIABILITY? WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. FIRES DON’T JUST A ON A LOCAL COMMUNITY. DEIRDRE: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. MORE COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
