Clarke drops legal fight over laid-off deputies
Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. announced Thursday that he was giving up his legal fight over deputy layoffs as the county prepared to issue 48 pink slips.

Those deputies' last day of work will be Monday.

Clarke had sought to block the layoffs and waged an unsuccessful months-long campaign against the 2012 budget cuts that forced the elimination of the jobs. He gave up the effort after a judge in one of two lawsuits over the layoffs agreed with the county on the number of deputy job cuts.

County filed suit

The county sued Clarke last month to force him to implement the layoffs, with county lawyers warning that arrests made by deputies whose jobs were abolished could be challenged. Clarke argued that he couldn't pull the trigger on layoffs until he knew how many deputies would have to be laid off.

That was clarified this week with a ruling by the state Employment Relations Commission and by Judge William Pocan. They sided with the county that the maximum number of 61 possible layoffs was offset only by deputy retirements over the last two months of 2011, resulting in 48 layoffs.

Clarke backs down

Clarke agreed to rescind an order he issued nearly a month ago calling deputies who had already received layoff notices back to work, said Michael Whitcomb, an attorney for the sheriff.

Fran McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Clarke, said the sheriff was working on a plan to help fill gaps created by the layoffs.

"There are holes to fill," she said. "Obviously, it will have an impact."

No decisions have been made yet on whether any tasks of the sheriff's office would be curtailed as a result of the layoffs, McLaughlin said.

Clarke wasn't available for comment, she said.
