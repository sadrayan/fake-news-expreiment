Team Rick Scott
I am so proud of Team Scott and the campaign we ran. I know that I would not be here today without you in my corner. I am extremely humbled by your generous support and encouragement. Thank you!

This campaign has been a wonderful experience – it was hard work, but I have had the opportunity to meet thousands of people who share my love for this great state. Now the real work begins: representing the people of Florida in the United State Senate

Together with my wife, Ann, I want to sincerely thank you for your support and your work on behalf of this campaign.

Let’s get to work,

Rick Scott
