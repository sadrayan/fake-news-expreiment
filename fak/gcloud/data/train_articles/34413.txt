HOUSTON, Texas - Yesterday, U.S. Sen.

"I was honored to visit the hardworking men and women at Air Liquide today," Sen. Cruz said. "As a leader in technological innovations that foster energy production, it's not surprising that you chose to make your home in the U.S here in Texas. In Texas, we know the power of free enterprise and the opportunity and economic growth that we can create when we get government off the backs of the job creators and the working men and women of our state. We're grateful for the 20,000 people you employ across our nation and the critical role you are playing creating good-paying jobs and generating economic growth in our state."
