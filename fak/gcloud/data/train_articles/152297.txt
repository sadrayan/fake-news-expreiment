Papa John’s Teams Up with Cowboys for Charity
Papa John’s has teamed up with Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten to give hope to children affected by domestic violence. With every “I’m With Witten” extra-large pizza deal ordered online, $1 will be donated to Witten’s SCORE Foundation. The foundation’s SCOREkeeper’s program provides positive male mentors to boys and girls staying in family shelters for domestic violence. The mentors serve as role models, provide friendship, teach life skills, and assist in academics and counseling. The program has impacted more than 6,400 Texas children since Witten founded it in 2007.

“I want every child who’s been in a home where domestic violence has occurred to have the opportunity that I had to break the cycle,” Witten says. “My grandfather reset what I understood a man to be and showed me another way. I would not be who I am today without his love and support. I’m thankful to our SCOREkeepers who are dedicated to being strong role models and proving that good men are not hard to find. I also appreciate the fans and Papa John’s for contributing to our mission.”

“Jason Witten’s willingness to share his story shows others that they don’t have to be ashamed of being victims of domestic violence, and through the SCOREkeepers program, he’s empowering thousands of Texas children to pave the way for a better life,” says Steve McNeil, vice president of operations for Papa John’s. “He is an inspiration to all of us who admire him as a model family man, athlete, and leader. I’m with Witten. Papa John’s is with Witten, and we know our customers are too.”

The “I’m With Witten” pizza deal lasts through the Cowboy’s entire football season, and is valid at participating Dallas, Austin, and Waco-area locations.
