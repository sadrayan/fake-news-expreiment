House Democrats vote to reopen government, reject Trump's demand for wall funding
Washington (CNN) House Democrats on Thursday approved a legislative package aimed at ending the partial government shutdown, while rejecting President Donald Trump's demand for additional funding for a border wall, despite a White House veto threat.

As a result, the legislation is expected to be dead on arrival in the Senate, leaving congressional Democrats and the administration at a stalemate that threatens to prolong the shutdown, which is wrapping up its second week.

The House of Representatives first voted on Thursday to approve a stopgap spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would not allocate any new wall funding, in a rebuke to the President. The bill passed by 239-192, with five Republicans joining Democrats.

Shortly afterward, the House voted to approve a legislative package made up of six full-year spending bills to reopen other shuttered parts of the federal government.

The key sticking point in the shutdown fight has been the President's demand for $5 billion in wall funding, which congressional Democrats have refused to meet.
