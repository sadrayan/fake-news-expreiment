Justin Timberlake: ‘Mandatory Vaccination Schedules Are Un-American’
“The whole concept of mandatory vaccination schedules is un-American,” according to Justin Timberlake, who says “Why risk damaging your precious child for the sake of the herd?”

“Take care of your own child. That is your duty. That is your God given right,” said Justin Timberlake, while readying himself for his long-awaited Super Bowl Halftime show appearance. “If everyone took care of their own children, we wouldn’t have to worry about taking care of the herd, or making anything mandatory, or any of that communist stuff.”

“I’d also like to know,” continued the Cry Me A River hitmaker, “why a child who has been ‘immunized’ is not actually immune to the disease… Why are these kids are always catching the very disease they are supposedly immune to?… and they spread these diseases too…”

“And yet sanctimonious parents of immunized kids, they get on their soap box and say my unvaccinated child is a threat to their child? Get a grip already. Isn’t your child supposed to be immune?”

Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel sparked controversy in 2015 when they refused to vaccinate their son, Silas, citing health concerns

Timberlake is far from the only celebrity in the music business who believes mandatory vaccinations are unsafe. Superstar DJ Calvin Harris recently dropped a series of truth bombs on Twitter , defying Big Pharma by sharing real information about health and vaccine safety with his millions of followers.

Justin Timberlake’s new album Man of the Woods is set to be released on Feb. 2. Two days later, JT will take the stage at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota for halftime of Super Bowl LII.
