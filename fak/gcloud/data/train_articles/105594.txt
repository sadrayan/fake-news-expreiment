90 Miles From Tyranny : In Canada Syrian Refugees Get $3600 Per Monthâ€¦
The Canadian Broadcasting Company, commonly referred to as the CBC, recently put out a puff piece about a Syrian refugee family in Canada.



The CBC tours the families house, a three bedroom home that is honestly nicer than most homes.



It turns out the average Syrian refugee receives $3600 from the Government of Canada, or $43,000 per year, while the average Canadian makes a mere $27,100.
