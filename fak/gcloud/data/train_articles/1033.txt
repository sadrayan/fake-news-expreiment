Partnership for Patients initiative launched to improve care and lower costs for Americans
The Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Donald Berwick recently launched the Partnership for Patients initiative. Partnership for Patients is a new public-private partnership that brings together leaders of major hospitals, employers, health plans, physicians, nurses, and patient advocates along with State and Federal governments in a shared effort to make hospital care safer, more reliable, and less costly. The two goals of the new Partnership for Patients campaign are to:

Keep hospital patients from getting injured or sicker. By the end of 2013, to decrease instances of patients acquiring preventable conditions while in hospitals by 40 percent compared with 2010.

Help patients heal without complication. By the end of 2013, to decrease preventable complications during a transition from one care setting to another, so that the number of patients who must be re-admitted to the hospital would be reduced by 20 percent compared with 2010.

Achieving these goals holds potential to save both lives and money. The combined efforts of this partnership could save 60,000 American lives and reduce millions of preventable injuries and complications in patient care over the next three years. It also could save as much as $35 billion to the health care system, including up to $10 billion in Medicare savings. More than 500 hospitals, as well as physician and nurse groups, consumer groups, and employers have pledged their commitment to the Partnership.
