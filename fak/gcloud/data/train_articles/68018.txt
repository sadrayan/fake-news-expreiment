Rep. Graves Votes to Save Taxpayer Dollars by Selling Federal Properties
Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA-09) issued the following statement after voting in favor of H.R. 665, the Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act. This bill speeds up the federal government’s sale of excess federal properties. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would raise about $20 million a year from 2013 through 2017.

“The federal government owns tens of thousands of properties that are vacant or underused. Expediting the sale of these properties is a common sense way to eliminate government waste and save taxpayer dollars.”

“In this climate of exploding debt and deficits, Congress must consider every opportunity to tighten our belts and trim the size of government. Shedding these properties and returning them into the hands of the private sector is a step in the right direction.”

Background:

This bill would set up a five-year pilot program to speed up the sale of underused and excess federal properties by letting the General Services Administration (GSA) cut through several layers of reviews usually required before a federal property can be sold. The GSA is an independent agency of the federal government which provides office space to federal employees and develops government-wide cost-minimizing policies. Unless extended, the pilot program would expire after five years.
