“Smuggling organizations play a despicable role, profiteering from the hopes and dreams of desperate people. There are frequent reports that smugglers are using more creative recruitment techniques, including social media. They spread false rumors that promise immigration benefits to these children once they are in the United States, and attempt to minimize the very real dangers of the journey north. Putting children into the hands of smugglers is a reckless and dangerous undertaking. The children who are fortunate enough to survive the dangerous journey north will be taken care of while they go through the legal process, but in most cases, that process will lead to them being sent back home.”
