Russian education officials order a special review of a school history textbook that fails to call Ukraine's 2014 Maidan Revolution ‘a bloody coup’ — Meduza
Russia’s Education Ministry has ordered an additional review of a 10th-grade history textbook, after the Federation Council criticized the text because it refers to the overthrow of the Yanukovych regime in Ukraine as a “revolution” and not a “bloody coup.” The Russian Academy of Sciences will carry out the new review, which should be completed by January 27.

In October, Crimean Senator Sergey Tsekov read an excerpt from the textbook on the Russian Senate floor in protest. Senate Chairwoman Valentina Matviyenko, meanwhile, called the textbook “prevocational.”

Several other lawmakers also complained about the book to pro-Kremlin TV pundit Dmitry Kiselyov, whose television show implied that the textbook was responsible for a high school student’s controversially pacifist speech about World War II at the Bundestag last year. Fun fact: students at the Novy Urengoy high school in question actually study a different history textbook.
