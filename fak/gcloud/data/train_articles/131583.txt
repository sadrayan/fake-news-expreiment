Supreme Court Sides With Trump–This Changes Everything ⋆ USA Politics…
The Supreme Court of the United States just sided with President Trump in a landmark case the mainstream media hasn’t been reporting on.

On behalf of Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education, Trump’s legal team has petitioned the court to make America safer, starting with our children.

In a 5-3 decision that wasn’t a difficult interpretation of the constitution, the high court ruled that public schools in this country will NOT teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia law.

Students will learn about Islam in history, as they do Christianity and all other religions, only as it pertains to the time period they are studying.

This rolls back an Obama regulation that forced children to learn about the “peaceful” religion of Islam so they would be more tolerant of terrorists.

The age of indoctrination is over.
