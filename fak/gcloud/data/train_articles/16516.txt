What’s the best way to query Christi Craddick about her position on changing the name? She was quoted in 2017 saying it wasn’t her priority.

Hi Gardner,

Happy to help.

Would you want an updated statement from Commissioner Craddick?

I’d be happy to visit by phone or email. We’re checking a claim that the commission has nothing to do with railroads.

Gardner,

The below, full quote is still accurate. Chairman Craddick feels it’s important to explain why it’s not her priority.

“As regulator, I’d tell you that a name change for the commission is simply not our priority today. It’s costly, and we should be directing any additional funding to items critical to our operations such as (information technology) improvements and staff salaries.”

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Does she mean “as a regulator?”

That’s correct.

2:59 p.m.

And, by “staff salaries”, she means funding to pay staff, namely inspectors.
