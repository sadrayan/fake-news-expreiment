Russian chess grandmaster Sergey Karjakin says he is on 'team Putin'
Russian grandmaster Sergey Karjakin, runner-up in last year’s World Chess Championship, has vowed his support for Vladimir Putin after several sports stars publicly backed the president.

Putin is expected to stand for a fourth Kremlin term in 2018 but has not yet confirmed his candidature.

Karjakin, 27, gave no details on what his involvement in the campaign will be, but wrote on Twitter: "I’ve always openly supported Vladimir Putin but now I can finally do this officially. Putin team. I’m on the team!"

He added a photo of him meeting Putin this summer.

A chess prodigy, Karjakin became the youngest ever grandmaster at 12. Last December he lost to Norwegian Magnus Carlsen at the World Chess Championship during which he was nicknamed the "Minister for Defence".

Karjakin, who was born in the Ukraine before the Vladimir Putin's tanks rolled into Crimea, considers himself an ethnic Russian and is proud of his background.
