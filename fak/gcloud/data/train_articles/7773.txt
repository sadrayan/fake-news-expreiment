Keystone XL Pipeline
The Keystone XL Pipeline is a proposed 1,179 mile (1,897 km), 36-inch-diameter crude oil pipeline which begins in Hardisty, Alta., and travels south through to Steele City, Neb.

This pipeline goes through many different states and provinces on its route south, including: Alberta and Saskatchewan in Canada, and then Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska in the United States. Along with transporting crude oil from Canada, the Keystone XL Pipeline will transport oil from producers in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana and North Dakota.

In January, 2013, Governor Dave Heineman approved an alternative route (PDF, 620 KB), for the Keystone XL Pipeline in Nebraska. The new route was created to minimize disturbance of land, water resources and special areas in the state.
