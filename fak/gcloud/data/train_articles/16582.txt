Gardner, the Census components-of- change estimates are all net. So, there’s not separate in-migration and out-migration estimates in this data that both Drew and Potter are citing.

Based on the latest year, there are 151 net new residents daily. 105 are net migrants (83 domestic and 22 international) and 46 are net natural increase (75 births minus 29 deaths).

POP ESTIMATE 2016 POP ESTIMATE 2017 NET POP CHG 2017 BIRTHS 2017 DEATHS 2017 NATURAL INCREASE 2017 INTERNATIONAL MIG 2017 DOMESTIC MIG 2017 NET MIG 2017 RESIDUAL 2017 2,060,558 2,115,827 55,269 27,400 10,609 16,791 8,185 30,120 38,305 173 Per day: 151 75 29 46 22 83 105

If you want to fact check Jose’s statement that “150 people a day move to the Austin MSA,” I would say he was likely relying on the above data and it would have been better to phrase it as “the Austin MSA adds 150 new residents daily.”

In reality, a good deal more than 105 people or 150 people move to Austin each day, but a lot of people move out too. The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey asks people (over the age of 1 year) if they lived some place else one earlier. The 2016 ACS (table B07201) indicates that of the 2,030,464 residents Austin MSA over 1 year old, 129,119 moved to Austin from a different metro or non-metro area in the U.S. or abroad that year. That’s 354 per day.

I am sharing below Lloyd Potter’s reply to my latest query. Would your analysis align about the best figure for people moving into the region alone?



Thanks, again,

If we were focused only on people moving into the region, are you saying that 105 a day is not the right figure? If so, what is?

If only moving in, not adjusted for those moving out, I would use the 361 per day (that includes people who move from outside of the U.S.). I think that is probably the best available estimate of in-migrants (only) into the MSA.



Generally the indicator of migration is on net-migration (in-out) because that is the indicator of population change associated with migration.

Well you have what I’d call two really close estimates. Potter is getting 361 using an ACS table of 2015 5-year data and I got 353 using an ACS table of 2016 1-year data. We’ve used different tables, but are basically talking about the same universe of movers, domestic and from abroad.



I’m using a table based on the question about whether or not you lived someplace else last year. That yields and est of people moving in (353 per day), but not out. Potter is using a table of geo-to-geo move estimates that could be used to get you not just movers in (361 per day), but also movers out (223 per day). I have to think that the MOE of the ACS table I’m using would be relatively moderate for the est of people moving in. With the geo-to-geo in-out data there’s MOE for each estimate going in to the calculation. In this data, an estimated total of 165 people moved from Austin to Bakersfield, but the MOE for that estimate is 175. To get to the total people moving to Austin with this data, you are using 326 estimates like that (and the moving-out-of-Austin estimate is based on 317 estimates). I don’t know if there’s a methodological reason the two numbers (361 or 353 per day) nevertheless end up as close as they are, or if it’s a fluke.



Where it serves, the Estimates data is preferred to the ACS data. And as Potter says, it’s the net figure that speaks to pop growth, rather than the in-flow number.



Like I said, I think Jose’s 150 per day statement was probably based on the net new residents number from the Population Estimates data. It’s the most commonly quoted number around here and 150 for the metro is pretty much the ballpark it’s been at for a number of years. I’ve tried to train people here to phrase it as “Austin gains 150 new residents per day” and not “150 people move here per day,” but the latter is often the locution they go to.

Hello again from the American-Statesman newsroom. I am close to finally completing our review of the claim that 150 people a day move to the Austin region.

What do each of you make of my wording below? REPLY ALL to share with your fellow outstanding expert. My thanks.

WHAT WE’RE CHECKING: “Just in the Austin MSA alone, 150 people move here every day.”

As you each counseled, this figure ties to a federal estimate that the five-county region’s population grew by about 150 people a day in the 12 months up to July 2017. According to the estimate, people moving to the region accounted for two thirds of that growth.

Then again, bureau research also estimates that around 350 people a day have lately moved into the region.

Carrillo’s statement, recapping recent net population growth, understates simple in-migration. Perhaps it’s still Mostly True on our scale, which means it’s accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Appreciated,

G.

Looks like a reasonable assessment of the validity of the statement to me. However, time and time again, public figures seem to unknowingly misstate population growth as being only from people moving while usually, much of the growth is also a result of more births than deaths. While it’s unlikely that being more clear in Politfacts will lead public figures to change the way they talk about population growth, I suggest being a bit more clear about components of population change. Something like:, “According to the estimate, the balance of net migration (people moving to the MSA minus those moving out) to the region accounted for two thirds of that growth while about one-third is from more births than deaths.”

Yes, what Lloyd says is tidy clarification.
