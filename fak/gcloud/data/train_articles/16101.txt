Emails, Robbie Searcy, communications manager, Electric Reliability Council of Texas, March 22 and 29 and April 7, 2016

I write because we’re checking this claim made by President Obama while in Texas: “Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels.”

?

I’d be happy to visit for our story by phone or email.

I would give this a mostly true.

Within the ERCOT real-time wholesale energy market, all generation that is used in any interval technically clears at the same price, which is the highest price of all resources used to serve demand in each load zone at that time.

During periods of high wind output, wind generation resources are able to offer power into the market at very low, and sometimes negative, prices. This in turn drives down the settlement point prices for all resources operating during those intervals, especially when demand is low.

Does that make sense?

Best,

Robbie

Hello again. I just realized that I failed to account for natural gas-fired electricity in the comparison. Tweakable?

7AM Values:

Coal = $14.14

Wind = –$23.89

Gas = $23.37

Daily Values:

Coal = $14.91

Wind = –$23.41

Gas = $41.43

The revised graph and corresponding data are attached. Keep in mind that, when we talk about natural gas-fired resources, that covers a broad range of technologies and efficiency levels, from older steam units to more modern combined-cycle units to quick-start combustion turbines.

Thanks,

Robbie
