Florida House District 69: Josh Shulman (D), Kathleen Peters (R)
The District 69 House race offers voters a pair of confident candidates with divergent goals and backgrounds. Kathleen Peters has served on South Pasadena's City Commission since 2008. She is currently the mayor, a commission-appointed position. Josh Shulman lost a bid last year for St. Petersburg City Council. Peters entered the race with a bevy of high-profile endorsements and has raised substantially more money, but Shulman doesn't seem deterred. Since May, Shulman says, he has knocked on voters' doors every weekend but one. The Florida Democratic Party also recently released an aggressive TV ad promoting Shulman and attacking Peters.
