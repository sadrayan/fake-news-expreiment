Bush and Rubio blast Clinton college affordability plan as major tax increase
Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio on Monday blasted Hillary Clinton’s proposed overhaul of higher education funding as a massive tax increase.

"We don’t need more top-down Washington solutions that will raise the cost of college even further and shift the burden to hardworking taxpayers,” Bush said in a statement. “We need to change the incentives for colleges with fresh policies that result in more individualization and choices, drive down overall costs, and improve the value of a college degree, which will help lead to real, sustained four-percent economic growth.

"We also need additional pro-growth economic policies that will give more college graduates the opportunity to achieve earned success rather than continuing down the path of declining workforce participation and access to jobs."

Rubio, appearing on Fox & Friends, echoed criticism of the tax increases Clinton’s $350 billion plan would require. Rubio said it would pour money into an “outdated higher education system,” and said there needs to be more focus on nontraditional schooling, such as online or skill certification programs.

The AP outlines Clinton’s plan, which she’ll detail in New Hampshire today:

The proposal centers on a $200 billion federal incentive system aimed at encouraging states to expand their investments in higher education and cut student costs. States that guarantee "no-loan" tuition at four-year public schools and free tuition at community colleges will be eligible to receive federal funds.

The cost of Clinton's plan would be offset by capping itemized tax deductions for wealthy families at 28 percent, like those taken by high-income taxpayers for charitable contributions and mortgage interest. That proposal, which has long been included in President Barack Obama's annual budget, would raise more than $600 billion in the next decade, according to the Treasury Department.
