New York Governor Appoints New Permanent Attorney General, And She ALREADY Lost To Trump
When New York’s attorney general got #MeToo’d, it was difficult to find a qualified candidate because the pool from which Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo could draw was remarkably untalented (he would only even consider Democrats).

Initially, Cuomo appointed Barbara Underwood as Acting Attorney General, but when he gambling addiction became public he quickly rescinded that appointment and went with someone the Democrat Party can trust: Hillary Rodham Clinton.

“We are excited that Secretary Clinton has agreed to serve in this capacity for the remainder of the term,” Cuomo said in a statement announcing his new AG pick. “We are sure that she will do an excellent job continuing former Attorney General Schneiderman’s agenda including the aggressive prosecution of President Trump’s former attorney.”

Cuomo was referencing Michael Cohen, a target in the fake Democrat witch hunt against President Trump and anyone associated with him.

With the sham Russia investigation drawing to a close, we can expect Clinton to employ her usual dirty tricks to harass and undermine President Donald Trump in every way she possibly can.

But we can also expect her to do what she does every single time she comes up against our President: she will lose, and she will lose bigly.

God bless America and our troops, Amen!
