Here's everything Apple just announced, including the new iPhones
Apple unveiled its newest iPhones Wednesday: the iPhone XR, starting at $749; iPhone XS, starting at $999, and iPhone XS Max, starting at $1,099. The iPhone XS and XS Max will be available for pre-order on Friday. They will ship on Sept. 21. The iPhone XR will be available for preorder on Oct. 19 and will ship a week later.

The iPhone XS is water-resistant and comes with a 5.8-inch OLED screen — the same dimensions as last year's iPhone X — Apple's head of marketing, Phil Schiller, announced at the company's annual September product unveiling. The new handsets follow the company's 10th anniversary iPhone X announced at last year's product event and extend Apple's high-end product line.
