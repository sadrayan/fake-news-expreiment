Trump has said he can "humanely" deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country

Washington (CNN) Pressed on how he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country, Donald Trump said Wednesday he would build a "deportation force."

Trump was pressed for specifics on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" by co-host Mika Brzezinski, who asked if he would have a "massive deportation force."

"You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely," Trump said. "Don't forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they're waiting to come in legally. And I always say the wall, we're going to build the wall. It's going to be a real deal. It's going to be a real wall."

Included in the immigration proposal Trump released this past August is a call for to triple the number of immigrations and customs enforcement agents. He has also proposed ending birthright citizenship, which is included in the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution and grants automatic citizenship to anyone born in the U.S.

Trump was hit by both John Kasich and Jeb Bush for sticking by his call to deport 11 million people and build a wall along the Mexican border during Tuesday night's fourth Republican debate.
