1. What is influenza or “flu” and what are the symptoms?

A: Influenza is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. Symptoms include fever (though some people won’t develop one), cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and some people may experience vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults).

2. I got the influenza shot last year, so why do I need to get one this year?

A: Your body’s immune response to the vaccine declines over time, so it is best to get vaccinated every year. Also, influenza viruses are constantly changing, and the formulation of the vaccine is reviewed annually.

3. Can I still get vaccinated?

A: Yes. As long as influenza is circulating there is still time to get the vaccine.
