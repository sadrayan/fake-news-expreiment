Key Changes in Senate Tax Reform Bill Before Vote-a-Rama
This evening, the Senate looks to cap a frenetic few days with the adoption of a “wraparound” amendment to H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A so-called “vote-a-rama” will transpire later this evening, with dozens of floor amendments considered, followed—presumably—by a vote on final passage. These amendments will be drawn to the manager’s amendment which was released this evening around 6 p.m., which incorporated a range of individual members’ amendments that had been prepared for the bill, along with new language negotiated throughout the day. Many of these amendments are technical, clarifying or making minor revisions to non-notable provisions. Some, however, stand out—and were, in some cases, the result of intense negotiations.

A few Senators played an outsized role in securing these revisions. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) secured the retention of the state and local tax deduction for property (capped), a lower threshold for claiming unreimbursed health-care costs, and the restoration of catch-up retirement contributions for certain employees. Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) obtained a gradual phaseout of the bill’s expensing provisions, rather than a sunset after year five. Senators Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Steve Daines (R-MT) prevailed in their effort to increase the pass-through deduction from 17.4 to 23 percent. Of course, each of these provisions comes at a cost, necessitating a series of pay-fors.

What follows is a brief summary of the most notable provisions of the tax bill in the form in which it enters the “vote-a-rama.” It is by no means an exhaustive list of all differences since the bill reported from the Senate Finance Committee, and it is entirely possible that additional substantive changes will be made on the floor, but does attempt to capture the key changes in the version of the bill now before the Senate.
