Grouchy Old Cripple: Political Correctness
Political Correctness

This was sent to me by Woody.

"Political Correctness is a doctrine fostered by a delusional illogical liberal minority & rabidly promoted by an unscrupulous liberal press which holds forth the proposition that it is entirely possible to pick up a turd by the clean end."



--This definition has been attributed to students at Texas A&M; University.
