[Questions from Gardner Selby, PolitiFact Texas]

I write because we’re checking a January statement by George P. Bush that a majority of our children attend under-performing schools. The reader who pointed this out said that the last time the state rated districts, 90 percent met standards.

Bush’s office urges us to consider AYP results, pointing out a news story quoting the education commissioner saying 95 percent of the state’s schools would have failed to satisfy AYP in 2013-14 but for a granted waiver. Is AYP back in place for Texas this year? If so, how many of the schools are expected to meet the expectations? AYP is not in place in Texas now because of the waiver. If it were in place, 2014 is the year that all schools were supposed to have 100 percent of our students pass the state tests to meet AYP requirements. We do fall short of perfection.

What is the current best-measured status of Texas schools and school districts? The only rating system currently in place is the state accountability system.

What share of Texas students attend schools rated under-performing or such? Here’s a state summary. http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2014/statesummary.html The campus-level stats are right below the district level numbers. It shows that 85 percent of the schools met standards and 8.5 percent are in campuses that received a rating of Improvement Required, the equivalent of the old low-performing rating. (Those numbers don’t add up to 100 percent because some campuses aren’t rated.)

Any other recommended agencies or experts we should consult? Some of the education organizations, such as David Anthony at Raise Your Hand Texas, would probably have a choice word or two.

I am interested in estimating or pinning down the share of students in schools not rated acceptable. Best way to do that?

There were 372,287 students enrolled in campuses that received an Improvement Required rating, our lowest rating, in 2014. The total enrollment in the public schools in 2013-2014 was 5,151,925.
