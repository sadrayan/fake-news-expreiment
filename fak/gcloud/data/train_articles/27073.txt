UPDATE: Sheriff Joe Arpaio Sworn In To Replace John McCain
Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now Senator Joe Arpaio. President Trump, after ordering the Governor of New Mexico to appoint George Bailey to the board of the Savings and Loan committee, oversaw the swearing in of Arpaio by the Secretary of Agriculture.

Under the Successional Clause of the 14th Amendment, the person next in charge to the President must perform the ceremony while the President bears witness, otherwise, Habeus Corpus won’t apply and the whole thing is nullified by pocket veto.

Since Randall McDaniel was the next in the line for the Presidency readily available, he was tasked with the job. President Trump later gave him praise:

“Mr. Randy Agro…Culture? Was It? was put in an awkward situation of being next in line to me. As if he could ever live up. I have great stamina. Doctors say I’m as healthy as a horse. Randy? Yeah he was great. Did the thing. Dod you know that had I not been there it wqouldn’t have counted? That’s how important this whole Presidency thing is. It’s a transgressions from the immortality of your own spirit and soulless wonders.”

Such a wise man. Such wise words. Sheriff Joe used the same Bible George Washington carried with him across the Potomac. Now that he’s been sworn in as the 173rd Senator from Arizona, he’s looking forward to “digging in and getting to the business of building that wall.”

Amen, Senator Arpaio. Amen!
