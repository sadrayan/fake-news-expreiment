Lombardi`s Golden Boy Glides Into Hall

Hornung, one of five former National Football League stars who will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday in Canton, Ohio, was the Golden Boy of the Green Bay Packer offense, a gifted runner, blocker, passer and kicker. He was regarded as Lombardi`s special pet. Yet he was also a frequent target of the legendary coach`s acid tongue and temper.

``At the very beginning,`` Hornung rememebered, ``Lombardi said to me, `Paul, we`ve got to build a winning club. I`ve got to chew out a lot of talented people. I`m gonna get on your butt because you can handle it, and you need to be pushed. You`re one of our highest paid players.`

``I was making a lot of money on commercials, and Lombardi wanted to make sure the rest of the team knew I wasn`t getting any special treatment.`` But Hornung was very special to Lombardi and the Packers. He epitomized the spirit and efficiency of their championship teams in the `60s. ``Paul should have been the first player from our team in the Hall of Fame,`` said cornerback Herb Adderley, who was inducted in 1980.

``I had been a quarterback at Notre Dame and then, suddenly, Lombardi told me I was going to be his Frank Gifford, his option halfback,`` Hornung recalled.

``I had a lot of skills, but I needed coaching. You don`t have to coach a Gale Sayers or a Jim Brown that much. But you had to coach a Jimmy Taylor and a Paul Hornung. You even had to motivate Bart Starr.``

Taylor and Starr, Hornung`s backfield mates, already are in the Hall of Fame. Hornung finally was selected to join them last January after 15 years of eligibility. The 28-member panel had balked at recognizing the 1956 Heisman Trophy winner, whose flamboyant nine-year pro career was tainted when commissioner Pete Rozelle suspended him for the 1963 season, along with Detroit defensive tackle Alex Karras, for gambling.

``I have no animosity toward anyone,`` Hornung said. ``I am just extremely happy to be in the Hall of Fame.``

Hornung, now a prosperous businessman in his native Louisville, led the NFL in scoring for three straight seasons, 1959 through 1961, as a runner, receiver and kicker. Lombardi called Hornung the most effective runner inside the 20-yard line he had ever seen.

``You could hand it off to him or throw it to him and somehow he would get the ball in the end zone,`` said Forrest Gregg, a tackle who blocked for Hornung and is now the Green Bay coach.

Lombardi`s Packers were stocked with quality at virtually every position. But Hornung may have been the most important player of all. He rallied the team and had a nose for the end zone.

Lombardi`s respect for Hornung was so great that he went all the way to the White House to free his star player from Army duty in time for the 1961 championship game against the New York Giants. Hornung, a mere private, was sitting in the barracks in Fort Riley, Kan., in December, 1961, when the phone rang.
