Fake News Sites â€“ Changes to Visa Waiver Program
The U.S. Embassy in Peru is aware of false news reports stating that Peru nationals can now travel to the U.S. without a visa. Peru is not currently part of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).

The Department of Homeland Security, which administers the VWP in consultation with the Department of State, has not announced any new VWP entrants. The full list of countries whose citizens or nationals are currently eligible for the VWP, is available here.
