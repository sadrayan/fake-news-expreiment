Gardner,

Here you go.

Re: General homestead exemption: Resolution No. 20140828-086, passed in August 2014, directed the City Manager “to return to Council with an ordinance establishing a percentage-based homestead exemption that results in a $5,000.00 tax exemption for all homesteaded properties no later than December 1, 2014.” Staff is currently working to prepare that ordinance to bring before Council for approval.

Additionally in September 2014, within Resolution No. 20140925-086, Council added support for a ‘hybrid homestead exemption that would allow for a percentage-based general homestead exemption subject to a cap on the maximum value exempted” to its legislative agenda.

Re: the Elderly and Disabled Persons exemptions: In March, Council voted to increase the exemption for these property owners from $51,000 to $70,000. The exemption had not been increased since it was set at $51,000 by Council in 1986.

Thank you,

Melissa

Is the $5000 exemption designed to affect taxes for 2014 or not?

The $5,000 exemption, if adopted, would first affect property tax bills associated with FY 2015-16 (i.e. property tax bills due in January of 2016).

Can you guide me to how you learned this? Who or what is the primary source? I didn’t spot it in the materials online.

Texas Property Tax Code, Chapter 11, Subchapter A, Section 11.13, paragraph (n) states:

(n) In addition to any other exemptions provided by this section, an individual is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of a percentage of the appraised value of his residence homestead if the exemption is adopted by the governing body of the taxing unit before July 1 in the manner provided by law for official action by the body. If the percentage set by the taxing unit produces an exemption in a tax year of less than $5,000 when applied to a particular residence homestead, the individual is entitled to an exemption of $5,000 of the appraised value. The percentage adopted by the taxing unit may not exceed 20 percent.
