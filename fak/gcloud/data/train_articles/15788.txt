David:

To our inquiry, Zach Hunter of the National Republican Congressional Committee provided the attached document. Can you let me know if this document is a PAF for Pete Gallego? If so, it seems to indicate he was employed fulltime by the city from March nearly through August 2015. Is that right? Why?

Otherwise, I am interested in the city job description for the identified position, T17002. Also, what does “MuniProg, Professional” mean?

Who could I interview at the city this afternoon about what Gallego was hired to do?

Thanks for your quick help.

Those documents look like his Personnel File. I’ve attached what we have here so you can compare/confirm if you like. Pete Gallego was a temporary employee in our Government Relations Office from 2 March 2015 – 21 August 2015. He earned $56.26 dollars an hour for a total of $55,359.84 during his employment. While at the Government Relations office he advised the Government Relations Officer on policy and legislation and assisted in document preparation and strategy.

Both the T17002 and “Muniprog, professional” designations are used to identify temporary employees in our personnel tracking systems but don’t denote any specific role or job description.

Unfortunately, both of his former supervisors no longer work at the City so there isn’t really anyone to interview regarding what specific tasks he was assigned to handle on a day-to-day basis.

Thanks,

David Green

During his term of employment Karen Kennard but it is my understanding that John Hrncir may have been involved as well. John retired and Karen moved into the private sector last year.

BTW, did the attachment come through on that email? Some folks were complaining they weren’t getting my attachments.

So, 56.26 x $40 = $2250.40

$2250.40 x 25 weeks = $56260

I checked with our finance people and Temp employees don’t get paid for Federal Holidays since they aren’t working those days.

Memorial Day and Independence Day account for the only 2 Observed Holidays during his employment.

So, $56.26 x 16 hours = $900.16

$56,260 - $900.16 = $55,359.84

So that’s where the number came from.
