UPDATE: Sasha Obama's Racist Anti-White Rant Just Got Her Expelled | …
As you have probably heard, Sasha Obama was suspended from school last week after a racist attack against her high school principal. According to the DC Gazette-Intelligencer , Sasha was upset with a grade she got on a Biology project and screamed at her teacher. But things got worse when she was sent to the principal’s office:

According to school staffers, the youngest Obama daughter accused Principal Chad Harris-Crane of singling her out because she is black.

“You wouldn’t have me in here if I was white,” Sasha told the principal according to a classmate who was waiting to speak to the principal and heard the outburst. “I’m getting sick of you crackers.”

“Don’t you know who my dad is?” she allegedly continued. “I’ll have you fired if you wanna keep this [expletive] up.” The student heard “objects being thrown” but could not be sure who threw them or what was thrown.

Police were called to respond to the attack, but left because “Sasha calmed down.”
