Look Who Just Got a $100 Million Dollar Donation from Saudi Arabia
President Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia was fortuitous for both the Islamic nation and for the Trump family — specifically First Daughter Ivanka.

On the same weekend that Jared Kushner — Ivanka’s husband — brokered a $100 billion arms deal with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, officially the largest arms sale in U.S. history, the Saudis reciprocated by donating $100 million to Ivanka Trump’s female entrepreneurship fund.

The fund — which Ivanka is promoting with the help of the World Bank — is proving to be an ethical minefield for the First Daughter, who has already received donations from other foreign governments from Canada to Germany to the United Arab Emirates. While Ivanka Trump is quick to point out that she doesn’t directly solicit donations, the fact remains that President Trump is a huge fan of his daughter’s project, and countries seeking to curry favor with the Trump administration could hypothetically write a check to his daughter’s entrepreneurship fund.

Kushner’s arms deal with the Saudi government would supply the kingdom with new aerial defense systems by Lockheed Martin, in addition to new tanks, combat ships, and fighter jets.

Saudi Arabia is currently engaged in an ongoing war with Yemen, which has stirred up international controversy and condemnation from human rights watchdogs.

In March, Human Rights Watch referred to a Saudi-led attack on a refugee boat leaving the coast of Yemen as a war crime, when gunfire from a helicopter killed at least 32 civilians, and wounded another 29 (including six children).
