Readers sound off on downtown voting, BDS and Confederate statues
Kew Gardens Hills: I was wondering exactly who will decide which monuments and statues around the country will be removed because they are considered "offensive." Will Gov. Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker be the ones to decide? Will those monuments offensive to African-Americans be the only ones to be removed? What about those statues that are offensive to gays, Catholics, Jews, Hispanics, Irish, Muslims or any other group? What about monuments to former Klansman and Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.)? They should be the first to be taken down. And, by the way, Booker himself and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand should remove themselves from the Senate because they are offensive to Jews. They are supporters of the BDS movement against Israel, which is nothing less than thinly veiled anti-Semitism. Many people are offended by their presence in the Senate. Barry Koppel
