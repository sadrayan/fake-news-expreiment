DogsBite.org - From February 2013 to March 2018, Animal control and health departments in at least 17 U.S. states report that pit bulls are leading all breeds in biting incidents, including: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The oft-quoted false claim that pit bulls "do not bite more than other breeds" is untrue. Along with dominating bite counts, the pit bull bite is also the most damaging, often inflicting permanent and disfiguring injuries. For earlier bite report years, please see Archived Dog Biting Incidents: 2005 to 2012. In May 2018, after two pit bulls mauled an elderly woman to death in Gulfport, police released recent dog bite statistical data . From May 2016 to May 2018, there were 119 canine biting incidents. 106 involved dogs "at large" biting people, compared to 13 that were not at large. Pit bulls were responsible for over half in both categories. Pit bulls accounted for 53% (63 of 119) of the total incidents, including 53% (56 of 106) of at large incidents. Pit bulls inflicted 10 times more bites than the next closest breed, German shepherds, which accounted for 5% (6 of 119) of the total biting incidents. Labradors followed with 4% (5 of 119) of the total biting incidents.In April 2018, the Animal Health & Public Safety Department of Kansas City fulfilled a public information request by supplying a report of animal biting incidents in 2017 . A total of 418 bites were reported to the department. Dogs inflicted 346 of these bites. Pit bulls inflicted the highest number of bites, 152 (44%), and four times more than the next closest breed, labrador retrievers, which inflicted 38 (11%). German shepherds followed with 27 (8%) bites and American bulldogs with 14 (4%) bites. Notably, 21 (5%) of all reported animal bites in the entire city occurred at the Kansas City Pet Project Animal Shelter, which operates the city's open admission shelter.Also in April, the Franklin County Health Department stated that 31 animal biting incidents have been reported so far in 2018. 23 were dog bites and pit bulls inflicted 9 of them, 39%. Public Health Supervisor Tony Buel said that 2017 was the first year he began tracking breed information. "Pit bulls are the main breed we see bites from," Buel said, followed by Jack Russell terriers and mixed-breeds. For all of 2017, 219 animal bites were reported to the health department. Dogs inflicted 193 of those bites and pit bulls inflicted 43. Buel said the majority of severe injury dog bites come from pit bulls and cases with the worst damage almost always involve pit bulls.In January 2018, a study was published about dog bites in Allegheny County between 2007 and 2015. When excluding "mix-breeds," purebred pit bulls accounted for 27.2% of all dog bites, yet only comprised 4.9% of the registered dog breeds. The next closest breed, German shepherds, inflicted 10.5% of all bites and comprised 5.2% of the registered dog breeds. Across age groups, pit bulls inflicted over 2 times the number of bites (66 v. 29) to children 0-3 years than any other dog breed; 2.7 times more bites (90 v. 33) to ages 4-6 years; over 2.7 times more bites (207 v. 75) to ages 7-12 years; and 4 times more bites (184 v.46) to ages 13-18 years. ( View chart In November 2017, Contact 5 published an investigation into dangerous dogs in Palm Beach County, Florida. By examining dog bite records, they discovered there were over 1,700 dog bites in the county last year, but less than 100 dogs were designated as dangerous, appearing on the county's dangerous dog list. The investigation broke down the dangerous dog list by breed ( view related chart ). Topping the chart were pit bulls (32) with over twice as many designated as dangerous than the next closest breed, labrador retrievers (14). Through their investigative research, they also uncovered a fatal dog attack that occurred in late August in Lake Worth.In October 2017, thepublished a powerful piece ( From the Editor: No, these are not nice dogs ) after Pima Animal Care Center dropped breed labels in order to adopt out more pit bulls to the unsuspecting adopting public. The editorial also cites Pima County dog bite statistics. "Pit bulls were responsible for 319 bites last year in Pima County, more than 50 percent higher than No. 2 German Shepherd (197)." Back in 2011, after a 4-year calculation of reported dog bites in Pima County, reported bites inflicted by pit bulls were only 34% higher than the next closest breed, German shepherds (pit bulls 848 bites, versus German shepherds 633 bites).In September 2017,analyzed 2,800 bite reports made from May 2012 to May 2017. Of the 23 zip codes included in the analysis, two adjacent ones in North Sacramento -- 95815 and 95838 -- made up a quarter of all bite reports. Pit bulls dominated bite reports, responsible for more than one third of them. Of the 2,800 reported bites, pit bulls accounted for 922, more than four times more than the next closes breed, chihuahuas, which accounted for 225. Despite the "massive" disproportion, local animal-welfare officials dismissed this statistic, indicating yet again why such types have should have "zero role" in public safety.In August 2017, the Springfield-Greene County Health Department released dog bite statistical data after a proposed pit bull ban. Despite already being regulated by the city, pit bulls lead all other breeds in biting incidents, accounting for 38 between 2015 and 2017. The agency also released severity of injuries using the Dunbar Scale , where 1 is aggressive behavior and 6 results in death. Pit bulls were responsible for 15 Level 2 attacks, 15 Level 3 attacks, five Level 4, and three Level 5 attacks. Pit bulls are the only breed responsible for a Level 5 attack (multiple bites at Level 4 or above; a concerted, repeated attack) during the period, according to the data.In June 2017, after two life-threatening pit bull attacks required victims to be airlifted to trauma hospitals, Pueblo Animal Services (PAS) released dog attack statistics. Of the 13 dog attacks on humans this year, 11 have involved pit bull-type dogs, according to Lindsey Vigna, lieutenant of animal law enforcement for PAS. The vicious attacks, occurring less than a week apart, involved two family pit bulls attacking an elderly woman who suffered severe facial, hands and torso injuries, along with a fractured jaw. The other attack involved an 18-month old boy mauled by a family pit bull-mix at his home. The boy suffered severe injuries to his head, face and neck.Also in June, the Broward County's Animal Care and Adoption Division reported the county's top three biting breeds from June 2016 to June 2017. American Staffordshire terriers ( an interchangeable name with pit bull terriers ) led with 92 biting incidents, followed by pit bull terriers with 26 biting incidents. The third highest-ranking breed, labrador retrievers, had 22 biting incidents. Officials in Tamarac, also located in Broward County, said there had been only two pit bull-related bites in the city over the past few years. Tarmac has had a pit bull ordinance in place since 1985. Soon, only Sunrise and Miami-Dade County will regulate pit bulls in south Florida.In late April 2017, thereviewed dog biting incidents in the city and county after a pit bull broke free of its chain and fatally attacked a 60-year old man. According to the Public Health Department of Dayton and Montgomery County, there were 169 reported dog bites from owners who resided in Dayton last year. So far this year -- from January 1 to late April -- there were 56 reported dog bites from dogs whose owners live in Dayton. "In Montgomery County, there have been 245 reported dog bites so far this year. About 60 (24%) of the bites involved pit bulls, which was far more than any other breed identified," reports theIn March 2017, thereviewed dog bite and registration records across Cape Cod. Between January 2016 and February 2017, pit bulls had the most biting incidents, 58, nearly twice as many as the next closest breed, labrador retrievers, which inflicted 29 bites. German shepherds followed, inflicting 26 bites. Pit bulls represented 12.6% of the breeds listed on bite reports, but only make up 1.2% of the registered dogs. In contrast, labrador retrievers were 6.3% of the breeds listed on bite reports and make up 11.5% of the registered dogs. German shepherds represented 5.7% of the breeds listed on bite reports and make up 2.2% of the registered dogs.In a special addition, we are including statistics for the City of Montreal, poised to adopt a pit bull ban on September 27, 2016. The legislation comes three months after the brutal mauling death of Christiane Vadnais , killed by a neighbor's pit bull. On the eve of this historic vote, Montreal officials released dog biting incident statistics. Over the past 1.5 years, 362 serious dog bite incidents. Since January 1, 2015, 137 people and animals have been badly injured or killed by pit bulls or pit bull crossbreeds. Pit bulls, which account for just 4.6% of registered dogs in Montreal, are responsible forIn January 2016, after the back-to-back fatal pit bull attacks of 22-year old Rebecca Hardy in Port Huron and 4-year old Xavier Strickland in Detroit,published dog bite statistics for Port Huron, a city with about 30,000 people. In 2014, pit bulls were responsible for over half of all dog bites in the city. There were 61 reported dog bites in 2014, and 33 of those were inflicted by pit bulls. This is in contrast to the city of Toronto, a population of 2.6 million people, where pit bulls only inflicted 13 bites in 2014 . The Province of Ontario adopted a pit bull ban in 2005. Since this time, attacks inflicted by pit bulls in Toronto, Ontario's largest city, have dropped by 92% In November 2015, Cleveland 19 published dog bite statistical data from Cleveland showing the results of two time periods. In 2014, pit bulls were responsible for 40% of all dog bites where the dog's breed was identified. During the next 8-month period, January 1, 2015 to August 12, 2015, pit bulls were responsible for 41% of all dog bites involving an identified breed. Despite this, the city's Chief Animal Control Officer, Ed Jamison, denied that pit bulls posed a danger to the public and also denied that the city shelter -- with a pit bull occupancy rate of 40% -- posed a problem to the shelter. Cleveland 19 dubbed the city shelter, "" (View: full data file ).In October 2015, Hastings city officials discussed repealing their pit bull ordinance that prima facie declares pit bulls "dangerous." During discussions, Hastings City Police Chief Jeff Pratt shared statistics on dog-related complaints dating back to 2011. The statistics showed that 48% of all dog bites involved pit bulls, 41% of dangerous or aggressive dog complaints involved pit bulls and 66% of dogs shot by officers were pit bulls. Overall, “45.7% of our dog calls involve the pit bull breed,” Pratt said. “To me, this is a very significant number." These statistics clearly show that removing the existing ordinance , which does not prevent people from owning pit bulls, is injudicious.In June 2015, WKMG 6 News published the results of county dog bites over a 1-year period. From October 2013 to September 2014, Orange County Animal Services issued 331 citations to dog owners for failing to control their pets that resulted in a bite. Pit bulls and their mixes were responsible for 35% of all bites. Labs followed in distant second place with 7%. German shepherds and chihuahuas each made up 6% of all reported bites. The records showed that 7% of all bites occurred when someone tried to break up a fight between two dogs or rescue a dog being attacked by another dog and 2% of the owners were repeat offenders . (View: graphic chart ).In March 2015, the Oregonian released results of an investigation of Portland-area dog bites since 2010. The investigation showed that there were 3,940 total reported biting incidents. Pit bulls inflicted 510 of these bites and were responsible for more bites than all other dog breeds. Labs, which outnumbered licensed pit bulls by nearly 5-to-1, fell at a distant second with 427 bites. Among the highest biting rates by breed, pit bulls were number one with a 120 rate, followed by chows with a 100 rate, rottweilers 87 and mastiffs 76. The lowest biting rate breeds were golden retrievers, poodles and pomeranians with 12 and 13 rates accordingly (View: graphic chart ).In January 2015, a study examining dog bite injuries at the level 1 trauma pediatric center in Phoenix was released (study years of 2007-2013). "Pit bulls were most frequently responsible, accounting for 39% (83/213) of incidents in which dog breed was documented," states the study. The study only examined patients whose intake was by ambulance. The study also examined county dog licensing records from 2008 and noted, "Pit bulls accounted for 6.25% of the licensed dog population, only the seventh most popular breed." Labradors were the most popular breed (25.7%) in the county, but only accounted for 3.5% of the patients in the dog bite injury study.In November 2014, ABC 13 Eyewitness News did an investigation into the number of dog bites in the City of Houston . This is the first known reporting of total dog bites in Houston on record in many years (and possibly ever). Statistics pertain to January 1, 2014 to September 24, 2014 and were supplied by the Bureau of Animal Regulation and Control (BARC).Of the 1540 total reported bites during this period, pit bulls led with 518, double the number of the next topmost biting breed, German shepherds with 253 biting incidents. Labs followed in third place with 171. Notably, Belgium malinois were also represented in fifth place with 37 (View: graphic chart ).Also in November, NBC 7 released an investigative report after examining 7,600 bite reports between July 2011 and June 2014 in the jurisdiction of Animal Services, which includes the unincorporated portion of the county, and the cities of San Diego, Carlsbad, Santee, Solana Beach, Del Mar and Encinitas. Pit bulls had the most bites, a total of 851 during the 3-year period. Followed by German shepherds with 349 (less than half). In the 11-month period of December 2011 to November 2012, dogs in San Diego County killed four people , five if one includes a San Diego pit bull that was taken across the border and within a week killed a little girl in Tijuana Also in November, after city council wrestled with pit bull advocates about their ordinance that declares pit bulls "vicious," assistant Des Moines city manager Kandi Reindl presented data showing that pit bulls are still out biting the most popular dog breed despite being regulated. The fist six months of data from 2014 showed that pit bulls were responsible for 27 biting incidents, more than any other breed, out of 150 incidents. Labs followed with 14. However, there are 1,831 licensed Labs compared with 466 licensed pit bulls, according to licensing data. "We have more bites by a pit bull than a Lab and there are four times as many Labs in the city," Reindl said.In September 2014, after a 20-month old boy was badly bitten in the face by his grandmother's pit bull in Manheim Township, the LancasterOnline wrote an editorial ( Pit bulls and small children may be dangerous mix ) and provided state dangerous dog designation statistics. Of the 562 dogs on the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture’s Dangerous Dog registry, pit bulls accounted for a whopping 41%. The next highest category on the list, mixed-breeds (non-pit bulls), accounted for 23%. "That is not even a single breed," notes the editorial. The single breed with the second-highest percentage on the list were German shepherds, accounting for just 7%.In August 2014, after a series of pit bull attacks in Western Washington, KIRO 7 obtained bite statistics from area municipalities and learned that pit bulls are 8.5 times more likely to attack than other dog breeds. Of the areas investigated, King County, Pierce County, Snohomish County and the City of Tacoma, only King County collected dog bites "by breed." In that county (presumably excluding Seattle), there were 178 total dog bites in 2013. Pit bulls topped the charts with 36 bites, followed by Labs with 28 bites. However, there are 16,651 labs and only 2,520 pit bulls registered in the county , which means that pit bulls are 8.5 times more likely to bite than Labs.In June 2014, Boston.com published an article titled, 'But, My Pit Bull Would Never Attack' May Be Wishful Thinking . The publication then plowed through several years of dog bite statistics. From January 2012 to June 2014, there were 661 total dog bites in Boston, which includes bites against human, animal and unknown victims. Pit bulls and their mixes were responsible for 27% (180), despite pit bulls only making up 3% of the registered dog population. In 2012, a state anti-BSL law signed by Governor Deval Patrick struck down the City of Boston's Responsible Pit Bull Ownership Act . Ever since, attacks by pit bulls have been on the rise. See: related graphic Also in June, after one of the worst attacks the region has ever seen , Hamilton County Health Department data showed that from January 1 to May 11, 2014, there were 38 biting incidents involving pit bulls and their mixes. In 2013, there were 74 total pit bull biting incidents. 2014 is on pace to top the total reported in 2013. Notably absent from the data is 2011 comparison statistics when Cincinnati still had a pit bull ban. Cincinnati repealed their longstanding ban in May 2012. The recent victim, 6-year old Zainabou Drame , suffered unimaginable injuries, including her tongue ripped out and her jaw torn off. Two pit bulls latched onto her face and pulled it apart.In May 2014, Franklin County Department of Animal Care and Control released 2013 statistical data showing Nuisance, Dangerous and Vicious Designations by Breed (See: data chart ). This data is a reflection of the new state law adopted in 2012. Pit bulls topped the charts in all three categories. Of the 208 total Nuisance designations in 2013, pit bulls received 79 (38%), followed by "mix" with 69 and Labs with 8 -- pit bulls towering over Labs by a 990% margin. Of the 291 total Dangerous designations, pit bulls received 124 (43%), followed by "mix" with 87 and German shepherds with 15. Of the 23 total Vicious designations in 2013, pit bulls received 13 (57%).In February 2014, Alderman John Strasser introduced a pit bull sterilization ordinance to combat shelter overpopulation and a disproportionate number of attacks by pit bulls. Statistics complied by Public Health Madison and Dane County showed that: "More than half of the dogs euthanized at the humane society during 2010-12 were pit bulls … Pit bulls accounted for 12 percent of incidents involving dogs biting humans and 38 percent of the dog-on-dog attacks in the city in 2013. They also made up 21 percent of the cases of dogs running at large and 48 percent of abandoned dogs. Of the 15 dogs that were declared dangerous during 2011-13, 14 were pit bulls."In January 2014, after a pit bull repeatedly escaped its yard terrorizing citizens and killing a pet dog, Bullhead City Police Department released dog bite statistics. The statistics showed that pit bulls were responsible for nearly half of all biting incidents. In 2013, animal control officers responded to 126 dog bites. Of these bites, (48%) -- 60 -- were inflicted by pit bulls and their mixes. The other half was spread among a variety of breeds. The release of the statistics and discussion of creating a stronger dog ordinance came just weeks after a Bullhead City man was fatally injured by his own five dogs trying to break up a dog fight in late December.Also in January, Medford City Council began considering ways to crack down on the growing number of attacks by dangerous dog breeds. In the past three years, 89 reports of dog bites were received, according to the Medford Police Department. Pit bulls were involved in half of the attacks, and pit bulls or their mixes were responsible for 8 of the 11 fatal attacks on animals. Councilor Karen Blair began looking into the matter after a series of aggressive dog-on-dog attacks. Blair wants to review how other cities have controlled the problem , which includes reviewing cities with pit bull bans mandatory pit bull sterilization or insurance requirements.In December 2013, the Chicago Tribune published dog bite statistical data logged by the city's Commission on Animal Care and Control during 2012. Of the total dog and cat bites recorded in 2012 (according to 2011 Chicago data , canines were responsible for about 98%), pit bulls and their mixes topped the chart accounting for 44.3% of all bites. The published statistical chart shows just how much of the pie -- total dog and cat bites combined in the City of Chicago -- pit bulls and their mixes make up from 2006 forward. In 2006, pit bulls were responsible for 26.5% of all bites; in 2008, this grew to 31.2%; in 2010, up to 39.2% and in 2012, 44.3%.In November 2013, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported that nearly one-third of all dog bites in 2012 were attributed to pit bulls, according to the city animal services department. In 2012, 84 of the 271 reports of dog bites were attributed to pit bulls (31%). At a distant second were Labs with 28. As of October 2013, 70 reports of dog bites were attributed to pit bulls followed by chihuahuas with 24; the disproportional trend continues in 2013. The article then citesof the breed. One falsely claimed that pit bulls are one of the most " popular dog breeds in the country ," thus the high number of bites. In truth, pit bulls make up 6% of the total U.S. dog population.In August 2013, after a man had his lower jaw ripped off by a pit bull , KXLY.com examined the records from the Spokane Regional Health District, which tracks all dog bites. Since the start of 2012, there have been 249 dog bites. Pit bulls account for the "vast majority of those bites with 56," 63 bites when adding their mixes. Pit bulls make up 3% of licensed dogs and account for 25% of the recorded bites in the city and county of Spokane. German shepherds and their mixes account for 6% of all licensed dogs and account for 11% of all bites. Labradors and their mixes account for the largest percent of licensed dogs, 14%, and account for 7% of all bites.In June 2013, after a 5-year old boy was mauled to death by a bullmastiff-mix, Hot Springs Animal Services reported that the "largest number of breed-specific bites were pit bulls at 21% in 2008 and 2009." In 2012, pit bulls and their mixes accounted for 58% of all bites, according to Animal Services Director Dan Bugg. He added that in recent years, the number of pit bulls in Hot Springs and Garland County has continued to rise along with an alarming number of bites. The dog bite data was announced as Garland County discusses a vicious dog ordinance that places added restrictions on "high-risk breeds," including pit bulls and their derivatives.In May 2013, The Journal Gazette published dog bite statistical data from Fort Wayne Animal Care and Control. During 2012, 709 biting incidents were reported (human and animal victims). Pit bulls racked up 242 bites, 34.1% of all biting incidents. Pit bulls out bit the next closest breed -- German shepherds with 51 bites -- by. The article also details a vicious attack by a pit bull-mastiff mix during the period. Angela Diamente was walking her leashed boxer, named Dulli, and pushing her 2-year old daughter in a stroller when the dog latched its jaws around Dulli's throat. The violent and bloody struggle to free her dog lasted 10 to 15 minutes.In March 2013, after two pit bulls killed a little boy in Walworth County , Milwaukee Area Domestic Animal Control Commission (MADACC) released 2012 dog bite statistics. Back in 2011, we reported dog bite data from the same agency for the years 2008 to October 31, 2011 . Placing the years into chronology, the continued rise of pit bull biting incidents is sobering. We predict pit bulls will be out bitingin the Milwaukee area within 9 months. In 2008, pit bulls made up 33% of all biting incidents; in 2009, the percent grew to 39%; in 2010, 44%; in 2011, 45%; and in 2012, pit bulls made upAlso in March, animal control records from Broward and Palm Beach counties once again showed that pit bulls were the leading biters. "No other breed came close," notes the news article. (See: Related Sun-Sentinel graphic .) In Broward County, pit bulls (151 bites) led the second top biter, German shepherds (23 bites), by nearly 7 times. Of all reported dog bites in Broward County (305), pit bulls were responsible for about 50%. In Palm Beach County, pit bulls (330 bites) led the second top biter, Labs (122 bites) by almost 3 times. Of all reported dog bites in Palm Beach County last year (1,411) pit bulls were responsible for about 23%.Also in March, West Memphis City Councilman Tracy Catt presented an Animal Control Commission report to city council members showing that pit bulls were responsible for 57% of the city’s 28 dog bites in 2012. The report states that of the 16 pit bull bites reported, 31% of the bite victims were children 14 and younger.. The report also states that pit bulls account for more than 30% of all dogs taken into the city's shelter.
