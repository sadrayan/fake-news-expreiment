Statement from Senator Van Wanggaard

“Over 70,000 people voted yesterday in a historic election. We know that there are a number of outstanding absentee ballots, voting irregularities, and that there were problems across the county in the unofficial tally of ballots.” “People across the state and country have asked that I immediately ask for a recount.



However, we all know that the best decisions are made when well-rested and after consideration of all options.” “We will closely monitor the canvass of votes with legal representation. We will evaluate our options regarding recounts following the official count of ballots.”
