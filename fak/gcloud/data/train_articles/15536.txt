At the end of the day, I find that the Senate’s $4.63 billion tax relief package (franchise tax cut of $2.48 billion and property tax relief of $2.15 billion) would be the largest tax cut in the state’s history.

The fiscal note that shows a larger 2006 property tax cut package than the current Senate package merely a hypothetical that didn’t bear out in reality from higher local tax rates and higher appraisals. If you look at the total fiscal notes for cuts to the franchise tax, they amount to $2.48 billion. Considering the actual property tax cuts in 2007 from the 2014 Comptroller report in Exhibit 9, the 2006 property tax relief amounted to only a minor reduction of approx. $400 million in overall property tax revenues and a $2 billion cut in the school tax property levy in 2007. Both the total and school property tax revenues were above the 2006 level in 2008, erasing any property tax cuts during that two year period. This.

Therefore, I can only conclude that the Senate’s tax package would be largest tax cut in the state’s history. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best,

Vance
