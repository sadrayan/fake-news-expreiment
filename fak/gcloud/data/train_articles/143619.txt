What is up with this fake-ass looking trailer for Danny McBride as the son of Crocodile Dundee?
A teaser trailer for a new, previously completely-unheard-of movie arrived on the internet yesterday, and we have to admit that we’re stumped: Is Danny McBride actually starring in a bizarrely conceived, 30-years-later sequel to Crocodile Dundee, or is this some sort of elaborate joke?

All of the promotional materials for Dundee (subtitle: the awkward mouthful The Son Of A Legend Returns Home) seem to be taking the idea relatively seriously, with a website touting its plot outline—Paul Hogan’s Crocodile Dundee is lost in the Outback, so his illegitimate American son has to go hunt him down—and a trailer that sees McBride goofing on the old “That’s not a knife” bit. The site even lists Rimfire Films, the company that produced the original Crocodile Dundee and its sequel, as the production company for this latest effort.

But also: C’mon. Moving past the fact that this feels exactly like the sort of joke project McBride would spend time and energy on—possibly in the interest of promoting some other, less ridiculous film—there are also a few other clues that bring its Aussie authenticity into question. Like the fact that the country’s film board, Screen Australia, doesn’t seem to know it exists, or that the shots in the website’s gallery section all seem to come from the trailer shoot. We’re not sure what McBride would actually be promoting if this turns out to be a stunt—having recently finished up on HBO’s Vice Principals, he’s a fairly free agent at the moment—but we’re not convinced yet that “Brian Dundee” is anything more than a hoax.
