Tell Bob Dold...
Republican Bob Dold refuses to sign a Congressional petition that would force Speaker Ryan to allow a vote on commonsense gun safety legislation.



Instead, Dold continues to side with his Republican leadership and the NRA in blocking consideration of a bill that would keep firearms out of the hands of people on the terrorist watch list.



Itâ€™s time our Congressman started listening to the voters, not his party.



Sign YOUR name to tell Bob Dold to sign HIS name to the petition for commonsense gun safety legislation.
