A white ball of light with a fiery tail that streaked across the night skies over Arizona was debris from a newly launched Russian rocket re-entering the earth's atmosphere, the U.S. Strategic Command said Wednesday.

The fireball, seen over Arizona, Nevada and California late Tuesday, triggered its own firestorm on social media, as observers on the ground shared videos and photos of the fireball flying through the sky and pondered whether it was a meteor or space debris from a fallen satellite.

The strategic command, which follows some 16,000 "on-orbit cataloged objects," said it could not accurately track where the debris ended up because of the "damaging effects" of re-entry.

In dry military-speak, the command noted on Twitter that it had "removed the SL-4 rocket body from the U.S. satellite catalog" after the "decayed object" entered the atmosphere.

The SL-4 rocket was launched by Russia on Monday, Strategic Command said.
