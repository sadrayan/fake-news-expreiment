Dr. Peisner-Feinberg has been involved in several national research efforts as well, including a national center examining research issues for young dual language learners; a national research consortium that studied quality issues in Head Start and served as a technical advisory panel for key national studies (FACES and Head Start Impact Study); and the Cost, Quality, and Child Outcomes in Child Care Centers Project (CQO), one of the most well-known large-scale studies of center-based child care and childrenâ€™s development and school success from the preschool years through the end of elementary school. She has disseminated this work to a variety of audiences and authored numerous publications, including co-editing a recent handbook on RTI in early childhood.
