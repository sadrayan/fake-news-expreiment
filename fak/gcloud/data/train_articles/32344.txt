Who's the most bipartisan Ohioan in Congress? See how your member scored
WASHINGTON - Even as partisan infighting has stalled much of Washington's legislating, some Democrats and Republicans are still trying to work together.

A new study from Georgetown University and a public policy group founded by former Indiana GOP Sen. Richard Lugar attempts to quantify which members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives behave in a bipartisan fashion by co-sponsoring legislation with their opposite party counterparts.

According to the ranking released Tuesday, Ohio Republican Rob Portman is the second most bipartisan legislator in the U.S. Senate. Only Maine Republican Susan Collins scored higher. Ohio's other Senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, ranked 61 out of the 98 Senators examined, while Vermont Democrat Bernie Sanders had the Senate's lowest score.

Portman works hard to find common ground with his colleagues, said his press spokeswoman, Emily Benavides.

"Whether it's securing opioid funding or fighting to stop online sex trafficking, he's been able to navigate a challenging political environment and deliver results for the people of Ohio," Benavides said.

The most bipartisan Ohio legislator in the U.S. House of Representatives was Columbus-area Republican Rep. Steve Stivers, who ranked 37th overall, the survey said. Stivers chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee - which aims to ensure election of GOP members of Congress. He nonetheless has co-founded a "Civility and Respect Caucus" with his Democratic counterpart in the Columbus area, Rep. Joyce Beatty.

Stivers said he tries to ensure that any bill he introduces has a Democrat as lead cosponsor, and says he strives to "find common ground and" work across the aisle, because I believe it is the best and most effective way to do my job for the people of my district.

"There are good Members of Congress in both parties, and I appreciate the opportunity to share ideas and find solutions to the issues that face our country alongside them," he continued.

Jim Renacci of Wadsworth was next in Ohio - ranked 60th in the House and Dave Joyce of Bainbridge Township was behind him, with a 70th ranking.

Champaign County GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the most conservative House of Representatives members, did the least outreach across party lines of any Ohioan, according to the study, ranking 419 out of the 438 it examined.

Rep. Tim Ryan of the Niles area was Ohio's most bipartisan Democrat, ranking 86th in the study, while Rep. Marcia Fudge had the lowest score among Ohio Democrats, with a 292 ranking.

Among all U.S. House of Representatives members, the study said Minnesota Democrat Collin Peterson was the most bipartisan, and Alabama Republican Mo Brooks was the least.

The survey rated only 98 Senators and 438 House of Representatives because it excluded each legislative body's top party leaders, as well as Congress members who served fewer than six months in 2017.

The "Bipartisan Index" used in the study measures how often members of Congress introduce bills that draw co-sponsors from members of the other party, and how often they co-sponsor a bill introduced from across the aisle. A 0.00 score represents the average for a member of Congress over a 20-year statistical baseline. Scores above 0.00 are judged to be bipartisan, those below 0.00 are partisan.

"Members of Congress, from the most progressive to the most conservative can score well on the Index if they dedicate themselves to seeking bipartisan support for their own legislation and give fair consideration to a variety of legislative initiatives," said a statement from Lugar, who spent 36 years in the U.S. Senate.

Overall, the survey found significant shifts in bipartisan behavior in the Senate, where Republican scores improved to their highest levels since 2008, while scores of Senate Democrats declined sharply to near record lows.

"Index data shows that Senate Republicans are cosponsoring Democratic bills in much higher percentages than is normally the case for the majority party, while Democrats are cosponsoring Republican bills at a lower frequency than is normal for the minority party," the study said. "The motivations of each member are unique, but the gap in Senate scores between the parties must be seen in the context of relative election vulnerabilities and reactions to the first year of the Trump Administration."

In the House, the study found that Republicans as a group scored slightly better than Democrats (-.14 to -.34) with 89 Republicans earning bipartisan scores, compared to 60 Democrats.
