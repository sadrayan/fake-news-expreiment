Moms stage 'nurse-in': 49 states allow public breastfeeding, Idaho not one of them
Dozens of nursing moms gathered with family and friends on the steps of the Capitol Friday, calling for Idaho to pass a law making it clear breastfeeding in public is perfectly acceptable.

Without such an endorsement, they say breastfeeding moms will continue to be rebuked.



"I was actually at the mall here in Boise, when I decided to breastfeed," said Jackie Scott of Mountain Home. "I had a cover over her and a man came up and told me I was disgusting for feeding my baby in public and that I was being indecent."

"I have heard of mothers forced to leave department stores, one woman was police escorted out of a doctor's office," said Amy Miller, with Idaho Moms for Nursing In Public.

The National Conference of State Legislatures says 49 states have laws that allow public breastfeeding, even laws that exempt it from indecency statutes.

Idaho law alone is silent on the subject.

In fact, the only law about breastfeeding on the books in Idaho allows breastfeeding moms to be exempt from jury duty.
