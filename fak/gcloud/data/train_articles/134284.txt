South Africa finishes last in WEF’s 2016 mathematics and science education ranking
The World Economic Forum (WEF) has released its Global Information Technology Report 2016, which ranked South Africa last in mathematics and science education quality.

South Africa also finished close to last – 137 out of 139 countries – when looking at the overall quality of its education system.

The WEF’s 2016 report ranks SA’s mathematics and science education quality lower than that of Nigeria, Mozambique, and Malawi.

This is the third year in a row that South Africa has finished last in the World Economic Forum’s mathematics and science education quality rankings.

It should be noted that these rankings are based on the perceptions of business leaders, and make use of the WEF’s annual Executive Opinion Survey to establish how well a country’s education system is performing.

In this survey, the opinions of business leaders are gathered on a variety of topics.

The rankings therefore detail the perceived quality of mathematics and science education systems.
