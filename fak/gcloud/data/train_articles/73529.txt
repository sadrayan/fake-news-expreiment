Response to statements falsely attributed to CIDRAP regarding Ebola transmission
Oct 16, 2014

On Sep 17, CIDRAP News, a service of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), published a guest commentary by Lisa M Brosseau, ScD, and Rachael Jones, PhD, titled "Health workers need optimal respiratory protection for Ebola." Dr. Brosseau is a Professor and Dr. Jones an Assistant Professor in the School of Public Health, Division of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The commentary addresses potential modes of transmission for Ebola in healthcare settings and discusses the implications for optimal respiratory protection for healthcare workers. CIDRAP concludes that the commentary is based on sound science and believes it is an important consideration in the safety of healthcare workers who provide care to Ebola patients.

Nearly one month after publication of the commentary, the websites Breitbart and The Inquisitr News published incorrect information concerning it. In an effort to correct misinformation, we want to state clearly that:

CIDRAP has not made claims that "Ebola is Airbone" or that "Ebola [is] Transmittable by Air."

The guest commentary cited by Breitbart and The Inquisitr News was authored by two leading researchers with the University of Illinois at Chicago (not the University of Minnesota as wrongly reported).

The Twitter account @UnivMinnNews, which tweeted the article published by The Inquisitr News, is not managed or authorized by the University of Minnesota.

Transmission of Ebola must be considered in both the context of healthcare settings and within the general community. This commentary in question specifically addressed transmission risk within a healthcare setting and does not address community transmission.
