Reviews:

"...Takes [a] sweet, ingenious premise and really runs with it....[Zemeckis] will be spinning funny, whimsical tall tales for a long time to come..." - 07/03/1985 New York Times, p.C18



"...BACK TO THE FUTURE accelerates with wit, ideas and infectious, wide-eyed wonder..." - 06/26/1985 Variety



5 stars out of 5 -- "Robert Zemeckis' popcorn classic combines watertight scripting with broad but brilliant performances, all held together by Fox's stumbling charm." - 09/27/2010 Total Film
