Rubio calls on Crist to help with property taxes and PIP
House Speaker Marco Rubio has asked Gov. Charlie Crist to use his power to add two items to the official agenda for next week's special session: Fixing the Jan. 29th amendment on property taxes and keeping intact Florida's no-fault auto insurance requirement.

In the letter Rubio said both issues cannot be resolved without the "leadership" of Crist.

"We are keenly aware of, and appreciate, your respect and deference to the legislative process,'' wrote Rubio. "However, with regard to these two issues, we have reached a point where without your leadership, the urgent needs of Floridians will not be addressed."
