December 20, 2011 - New York Voters Confused By Tax Deal, But Love Cuomo, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; More Voters Think It's A Tax Hike



Word format



New York State voters are divided on whether they approve or disapprove of the new state tax rates and seem confused on whether the new rates are a tax hike or tax cut, but they approve 68 - 17 percent of the job Gov. Andrew Cuomo is doing, his highest score in his first year in office, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.





Gov. Cuomo's approval sweeps across the political spectrum, 71 - 12 percent among Democrats, 69 - 17 percent among independent voters and 63 - 25 percent among Republicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. Approval ranges from 59 - 20 percent among New York City voters to 71 - 16 percent among upstate voters to 76 - 12 percent among suburban voters.





Grading his first year in office, 10 percent of voters give Cuomo an 'A,' while 53 percent give him a 'B;' 25 percent say 'C,' as 6 percent say 'D' and 3 percent say 'F.'





New York State's new tax rates get a 38 percent approval and a 34 percent disapproval, with 28 percent undecided. Democrats approve 44 - 31 percent, while Republicans split 36 - 38 percent and independent voters split 36 - 36 percent.





The new rates are a tax hike, 40 percent of voters say, while 28 percent say they are a tax cut, with 32 percent undecided. Their own taxes will go up, 35 percent of voters say, while 23 percent say they go down, with 43 percent who don't know. Voters with a college degree split 30 - 31 percent while voters with no degree say 38 - 18 percent their taxes go up.





"The speed in changing the state tax code has left a lot of New Yorkers confused. Most of the state is divided on the merits, with New York City voters more negative than not," said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.





"Whatever they think about the tax deal, New Yorkers still love their governor. Andrew Cuomo's job approval hits a new high, higher than we've seen since the post-9/11 approval ratings for Gov. George Pataki," Carroll said. "Voters like Gov. Cuomo as a person 65 - 13 percent and they like his policies.





"How about your taxes? A lot of people think they'll pay more; a fair percentage think they'll pay less and a lot just don't know."





Cuomo has not kept his promise not to raise taxes, voters say 47 - 35 percent, with 18 percent undecided. Cuomo broke his no-tax promise, Republicans say 53 - 31 percent and independent voters say 51 - 32 percent. Democrats split 41 - 40 percent.





New York State voters also believe 42 - 23 percent, with 35 percent undecided, that in making the tax deal Cuomo broke his promise to end government by "three men in a room."





The new tax rates are fair to them, 37 percent of voters say, while 43 percent say they are unfair. The "fairness" vote increases with income: voters making less than $40,000 say "unfair" 53 - 28 percent while voters making more than $150,000 say "fair" 54 - 36 percent.





The new tax rates for people making more than $2 million are too low, 43 percent of voters say, while 10 percent say they are too high and 34 percent say the rates are about right.





"A lot of people still think those earning $2 million or more don't pay enough," Carroll said.





"That transparent government that Gov. Cuomo promised? Opaque is more like it. A lot of voters think that, in the quickie tax deal, Cuomo broke his promise to end Albany's tradition of 'three men in a room.'"





New York State voter attitudes on other budget-cutting measures are:

60 - 34 percent oppose layoffs for state workers:

45 - 41 percent for state worker furloughs;

59 - 34 percent in favor of a wage freeze for state workers.

From December 12 - 18, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,143 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.
