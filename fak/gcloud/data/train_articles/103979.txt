Teen Charged With Major Drug Trafficking Has Been Let Off. Guess Who Her Dad Is…
At the age of 19, you are an adult. You can be charged as an adult if you commit a crime – right? Well, not always, sometimes, it just depends on who your dad is. Sarah Furay was arrested when Texas authorities found methamphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana in her apartment.

Furay also had packaging material, two digital scales, and a drug price list in her bedroom. She was charged with one count of possession and three counts of manufacturing and delivery of controlled substances; her bail was set at $39,000.

After having spent just one day in jail, Furay was released. Turns out that this young woman’s father is Bill Furay – a DEA agent who has been working with that agency since 2008.



Bill has a long history of success at the DEA. In 2009, ABC reported that he broke up a major drug trafficking organization in the Lake Jackson-Freeport area after a two-year-long undercover investigation.



Today, Bill is serving as the DEA’s diplomatic representative in Panama City, Panama. According to the DEA’s website, a person found guilty of trafficking Schedule 1 and 2 drugs like methamphetamine, marijuana, and cocaine can serve decades in prison.



It is unclear at this time if the younger Furay will be spending any more time in jail. It shouldn’t matter who your parents are – if you commit a crime, you should serve the time.

Sarah Furay will learn nothing from this if she just gets away with it.



Share away, people.
