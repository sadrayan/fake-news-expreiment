#BLM protestors chant "what do we want? DEAD... - Wesley Scott Alexanï¿½
Definitely not ok. I didn't read all the above comments but I DO NOT CONDONE VIOLENCE against ANYONE. Hatred is what got us all in this situation in the first place. SHAMEFUL is not recognizing all the hate groups including the ones that left black men

and women hanging from trees in the south some years back or a group that decided it was ok to drag a black man on a rocky gravel road until he was unrecognized by his own family(RIH Emmit Till). Hate should not be condoned. Murder should not be condoned. <---that goes for police, black lives, and all lives.
