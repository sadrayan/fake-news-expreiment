Flint Water Sampling Objectives
1) Chlorine Residual Monitoring

EPA is collecting samples at businesses and homes throughout Flint to determine chlorine levels in the drinking water system. Chlorine is used to disinfect drinking water and prevent the growth of viruses and bacteria such as E. coli. At appropriate levels, the presence of chlorine in drinking water is normal. At monitoring locations where chlorine is not found, EPA follows up with testing for microbial contamination.

2) Recurring Chlorine Monitoring

Chlorine residual levels are being measured by EPA at 24 locations distributed around the City of Flint. Ten additional locations are being sampled by the Flint water department. The results measured indicate whether there is enough chlorine throughout the City of Flint drinking water system to maintain a barrier to prevent the growth of viruses and bacteria such as E. coli. The results may indicate the need to boost chlorine dosage or flush pipes in certain areas in the system. These data provide information for any necessary actions to be taken by the City of Flint water department.

Additionally, EPA is sampling these locations for the following disinfection byproducts (DBPs):

Total trihalomethanes

Chloroform

Dichlorobromomethane

Dibromochloromethane

Bromoform

Monochloroacetic Acid

Trichloroacetic Acid

Dichloroacetic Acid

Monobromoacetic Acid

Dibromoacetic Acid

Bromochloroacetic Acid

Bromodichloroacetic Acid

Chlorodibromoacetic Acid

Tribromoacetic Acid
