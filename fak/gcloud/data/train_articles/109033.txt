The University of Akureyri, North Iceland, has been selected to offer a curriculum for prospective police officers now that police studies have been brought to a university level. The decision was made by Minister of Education Illugi Gunnarsson, RÚV reports.

Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, rector of the University of Akureyri, states the curriculum and the university are a good match. An evaluation committee had placed the university second behind the University of Iceland when recommending a site for the police program. Eyjólfur pointed out that more factors than the committee’s recommendation weigh in, such as the university’s ability to appeal to students from all over the country, by giving students the option of online studies.

The Icelandic parliament, Alþingi, passed a bill in May, calling for the closure of the State Police Academy (Lögregluskóli ríkisins) September 30th and for the curriculum to be brought to a university level. Four locations for the new curriculum were considered: the University of Iceland, the University of Akureyri, Reykjavík University and Bifröst University, Borgarfjörður. Bifröst did not fulfill requirements for the program.

Eyjólfur is very pleased with the minister’s choice. “We’ve emphasized that police studies fit our university well, and that the university as such is a great fit for police studies. We’re used to providing professional training, both for nurse practitioners and teachers.”

The school year has already begun, or is about to begin,at the country’s universities. Eyjólfur admits that an earlier decision regarding a site for the studies would have been beneficial. He stated that the curriculum will be presented today or tomorrow, that applications will soon be called for and the admissions process begin. He pointed out that in this situation it’s helpful how flexible the curriculum is.
