Americans for Freedom of Information: Really Now, We Do Not Exist
Another Chump: Walks With Whispers Believes the Occidental Lie

July 2, 2009 at 12:29 am

You know, when a group like ours that does not exist sets out to not-actually release a report containing an utter lack of an Occidental College transcript for Barack Obama, it just amazes me. No, it’s not our utterly fictitious act that is so impressive. Any non-existent entity can not do anything, after all. Or after nothing at all, (not) actually. Sigh. Writing from nonexistence is a bit complicated.

But to get back on track, what really impresses me is that despite the multiple indications of the non-existence of the “Americans for Freedom of Information” group in gold-standard fact-check sites all over the web, for months on end reminding people that any claims by the “Americans for Freedom of Information” are utterly bogus and without a shred of documented evidence whatsoever, there are still some chumps out there taken in by all this!

Take “Walks With Whispers,” a fella who posts over at the fishingbuddy.com website. Why, he just cut and pasted the classic made-up hoax that pretends to be from the Associated Press and makes up the fake group “Americans for Freedom of Information” out of thin air… all to make the false claim that Barack Obama somehow registered at Occidental College as an Indonesian citizen.

Ya big silly, Walksy, ya gotta check these facts on Google if ya don’t want to look like a chump. Unfortunately, if ya looks like a chump and ya cuts and pastes like a chump, chances are you’re a chump.

Chump of the Day: Walks With Whispers! Don’t let the Sasquatch and the Illuminati take you down the garden path next time.
