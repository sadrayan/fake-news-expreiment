“Unfortunately my ties are made in China and I will say this, the hats -- �?Make America Great Again’ -- I searched long and hard to find somebody that made the hats in this country,” Trump told ABC News’ David Muir in an interview at Trump Tower. “I pay a lot more money. It is a very hard thing and it’s because they devalue their currency.”

Trump called China “the number one abuser” but asserted that “virtually every country” the United States does business with makes it “impossible” for domestic companies to compete.

Most Trump-branded neckties, shirts and suits are made in China, Bangladesh, or are branded “imported.”

However, his "Make America Great Again" hats are made in the USA, according to the campaign's online store.

Virtually all of his daughter Ivanka Trump’s extensive clothing and accessory line for women is made outside the U.S., with many items manufactured in China.

During a week when presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is sharpening her attacks on Trump over economic issues -- and on the eve of a speech Trump is preparing to deliver in New York tomorrow attacking Clinton -- the Republican presidential contender took direct aim at her in the interview with Muir.

“Hillary Clinton doesn’t know what she’s doing and we have to straighten out our trade deals,” he said. “We have the worst trade deals ever made probably in the history of the world.”

While campaigning in Ohio earlier on Tuesday, Clinton slammed the real estate mogul for outsourcing the manufacturing of some of his products.

“Trump's own products are made in a lot of countries that aren't named America,” Clinton said before listing a number of Trump’s products. “Trump ties are made in China. Trump suits in Mexico. Trump furniture in Turkey. Trump picture frames in Indiana. Trump barware in Slovenia and I could go on and on, but you get the idea.”

Clinton added, “I'd love for him to explain how that fits with his talk of America first.”

In the interview with Muir, Trump did not deny Clinton’s claims and instead said: “She doesn’t have to say that because I say it all the time.”
