This legislation evidently went almost nowhere. O’Rourke told me by phone that he and Cornyn carried some infusions into law.

Per your question from Friday:



Provision from HR 3753/S 1812 (the O’Rourke/Cornyn bill, which was introduced in the House on 12/12/13):



SEC. 4. CROSS-BORDER TRADE ENHANCEMENT.

(a) Agreements Authorized- For purposes of facilitating the construction, alteration, operation, or maintenance of a new or existing facility or other infrastructure at a port of entry, the Administrator may--

(1) enter into cost-sharing or reimbursement agreements; or

(2) accept donations of--

(A) real or personal property (including monetary donations); or

(B) nonpersonal services.



Subsequently, the following language was included in the 2014 Omnibus (HR 3547) that was signed into law on 1/17/14 (relevant section below):



Sec. 559. (a) In General- In addition to existing authorities, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in collaboration with the Administrator of General Services, is authorized to conduct a pilot program in accordance with this section to permit U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enter into partnerships with private sector and government entities at ports of entry for certain services and to accept certain donations.



(Also worth noting that the omnibus included authorization for 2,000 CBP officers at ports of entry; the bill O’Rourke/Cornyn introduced/advocated for included authorization for 5,000 new CBP officers at ports of entry)

Thanks; how do you get to the figure 2,000?

11:39 a.m.

here is the specific cite from the Appropriations Committee Explanatory Material that includes the 2,000 figure:

https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2014/01/15/house-section/article/H475-2

Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation is

funded at $3,215,844,000, of which $2,856,573,000 is for

Inspections, Trade, and Travel at Ports of Entry. For

frontline operations, the bill provides $255,715,000 to hire

not less than 2,000 new CBP officers (CBPO). In addition

$10,000,000 is provided for business transformation

initiatives, targeting efforts, and traveler enhancement

programs, as specified in the House and Senate reports

respectively and $10,000,000 is provided to restore proposed

reductions to mission support. A total of $40,912,000 is

provided for the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism

(C-TPAT) program, the same as fiscal year 2013. As per the

Senate report, $16,741,000 is included to account for the

transfer of the Arrival Departure Information System (ADIS)

from OBIM to CBP.
