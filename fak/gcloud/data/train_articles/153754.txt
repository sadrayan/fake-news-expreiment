FACT CHECK: Is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Holding a Facebook Giveaway?
In July 2018, social media users encountered Facebook posts suggesting that those who followed instructions to share those posts and click links found in the Comments section would receive money or a car from action film star Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson:

Thanks for sharing it, I will select the person who downloaded my latest movie now also click here to download Skyscraped and Fighting with My Family If you download is a great opportunity to win the money and the car.

But of course, such posts have nothing to do with the real Dwayne Johnson, and the chances of any user’s “winning” a cash, a car, or any other prize for sharing these posts and clicking links within them is non-existent.

These posts are scam bait that link to a video hosting website which attempts to elicit personal information and credit card numbers from registrants in order to “validate” their accounts, even though the downloads the service offers are supposedly free.

As always, consumers should be extremely wary of any offer that require users to pay money (or provide payment information) up front in order to receive “free” goods or services.
