Safety Board Blames Pilot Error in Crash of Kennedy Plane
The cause of the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law a year ago was probably that Mr. Kennedy, with hardly any experience flying his plane alone at night, became disoriented in haze, the National Transportation Safety Board said today in a staff report.

One of his flight instructors offered to fly with him that night, but Mr. Kennedy said ''he wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor told the investigators who prepared the report.

Mr. Kennedy, who had not yet qualified for flying with instruments alone (as opposed to seeing visual cues through the windows), probably had less than one hour's experience flying his plane at night without an instructor, the report said. It noted that a common cause of crashes among pilots untrained in instrument flying was taking off when visibility was good (a situation known as Visual Flight Rules, or V.F.R.) but flying into conditions where it was not, making the piloting more difficult than they can handle.

In this case, the report said, the condition was haze that obscured the horizon. Pilots who cannot see the horizon must rely on instruments to tell if they are in level flight or if they are banking. But a disoriented pilot can bank a plane into a fatal spiral.

The report cited six kinds of illusion that can lead to disorientation, without stipulating which one came into play in this case. ''Spatial disorientation as a result of continued V.F.R. flight into adverse weather conditions is regularly near the top of the cause/factor list in annual statistics on fatal aircraft accidents,'' the report said.
