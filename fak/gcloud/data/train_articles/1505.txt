FAA delays air traffic control tower closings

The Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday that it will delay until June 15 the closure of 149 air-traffic control towers that were slated to be shut down starting Sunday.

The goal is to give communities additional time to decide whether they will assume the costs of operating the towers, the agency said.

The decision comes after a number of airports filed suit to block the shutdowns, but it is only a temporary reprieve. Communities that do not agree to pick up the costs of running the towers could still lose them.

Last month, the FAA announced it would close 149 towers run by FAA contractors because of mandatory budget cuts known as the sequester. The towers, at mostly small airports with fewer than 150,000 takeoffs and landings a year, included five in Maryland and one in Virginia.

FAA officials said the shutdowns were needed to reach the $637 million in budget cuts the agency was obligated to make under the sequester. The FAA estimates that the closures will save $30 million to $40 million. Republicans, however, questioned whether the closings were necessary, saying they thought there were other areas cuts could be made. Contract towers were targeted in part because it is easier for the agency to shut them down and do not require the 12-month notice required for those staffed by FAA employees.
