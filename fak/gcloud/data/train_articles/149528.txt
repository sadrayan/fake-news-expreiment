IOM Rome reports 10,781 sea arrivals to Italy this month through 30 July. That figure trails the full July totals for each of the past two summers by nearly 13,000 (see chart below), highlighting a trend that IOM has observed of slower traffic to Italy during mid-summer, and fewer deaths (approximately half of those recorded in July 2015 and 2016). Nonetheless, for the year to date, 94,802 arrivals to Italy remain slightly ahead of either 2015 or 2016 totals.



IOM Spain’s Ana Dodevska reported Monday (31 July) that 13 people were rescued off the Spanish coast; 39 on 30 July and 158 on 29 July. She said among those rescued on 29 July suffered burns and were dehydrated. These latest arrivals bring the total number of men, women and children coming by sea to Spain in 2017 to 8,157.

The latest fatality in the region was reported on Thursday (27 July), after a boat capsized off the coast of Izmir, Turkey, killing seven (two women and five children), the first fatalities recorded in the Eastern Mediterranean since 24 April.

These deaths bring the total of fatalities in the Mediterranean in 2017 to 2,385. Although this figure trails the number of deaths (3,047) recorded at this time last year, it nonetheless marks the fourth consecutive year migrant deaths in the Mediterranean Sea have exceeded 2,350.
