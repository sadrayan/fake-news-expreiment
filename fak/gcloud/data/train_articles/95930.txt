Comments made by President Barack Obama during an interview with WESH 2 News made headlines Friday.

"This is a great, great country that had gotten a little soft, and we didn't have that same competitive edge that we needed," Obama said.

The economy, jobs and debt were the top three issues to U.S. citizens in recent polls, and Obama said he's concerned that the economic challenges are hurting opportunities for the next generation.

"This is the worst financial crisis and recession that has existed in our lifetime," Obama said.

Obama was answering a question from WESH 2 News anchorman Jim Payne about whether or not the financial crisis was lowering the bar on opportunities for today's young people to get ahead and succeed.

"It's challenging for young people coming up in the midst of those kinds of circumstances," Obama said.

But Obama didn't stop there. He explained that failed opportunities for future generations motivated him to run for president.

"We need to get back on track," Obama said.
