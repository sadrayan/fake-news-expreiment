Good day from Austin, Texas.

For a fact-check of US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, I write seeking the best source on the degree to which France currently depends on nuclear energy. I saw your piece posted here but it wasnâ€™t clear to me where the 75 percent figure came from. We seek on-the-record attributable information.

THANKS.

The 75% figure is an approximate figure representing a typical value for the range of percentages seen over recent years.

For a specific figure and source please see for example the International Energy Agency, which has 2015 data, with nuclear at 78%.
