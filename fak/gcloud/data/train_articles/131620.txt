Creepy Clowns Plan Halloween Night Purge “If you value the safety of yourself and your children, stay inside on Halloween night,” warned the Sgt. William Stein during a meeting with the Department of Homeland Security. “We have escalated these threats to acts of domestic terrorism and are working closely with the Department of Homeland Security to keep Americans safe this Halloween season.”

Creepy Clowns Plan Halloween Night Purge

According to Stein, several threats about a “Halloween night purge” have been sent to schools, businesses, and even churches all across the United States. Local and state authorities are urging parents to not take their children out on October 31. Concerned parents are pushing for a mandatory curfew on the 31st which will begin at 5 PM. Others say this should not ruin their children’s Halloween tradition.

“I carry a gun with me everywhere I go, so I’m not worried about it,” said Maria Fisher, a mother of three. “Let them try it. I’m not afraid to take down a stupid clown that’s trying to hurt my kids. I’m not going to hide in fear because people want to be stupid.”

As of now, there has been no enforced curfew for the evening of October 31. However, Homeland Security is urging the president to sign an emergency declaration for this 5 PM curfew. This is a developing story and we will keep you updated as events progress.
