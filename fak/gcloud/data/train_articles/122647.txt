Man allegedly takes pictures of boy in bathroom
A 59-year-old man has been arrested in taking pictures of a boy in a bathroom at Disney's Animal Kingdom.

Joseph Cionzynski, from Pennsylvania, is accused of taking pictures of an 8-year-old boy by putting his cellphone under the stall.

According to WFTV Channel 9, the boy saw the phone and ran out to tell his mother, who marched into the bathroom and confronted him.

The boy said he recognized the man from his shoes.

Disney security was alerted and officers were called to the Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.

WFTV reported that the suspect voluntarily handed his phone over to detectives for further investigation.

Police said they later recovered photos of the boys, and Cionzynski was then taken into custody in Pennsylvania.

He has since been banned from all Disney properties, Channel 9 reported.
