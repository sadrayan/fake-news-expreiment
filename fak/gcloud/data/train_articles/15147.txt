Denton County Republican Executive Committee Passes Resolution of No Confidence in Texas House Speaker Joe Straus

The Denton County Republican Party Executive Committee unanimously passed a resolution of no confidence in Texas House Speaker Joe Straus last Thursday at its monthly meeting. The resolution was presented by Sylvia Acuff, Denton County Republican Party Precinct Chairman of Precinct #1025 and reads as follows:

“Whereas, even though many pieces of legislation have been put forward that are in line with the Republican Party of Texas platform, Speaker Straus has failed to get them through the Texas House of Representatives; and

Whereas, We have no confidence going forward that he will adequately support the direction outlined by the platform; and

Whereas, We believe that it is time for new leadership in the house in order to effectively represent the will of Texas voters;

Therefore Be it Resolved, We the Republican committee of Denton County, do hereby demand our elected officials in the Texas House withdraw support for the current Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Joe Straus; and,

Be it Further Resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent to all of the Republican State Representatives.”

A copy of the resolution is being sent to all of the Texas Republican State Representatives. The Republicans representing Denton County are: Tan Parker, Pat Fallon, Ron Simmons, and Lynn Stucky.
