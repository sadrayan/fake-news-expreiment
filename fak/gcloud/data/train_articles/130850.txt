UPDATE: FL Election Worker Chelsey Smith Accused Broward County Elect…
These so-called ballots have appeared by the tens of thousand, in truckloads (!), four days after the vote.

They should all be seized, put under armed guard and then forensic tests should be applied to them.

That will explain immediately what has gone on.

● If 80,000 real ballots have not been registered until today, then it is catastrophic failure by Snipes and she should be removed and investigated - after all, it is not her first disgrace.

● If the ballots are on different paper to that used by the official printers... If all the ballots have the same DNA from just one person... If the same pen has been used with a monotonous repetition of 80,000 marks. If the tracing of the journeys shows they came from overseas... If any of these singly or any combination is evident, then that is clear fraud !!!

Either way, it is unacceptable. There is no good answer here.
