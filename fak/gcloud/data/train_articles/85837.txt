National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)

Enacted by Congress in 1975, CAFE's purpose is to reduce energy consumption by increasing the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. NHTSA has set standards to increase CAFE levels rapidly over the next several years, which will improve our nation’s energy security and save consumers money at the pump. This site contains an immense amount of information about the CAFE program including an overview, rulemaking actions, fleet characteristics data, compliance activities, summaries of manufacturers’ fuel economy performances since 1978, and related studies.

August 16, 2016 : NHTSA and EPA have jointly issued final "Phase 2" fuel efficiency and GHG emission standards for MD and HD vehicles for model years 2018-2027. Read the news release

Final Rule for Phase 2 fuel efficiency and GHG emissions standards for medium & heavy-duty vehicles, MY2018-2027

NHTSA and EPA issued a Final Rule for “Phase 2” for medium and heavy duty vehicles to improve fuel efficiency and cut carbon pollution. The agencies estimate that the standards will save up to 2 billion barrels of oil and reduce CO2 emissions by up to 1.1 billion metric tons over the lifetimes of MYs 2018-2029 vehicles, providing up to $230 billion in net social benefits.

CAFE Standards and Mid-Term Evaluation for Light-Duty Vehicles, MYs 2022-2025

On July 18, 2016 , NHTSA, EPA and California Air Resources Board (CARB) issued a Draft Technical Assessment Report (TAR) for light-duty vehicle CAFE and GHG standards for MYs 2022-2025. This Draft TAR is the first step in the Agencies’ mid-term evaluation process of the October 2012 final rule establishing CAFE and GHG standards for MYs 2017 and beyond.

The Mid-Term Evaluation is the overarching process by which NHTSA, EPA, and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) will decide on CAFE and GHG emissions standard stringency for model years 2022-2025. The first step in the Mid-Term Evaluation is the Draft Technical Assessment Report, or TAR. Using comments to the Draft TAR and the best available data and information, NHTSA will begin to develop its rulemaking to establish CAFE standards for MYs 2022 and beyond, while EPA will consider whether its existing GHG standards for those MYs continue to be appropriate or should be revised. The 2012 joint final rule that set CAFE and GHG standards for MYs 2017 and beyond laid out the path for the Mid-Term Evaluation.
