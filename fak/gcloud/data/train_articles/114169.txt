African Vaccination Week 2014 - WHO
This year, African Vaccination Week will be celebrated from 22 to 27 April under the theme --“Vaccination - a shared responsibility”.



The theme highlights the role and importance of governments, health care workers, parents, families and communities -- all doing their part to support immunization. Everybody has a role to play in fighting vaccine-preventable diseases such as polio, whooping cough, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, influenza, diarrhea, pneumonia, hepatitis and cervical cancers. Vaccination prevents infections and protects us all – infants, children, adolescents and adults.



For this year’s African Vaccination Week campaign, we encourage countries to strengthen the integration of immunization activities with other lifesaving interventions and also people to complete their vaccination schedules. Everybody should be fully immunized. Let us all vaccinate now, and vaccinate completely! Message of the WHO Regional Director for Africa - African Vaccination Week, 22-27 April 2014
