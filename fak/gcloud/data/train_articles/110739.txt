Save Money. Live Better...Die Better? Walmart Now Sells Caskets And Urns.
Walmart has over 11,000 stores in 27 different countries. Over 2 million employees work for the retail chain. Last year, Walmart earned $405 billion in revenue, making it one of the largest economies in the world. Chances are, you've had a long, tenuous relationship with Walmart (unless you live in New York City). People who shop there typically have a love/hate relationship with the store.

Recently, the chain extended this "love it and hate it" relationship to the grave. That's right: Walmart now sells caskets. While the average coffin for your loved one will set you back a little more than $2,000, most of Walmart's coffins are more affordable.

Walmart: Save money. Live better. Die better.

"Soulful Peace Brass" Urn, $95.74.

"Official MLB Baltimore Orioles" Urn, $2,459. Where a lot of self-hating Baltimoreans wanted to be after losing to Kansas City.
