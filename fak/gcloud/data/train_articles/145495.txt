Is Friends Leaving Netflix in January 2019?!
UPDATE: Netflix was playing a cruel joke on us? "The Holiday Armadillo has granted your wish: Friends will still be there for you in the US throughout 2019," the streamer tweeted after the internet panicked for a few hours. Go back to your binging. All is well.

Could we BE anymore disappointed right now? It looks like Friends is leaving Netflix in just a matter of weeks. Yep, in the words of Rachel Green, looks like it's going to be a crappy new year to us all.

Eagle-eyed viewers (who were probably on their 27th rewatch of the series) noticed Netflix has snuck an expiration date of January 1, 2019 onto the details page of the beloved sitcom that starred Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc.

UPDATE: According to THR and USA Today, Friends isn't leaving Netflix...just yet. Details are still sketchy, but it looks like they'll be there for you on January 1, 2019 after all.

Reaction to the previously listed expiration date, as you can probably imagine, has been swiftâ€”and angry.
