The Alamo is on my list (of) the most disappointing historic sites in the United States. The commercialization of this area has compromised the most important historic site in Texas.

You asked about evidence that the site is overrated, a letdown, etc. All of these comments were created by others on the referenced site only from this summer to today. Our staff compiled the list for you but you can go and review the sites.

They go on for years.

To absolutely confirm the statement as 100% correct, please look at the list by Business Insider which named the Alamo as one of the country’s “worst tourist traps.”

It further states that the attractions on their list are not “legendary landmarks that everyone should see.”

This was reported in the May 24 edition of the SA Express.

While the Alamo receives a 4 on Yelp, Gettysburg, San Jacinto State Park, Pearl Harbor and Mt. Vernon get a 4.5. As I noted, museums and historic sites all score highly, the Alamo however scores worse.

Thus, we have provided you with evidence of lists showing the Alamo experiences is rated lower than other sites, it is listed as one of America’s worst tourist traps and provided many comments which are posted online,

As a museum professional, all of this is disturbing, it should be disturbing to every Texan. The implementation of this Master Plan is the only plan which has a possibility of changing this compromised site to a dignified one.
