Full Kindergarten In Place For 2013-14 School Year
CHICAGO (CBS) — Mayor Emanuel’s education team says it’s keeping a promise to bring full-day kindergarten to all Chicago public school children.

All-Day Kindergarten For CPS

In February, the mayor announced that Chicago Public Schools would guarantee full-day kindergarten for all students, beginning in the 2013-14 school year.

In previous years, students had the options of attending half-day kindergarten and full-day kindergarten. The move nearly doubles the amount of in-school time.

“Despite the District’s financial crisis, we protected this investment in our children because education at this early age is critical to their long-term development and success,” said CEO Byrd-Bennett.

For the first time, kindergarten will be funded just like first through third grade. Principals will be able to count on these funds and not have to patch together resources, the mayor’s office said.

Illinois school districts are not required by statute to fund full-day kindergarten for all eligible students.
