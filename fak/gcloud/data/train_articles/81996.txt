Renaming of post office becomes attack line in Senate debate
Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris' accusation that Rep. Loretta Sanchez has been absent from Congress took on new flair toward the end of their Senate debate.

“My opponent has somehow insinuated that I have not been to work,” Sanchez said.

“My opponent has passed one bill in her 20 years in office, and that was to rename a post office,” Harris shot back.

That bill named a Santa Ana post office for Hector G. Godinez. (He was Orange County's first Latino postmaster, and died in 1999.)

Sanchez introduced the measure in April 2001, and it took more than a year before it was law. She also has co-sponsored 179 bills that have become law.

Relative to the number of bills that are filed, few actually pass as standalone legislation and become law. Members often insert legislation into broader bills in hopes of increasing chances it will pass.

In fact, many of the day-to-day bills that do pass are to rename post offices — because they are not controversial.

Attacks about the naming of post offices have been a staple of congressional debates across the country, especially as Congress has done less and less actual legislating in recent years.

Sanchez said the attack line suggests Harris doesn't understand Congress: "You don't pass a bill on its own necessarily in the Congress; you pass it by inserting it into other bills."

Harris criticized Sanchez repeatedly throughout the night for missing votes and committee hearings, especially in the last year.

Sanchez missed more floor votes in the House — more than 1 in 5 — than all but two other members in 2015, according to Congressional Quarterly.
