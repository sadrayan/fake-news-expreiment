Marquette University Law School
Professor Daniel D. Blinka teaches courses in evidence, trial practice, criminal law, and constitutional criminal procedure. He is also the director of the Law School's Certificate in Litigation program. In addition to his J.D., he holds a PhD in United States history from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Professor Blinka is the author of books and articles on evidence law, criminal procedure, legal history, and other subjects. His books are published by leading law book publishers, Thomson-Reuters (West) and LexisNexis. His work is often relied upon by Wisconsin's courts. In addition to his ongoing work on evidence law, Professor Blinka is presently writing on the history of jury trials at the time of the American Revolution and the early national period. He is also writing supplements for the volume on the Sixth Amendment confrontation right as part of Wright & Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence (Thomson Reuters), and plans to start work soon on a new volume.

Professor Blinka has received the Law School's teaching award on multiple occasions in addition to Marquette University's teaching excellence award. He strongly believes that the Law School's primary mission is to prepare students for the practice of law; theory and policy must foster the development of critical judgment and the analytic skills needed to serve clients and the justice system. Before joining the faculty, Professor Blinka served as a trial lawyer in the office of the district attorney for Milwaukee County. He is the past chair person of the Wisconsin Board of Bar Examiners, a past president of the Milwaukee Bar Association, and is currently on the Board of Directors of the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee.
