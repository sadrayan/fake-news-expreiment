I just am trying to understand what the goal is here I'm hearing a lot of different things Can you explain to me If he is making progress why does he need to go?

We’re making good progress on the TV booking front, and this would help. Thanks, - Luis. Hi Lindsey, one final check in on this. I think it would be fair to cover transportation. Our bookings have improved dramatically and it’s important to shore up the direct contact. In addition to the meetings, Henry will now also be in NYC and is booked on a couple of interviews so this will give us the chance to staff him. Again, I know he hasn’t been a model employee, but he’s actually doing a good job and staying on task in this role. Just yesterday he brokered a lunch with the Vice President of News at Fox and he’s helped set up key meetings and pressure points to drive this forward. Thanks for considering it. So as an example, we just had Anderson Cooper’s team cancel two bookings for this week. We need to get in there and nudge them loose. So one of the meetings on Wednesday he’s going to is a dinner with CNN’s bookers. I know he has a history, but he’s actually delivering on this front. <http://www.democrats.org/><image003.png><http://www.democrats.org/><http://www.democrats.org/>Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 – MirandaL@dnc.org<mailto:MirandaL@dnc.org> - @MiraLuisDC<https://www.twitter.com/MiraLuisDC> Although it looks like he could do it as a day trip, or crash with a friend, so we would only cover his transportation but not lodging. Can we do it for transportation? Not approved for him to go to NYC this week.
