Woman in critical condition after shooting A 27-year-old man was out on bond after being charged in a shooting of an escort, a police report said.

A 23-year-old woman shot in the neck and back on Christmas Eve remained hospitalized Monday while the man charged in the crime was out on bond, officials said.

Ezekiel Gilbert, 27, was charged Thursday with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly shooting Lenora Ivie Frago after the two argued over an exchange of money for sex, according to a police report.

The shooting occurred around 4:15 a.m. at the Camino Real Apartments in the 12200 block of Blanco Road on the North Side, according to the report.

A witness told police Gilbert paid for a specific amount of time with Frago but became angry when she left before they had sex, the report said. He asked for his money back, and when she got into the car without returning his payment, Gilbert fired shots at the passenger side, hitting Frago, the report said.

Frago remained in critical condition Monday night at University Hospital.
