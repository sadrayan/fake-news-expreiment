Lopez-Cantera Will Receive Limited Staff and Security » Shark Tank
Governor Rick Scott is has been slashing excess state government waste since day one of his first term as governor of Florida, but now a few of those cost-saving-cuts could be called into question.

Talk within Tallahassee political circles has been that Scott’s newly appointed lieutenant governor pick, former House leader Carlos Lopez-Cantera, would not be afforded the same staff and security support that his predecessor, Jennifer Carol received before she stepped down from the job.

Insiders are saying that Scott’s chief of staff Adam Hollingsworth is clamping down on Lopez-Cantera’s exposure, and limiting the resources that are usually allotted for someone in his position.





Scott’s Spokeswoman, Jackie Schutz has confirmed to the Shark Tank that there will be “efficiences” in Lopez-Cantera’s lieutenant governor’s office.

While Jennifer Carroll use to have 5-6 staffers and a Florida Highway Patrol security detail, Lopez-Cantera can expect to receive 3 staffers, and as far as his security, according to Schutz,” He will have security as needed.”

Lopez-Cantera’s entourage will be comprised of a press aide, a office manager, a travel aide, and a dog. Well, Lopez-Cantera would probably have to bring along the dog for “as needed” security, but on his own dime.

***UPDATE***

Governor Scott’s Office just contacted the Shark Tank to inform us that Carlos Lopez-Cantera did not want to receive full 24-hour protection, and personally requested the reduction in staff and security.

Lopez-Cantera will still be receiving the full protection and support of the Florida Highway Patrol “as needed.”
