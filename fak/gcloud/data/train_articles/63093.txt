Whois Lookup & IP
Our WhoIs lookup is designed to help you perform a variety of whois lookup functions. WhoIs lets you perform a domain whois search, whois IP lookup and search the whois database for relevant information on domain registration and availability. This can help provide insight into a domain's history and additional information. Use WhoIs lookup anytime you want to perform a search to see who owns a domain name, how many pages from a site are listed with Google or even search WhoIs address listings for a website's owner.

If you are looking for a domain, WhoIs domain lookup can tell you if it's already owned by another entity and provide contact information for the domain name owner. WhoIs domain information can help you determine the proper contact for any domain listed in the Whois database. A WhoIs lookup identifies the administrator contact information, billing contact and the technical contact for each domain name listing or IP in the WhoIs database. A WhoIs IP search can also help you potentially determine the source of spam and other details related to a website.

In addition to looking up a domain by IP, Whois lookup can also help you validate your website code with one of several Domain and SEO tools including CSE HTML validator, W3C HTML validator and the CSS Validator. Each WhoIs tool identifies errors in your source code so that you can fix things like missing closing tags, errors in character encoding and more. No matter what DNS information you are looking for, WhoIs can help you identify anything related to domain names quickly and easily.
