PA DEP Oil & Gas Reporting Website
Welcome to the PA DEP Oil & Gas Production / Waste Reports Website

Pennsylvania statutes and regulations require unconventional well operators to submit production and waste reports to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on a monthly basis. These reports are due within 45 days after the last day of each month. Operators of conventional oil & gas wells are required to submit production and waste reports on an annual basis. The conventional reports are due on Feb. 15th for the previous calendar year. DEP makes every practical effort to post these reports as soon as possible after they are filed. Generally, reports are posted the first business day after the due date for that report.

Both conventional and unconventional well operators self-report production and waste data. This means that all production data is posted as it was received from the well operator. DEP does not independently verify the data before it is posted.

While the statutes and regulations require accurate and on-time data reporting by operators, and the operators and DEP endeavor to correct any errors discovered after the data is posted, DEP makes no claims, promises or guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of the operatorsâ€™ data that DEP is required to post.

DEP expressly disclaims any liability for errors or omissions related to the production data contained within these reports. No warranty of any kind is given by DEP with respect to the production data contained within these reports posted on its website.
