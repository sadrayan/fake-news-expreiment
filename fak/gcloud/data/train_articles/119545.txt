Addressing Inequality and Poverty Between 2003 and 2008, the HSRC published its annual flagship publication, State of the Nation. Since the launch of the first edition, the series has captured the attention of public intellectuals, scholars, policymakers and the media in South Africa and abroad. Internationally, the series has been acclaimed as one of the most in-depth and important independent analyses of the national agenda through the lens of the South African political, economic and social context, and has been selected by university departments across the world as prescribed or highly recommended reading. In view of its historically high demand and the need for vibrant national and continental debates, the HSRC will relaunch this authoritative publication in 2013.
