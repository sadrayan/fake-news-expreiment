Notes: Two sets of figures are shown for the U.S. The first is from the ERS Food Expenditure series and is based on a comprehensive measure of the total value of all food expenditures in the U.S. by final purchasers. The second set is based on U.S. Department of Commerce estimates of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) for food and beverages, used by both the United Nations and Euromonitor International. The ERS estimate is lower than the PCE estimate partly because it excludes pet food, ice, and prepared feed which are included in the PCE estimates.
