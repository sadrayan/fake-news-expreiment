ITEP Tax Inequality Index

According to ITEP’s Tax Inequality Index, New York has the 41st most unfair state and local tax system in the country. States with regressive tax struc­tures have negative tax inequality indexes, meaning that incomes are less equal in those states after state and local taxes than before (See Appendix B for state-by-state rankings and more details).
