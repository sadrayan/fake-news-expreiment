Trudeau’s Family Vacation

By now, you may have heard about how Justin Trudeau showed up to Washington with a 44-member entourage made up of, celebrities, his children’s nannies, and his in-laws.

That’s right, his in-laws.

Rather than bringing along his Natural Resources Minister to, you know, advocate on behalf of Canadian jobs, Justin Trudeau decided to include his mom, his in-laws, and top Liberal fundraisers on the trip.

His priority wasn't you, or to negotiate for pipelines that would benefit hard-working Canadians. He preferred a photo op with the President that benefited his family, friends and the Liberal Party.

Higher taxes for you, more perks for him.
