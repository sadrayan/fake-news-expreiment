Getting to the Bottom of ‘Grubergate’
I don’t know how or why Jonathan Gruber has gotten so much wrong about the Affordable Care Act. But as someone who worked on health reform for the Obama administration, I’d like to clear up a few things:

Mr. Gruber was not, as many claim, the architect of the health-care law. He is an MIT economist who, as a consultant to the Department of Health and Human Services, modeled the impact of various subsidy levels and rules. He did not make policy, nor did he work for the White House, HHS, or any congressional committee. Earlier, he advised the Massachusetts legislature when it created the health-care reforms that were a model for the ACA.
