Email, Catherine Frazier, press secretary, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Sept. 4, 2014

the senator was illustrating the tragic and violent tactics ISIS uses across the region it considers its "caliphate" - which includes Iraq and Syria. The senator is aware that crucifixions have been documented specifically in Syria, but equally violent tactics like beheadings, torture, rape and mass executions of religious minorities have been widely documented in both countries. These are heinous crimes against humanity that shock the conscience regardless of where they occur.
