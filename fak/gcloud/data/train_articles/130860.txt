RIGHTS MANAGED IMAGES

Rights Managed images are always provided in the largest file size available, whatever that is for a particular image.

The file size differs depending what type of device it has been created on: before purchase it is made clear what the largest file size is, we don’t have any “larger” files than the one we provide you.

ROYALTY FREE IMAGES

A guide to help you choose the right file size for your particular needs.

Before you download your selected image, you need to be very clear with regards to how you will be using the image and where it will appear. The two most important factors to consider are:

The DPI or printed resolution.

DPI means 'dots per inch' and refers to the amount of detail included in every inch printed. It helps you understand how large an image can be printed. The dimensions.

This will indicate the actual size of the image when printed.

Size really does matter

An image can be reduced to any size without affecting its quality. However, if the image is increased beyond its original size, pixel and/or blur may occur, especially if you scale an image up more than around 10%.

The required resolution of an image for usage such as book and magazine (publishing) printing is typically 300 DPI and above.

Interesting fact

The required resolution of an image for usage such as Billboards is typically only 30-150 DPI as there isn't such a requirement for fine detail, because the image is viewed from a distance.
