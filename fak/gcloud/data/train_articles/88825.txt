Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday slammed the GOP's Obamacare repeal plan as "disgusting" and "immoral," predicting that "thousands of Americans will die" if it becomes law.

The Vermont Independent, a member of Democratic leadership, spoke out after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the Republican health care bill would cause 24 million people to lose insurance over the coming decade. Sanders urged Republicans to reject the legislation crafted by House GOP leaders.

"If this legislation is passed and millions of people are thrown off of health insurance, not able to get to a doctor when they must, thousands of Americans will die," Sanders told reporters on Capitol Hill. "Thatâ€™s what this legislation is about. And it must be defeated. I hope there is enough sense among some of the Republicans to vote against it."

Sanders' stark prediction also underscores the political risk that Democrats believe the GOP is taking in its beleaguered Obamacare repeal bid. Congressional Democratic leaders are already planning to seize on health care as a centerpiece of their midterm campaign agenda next year.
