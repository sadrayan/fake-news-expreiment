Please see the attached document TRS presented to retirees at the TRTA fall meetings, page 12-13 will show you changes from current premiums and plan designs to what the regular session funded to ultimately what the special session funded. TRS-Care currently offers TRS Care 1/2/3 and Medicare Advantage 2/3 plan designs for participants. Starting January 1, 2018 TRS-Care will offer the TRS-Care Standard Plan for the under age 65 retirees and TRS-Care Medicare Advantage plan for the Medicare eligible participants.

TRS also held over 100 information sessions across the state at more than 50 locations. Over 40,000 retirees met with TRS face-to-face.

You can review documents presented at those information sessions and webinars at the below link.

Merita:

Is what you attached to your email posted on the TRS site? I’d like to give readers the link.

It is on the website and can be found at: https://www.trs.texas.gov/Pages/legislation.aspx

Is my summary of session action I am pasting below accurate? Anything substantive missing? What part of this action was expected to drive up out-of-pocket costs?

(Some edits):

PASTE:

In the regular session, legislators agreed to spend more on TRS-Care in the state budget, Senate Bill 1. Members also advanced, by unanimous bipartisan floor votes, House Bill 3976, later signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott. That measure raised the state’s contribution rate for TRS-Care to 1.25 percent of the state’s public education payroll while ending the requirement that TRS offer retirees a zero-premium basic health plan also known as TRS-Care 1. HB 3976 directed and directing the system to offer a high-deductible plan for retirees and dependents not yet 65 and a Medicare Advantage plan for retirees and dependents eligible for Medicare. HB 3976 provided an open enrollment opportunity for a retiree that reaches age 65 to enroll in the TRS-Care Medicare Advantage plan even if they did not participate in TRS-Care’s high deductible plan. HB 3976 also provided if a retiree has taken a disability retirement on or before January 1, 2017 and is not eligible to enroll in Medicare, the retiree will not be required to pay a monthly contribution (premium) to the high-deductible plan until the 2022 plan year.

END PASTE

(**Gardner- appropriations to the plan is what determines out-of-pocket costs).

The interim report released in December says that if lawmakers didn’t act in 2017, TRS-Care would ultimately have to be shut down by the TRS board. Did I read that right?

Does or did TRS agree? Why or why not?

TRS testified to this point at various legislative hearings. Nearly all legislative presentations noted that without legislative changes or additional funding the program would have quickly become unsustainable. Specifically in a presentation to the Senate Finance Committee on January 24, 2017, TRS noted the Board would have been forced to administer a combination of increased copayments, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses for all plan levels. Since premiums would be increased, many participants would likely decrease coverage to TRS-Care 1, the zero-premium basic catastrophic health plan. Additionally, this migration to the TRS-Care 1 plan would create a significant loss of premium revenue, which would cause further increases in premiums all other TRS-Care plans.

Under this scenario, where no significant funding and/or benefit changes occur, funding for TRS-Care would have been inadequate to pay claims and sustain the plan through the 2018-2019 biennium. Thus, the Board would likely have been obligated to close the TRS-Care plan.

Has TRS or any authoritative entity laid out the out-of-pocket effects on retirees if lawmakers had not acted in 2017 compared to the effects based on the actions in the regular and special sessions?

Throughout the regular and special session, the legislature reviewed premium costs to retirees and dependents. We did not project other out of pocket expenses (such as deductibles and co-pays) because it depends entirely on individual utilization.

At the Senate Finance Committee on January 24, 2017, TRS went through an exercise to illustrate the potential increase in FY 2018 premiums to attempt to maintain the current health care plan options without additional funding. Please refer to page 22 of the attached presentation.

Subject: RE: Follow-up questions for fact-check

Got it.

For a retiree alone, the chart on page 22 of the January 2017 presentation suggests that monthly premiums for the two plans offering more than basic coverage would escalate by at least 43 percent to as much as 337 percent. Agree?

Agree, under this exercise the premiums for the retiree only in TRS-Care 2 and TRS-Care 3 standard plans would have increased anywhere from 43% to 337%. This was strictly an exercise and used retirees with 20-29 years of service as an example. As you recall, premiums prior to the 85th legislative were frozen since 2005 and set based on years of service, Medicare status, plan choice and tier. There were over 100 different premium structures.

How much will premiums escalate, on available plans, after all the changes adopted by legislators this year? Any other cost changes pinned down?

For the 2018 and 2019 plan years the legislature based funding on new premiums remaining the same in 2018 and 2019. TRS is estimating the program will experience a shortfall between $500-$700 million at the end of 2021.

Folks:

In trying to fact-check the claim, I asked Tim Lee of the retired teachers group to be specific about health plan benefits retirees now have that they will be losing as of 2018.

By email, Lee replied that retirees not yet 65 would no longer have a zero-premium plan [THIS IS TRUE, NONE OF THE RETIREES REGARDLESS OF AGE/MEDICARE STATUS WILL HAVE A $0 PREMIUM PLAN. HOWEVER THE $0 PREMIUM DID COME WITH $5,250 DEDUCTIBLE. BEGINNING 1/1/18 THIS GROUP WILL PAY A $200 PREMIUM WITH A $1,500 DEDUCTIBLE] with traditional benefits that include copays for medical and pharmaceutical coverage [THE PRE-65 POPULATION WILL NOT HAVE COPAYS BUT WILL STILL RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF GROUP COVERAGE INCLUDING NEGOTIATED AND CONTRACTED RATES FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACY. ONCE THE RETIREE MEETS THE $1500 DEDUCTIBLE, THE 80/20 CO-INSURANCE WILL KICK IN UNTIL THE MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET IS REACHED THEN THE PLAN PAYS 100% OF COSTS] . “They will now have a high-deductible plan that will increase their out-of-pocket costs,” Lee wrote, though the summer special session reduced the heft of the deductible and premium costs.

Retirees 65 and older, Lee wrote, “have lost access to a traditional Medicare supplement plan under TRS. They will now have access to a Medicare Advantage plan only.” [THE TRS-CARE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN, THE ONLY OPTION AVAILABLE TO TRS MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RETIREES.] Lee called the new offering a reasonable plan though he said it will impose “markedly higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.” [NOT AS BLACK AND WHITE. IF YOU REFER TO PAGE 13 OF THE TRTA PRESENTATION YOU WILL WHAT THE PLAN BENEFITS ARE CURRENTLY AND WHAT THEY WILL BE STARTING 1/1/18. MOST RETIREES WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS, SMALL GROUP WILL SEE A DECREASE. IF A RETIREE IS IN THE CURRENT MEDICARE ADVANTAGE 2 THEY WILL NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE IN DEDUCTIBLES AND OTHER OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS BUT A CHANGE IN THEIR PREMIUM, AGAIN SOME MORE SOME LESS. IF THE RETIREE IS IN THE CURRENT MEDICARE ADVANTAGE 3 THEY WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN THEIR DEDUCTIBLE FROM $150 TO $500. IF THE RETIREE IS IN THE CURRENT CARE 2 PLAN THEY WILL SEE A DECREASE IN THEIR DEDUCTIBLE FROM $1,300 TO $500.]

Lee also said that many medical providers say they’ll refuse to accept the new plan “and retirees are weighing the choice of staying with the TRS plan (one that they have paid their entire career to have access to via contributions from their paychecks while employed at an ISD and have always paid premiums for as a retiree) or leaving the system altogether to find a plan their doc is willing to accept.” [THE TRS MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN IS A PPO AND NOT AN HMO. IT HAS IN AND OUT OF NETWORK BENEFITS THAT ARE THE SAME. TRS-CARE WILL PAY MEDICARE PROVIDERS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE IN HUMANA’S NETWORK, THEY MUST SIMPLY BILL HUMANA AND THE RETIREE CAN STILL SEE THE DOCTOR. A DISTRUPTION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT 96 PERCENT OF THE PROVIDERS TRS-CARE PLAN PARTICIPANTS SAW WERE EITHER ALREADY IN HUMANA’S NETWORK OR PREVIOULY BILLED HUMANA. WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION HERE UNDER "PROVIDER ACCEPTANCE"

https://www.trs.texas.gov/Pages/retirees_faq_trscare_medicare_adv_changes.aspx]

“These are difficult decisions for retirees who have been a part of this system for over 30 years,”

Lee wrote.

In addition, Lee said, retirees 65 or older are seeing costs for coverage for spouses nearly doubling. “Many retirees simply cannot afford the $394/month for spousal coverage,” Lee wrote. “Again, the Legislature’s actions in the special session did provide more help to these retirees by lowering the new premium amounts (about a $50 reduction for spousal premium), [CORRECT, THE SPECIAL SESSION APPLIED A $50 SUBSIDY TO THE SPOUSE; $11 FOR THE RETIREE, SEE PAGES 10-11 OF TRTA PRESENTATION] but these amounts are still a heavy burden as the average TRS pension is $2,000/month. And, many do not receive any Social Security. [95% OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATORS DO NOT EARN SOCIAL SECURITY AND RELY ON THEIR PENSION FROM TRS.] So, these premium costs have a major influence over a retiree’s ability to meet their costs of living.” [PLEASE REFER TO PAGE 12 OF THE TRTA PRESENTATION. THE TOTAL PREMIUM FOR RETIREE AND SPOUSE WITH MEDICARE IS $529. THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED FUNDING TO SUPPLEMENT COSTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR THE RETIREE AND APPLYING MINIMAL AMOUNT TO SUPPLEMENT THE SPOUSE.]

Retirees remain grateful that a state-supported health plan will survive, Lee said. Still, he wrote, “the benefits went down, the costs went up, and the plan is still on shaky ground.” [ AS WE NOTED BEFORE, THE TRS-CARE PROGRAM WILL SEE A SHORTFALL OF $500-700 MILLION AT THE END OF 2021].

Hello again.

Follow-up queries: Is the sentence pasted below accurate? If so, is that $438.9 million more than what was spent in the 2016-17 biennium? If not, what does the “more” mean?

Legislators in the 2017 regular session agreed to spend $483.9 million more on TRS-Care in the state budget, Senate Bill 1.

Yes that statement is accurate.

SB 1 provided for additional State/District Contribution in FY 2018-19:

• Increased the state contribution from 1% to 1.25% of active employee payroll

• Provided $182.6M one-time supplemental contribution

• Increased the district contribution from 0.55% to 0.75% of active employee payroll

$167.4M (0.25% state contribution increase) + $182.6M (supplemental) = $350M

+ $133.9M (0.20% district contribution increase)

Total Additional Funding = $483.9M

The special session provided an additional $212M in supplemental funding to pay for the benefits enhancements (premium reductions, lower deductibles, etc.) described in previous emails.
