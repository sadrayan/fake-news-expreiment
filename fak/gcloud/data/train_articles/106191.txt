California Man Dressed as Woman Busted for Videoing in Women�s Bathro�
A Palmdale, California, man wearing women’s clothing was arrested in a Lancaster Macy’s store after he was seen in a women’s bathroom. The man was allegedly videotaping women in the bathroom.

Jason Pomare, 33, was arrested over the weekend after mall security officers learned he had been hanging out in a Macy’s department store women’s bathroom. The security guards contacted a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) deputy who found the cross-dressing man in a mall storage area, NBC Los Angeles reported

When Pomare was contacted, he was wearing a wig and women’s clothing, including a bra, a statement from the LASD revealed. “The deputy noticed he was wearing a wig and appeared to have breasts,” LASD Sergeant Brian Hudson told the Los Angeles news outlet.

While searching the suspect, the deputy discovered a video camera in his purse. The camera allegedly contained hours of women using the bathroom inside the store.

Witnesses told police that Pomare would conceal the camera in bathroom stalls. The woman who contacted store security noticed the “recording light” on the camera. It appears Pomare was in the bathroom for around two hours, Hudson told the reporter.

On Tuesday, Pomare was formally charged with six counts of unlawful use of a concealed camera for purposes of sexual gratification. The charges are misdemeanors under California law. If convicted, Pomare could face up to 6 months in the county jail and a fine of up to $1,000 on each count. His criminal record was not released, but if he has a prior conviction on this charge, the penalties would double.

It is not clear if Lancaster has a “bathroom ordinance” like the one defeated in Houston last year where men would legally be allowed to enter women’s bathrooms and locker rooms. Breitbart Texas’ Lana Shadwick covered the defeat of that ordinance in Houston. Pomare was not charged with any offenses related to being in the women’s bathroom other than the illegal filming.

In October 2015, Breitbart Texas reported on an illegal alien who was caught filming women in a Walmart bathroom in San Angelo, Texas. Jose Santos Argueta was sentenced to 270 days in jail and was subsequently turned over to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for deportation.
