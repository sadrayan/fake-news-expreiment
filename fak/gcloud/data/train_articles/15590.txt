Data on unintended pregnancy rates in developed countries are not systematically collected. We estimated that the unintended pregnancy rate in Europe was 41 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 2008. Our preliminary estimate for 2012 is 43. For North America, the estimated rate for 2008 is 49, and the preliminary estimate for 2012 is 51.

Best,
