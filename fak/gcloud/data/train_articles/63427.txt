Florida Senate bill on Canadian drug imports moves forward
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Legislation that would allow Floridians access to cheaper Canadian prescription drugs has taken another step forward in the Florida Senate.

Governor Ron DeSantis wants to allow Florida to import prescription drugs from Canada, to reduce costs to consumers. A Senate subcommittee just approved a bill that would let Florida ask the Feds for permission to do so.

In a press release, DeSantis told 10News:

“The United States pays more for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. In Florida, we can change that by employing safe, common sense solutions such as importing FDA approved prescription drugs from Canada.”

The Senate Appropriations Health and Human Services panel approved the measure Tuesday. The House has scheduled floor consideration Wednesday on its version, which would expand the countries from which drugs can be imported beyond Canada.

Republican Sen. Aaron Bean of Jacksonville says the Canadian drug import program, if adopted, would be submitted for approval to the federal government. If approved there in an estimated six months to a year, the plan would come back to Florida lawmakers for a final decision.

U.S. consumers pay some of the highest prescription drug prices in the world. The Canadian import bill is a priority for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.
