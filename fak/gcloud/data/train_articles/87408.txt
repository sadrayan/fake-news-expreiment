Cancer Cancer is a leading cause of death in the Americas. In 2012, cancer accounted for 1.3 million deaths, 47% of which occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The number of cancer deaths in the Americas is projected to increase from 1.3 million to 2.1 million between 2012 and 2030.

About a third of all cancer cases could be prevented by avoiding key risk factors. These include tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity.

Vaccination and screening programmes are effective interventions to reduce the burden of specific types of cancer.

Many cancers have a high chance of cure if detected early and treated adequately.
