Thanks, Daddy! Ivanka Trump's clothing line will be exempt from tariffs
Trump has fired off a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum to pacify his base in swing states.The Chinese have retaliated by targeting farmers in Trumps solid base, but, they aren’t likely to vote against Trump anyhow. Too much, wait, what are we calling it these days? “Economic anxiety,” or “Christian morality” or cough, fear of brown people, cough.
