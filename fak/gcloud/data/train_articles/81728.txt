New Senate ad goes after Cortez Masto on rape kits
A new ad by a GOP Super PAC targets former Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto on the thousands of untested rape kits in Nevada, an issue she said she was unaware of during a state meeting two years ago.

The spot focuses on a 2014 meeting of a state panel, the Advisory Commission of the Administration of Justice, during which the issue of untested rape kits over decades came up. When asked about it, Cortez Masto, now a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, said she was unaware of the problem (2:18:30 and after).

The backlog had long been a problem in Nevada and was the subject of a Las Vegas Review-Journal story nearly three weeks before the meeting. Cortez Masto’s successor, Adam Laxalt, has pledged to combat the issue.

The spot is the first ad of a planned $6 million fall campaign by the Senate Leadership Fund, a Super PAC tied to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

It is part of a constant stream of campaign ads in the race between Cortez Masto and Rep. Joe Heck for Harry Reid’s seat, a contest that could determine who controls the U.S. Senate.
