PHOTOS: Camping World raises giant American Flag
A giant American Flag was raised at Camping World in Statesville on Friday. The flag, which was made in Texas, is 40-by-80 feet and it sits on top of a flag pole that is 130 feet tall. The flag is a way for our American company to show pride in our country, said Emily Naehring who is the e-commerce manager at Camping World. Camping World has been in Statesville for more than 10 years, and there are more than 160 locations across the country.
