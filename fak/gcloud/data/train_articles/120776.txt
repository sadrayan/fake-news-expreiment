Mandalay Bay management says Las Vegas rampage began 'within 40 seconds' after security guard reported shooting
The statement confirms that Campos, who was wounded in a leg after Paddock fired an estimated 200 bullets through his hotel room door, may have reported a gunman in the hotel sometime before the massacre began at 10:05 p.m.. It continues to raise questions about why it took police at least 12 minutes to reach the gunman's floor when armed security and Las Vegas police were already in the building.
