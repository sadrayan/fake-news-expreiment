Syrian 'heart-eating' rebel commander explains his actions
A Syrian rebel commander filmed earlier this year cutting out and apparently biting the organs of a dead Syrian soldier has defended his actions.

Abu Sakkar told the BBC it was an illustration of the desperate acts Syrians were being pushed to by the lack of outside assistance in their fight against the government.

He added he did not actually bite into it but held it for show.

Paul Wood has spoken to Abu Sakkar in northern Syria.
