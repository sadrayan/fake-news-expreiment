The NATO Secretary General announced at the Riga Summit that the Alliance has agreed to offer the Partnership for Peace programme to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

“This will help to bring the region more fully into the Euro-Atlantic family,” Mr. De Hoop Scheffer told reporters, “We have the nations with Membership Action Plan, we now have the others in NATO’s Partnership for Peace.”

The Partnership for Peace (PfP) is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Partner countries and NATO. It allows Partner countries to build up an individual relationship with NATO, choosing their own priorities for cooperation.

20 countries in Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia are members of the Programme.

The Secretary General said that NATO expects both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
