So Staples votes for it, Patterson wants sanctuary state for illegal's and Dewhurst lets the bill died repeatedly in committee under a Democrat chair. Patrick files a bill and co-authors an amendment on the floor to abolish in-state tuition for illegal's. You don't see a distinction between these four people? The ad is making a distinction between the four candidates' record. Not the lipservice they are paying now. If you don't see this, you just don't want to.

If this is the extent of his opposition to the 2001 law, I don’t need more information. If you have more, let me know? It doesn’t look to me like he’s alone among the candidates.

Thanks.
