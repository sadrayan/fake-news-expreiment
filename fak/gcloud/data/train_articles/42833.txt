"Juárez in an extremely lucrative drug-smuggling route," Robert Almonte said.

He is a former U.S. marshal and retired El Paso police detective who trains law enforcement across the U.S. about narcotics and the drug cartels.

"What's going on regarding the violence, you have the different cartels and gangs that are fighting each other and trying to gain control of the drug-smuggling route," Almonte said.

The problem appears to be caused by new cartels that are forming.

"For example, you have the Assassin Artists who used to be the enforcers for the Sinaloa cartel, Almonte said. "They broke away from Sinaloa, they're fighting Sinaloa. And you have the Barrio Azteca gang. They used to be with the Juárez cartel."

Almote said a lot of methamphetamines are coming from Mexico. He said it's the number one drug that law enforcement in the U.S. has to deal with.

It's why Almonte thinks nothing will change unless Mexico gets a handle the drug situation and dismantles the gangs and cartels.

The gangs will continue fighting for the territory, according to Almonte.

Almonte believes the number of homicides in Juárez will likely remain high in 2019.
