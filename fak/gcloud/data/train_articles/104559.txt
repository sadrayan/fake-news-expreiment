ADL Disappointed Over North Carolina’s Passing of House Bill 522, After Urging Governor to Veto Legislation
Date: August 13, 2013

Following a letter written to North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory urging him to veto North Carolina House Bill (HB) 522, “An Act to Protect Rights and Privileges Granted Under the United States and North Carolina Constitutions in the Application of Foreign Law,” the DC Regional Office was disappointed to learn that the Bill had been passed by North Carolina legislature.

Whenever anti-sharia laws are passed by state legislatures, it raises concern that the state’s Jewish community will be detrimentally impacted, including the Israeli community living within the jurisdiction, in addition to other religious groups in our nation that utilize religious tribunals as arbitrators.

ADL expressed in their letter to Governor McCrory that HB 522 is a proverbial solution in search of a problem; that there simply is no documentation of unconstitutional application of foreign law in our judicial system. The reason is that our state and federal constitutions already prohibit such an unconstitutional application of foreign law. The language of HB 522 is similar to bills filed in other states and is part of a national trend that is nothing more than an unnecessary response to unfounded fears. HB 522’s purported protections against the unconstitutional application of foreign law are redundant and wholly unnecessary.
