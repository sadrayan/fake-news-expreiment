Effects of Travel on the Economy
A new study by Rockport Analytics finds that government spending on meetings totaled $17.9 billion in 2011, the most recent comprehensive data set available. That expenditure resulted in a total economic contribution of more than $24 billion to the U.S. economy — 34 percent beyond associated costs — including a $2.5 billion infusion into state and local governments and support for $14.5 billion in wages via 343,800 U.S. jobs.

Breaking the data down further, researchers found that the economic impact of government meetings is more than double the costs for meetings travel. Just more than half of meetings spending, $10.9 billion, went to travel expenses, with the balance accounted for by venue, service and operations expenses — costs incurred regardless of location.

These calculations don’t include immeasurable long-term economic gains realized through private sector delegates engaging with government agencies in meetings. The study indicates that 62 percent of business executives report positive ROI from attending meetings where government employees are present, compared to just 12 percent claiming a negative return.

And while both government and the private sector benefit from these conferences, the government maximizes its return by more tightly controlling costs. Private-sector spending on meetings totals nearly 13 times government spending and is more than double government outlays on a per-employee basis.
