The chairman of the affected Guma LGA, Anthony Shawon, had allegedly confirmed an attack on his domain, claiming that two people including, Tersoo Nyiukaa and Doove Dogbo were killed by suspected herders while many were wounded.

But the All Progressives Congress (APC)’s House of Representatives candidate for Makurdi/Guma federal constituency in Benue State, Engr. Conrad Terhide Utaan, at a press conference in Makurdi on Thursday, insisted that the killings were instigated by the state government.

Utaan accused Governor Samuel Ortom and the PDP of orchestrating the attack and killing people in the area because they do not have the political capacity to win the vicinity he alleged was APC’s stronghold.

Ortom however confirmed attack in Iye community but said he was yet to ascertain the figure of casualty.

He berated the APC and its candidate for what he described as unfounded allegation against his government.

Speaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, the governor said the position of the APC candidate confirmed his earlier alarm that some persons in the state were in connivance with external forces to cause insecurity in the state so as to destabilise PDP’s strongholds during the elections.

The governor insisted that those who attacked the rural communities were herders.

Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) iin the state, Catherine Sewuese Anene, said, “I have not gotten any information about that (attacks in Iye) yet but will let you know upon confirmation.”
