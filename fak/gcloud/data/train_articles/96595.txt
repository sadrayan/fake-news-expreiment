â€” The tenth Nicholas Sparks' book to be made into a film, "The Longest Ride," will be filmed in Wilmington, according to a post on the Wilmington Film website.

The romantic drama follows two love stories - one told through a college student falling in love with a bull rider and the other through an ailing 90-year-old man remembering his deceased wife. The book came out in September.

No casting info or production dates yet, but the film is accepting resumes from local crew members. Just submit your resume to TheLongestRide2014@gmail.com or go to the Wilmington Film website.

The film is set to be released April 3, 2015, according to IMDB.com.

This is the latest Sparks' project filmed in North Carolina. The film based on his book "A Walk to Remember" was filmed in Wilmington in 2001. Six years later, the film adaptation of his book "Nights in Rodanthe" was shot in Wrightsville Beach. In 2012, "Safe Haven" was filmed in the Southport area.

The film based on his book "The Best of Me" will hit theaters on Oct. 17. That movie, featuring Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden, was shot in Louisiana.
