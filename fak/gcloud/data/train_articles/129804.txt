Sixth Annual Transatlantic Forum on Russia
Streamed live on Nov 16, 2017

In partnership with the Centre for Polish-Russian Dialogue and Understandng (CPRDU), we are pleased to invite you to the sixth annual Transatlantic Forum on Russia. As the transatlantic community continues to search for an enduring policy framework toward Russia, this forum will examine the power of historical understanding and grievances that shape Russia's foreign and security policy as well as assess opportunities to reinvigorate the Helsinki Final Act to restore stability and transparency to Europe's security environment.
