Patrick Murphy says it's time for Benghazi committee to come to end
Patrick Murphy, one of just seven House Democrats to vote for the Benghazi committee, said today that "it's past time" the panel be disbanded. But he does not think Democrats should walk away as Hillary Clinton prepares to testify on Thursday.

Murphy has come under attack from Democratic rival Alan Grayson for supporting the investigation, a plank in Grayson's strategy of casting former Republican Murphy as a phony.

In the MSNBC interview, Murphy cited a news release he issued after his vote. It read: “While the congressman respects the work his colleagues have done already investigating this matter, when it comes to American lives lost overseas in service to our nation, we must make sure that all questions have been answered. He sincerely hopes that this committee is not used as a way to politicize this tragedy and the deaths of four Americans.”

Grayson spox Kevin Franck: "Murphy's silly explanation that he thought this committee headed by a right-wing former prosecutor would clear Hillary Clinton's name is either a lie, or among the dumbest things a Member of Congress has said in a long time. Murphy voted with Republicans on this witch hunt for the same reason he voted with Republicans on the Keystone pipeline and so many other issues - because he is one."
