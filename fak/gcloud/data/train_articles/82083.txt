About Laureate
Aligned to our commitment to being Here for Good, we are proud to be one of the world’s largest Certified B Corporations® and Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). Further, our PBC is the largest such corporation to be publicly traded on any stock exchange in the world. Being a PBC and a B Corp allows us to legally embed our mission into all that we do, pushing us to find meaningful ways to improve on our social and environmental performance. It helps us balance our purpose and profit, bridging the gap between our academic community and our business operations. We strive to be not only the best in the world, but also the best for the world. What sets us apart, though, is the scale and platform we have to equip students around the world with the skills and awareness to be ambassadors in this movement, preparing them to lead innovative companies and communities that are determined to effect global change.
