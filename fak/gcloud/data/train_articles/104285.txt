No, no, no, NO! The Obamas have suffered enough hate, criticism, and ingratitude. Barack remains the most disrespected President in our nation's history. I wouldn't want Michelle to suffer worse as the first black woman President. They already have one "Jackie Robinson" in the family. Let them work outside of the gauntlet of public office.

Besides, this country elected Trump. We don't deserve Michelle.
