Concealed Handgun Permit Holder: Esteban Santiago CONVICTED

Date: January 6, 2017

People Killed: 3



Circumstances: On January 6, 2017, concealed handgun permit holder Esteban Santiago, 26, allegedly opened fire in the baggage claim area of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport killing five and wounding six others. A witness said that the shooter reloaded his Walther 9mm pistol before running out of ammunition. The suspect then sat on the floor and waited to be arrested. The shooter had arrived on a Delta flight from Alaska and had his handgun in his checked baggage. Santiago reportedly had a history of mental health problems. Santiago was held on federal firearms and airport violence charges while awaiting formal charges to be filed.

UPDATE: On May 1, 2018, prosecutors announced they would not seek the death penalty against Esteban Santiago in exchange for his guilty plea in the January 2017 mass shooting at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. In August 2018, the judge overseeing the case formally accepted the plea deal and Santiago was sentenced to five life sentences plus 120 years in prison.

Concealed Handgun Permit Holder: Pedro Vargas SHOT AND KILLED DURING INCIDENT

Date: July 27, 2013

People Killed: 6



Circumstances: On July 27, 2013, concealed handgun permit holder Pedro Vargas, 42, shot and killed six people at an apartment complex in Hialeah, Florida before being shot and killed by a police SWAT team. Officials identified those killed by Vargas as: Italo Pisciotti, 79; Camira Pisciotti, 69; Carlos Javier Gavilanes, 33; Patricio Simono, 64; Merly S. Niebles, 51; and, Priscilla Perez, 17. The incident began around 6:30 PM when Vargas lit his apartment on fire by burning $10,000 in cash with a combustible liquid. Vargas’s mother, who was in the apartment at the time, fled to safety. Seeing the smoke, building managers Italo and Camira Pisciotti ran toward the apartment. They were met at the door by Vargas, who shot and killed them both. Vargas then walked out onto his balcony, firing 10 to 20 shots from his Glock 9mm pistol, killing Gavilanes who was standing in the parking lot of an apartment building across the street. Vargas then went one floor down and kicked in an apartment door before shooting Patricio Simono and his girlfriend Merly Niebles. Niebles’ daughter Priscilla hid in the bathtub, but Vargas discovered her and shot and killed her. Vargas then continued firing randomly. Police arrived on the scene and returned fire. Vargas then entered another apartment where he took two hostages. Negotiators talked with Vargas but eventually a SWAT team entered the apartment and killed him, freeing the two hostages. Vargas took a two-hour introduction training course and a four-hour safety course at the Florida Gun Center in the fall of 2010 before obtaining his concealed weapons permit and purchasing a Glock 17 pistol. He reportedly had no known history of violence or mental illness.
