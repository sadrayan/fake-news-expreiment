Regarding the claim by Tom Luce, it appears that he was speaking about the 8th grade cohort (that I referred you to on p. 15 of the 2017 Almanac) rather than HS graduates.

Please see below for data regarding HS graduates. These data are for Texas publics and independent (ICUT) institution completions. We do not include out-of-state completions because we donâ€™t consistently have that data. It does not include career school data.

For 2008-2010 HS grads (with cohort of 797,074), 28.0% (222,913 students) earned degrees or certificates (including certificate, assoc., bacc. or higher) within 6 years of their HS graduation, where 20.6% (164,563) earned bacc. or higher.

I forgot to add this information to the email that I just sent to you:

For the 2006 8th grade cohort: 27% of the 8th grade cohort students who graduated from high school completed a degree or certificate in the time frame tracked (11 years from grade 8 onward which is 6 years from HS graduation if a student follows a traditional timeline).

Yes, that is accurate.
