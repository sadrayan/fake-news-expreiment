Fraud: How the Left Plans to Steal the Next Election
From the investigative team that produced Clinton Cash, Fraud busts open the ballot box to expose the felons, illegal immigrants, and even corpses that fraudulently foil America’s chances for honest election outcomes.

Which members of Congress actually lost their races? Which counties have registered voters listed as over 200 years old? Where in America are over 100 percent of an area’s voters registered to vote? With exclusive interviews with whistleblowers who have seen the fraud first-hand and backed by state of the art forensic tools and elite investigative acumen, Fraud analyzes the voter rolls to name names and show, in historic detail, how the numbers just don’t add up.

When it comes to exposing voter fraud, the stakes have never been higher.
