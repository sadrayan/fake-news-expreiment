Crain's New York Business Class of 2012 40 Under 40 honorees
He's the youngest network news president in television history, but a more interesting fact about David Rhodes might be that he's the only CBS news executive whose career began at Fox News. Even more important, the executive who has helped make the CBS Evening News competitive again is as much at home with the ghost of Edward R. Murrow as he was with conservative cable news pioneer Roger Ailes.

And for that, Mr. Rhodes can thank his Manhattan upbringing at the hands of a mother from the Upper East Side and a father from Baytown, Texas. "We always had a diversity of views at home," he said.

That diversity would be reflected in their sons. Younger brother Ben—now deputy national-security adviser—worked on the Obama presidential campaign while Mr. Rhodes was directing political coverage at Fox News. "That's the book we could write that we never will," he said.

Mr. Rhodes considers his own "eclectic" voting record of no consequence to his job. Since his arrival last year, he has been rebuilding the last-place evening and morning news programs with a hard-news approach.

It's been working. CBS Evening News With Scott Pelley—the only network newscast to show audience growth this season—recently spent a week in second place among viewers 25 to 54 years old. CBS hadn't been second since 2006.

Mr. Rhodes has plenty more to do. The relaunched CBS This Morning has yet to see a ratings turnaround. And he's hoping to improve on what already works. Face the Nation, for instance, will expand to one hour in April.

'David is unassuming, he's funny, and he has amazing instincts about the news,' said his boss, CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager.
