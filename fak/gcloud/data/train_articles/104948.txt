CUBA FOUND A CANCER VACCINE! MORE THAN 4 THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN CURED BY IT!
Cancer is the deadliest disease of our time, and unfortunately, scientists haven’t been able to find a cure yet. There are many scientists who have dedicated their life in the search for the cure, and there are many promising natural alternatives that can replace chemotherapy and radiation in the future.

The latest example is a research from Cuba, where a small group of scientists with a limited budget have been able to develop a vaccine against cancer that has cured more than 4000 people! The scientific community is impressed by the Cuban discovery, and many doctors claim that the cure for cancer has finally been found!

The vaccine has produced incredible results even in the more advanced stages of cancer. It finally saw the light of day after 16 years of intense research, and doesn’t have any adverse side-effects. What’s even more impressive is the fact that a country like Cuba has managed to develop such a marvelous creation instead of bigger countries and pharmaceutical giants that were not even close.

The vaccine works by attacking a protein known as EGF (epidermal growth factor), which allows lung cancer cells to grow. The CIMAvax vaccine reinforce the immune system and accelerates the production of antibodies that bind to EGF, preventing it to feed cancer cells and not allowing the disease to spread. This improves the longevity of the patient and effectively stops the disease from progressing. The administration of the vaccine also relieves the symptoms of cancer and reduces the pain – after a few therapies, patients have seen a significant weight gain and got their appetite and energy back. The vaccine has already arrived in countries such as Bosnia & Herzegovina, Paraguay, Colombia and Peru.

There are high hopes among Cuban scientists that the vaccine can cure breast, uterus and prostate tumors, while further research on other types of cancer is underway. The vaccine is free for Cubans, while people from other parts of the world may inform themselves on the vaccine by contacting the Cuban medical services:
