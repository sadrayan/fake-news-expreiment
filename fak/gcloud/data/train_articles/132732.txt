South Africa Survey/Socio-Economic Survey

The Survey is published annually providing a deep-dive analysis of the major trends shaping South Africa across 14 social and economic fields from the economy, government finance, and living standards, to healthcare, crime, education, and demographics. At over 900 pages there is no more complete statistical reference guide to the trends that will shape a future South Africa and this makes the Survey an essential resource for the strategy and marketing teams of any firm with interests in South Africa. The Survey is published in hard copy and online in PDF and Excel.
