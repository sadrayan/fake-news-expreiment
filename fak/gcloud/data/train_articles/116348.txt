License to drive: James Bond gets a new car you can't buy
James Bond is synonymous with cool gadgets, beautiful women and, of course, fast cars. This one, however, is one nobody will be able to buy.

On Thursday director Sam Mendes revealed the title of the 24th film based on Ian Fleming's iconic British spy, as well as the hero's new ride. Continuing the character's 50 year relationship with Aston Martin, Mendes worked directly with engineers and designers to create a vehicle—the DB10—specifically designed for the new film.

"To be partnering once again with EON Productions is great news for this company and for everyone around the world that loves to see Bond at the wheel of an Aston Martin," Dr. Andy Palmer, CEO of Aston Martin, said in a statement.

There is a catch. Unlike previous models seen in Bond films, however, the DB10 will not be available to consumers. Only 10 models will be created and all of them will be used exclusively for filming.

While the new model doesn't come with a price tag, the company's 2014 DB9, starts at $183,700. Aston Martin reported earnings of £519 million ($809.35 million) in 2013 having sold only 575 vehicles. That represents a 13 percent increase in revenue from 2012.
