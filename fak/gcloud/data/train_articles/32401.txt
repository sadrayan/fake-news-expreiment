Clinton Foundation Policy Update
The Clinton Foundation is committed to improving millions of lives around the world. In light of Secretary Clintonâ€™s decision to run for President, Secretary Clinton has stepped down from the Clinton Foundation board and, while she is a candidate for President, the Foundation will modify its policies as follows:

Increase Donor Disclosure: The Foundation will increase the frequency of disclosure of its donors from annually to quarterly, publishing new contributors beginning in July 2015, and then each quarter thereafter (i.e., October, January, and April).

Clinton Global Initiative (CGI): After the already scheduled CGI International conference in May (CGI Middle East & Africa), CGI will not hold any CGI International events, nor will it accept contributions or sponsorships from foreign governments, other than meeting attendance fees.

Contributions from Foreign Governments: The Clinton Foundation only will accept funding from foreign governments that have funded Clinton Foundation programs, namely: Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Funding from these governments will support the economic development or climate-focused work of the Clinton Climate Initiative, the Clinton Development Initiative, and the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership.
