Carlos Larmond tried to convert beating accused to Islam, lawyer says
A jailhouse video released in court shows the beating of Carlos Larmond, one of the Ottawa twins facing terrorism-related charges, after Larmond allegedly tried to convert another inmate to Islam.

The video, released to the media on Thursday, shows two men attacking Larmond on March 3 in a common area of the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre located on Innes Road, with other inmates surrounding the group.

One of the accused, 24-year-old Terrence Wilson, has since been sentenced on Thursday to 60 days in jail for assault causing bodily harm related to the jailhouse attack.

The other accused inmate, who was 29 years old at the time, is scheduled to appear in court for sentencing at a later date.

Larmond allegedly made death threat

Paolo Giancaterino, the lawyer representing Wilson who submitted the video as evidence, said Larmond had tried to convert his client to Islam on several occasions.

The efforts turned from friendly to aggressive, though, and Larmond eventually told Wilson "he was going to kill him in his cell," Giancaterino said.

Carlos Larmond suffered a broken left hand, a black eye and multiple scrapes and bruises in the beating, according to police.

He did not file a victim impact statement during Wilson's trial, Giancaterino said.

Larmond and his twin brother, Ashton Larmond, were arrested by RCMP in early January.

Carlos Larmond is facing one count of participating in the activity of a terrorist group and one count of attempting to leave Canada to participate in terrorist activity abroad.

The twins have since been transferred out of the Ottawa jail.
