State Sen. Isadore Hall (D-Compton) was met by a process server at his congressional campaign's election party in San Pedro on Tuesday night, and was served with a subpoena in a lawsuit over a real estate deal, CBS 2-TV reported. Hall, who has been accused by opponent Nanette Barragán of campaign finance violations, is leading Barragán in early returns for South L.A.'s 44th Congressional District seat.
