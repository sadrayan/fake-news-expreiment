Pro-Trump PAC ad calls Cruz weak on ISIS and border security
WASHINGTON – A PAC supporting Donald Trump is targeting Sen. Ted Cruz on national security.

The ad, paid for by Great America PAC and airing in Wisconsin ahead of Tuesday’s GOP primary, claims Cruz supports increasing the number of Syrian refugees allowed to enter the U.S. and favors legalization for people in the country illegally.

“Sure, I get some grief when I say I’m voting for Donald Trump, but you know what, I want to protect my family. Paris, San Bernardino and now Brussels. I want a president that will keep us safe,” the ad says. “We need to control our borders and stop letting in dangerous people. Trump will do that, and Ted Cruz — he wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants. That won’t protect my family; Donald Trump will.”

Cruz did note in 2014 that he was sympathetic to the plight of refugees fleeing ISIS in Syria and Iraq because his Cuban father was also a refugee. But since the Paris terrorist attacks in November, Cruz has called for a ban on Syrian refugees. The ban would exempt Christians because they pose “no meaningful risk” of radicalization, according to Cruz.

Trump has painted Cruz as an amnesty supporter because of an amendment to a 2013 immigration bill that would have removed the option of citizenship for people in the country illegally. Other forms of legalization would still be allowed for certain people in the country without permission. Opponents say Cruz was helping to push the legislation through, while Cruz claims he wanted to kill the bill with a “poison pill” amendment.

The legislation, known as the “gang of eight” bill, fell apart but has still haunted other Republicans involved, including former presidential candidate and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.

Trump, Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich face off in the Wisconsin primary Tuesday, when 42 delegates are up for grabs.
