Resources on school shootings, perpetrators, and prevention
Despite increased attention to school shootings and school safety, rampage attacks continue to devastate communities in the United States and around the world.

This site is a compendium of documents relating to a wide range of active shooter incidents in educational settings. The purpose of the site is to help prevent school shootings and to provide insight into the perpetrators of large-scale school violence. The information and materials on this site are relevant for professionals in education, mental health, and law enforcement, as well as anyone else who is interested in learning about those who commit school shootings.

As a psychologist who has worked with potential school shooters and studied this phenomenon for over fifteen years, I am acutely aware of both the necessity and the challenge of obtaining accurate information to further our understanding. We now have over 500 documents, totaling over 60,000 pages, on 150 perpetrators. School Shooters .info is an effort to make these important resources available to the public.
