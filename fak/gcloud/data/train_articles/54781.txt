Crescent Dunes â€” SolarReserve
The Crescent Dunes plant is a tremendous success story for US-developed technology. The plant produces more than 500,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year, twice the generation of an equivalent sized photovoltaics (PV) or direct steam solar thermal facility. It also utilizes dry cooling technology in a hybrid design to minimize water use well below conventional power projects. The storage technology developed by SolarReserve also eliminates the need for any backup fossil fuels, such as natural gas, which are needed with other solar technologies to keep the system operating during times of reduced solar resource. During the construction of the plant, the Crescent Dunes Project created over 4,300 direct, indirect and induced jobs, with more than 1,000 construction workers on site during peak construction. The project also generated in excess of $750 million in capital investment in Nevada.
