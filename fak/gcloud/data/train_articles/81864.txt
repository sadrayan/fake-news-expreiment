Everything we know about the San Bernardino terror attack investigation so far
Enrique Marquez Jr., a 24-year-old Riverside man who worked as a Wal-Mart security guard, is a central figure in the investigation.

He checked into a mental health facility on the day of the shooting and police searched his Riverside home -- next door to Farook’s old residence -- shortly after the shootings. He was said to be good friends with Farook and cemented his connection to his next-door neighbor by marrying the sister of Farook's sister-in-law in 2014. In 2011 or 2012, Marquez bought two of the rifles Farook and Malik used in the attack. A law enforcement source said he converted to Islam at some point, but when is unclear.

Marquez has waived his right to an attorney and been cooperative throughout marathon interviews with federal investigators, a law enforcement source said.

According to a law enforcement source, Marquez told investigators Farook wanted him to buy the guns because he feared he "wouldn't pass a background check" if he attempted to acquire the weapons on his own.

Marquez also told FBI agents Farook had made an earlier attack plan he didn’t follow through on, according to a source.
