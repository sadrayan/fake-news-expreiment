Americas: Amnesty International monitors treatment of asylum seekers at US-Mexico border – Amnesty International USA
On Thursday 26 April, Amnesty International raised a billboard at the San Ysidro Port of Entry (POE) on the US–Mexico border in Tijuana, with a message reminding US and Mexican authorities of their obligations to facilitate asylum claims and to respect the universal human right of all people to seek asylum in other countries.

The billboard also invites asylum seekers to report to Amnesty International if authorities turn them away or otherwise violate their human right to seek asylum.

As hundreds of people who have traveled in caravan from Central America prepare to claim asylum over the weekend at the San Ysidro POE, an Amnesty International delegation will be on the ground to monitor the conduct of authorities in the reception and facilitation of their asylum claims.

On 24 April, Amnesty International denounced apparent efforts by US and Mexican authorities to prevent caravan members from exercising their right to seek asylum at the San Ysidro POE.

Members of the Amnesty International delegation at the border will be available for interviews.

This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR, 1948), which establishes that “everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.”

According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), there are currently over 22.5 million refugees worldwide – the highest number since the United Nations was established. More than half of those refugees are under the age of 18.
