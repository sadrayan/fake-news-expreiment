White House Chief Digital Officer Gerrit Lansing was among the six staffers who were dismissed from the White House last week after being unable to pass an FBI background check, according to sources.

A source close to Lansing said the issue with the background check was over investments.

Lansing previously led the digital department for the Republican National Committee.

The background check, security questionnaire SF86, must be completed by White House staffers for positions that cover national security.

President Donald Trump's director of scheduling, Caroline Wiles, was also among the six staffers who did not pass the intensive FBI screening. She is the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trumpâ€™s Florida campaign director. Caroline Wiles resigned Friday before the background check was completed.

She was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. Two sources close to Wiles said she will get another job in the Treasury Department.

Lansing left Feb. 9; his official file says he left on his accord.

The intensive background check includes questions on the applicant's credit score, substance use and other personal subjects.
