Electric Skateboards Legalized in California, Reversing Ban
Electric skateboarders rejoice: you can soon ride in California in all legality.

California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill Sunday that allows the use of motorized wheeled devices, aimed at electric skateboards but which could be extended to other new contraptions, anywhere bicycles are allowed to go. The law, which takes effect Jan. 1, 2016, reverses a 1977 ban intended to keep noisy, stinky, gas-powered skateboards off the streets.
