New data from eHealth shows average individual(Obamacare) health insurance premiums have increased 99% since 2013. Over the same time period, family premiums have increased 140%.

This data is from an newly published eHealth analysis of individual and family health insurance shopping trends for the first two months of the 2017 open enrollment period as well as a review of previously published data from eHealth that looks back on individual and family health premiums and deductibles since 2008.

This data dump is the latest in a long running list of eHealth’s continuing Health Insurance Price Index reports, which track costs and trends in the self-purchased health insurance market since 2014. Prior to 2014, eHealth published an annual Cost and Benefits report, which tracked cost and benefit trends in the self-purchased health insurance market since 2005.

The previous reports are available online:

Between 2013 and the first two months of the 2017 open enrollment period, average individual monthly premiums have increased 99% from $197 in 2013 to $393 in 2017

Family coverage highlights

Average family premium: $1,021 for a family not receiving subsidies

Historical Data

Premium data for the 2014-2017 open enrollment periods reflect premiums for plans selected by eHealth customers not receiving government subsidies. Government subsidies were not available prior to 2014.

The health insurance plans available through eHealth or chose by eHealth shoppers differ from year to year. Health insurance plans available before implementation of Obamacare typically provided a larger variety of benefits and coverage. For example, many plans sold prior to Obamacare’s implementation did not cover pre-existing medical conditions or the Affordable Care Act’s comprehensive list of 10 essential benefits, which became mandatory for all plans.

Ten Years of Health Insurance Costs:

Average individual health insurance premiums increased 147% between 2008 and the first two months of the 2017 open enrollment period

Average family health insurance premiums increased 177% between 2008 and the first two months of the 2017 open enrollment period

The benefits offered by individual and family health insurance plans before 2014 often differed significantly from the benefits available between 2014-2017 due to regulations introduced by the Affordable Care Act which came into effect in 2014.

An 2013 eHealth report analyzed some of these differences.

Additional information describing consumer shopping trends and demographics during the first two months of the 2017 open enrollment period was published by eHealth on January 13, 2016 and is available at the company’s media center.





About eHealth’s Price Index

eHealth is one of the few organizations with national source health insurance data that broadly reflects consumer buying patterns and purchase prices in the self-purchased individual and family health insurance market. eHealth’s Price Index reports provide insights into the large segment of the individual and family health insurance market which may not qualify for or elect to use government subsidies, and which may shop for coverage through sources other than government-run exchanges.

eHealth’s Price Index 2017 figures are based on thousands of health insurance applications submitted by eHealth shoppers during the first two months of the 2017 open enrollment period (November 1 and December 31, 2016). These figures do not include data from individual or family health insurance shoppers who have applied for government subsidies or selected subsidy-eligible plans through their state government’s health insurance exchange with the assistance of licensed agents from eHealth. Information from prior years was previously published in other eHealth reports using the methodologies indicated in those reports.

Data presented in eHealth’s report is based solely on rates quoted for health insurance applications selected by consumers through the company’s website in the specified time period. Figures have been rounded to the nearest full dollar or nearest full percentage point. The information provided here does not offer a comprehensive view of costs for all plans available through eHealth, through the market as a whole, or through government exchanges. Certain data may have been excluded. For example, applications missing key data fields relevant for analysis may have been removed from the sample.
