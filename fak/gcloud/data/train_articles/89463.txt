Sheila Resseger: Students can opt out of new tests in R.I.

I am a retired teacher from the Rhode Island School for the Deaf with an extensive background in linguistics, early language development and literacy development, as well as many years of experience working with struggling readers and writers.

This coming spring, Rhode Island public school students will spend many hours sitting in classrooms being subjected to the high-stakes, standardized tests from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), which are purported to measure a student�s achievement of the Common Core state standards.

I have zero confidence in the pedagogical underpinnings of the English Language Arts standards supposedly measured by the PARCC, and am appalled at the developmental inappropriateness and convoluted ambiguity of the PARCC sample items that I have examined.

Rhode Island needs to learn from the bitter experience of the state of New York, which piloted Pearson�s Common Core assessments in the spring of 2013. (Pearson is the global corporate behemoth that also produced the PARCC.)

It is clear that New York did not receive the value it should have expected for the millions of dollars it paid for the tests. While the state had every right to believe that it was receiving carefully constructed tests for each grade level, the opposite was the case: the same passages and questions appeared at multiple grade levels; some of the passages and questions had already appeared in the practice materials that Pearson had sold to some districts; the tests were so lengthy that even high-achieving students were unable to finish; questions were ambiguous; many children across the state became severely distressed before, during and after the assessments.

As Robert D. Shepherd, a recognized expert in literacy curriculum, asserted about questions on this type of standardized test, �it is often the case that, arguably, none of the answers to a given question, as worded, is correct or that more than one of the answers is correct, which invalidates the question.�

Not unexpectedly, the state proficiency rate in New York plummeted to about 30 percent after the 2013 assessments, with much lower scores for students with special needs, English language learners and students living in high-poverty neighborhoods.

This is what we are now bracing for in Rhode Island. Yet these assessments will sooner or later be used to make consequential judgments about students, their teachers and their schools. This is not raising the bar in a prudent and productive way � it is abusive. This is not a situation that can go unchallenged.

On behalf of a number of Rhode Island parents of school age children who share my concerns about the PARCC, I wrote to Phyllis Lynch, the director of instruction, assessment and curriculum at the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, in September. Among other things, I asked her whether refusal to participate (also referred to as opting out) in the PARCC would have a negative impact on the student�s placement, grade retention, provision of special services, or on the teacher�s evaluation.

Ms. Lynch replied on Sept. 18, �We expect all students to participate in state assessments, but no law requires participation.�

In a follow-up email on Sept. 24 in response to my further questions, she wrote, �Students who opt out of participation on state assessments will be counted as a non-participant when we calculate participation rates, but the nonparticipating students will not receive a score of �0� when we calculate the percent of students who attained proficiency.�

She also said, �Opting out of participation in state assessments, under current state laws and regulations, will not affect a student�s placement, grade retention, or receipt of special services, nor will opting out affect a teacher�s evaluation.�

Rather than informing parents on the Rhode Island Department of Education website of the legal right of students to opt out of assessments, RIDE is counting on parents to unwittingly acquiesce to a system that is wasteful of financial and other vital resources, and damaging to children�s right to authentic learning, emotional health and future opportunities.

By spring 2014, parents of 60,000 students in New York state had refused to let them take the Common Core tests. Rhode Island parents need to know that they have the opportunity and the right to counteract this wrong-headed testing juggernaut by barring their children from participating in the PARCC testing this spring.
