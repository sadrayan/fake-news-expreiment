Beto for Senate
We should all have a chance to succeed.

That means jobs for Texans who are ready to work and the education and training to be competitive for them.

It means that every one of us is able to get healthy and stay healthy. It means we have access to the providers, medications and help that keep us on our feet and moving forward.

It means that immigrants are seen as a critical source of strength and security in our communities – that beyond stopping walls and raids, we take the lead in writing immigration policy that matches our values and interests.

It means that we are all treated with dignity and respect, meeting the small, petty and divisive politics of this age with a confidence, courage and strength that could only come from Texas.

To get this done, we’re going to need a government that Texans can trust and a senator who is focused on helping the people he’s elected to serve.
