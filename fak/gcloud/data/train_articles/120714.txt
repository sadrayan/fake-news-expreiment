Man sues Disneyland for ending membership to exclusive Club 33
A change in the club's rules recently drew the ire of platinum members, the highest level of noncorporate membership.



In the past, such members got three extra VIP cards that allowed friends of the members to access the park and the club. But Disneyland announced that starting in 2015, only the member and a spouse or domestic partner would have access to the club benefits. Also, the membership fee rose this year to $12,000.



Cosgrove, a retired public relations and marketing expert, said he is a lifetime fan of Walt Disney Co. and the author of "Walt Dreamers Me," a book about Walt Disney.



The lawsuit asks the court to force Disneyland to pay Cosgrove at least $100,000 for mental anguish, legal fees and punitive damages, among other considerations.



An attorney for Cosgrove, Mark Corrinet, said Disney has provided no evidence that Cosgrove has previously violated the club's rules. He said he doubts that the company would want to fight the lawsuit against an elderly, longtime Disney devotee.



"He really is a huge fan of Walt Disney and Walt Disney's dream," Corrinet said. "The focus of his retired life has been yanked from him."
