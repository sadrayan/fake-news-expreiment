Terrorism Deaths, Injuries, Kidnappings of Private U.S. Citizens, 2009
Provided by the Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State

The term "Private U.S. Citizen" refers to any U.S. citizen not acting in an official capacity on behalf of the U.S. Government; therefore these figures do not include, for example, U.S. military personnel killed or injured in a terrorism-related incident while on active duty or employees of the Department of State and other federal agencies. Members of U.S. Government employees' households are considered private U.S. citizens.

Although every effort was made to include all terrorism-related deaths and injuries involving private U.S. citizens, the figures below reflect only those cases reported to, or known by, the U.S. Department of State, and may not reflect actual numbers of injured, which may not always be reported depending on their severity. As NCTC also notes, in the cases of Iraq and Afghanistan, it is particularly difficult to gather comprehensive information about all incidents and to distinguish terrorism from the numerous other forms of violence. The deaths, injuries, and kidnappings to U.S. citizens in this report occurred outside the United States. US based casualties can be found in the NCTC Report on Terrorism.

U.S. citizens worldwide killed as a result of incidents of terrorism: 9

U.S. citizens worldwide injured as a result of incidents of terrorism: 14

U.S. citizens worldwide kidnapped as a result of incidents of terrorism: 4
