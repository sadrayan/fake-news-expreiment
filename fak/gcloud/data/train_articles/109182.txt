'President Supervillain' Puts Trump's Quotes in Red Skull's Mouth, and It's Disturbingly Perfect
He’s barely been in office for a month, but already Donald Trump has given the world a fearsome amount of wild, delirious quotes. They’re sentences that not even the best satirical writer could come up with—and weirdly enough, they make for uncomfortably believable quotes for Marvel’s premiere fascist supervillain.



Brillian parody Twitter account/depressing vision of our global future President Supervillain—created by D.M. Higgins, creator of the excellent Jill Trent, Science Sleuth—takes classic Silver Age panels from Marvel comics featuring the Red Skull, erases the text, and then puts in honest-to-god quotes from Trump.

And then, just in case you can’t believe that these pearls of wisdom are coming from the purported leader of the free world, each tweet contains its source material as horrific evidence.

It is honestly rather petrifying just how well it works, in one of those “laugh because otherwise you’ll cry” sort of ways. Head on over to President Supervillain to see more.
