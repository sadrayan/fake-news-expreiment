Kharai camels to get protection as endangered species
AHMEDABAD: As now Kutch's 'swimming camels' have got recognition as a separate breed of camels, the experts hope that it would help in conservation and research efforts.At the moment, Gujarat is the only home to Kharai camel who have adapted to the extreme climate of rann and shallow seas and high salinity. As per latest counting, the state has 6,200 camels out of which around 2,200 are found in areas such as Lakhpat, Abdasa, Mundra and Bhachau in Kutch whereas the remaining are seen in South Gujarat near Aliya Bet.As the breeds having less than 10,000 population are identified as endangered, it can get special recognition and care. The move will also throw light on the life of maaldhari community whose livelihood is intertwined with that of the animal.Recently the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) located in Karnal, Haryana has certified the breed as ninth camel breed found in India, separating it from Kutchi camel.Sahajeevan, a Bhuj-based NGO along with Kutch Camel Breeders Association, Anand Krishi University and the stateâ€™s animal husbandry department had prepared breed descriptor and had conducted tests for gene pool and other characteristics.
