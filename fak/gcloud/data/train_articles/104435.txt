Have you ever wonder why the ironically named “antifa” organization only shows up to support Democrats?

According to a bombshell Breitbart report, the Clinton Foundation made some interesting “donations” to Antifa International in the amount of $75,983, multiple separate donations to Unite Against Fascism of more than $25,000 each, as well as donations to other Antifa groups. In total, she handed out more than $7.1 million to fund groups that brutally attack conservatives.

Many of these donations were made during the 2016 election while Hillary Clinton was busy losing to Donald Trump. The Clinton Foundation thus far has refused comment.

Antifa terrorists now regularly show up at free speech events to “bash the fash” – they call all conservatives fascists – both with fists and weapons, and when anyone acts in self defense they cry like a baby about how persecuted they are by the evil conservatives.

Antifa is recognized by the FBI and DHS as a terrorist organization as of February 29, 2017.

It’s now clear that Antifa is the paramilitary wing of the Demcorat Party, and they must be stopped at any and all costs.
