Does a Disney Cartoon Feature the Studio’s First Gay Kiss?
On 2 March 2017, the Facebook page “1,000,000 Supporting Traditional Marriage” shared an image featuring two male Disney figures engaging in a kiss, along with the claim that the studio had just aired its first ever same-sex kiss between animated characters:

Although the text accompanying the image is accurate — the program Star vs. The Forces of Evildid feature a same-sex kiss in an episode that aired on the Disney XD cable channel — the pictured characters were not involved in that moment of animated affection.

This images features a rendering of two characters from older classic Disney animated feature films — Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Prince Phillip from Sleeping Beauty (1959) — that was created by Mexican artist Rodolfo Loaiza for a series called “Disenchanted Disney.” The kiss Loaiza depicted did not actually appear in any Disney television program or film.

The real same-sex kiss included in Star vs. The Forces of Evil featured two nameless background characters shown during a brief montage of kissing cartoons in the season 2 episode “Just Friends.” The moment can be glimpsed at around the 1:25 second mark of the following video:

A second same-sex kiss can be spotted toward the end of this video:

UPDATE: The original article misidentified the two Disney princes kissing in this meme as Prince Charming from Cinderella and the Prince from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

We’ve reached out to Disney to confirm that this was the studio’s first-ever animated same-sex kiss, but have yet to receive a response. Disney did feature a same-sex couple in a 2014 episode of the live-action television series Good Luck Charlie.
