Congressional Republicans channel Trump in bashing the FBI
The larger context here is that ever since Mueller was appointed, there has been an effort by the president and his allies to discredit the special counsel’s investigation — for example, by pointing to the fact that some lawyers on his staff made political contributions to Clinton or other Democrats. There also have been attempts by the president’s allies to change the subject, such as the claim that the real scandal was improper ”unmasking” of members of the Trump transition team whose communications with foreign governments were intercepted by U.S. intelligence. The unmasking allegations have proved to be a non-scandal too.
