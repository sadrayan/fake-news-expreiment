Setting Past Aside, Russia and Ukraine Sign Friendship Treaty
After years of doubt and tensions, the Presidents of Russia and Ukraine today signed a friendship treaty designed to strengthen the weak bonds between the two Slavic states.

The treaty was signed in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, on Boris N. Yeltsin's first trip there as President of Russia. Many previous visits were scheduled or considered, but all were postponed because of tensions over the future of the Black Sea Fleet, territorial disputes in the ethnic Russian region of Crimea, which is part of Ukraine, and other issues.

But now, with NATO ready to expand eastward, Russia is looking to bolster its defense and prove to the West that it still has power worth worrying about. So Russia has quickly made past problems disappear -- at least for a while.

''My friend President Kuchma and I vow at this sacred place, at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, that the treaty that we sign today will be fulfilled,'' Mr. Yeltsin said as he stood with President Leonid Kuchma this morning. He said he would issue strict orders to the Russian leadership that the relationship with Ukraine ''is a priority of priorities for us.''

''We respect and honor the territorial integrity of Ukraine,'' Mr. Yeltsin added, in an important aside. Many Russian leaders have urged the Kremlin to try to claim the city of Sevastopol in the Crimea -- the base of the Black Sea Fleet -- as Russian.
