Nicolle Wallace Obliterates Trump Over 'Sh*thole' Comment: He 'Disgraced the Country'
The Washington Post‘s report was published at 4:37 p.m. ET — during the second half of MSNBC’s Deadline: White House. Host Nicolle Wallace saw the report and reacted to it live on air.

She was furious.

The Post report, if you missed it, centered on comments made by President Donald Trump during a Thursday bipartisan meeting with lawmakers discussing immigration.

“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” The president reportedly said.

Wallace hit the roof.

“This is so abnormal!” Wallace said. “This is a freak show!”

The MSNBC anchor added, “Donald Trump disgraced the country if what was reported out of this today was true.”
