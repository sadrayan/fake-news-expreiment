Palin Signs AGIA License Bill

Start Development on Natural Gas Pipeline Printer Friendly



No. 08-148

August 27, 2008, Anchorage, Alaska  Governor Sarah Palin today signed House Bill 3001, authorizing the state to award an AGIA license allowing TransCanada Alaska to start developing a 1,715-mile natural gas pipeline from a treatment plant at Prudhoe Bay to the Alberta Hub in Canada. The Governor signed the bill at the Alaska AFL-CIOs biennial convention.

After dreaming of a natural gas pipeline for more than 30 years, Alaskans have now created the framework for the project to advance, Governor Palin said. This legislation brings us closer than weve ever been to building a gas pipeline and finally accessing our gas that has been languishing for so many decades on the North Slope.

TransCanada Corporation has successfully constructed many natural gas pipelines and now operates more than 36,000 miles of natural gas pipelines in North America.

TransCanada appreciates the support the Governor, the Legislature and Alaska have shown for the Alaska gas pipeline, and our role as the AGIA Licensee, TransCanada Vice President Tony Palmer said. Our company has started field work on the project in order to meet our target date for completing the initial open season within two years.

TransCanada Alaska has already authorized specific aerial photography, engineering work and environmental gap analysis in support of the open season project. The AGIA license will be issued in 90 days.
