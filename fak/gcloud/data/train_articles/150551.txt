Things are coming full circle for Henry Winkler in many ways.

The actor best known for playing "The Fonz" on the sitcom "Happy Days" also is a children's book author and recently paid a visit to promote his latest book at his old elementary school in New York City.

He says he was struck by the "way the world comes together."

His latest book is the 29th in a series, called "Here's Hank: Everybody is Somebody," about a kid named Hank who goes to Public School 87 in New York City, the same school he attended.

Winkler had trouble reading as a child and academics were difficult for him. It wasn't until he was an adult and his stepson was diagnosed with dyslexia that his own challenges had a name.
