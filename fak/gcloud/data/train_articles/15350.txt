Tracing the 1 in 12 statistic

Response to PolitiFact Texas from Equality Texas (received by email from Chuck Smith, executive director, Equality Texas, May 8, 2015)

“Based on the FBI’s “Uniform Crimes Reports, Crime in the United States 2000,” showing the murder rate of 5.5 people per 100,000.”

This is the overall crime rate in the US in that year, the giving the chance an ordinary US citizen has of being murdered. – See the PDF file included.

It’s page 15 of section II near the bottom of the left hand column.

Tracing “1 in 12”

The number of transgender people murdered appears to come from a single source who is cited as Kay Brown, an expert who gave a course on transgender history based on her masters thesis. -- http://www.ifge.org/news/1999/feb/ntc99feb16.htm#notice3

Her legal name is Candice Hellen Brown Elliott, and who according to another person investigating the ‘1 in 12’ claim, is “a transgender activist who has made an honest effort to collect transgender murder statistics, but even she admits that data are hard to come by because there is really no way to know how many transgender persons there are or to identify all murder victims who are transgender.” -- http://blog.thejurorinvestigates.com/2010/11/more-about-transgender-murder-statistics/

A well-researched look at the sources of the ‘1 in 12’ statistic is here:

This article points out that nearly every one of the sources mentioned wind up citing Kay Brown’s information or the HRC website which cites the Kay Brown information.

The website on transgender history mentioned in the announcement for her course at the Harvey Milk Institute during March of 1999, from which the article published in December 1999 came, is no longer available on the Web – except via the “wayback machine” at the Internet Archive – which takes periodic “snapshots” if the Web and stores them for research.

The numbers of transgender people killed in a year is often taken from the transgender day of remembrance web site which is kept relatively current within a couple years – http://tdor.info/statistics/

To reconstruct the statistic one needs to know the number of transgender people murdered in the year cited – and because there were no official numbers, and the TDOR web site depends on people reviewing news articles, and because identifying people as transgender is often difficult and there was no official count kept by authorities it is assumed that the number TDoR and other groups come up with is an under-representation of the true numbers.

Another issue is whether the statistic refers to a murder rate or the lifetime risk of ending their life as a murder victim. This article when taken together with its updates and the comment linked in the January 2015 update makes a plausible case for the statistic (such as it is) referring to the lifetime risk a transgender person has of ending their life as a murder victim.
