Do You Want To Play With My Balls?
A few years ago four kind and slightly demented fellows (that's us!) got together and created a book called Do You Want To Play With My Balls?, a children's book for adults. Our first attempt at printing the book, however, was only a short run of around 100 copies. We also made our book available digitally in hopes that enough money would be raised to print even more.

Fast forward to today ...

Of the 100 or so books that did get printed, one found its way onto the internet in the form a young lady reading it out loud. In a very short time this video had over 5 million views, and our collective jaws hit the ground.

So now we are super excited to print Do You Want To Play With My Balls? and get it out to all the people who seem to also love the idea. We have a new printer lined up, a wonderful website, a company name (Bum Bum Books :)) and we're ready to start shipping. The only problem now is getting the money together to print our next batch of books.

That's where you come in! Be the first to pre-order Do You Want To Play With My Balls? and help us make our kind, and slightly demented, dreams come true!! And thank you so much for helping us make this a reality!
