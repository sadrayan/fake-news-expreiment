Study: Doctors Aren't Urging Preteens To Get HPV Vaccine
A new study finds that many doctors are not urging their preteen patients to get the vaccine for HPV (human papillomavirus).

HPV can cause cervical and throat cancers and it's the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States. The vaccine can prevent the transmission and therefore prevent cancers, but the study showed many of these doctors thought that patients' parents would object to the vaccination.

Here & Now's Robin Young speaks with the lead researcher, Dr. Allison Kempe of the University of Colorado.
