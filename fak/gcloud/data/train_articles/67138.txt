Trump, speaking at the groundbreaking of Foxconn's new factory in Mount Pleasant, said Wisconsin “hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952" before he did in 2016.

“And I won Wisconsin. And I like Wisconsin a lot but we won Wisconsin. And Ronald Reagan, remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win,” Trump said.

Trump, while bragging about himself, gets the facts wrong and claims that the only state Reagan didn't win in 1984 was Wisconsin.

Reagan won Wisconsin in both 1980 and 1984.

In 1984, Minnesota was the only state he did not win — Democratic nominee Walter Mondale picked up his home state.

Wisconsin traditionally leans Democratic, but Trump narrowly won the state in 2016.
