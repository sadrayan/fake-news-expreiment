Outagamie County sues over food code inspections
Green Bay - Outagamie County is suing the state in federal court over how its inspectors are interpreting the federal food inspection code.

The county-owned Brewster Village was cited by inspectors from the state Department of Health Services in 2011 and 2012, in part for failing to follow proper hand washing procedures during food preparation.

In the lawsuit, the county said staff members washed their hands nine times when making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And, under the state's interpretation of the rules, staff members would have to wash their hands 28 times. For example, inspectors said staff touched door and drawer handles and didn't wash their hands before touching clean utensils.

County Executive Tom Nelson said the state's interpretation of the rules is "just ridiculous." The state has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
