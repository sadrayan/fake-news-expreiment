Clinton Foundation Facts
In fact, on several occasions, investigative journalists have looked into the Foundation’s actual work – helping people around the world – and come back with positive conclusions.

In 2016, after several days seeing the Clinton Foundation’s work and impact on the ground in rural Tanzania, Politifact reporter Jon Greenberg saw the impact of the Foundation’s work firsthand:

“Because of the foundation’s intervention, the 62-year-old Kipati upped his maize harvest from seven sacks to 20. And Kipati didn’t just boost his harvest, he got a better price at market. The extra money helped send his children to better schools, put a new roof on his house and plant a row of pine trees to sell as lumber a decade from now. About a five-hour walk away is the local grain trader. When the two parties meet, the grain trader has the upper hand. Everyone is selling now, and he knows these guys won’t be hauling the heavy crop back home if the price isn’t right. These are the sort of people the Clinton Foundation’s farming project in Tanzania aims to help. ‘We want to see them grow more on the same land, and for a better price,’ said Seleman Kaoneka, the program manager.”

In 2015, two investigative journalists with the New York Times spent several months examining the Clinton Foundation’s work in Africa, running an in-depth piece that concluded: “In Rwanda, a review of the foundation’s history shows that it has done vital, often pathbreaking work, particularly in health and rural development.”
