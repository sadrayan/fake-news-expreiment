Congress begins meetings on tax reform

Dueling budgets and three days of political schmoozing by President Obama left Congress on Thursday in broad agreement on at least one idea: The tax code is awful and should be overhauled. But actually fixing it faces long odds given deep divisions between the two parties on the role of taxes in the economy.

Members of the Senate Finance Committee from both parties met for the first time Thursday to start laying the groundwork for legislation to overhaul the tax code, as the House Ways and Means Committee engages in a similar bipartisan effort.

And while House Republicans and Senate Democrats this week advanced budget plans that are at sharp odds over most policies, they agreed that the economy would benefit from wiping out tens of billions of dollars a year in existing tax breaks.

Where they differ, however, is over what to do with the savings — and that dispute could snuff out any hope for the grand bargain Obama pursued in separate meetings with each party in both chambers this week.
