Bill would keep school performance grades on 15-point scale
â€” The North Carolina General Assembly is considering a bill that would make permanent the grading scale used to grade the performance of state public schools.

The state has been using a 15-point grading scale to rate schools for several years, but the scale is set to revert back to a 10-point scale at the end of this school year if no action is taken.

House Bill 145 would ensure the current scale remains in place:

A: 100 to 85 percent

B: 84 to 70 percent

C: 69 to 55 percent

D: 54 to 40 percent

F: Anything below 40 percent

Editor's Note: This new scale applies to the grades schools receive based on performance. It would not change the scale used to grade students.
