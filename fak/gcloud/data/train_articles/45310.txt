After asking for two extensions, Jon Ossoff finally released his personal financial disclosure.

Turns out, he was paid at least $5,000 by Al Jazeera – a propaganda network based in Qatar that has been widely accused of funding terrorist organizations.

And what’s more, yesterday he released an ad vowing to fight terrorism. Hypocritical much?

Not only does Ossoff stand by his work with Al Jazeera, he also declined to give the exact number of how much $ he received from them.

What else is he hiding?
