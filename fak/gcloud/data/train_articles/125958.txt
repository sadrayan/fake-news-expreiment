FACT CHECK: Role Model
Well, well, well, we finally have a real answer to Dubya’s antics, follies, farces and mishmash leadership. He’s set the record straight about who he chooses to emulate. For once I think his actions truly follow his words.

Mahalo, President Bush, for clearing this up in an unscripted comment. It all makes sense to me now.

Bush mourned the passing of actor Bob Denver, calling the “Gilligan’s Island” star “a great American and a role model for me personally.” Gilligan managed to foul up an island and six other people’s lives while he’s managed to foul up a nation and millions of lives.

Congratulations, President Bush. I think you have surpassed your role model, little buddy.
