SECTION 5.1.(b) Receipts collected in a fiscal year in excess of the amounts appropriated by this section shall remain unexpended and unencumbered until appropriated by the General Assembly, unless the expenditure of overrealized receipts in the fiscal year in which the receipts were collected is authorized by the State Budget Act.

SECTION 5.1A.(a) Notwithstanding G.S. 143C‑6‑4, State agencies may, with approval of the Director of the Budget, spend funds received from grants awarded subsequent to the enactment of this act for grant awards that are for less than two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000), do not require State matching funds, and will not be used for a capital project.

Funds received from such grants are hereby appropriated and shall be incorporated into the authorized budget of the recipient State agency.

SECTION 5.1A.(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no State agency may accept a grant not anticipated in this act if acceptance of the grant would obligate the State to make future expenditures relating to the program receiving the grant or would otherwise result in a financial obligation as a consequence of accepting the grant funds.

(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a newly qualified nonparticipating manufacturer is to be listed in the North Carolina Tobacco Directory (the Directory), or if the Attorney General reasonably determines that any nonparticipating manufacturer who has filed a certification pursuant to G.S. 66‑291, et seq., poses an elevated risk for noncompliance with this Article, neither such nonparticipating manufacturer nor any of its brand families shall be included in the Directory unless and until such nonparticipating manufacturer, or its United States importer that undertakes joint and several liability for the manufacturer's performance in accordance with G.S. 66‑291, et seq., has posted a bond in accordance with this section.

The bond shall be posted by a corporate surety located within the United States in a form and manner acceptable to the Attorney General, or a cash equivalent posted by the nonparticipating manufacturer, in an amount equal to the greater of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or the greatest amount of escrow the manufacturer in either its current or predecessor form was required to deposit as a result of its highest calendar year's sales in North Carolina or greatest quarterly escrow deposit depending on the manufacturer's required escrow deposit frequency. The bond or its cash equivalent shall be posted at least 10 days in advance of each calendar year or quarter depending on the manufacturer's required escrow deposit frequency. The bond shall be written in favor of North Carolina and such bond or cash equivalent shall be conditioned on the performance by the nonparticipating manufacturer or its United States importer that undertakes joint and several liability for the manufacturer's performance, in accordance with G.S. 66‑294.2, of all of its duties and obligations under this Article during the year in which the certification is filed and the next succeeding calendar year. The bond may be drawn upon by the Attorney General to cover unsatisfied escrow obligations, penalties, and any other liability under the tobacco laws of the State.

Some factors, though not exclusive, which the Attorney General may consider in determining whether any nonparticipating manufacturer or importer poses an elevated risk of noncompliance are (i) the nonparticipating manufacturer or any affiliate thereof or importer has illegally failed to satisfy an escrow obligation with respect to any state in the past; (ii) any state has removed the nonparticipating manufacturer or its brand families or an affiliate or any of the affiliate's brand families from the state's tobacco directory for noncompliance with the state's laws; (iii) any state has pending litigation against, or an unsatisfied judgment against the nonparticipating manufacturer or any affiliate thereof or importer for escrow or penalties related to noncompliance with state escrow laws; (iv) the nonparticipating manufacturer sells its cigarettes or tobacco products directly to consumers via remote or other non‑face‑to‑face means; (v) a state or federal court has determined that the nonparticipating manufacturer or importer has violated any tobacco tax or tobacco control law or engaged in unfair business practice or unfair competition; or (vi) the nonparticipating manufacturer or importer fails to submit or complete any required forms, documents, certifications, or notices, in a timely manner or, to the satisfaction of the Attorney General.

The Attorney General must add a nonparticipating manufacturer and its brand families to the list if it determines all of the following:

(1) The nonparticipating manufacturer manufacturer, as well as any joint and severally liable importer, has submitted an application under G.S. 66‑294, and it is found to be complete and accurate.

STUDY STATE AGENCY USE OF UTILITY‑BASED COMPUTING

SECTION 7.26.(a) The Department of Information Technology (Department) shall study the use of and cost savings associated with the adoption of utility‑based cloud computing services by State agencies. For the purposes of this section, "utility‑based computing" means the process of providing computing service through an on‑demand, pay‑per‑use billing method, metering the offered services. At a minimum, the review conducted by the Department shall:

(1) Evaluate the actual and potential usefulness of commercial cloud computing services by State agencies and whether expedited transition to cloud computing would offer significant savings to State agencies.

(2) Evaluate how giving State agencies the ability to purchase information technology (IT) services in a utility‑based model would result in savings from paying for only the IT services consumed.

(3) Identify the capabilities required to implement utility‑based computing, storage, and applications, including a rate structure.

(4) Include a request for information to determine the capabilities and costs of available services.

SECTION 7.26.(b) On or before April 1, 2016, the State Chief Information Officer shall make a written report to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Information Technology on the results of the Department review of utility‑based computing.

STATE FUNDED IT CONTRACTS
