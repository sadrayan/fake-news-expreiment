Veterans Affairs Secretary Scocos Statement on POW-MIA Recognition Day



MADISON – Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) Secretary Scocos today made the following statement regarding POW-MIA Recognition Day:



“Our nation has made a commitment to those young men and women who swear an oath, put on a uniform, and go into harm’s way – they will never be left behind. That we never leave a fallen or captured comrade on the field of battle or in enemy hands is part of the ethos of our troops, and why days like today are so important. There are still tens of thousands of missing servicemembers from previous and current conflicts that our nation is working to find and repatriate. Today we remember and honor their sacrifice, as well as the sacrifice of the loved ones they left behind, and do our best to bring them home with honor.”
