TEXAS RURAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
PARTNERS

Our policy is to find products and or services which are available to all school districts , but where costs for smaller districts are higher because of the dis-economies of scale. We have also looked for those products and services which are more beneficial to school districts who are small and do not enjoy a large central office staff to assist in a more effective operation of the school district. Below are some partnerships that TREA members will enjoy.

myON-Special pricing for TREA members for this program which provides more than 6,000 enhanced digital books for students, teachers and families in a school community.
