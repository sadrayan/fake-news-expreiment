Michelle Obama, along with daughters Sasha and Malia arrived in Botswana to a rousing welcome as 25 school children dressed in animal hides danced and chanted "Obama Ye-Le-Le." See the pics inside...

FLOTUS, who's been in South Africa since Monday, arrived in Botswana as part of the second leg of a week-long goodwill visit, after flying in from Cape Town. She rocked an orange pantsuit and graphic belt by Tory Burch as she watched the amazing greeting:





The excited school children danced and performed for the First Family shortly after their arrival in Gaborone, Botswana.





Later, 50 school children gathered around the First Lady waving U.S. flags.

The first family will also enjoy a private safari over the weekend.





While there, Mrs. Obama visited an AIDS clinic that services over 4,000 children and their families. And met with president of Botswana, Lt. Gen. Seretse Khama Ian Khama (above). Nice.
