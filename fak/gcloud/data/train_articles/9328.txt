Curbelo named CPAC rising star
State Rep. Jose Felix Diaz wasn't the only Miami-Dade politician honored at this weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference.

The 10 rising conservative stars under 40 also included Miami-Dade School Board member and congressional candidate Carlos Curbelo.

Speaking to attendees Saturday, Curbelo called Obamacare "the most recent example of the left's misguided policies that close the path of upward social mobility for those that have the desire to grow and achieve more for themselves and their families."

"Before they used to trap people in welfare," he said. "Today, they trap people in Obamacare. This healthcare law is the perfect storm to suppress those that are most in need of jobs and opportunities in this country."

Curbelo also used the platform to criticize Democratic education policies.

"Their chief concern is: Are the adults satisfied?" he said.

Curbelo is running against Democratic Rep. Joe Garcia in Florida's 26th congressional district.
