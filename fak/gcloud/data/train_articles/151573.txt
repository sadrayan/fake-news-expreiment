XXXTentacion Is Mourned by Thousands at a Memorial in Florida
SUNRISE, Fla. — Hordes of eager young fans burst into spontaneous songs of grief and celebration on Wednesday afternoon at an arena here in South Florida, where they had gathered to honor the life of the controversial 20-year-old rapper and singer XXXTentacion, who was shot and killed in an apparent robbery last week.

The public memorial, organized by the rapper’s family, included an open-coffin viewing onstage at the BB&T Center — capacity 20,000 — in Sunrise, Fla., about 25 miles from where XXXTentacion (born Jahseh Onfroy) was killed in his BMW sports car on June 18, halting what had been a meteoric 18-month rise and raising knotty questions about his legacy.

“He considered you all family, and I wanted to do something special for you all,” Cleopatra Bernard, the rapper’s mother, wrote on Instagram about the service.
