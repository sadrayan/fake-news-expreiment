Fyre Festival is Sketchy : fyrefestival
If you look at just about anything they claim on the website you'd see that nothing adds up. -It's not on a private island -Nothing has really been built yet -You won't fly in on a private plane -Their accommodations are hugely inflated in price -Some of their artists are complete nobodies and others have booked gigs in other locations -None of the artists are promoting this event

Not saying its a scam but it doesn't sound completely legit either. Read more about it here to make up your own mind http://exuma.online/entertainment/fyre-festival-scam-or-legit/
