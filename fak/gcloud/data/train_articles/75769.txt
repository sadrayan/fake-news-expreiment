Turnover common at e-schools
Ohio's largest online charter school averaged 14,600 students last school year, but almost 23,000 students were enrolled over the course of the year. Thousands of those students enrolled for just a few weeks or months in the Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow.

Ohio�s largest online charter school averaged 14,600 students last school year, but almost 23,000 students were enrolled over the course of the year.

Thousands of those students enrolled for just a few weeks or months in the Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow.

The large-scale turnover isn�t unique to ECOT: With the exception of schools designed for dropouts, no schools churn through students like Ohio�s online charters. At many of Ohio�s charter e-schools, more than 40 percent of students leave before they�ve completed a full academic year.

Churn, or student mobility, has long been �generally considered a negative thing� facing education, said Aaron Churchill, research director for the Thomas B. Fordham Institute in Columbus. It can disrupt students� learning routines and is generally associated with low achievement, he said.

Mobility issues in the past were caused mainly by families moving to a new home. But the cause of online mobility isn�t so simple.

It�s probably a mix of dissatisfaction with their current school, the convenience of online schools, the sheer number of school options that students have today, online advertising, and the fact that �the cost to make that transfer from a kid�s perspective or a family�s perspective is essentially zero, so why not give it a shot?� Churchill said. �It�s sort of the brave new world, the online education sphere.�

At ECOT, which is a K-12 school that draws students from almost every school district in Ohio, students stayed an average of less than two-thirds of the last school year before leaving. In any given month last year, up to 2,200 students enrolled and as many as 1,500 withdrew.

Other online schools have significantly higher rates of turnover. At the Reynoldsburg-based Virtual Community School of Ohio last school year, about 67 percent of students were enrolled less than one school year.

Those rates are much higher than in most traditional school districts. In Columbus and Cleveland schools, the percentages of students who aren�t enrolled the whole year are about 17 and 18 percent, respectively.

The Ohio Department of Education is trying to better understand why so many students are mobile in all schools, including e-schools. State report cards for this school year will track mobility more closely than they have in other years.

The state hopes to learn �the degree to which it�s a choice and the degree to which it�s a compelled situation,� said Eben Dowell, who works in policy at the department.

One of the biggest drivers of e-school turnover is that students need a short-term school option, said Ryan Crawford, a spokesman for ECOT. Students might have succeeded in the online school but needed ECOT only for a little while.

�That factors a fair amount � people needing a short-term situation for a bullying situation, parents splitting, or they have a child. There are a lot of students out there that need something for that amount of time,� Crawford said. �They have instability for that moment that doesn�t lend itself to a traditional school and how it�s structured.�

To gain insight into the short-term nature of some virtual schools, The Dispatch examined Ohio Department of Education enrollment and withdrawal data for the 23,000 students who attended ECOT for any period last school year. The one-year snapshot showed:

� Students who enrolled at ECOT last school year and withdrew during the school year stayed, on average, about three months.

� Most students withdrew because they moved to another school or were withdrawn for being truant.

� About 5,100 students both enrolled and withdrew last school year.

� Despite that ECOT is a program for kindergarten through 12th-grade, the median start date of all the students who attended last year was in mid-September 2013. That means that half of the students started after the school year had already begun. ECOT was founded in 2000. It was designed to be a flexible school option, though not necessarily with short-term students in mind. That has evolved over time to meet students� demands, Crawford said.

Both Katie Bower and Payton Payne intended to stay when they joined ECOT. But after they enrolled in 2013, they left after about half a school year. They said they found classes difficult and quickly fell behind.

Bower was a sophomore at Hamilton Township High School when she heard about ECOT through friends. �It�s all you, pretty much � however you want to do it, whenever you want to do it,� said Bower, now 17, who lives just north of Rickenbacker International Airport. �You don�t really have a teacher standing over your shoulder telling you what to do, so I fell behind really fast.

�I think a lot of people are thinking it�s the easy way out. Honestly, that�s what I thought. But it really wasn�t.�

Within several months, she quit logging on to her classes. ECOT filed truancy charges against her, and as part of the resolution to the case, she returned to a Hamilton district program, Hamilton Alternative Academy. She is doing well in the blended-learning program, which combines traditional classroom instruction with online courses.

She is on course to graduate from high school with her class this summer, she said.

Payton Payne, 22, joined ECOT in 2013 after leaving Columbus City Schools� Eastmoor Academy in her sophomore year. ECOT delivered a new computer to her South Side home and set it up. The hardware and software worked well. But like Bower, Payne said she quickly fell behind on her assignments and couldn�t catch up.

�I needed a little bit more help because I had been out of school for so long,� Payne said.

She would email her questions to teachers; sometimes the answers would come at the end of the day or the next morning. The lag time slowed progress.

�I did like it,� Payne said. �It wasn�t a bad program. ...You just have to really be focused on your education.�

Crawford said many students are successful with ECOT for the long term. A recent graduate had attended since kindergarten.

And regardless of how long students are enrolled, the school works to help them keep moving forward in their education, he said. �Our hope, if we were a short-term stay for them, is that we gave the best situation we could.�
