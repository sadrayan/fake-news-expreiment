Adam McKay has been busy writing, directing and promoting Oscar-nominated The Big Short of late, and if he gets his way, he’ll also be writing Ant-Man and the Wasp. But when we recently caught up with McKay, we asked about the potential for a sequel to one of his older movies – namely Step Brothers.

“You know, never say never” was his response. “Not right now, but man oh man, if we had an idea, and the funny thing is the older Will [Ferrell] and [John C.] Reilly get, the funnier idea gets. So is it possible when they’re like 57/58-years old, we do a Step Brothers sequel? Maybe.

“I certainly love that movie. I think that movie makes me laugh the hardest of anything we’ve done. Although I love all the movies we’ve done, but that’s the one that really makes me laugh… There’s an aggressiveness to it that I really like. It’s just unflinching and insane. It’s also my favourite ending of any movie that we’ve ever done. That opera song at the end is kind of beautiful but unhinged and I just love that ending.”

We then pitched McKay the concept of a sequel taking place in an old folk’s home – his response? “We actually were kicking around that as one of the ideas.”
