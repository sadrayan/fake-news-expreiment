El Chapo tells ISIS his men will destroy them
Update: It looks like ISIS doesn’t have to worry about El Chapo just yet. News first reported on Cartelblog.com has turned out to be a hoax.

The world’s most wanted drug lord has declared war on the Islamic State, promising the terror group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, that his narcotics cartel will wipe them off the planet.

“My men will destroy you,”’ El Chapo huffs to the ISIS leader in an encrypted email that was leaked to a cartel-linked blogger in Mexico.

News of the threat, purportedly issued from wherever El Chapo is hiding since busting out of a Mexican prison in July, was first reported in the US by cartelblog.com.

El Chapo — real name Joaquin Guzman, leader of the Sinaloa Cartel — is not incensed at ISIS being a vile, bloodthirsty death cult. Instead, the renegade drug lord is angry that ISIS destroyed one of his drug shipments somewhere in the Middle East.

“You [ISIS] are not soldiers,” El Chapo huffs in the leaked email, according to cartelblog.com.

“You are nothing but lowly p-ssies. Your god cannot save you from the true terror that my men will levy at you if you continue to impact my operation.”

The evil international overlord trash talk continues:

“My men will destroy you. The world is not yours to dictate. I pity the next son of a wh-re that tries to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa Cartel. I will have their heart and tongue torn from them.”

The Sinaloa Cartel has been trying to make inroads in the Middle East, which has a burgeoning party drug scene enjoyed by oil-rich royals and executives, the blog notes.

“As drugs are not a part of the organizational ideology for a Muslim state, ISIS fighters have been destroying shipments of drugs from the cartels,” the blog says.
