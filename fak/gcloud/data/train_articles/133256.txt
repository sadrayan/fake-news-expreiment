Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal
Legal dispute

Daniels (2010) and Trump (2011)

The Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal is a political scandal involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels, Donald Trump, and Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The scandal first broke in January 2018, when The Wall Street Journal revealed that shortly before the 2016 United States presidential election, Daniels had been paid $130,000 for signing a nondisclosure agreement about an affair she had with Trump in 2006.

In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges, including a campaign finance violation for the Daniels payment. He stated under oath that he had paid her "in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office." Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani stated that Trump had personally reimbursed Cohen in 2017, and that no campaign money was involved. Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison for various charges.

Daniels filed three lawsuits against Trump and Cohen, arguing that the nondisclosure agreement was invalid, that she had been defamed, and that Cohen had colluded with her previous attorney Michael Avenatti against her interests when negotiating the payment. The first of these was dismissed; the second was dismissed and as of May 2019 is the subject of an appeal; and the third was settled in May 2019.[1] The dispute gained significant media coverage and drew legal attention to Cohen's involvement in the matter.

Allegation and non-disclosure agreement [ edit ]

The first reports of an alleged 2006 affair between Trump and Daniels (for which Daniels took a polygraph test) were published in October 2011 by the blog The Dirty and the magazine Life & Style.[2][3] Around the same time, Daniels talked about the alleged affair with the gossip magazine In Touch Weekly, which chose not to publish the interview after Cohen threatened to sue the magazine.[4] On January 12, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in October 2016, a month before the presidential election, to stop her discussing the alleged affair.[5][6]

On behalf of his client Donald Trump, on January 14 Cohen denied the existence of the affair,[7] but on February 13 he acknowledged that he paid Daniels $130,000.

On March 6, 2018, Daniels filed a lawsuit against Trump, claiming that the nondisclosure agreement she had signed about the alleged affair was invalid because Trump had never personally signed it, despite acknowledging that she accepted the payment made in consideration for her silence in the matter.[8][9] The suit also alleged that Trump's attorney was trying to intimidate Daniels and "scare her into not talking". On the next day, Cohen initiated an ex parte arbitration process that resulted in an order barring Daniels from disclosing "confidential information" related to the nondisclosure agreement. The order itself, which Daniels's lawyers called "bogus," was supposed to remain confidential.[10]

In an interview with 60 Minutes that was aired March 25, 2018, Daniels said that she and Trump had sex once. She also said that in 2011 she was threatened in front of her infant daughter after a fitness class in Las Vegas. The threat pressured her to later sign a nondisclosure agreement.[8][9]

On April 9, 2018, FBI agents raided Cohen's office and seized emails, tax documents, and business records relating to several matters, including the payment to Daniels.[11]

Status of Cohen's payment [ edit ]

Daniels' lawyer said that the $130,000 payment to her was a cover-up, while others also raised questions about whether the payment was in violation of federal campaign finance laws, which may be the case if campaign funds were used.[12] The payment was reported on January 12, 2018, by the Wall Street Journal that revealed that Daniels was paid $130,000 pursuant to the nondisclosure agreement via a Delaware limited liability company called Essential Consultants created by Cohen for the purpose.[13][14][15] On January 22, the political watchdog group Common Cause filed a complaint calling on the Federal Election Commission and U.S. Department of Justice to investigate if the reported payout violated campaign finance rules, saying the alleged payment amounted to an in-kind donation to Trump's presidential campaign that should have been publicly disclosed in its official reports.[16][17][18]

In response, on February 13, Cohen told The New York Times that the $130,000 was paid to Daniels from his own pocket, that it was not a campaign contribution, and that he was not reimbursed for making it by either the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign.[19] The Washington Post later noted that, by stating that he used his own money to "facilitate" the payment, Cohen was not ruling out the possibility that Trump, as an individual, reimbursed Cohen for the payment.[20] On March 13, Cohen said that he had transferred funds from his home equity line of credit to Essential Consultants and from the company to Daniels' attorney.[21]

On April 5, 2018, Trump was on Air Force One when he claimed that he had no knowledge of Cohen’s payment to Daniels.[22] On April 26, however, Trump admitted for the first time that Cohen represented him in "the Stormy Daniels deal".[23] On May 2, Trump's new personal attorney Rudy Giuliani told Sean Hannity of Fox News that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payment, stating Trump "didn’t know about the specifics of it but he did know about the general arrangement, that Michael [Cohen] would take care of things like this."[22] On the next day Trump tweeted that it was Cohen who entered into the nondisclosure agreement, and wrote Cohen was reimbursed for the $130,000 through monthly $35,000 retainer payments to him and wrote that "Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll [sic] in this transaction."[24] On May 4, Trump contradicted Giuliani's statements, saying that Giuliani "wasn't familiar with everything" and that "He started yesterday. He'll get his facts straight."[25] Giuliani later released a statement saying "the payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President's family."[26]

On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges, including a campaign finance violation, for his role in the payment. He implicated Trump, saying that he was acting "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office."[27] Trump said that he only knew about the payments "later on," adding that the payments "didn't come out of the campaign, they came from me."[28] On August 22, The New York Times reported that Cohen's court documents revealed that two senior Trump Organization executives were also involved in the hush money payments. The report also said that Cohen “coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls” about the payments.[29]

On December 13, Trump denied directing Cohen to make hush payments.[30]

Legal issues [ edit ]

The Common Cause complaints with the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission claim that Trump’s campaign violated campaign laws by not publicly disclosing the $130,000 payment to the Federal Election Commission.[16] There are also concerns about where the funds originated, and whether they are an illegal or undisclosed in-kind contribution to the campaign. However, several members of Trump's legal team have denied the payment was related to the campaign and claimed it was instead aimed at saving Trump's marriage.[31] Questions have also been raised about how the payment was classified for tax purposes, and if there is a possibility of tax-based charges or fees relating to the payment.[32]

Daniels filed a civil suit on March 6, 2018,[33] in an attempt to nullify the nondisclosure agreement between her and Trump. The hearing was set for July but has since been pushed back by U.S. District Judge James Otero citing the possible indictment of Cohen in the ongoing criminal probe by federal prosecutors.[34][needs update][35]

Cohen could also face discipline from the State Bar of New York under the New York Rules of Professional Conduct, which prohibits lawyers making loans to clients.[36]

A well established principle of contract law is the offer and acceptance of "consideration" or something of value, in exchange for a promise to do something (or not do something in the case of a non-disclosure agreement). Legal experts argue that the $130,000 payment being accepted by one party is valid consideration and enforceable regardless of the unsigned state of the Daniels non-disclosure agreement, but other elements in the Daniels agreement make predicting the outcome difficult. Issues such as the use of pseudonyms and the disclosure exception for law enforcement investigations may favor Daniels's position.[37]

On August 21, 2018, Cohen pled guilty to eight charges, including tax fraud, bank fraud, and campaign finance violations, for his role in the payment, and implicated Trump.[27] In response, Trump said that he only knew about the payments "later on".

The Wall Street Journal reported on November 9, 2018, that federal prosecutors have evidence of Trump’s "central role" in payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal that violated campaign-finance laws.[38][39]

In a December 7, 2018, sentencing memorandum for Cohen, federal prosecutors implicated Trump in directing Cohen to commit the campaign finance law felonies for which Cohen had pleaded guilty. Shortly after the memorandum court filing, Trump tweeted, “Totally clears the president. Thank you!”[40] Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison.[41]

On December 13, 2018, NBC News reported that Trump was present in an August 2015 meeting with Cohen and David Pecker when they discussed how American Media could help counter negative stories about Trump's relationships with women, confirming previous reporting by The Wall Street Journal.[42][43]

As of May 2019 the Southern District of New York is investigating the possible role of Trump and others regarding concealment of hush money payments.[44]

CNN also reported that "Falzone had even seen emails about a settlement" between Daniels and Trump. [49] The next day, In Touch Weekly published excerpts of a 2011 interview of Daniels alleging a 2006 extramarital affair with Trump. The magazine described her account as being supported by a polygraph and corroborated with both her friend and her ex-husband. [50] Cohen alleged that claims made in that interview were untrue and had previously been published in October 24, 2011, in Life & Style magazine. However, The Daily Beast described the interviews as "hardly identical", noting that Daniels had declined to comment to Life & Style , while the In Touch Weekly interview had direct quotes from Daniels.

February 2018 [ edit ]

February 13, 2018: Cohen publicly acknowledged paying Daniels $130,000 and said the payment was made with his own funds.

April 2018 [ edit ]

April 5, 2018: On Air Force One, Trump said he did not know about the $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels. He also said he was not aware of why Cohen had made the payment or where he got the money. [75]

April 9, 2018: FBI agents raid Cohen's office and seized emails, tax documents, and business records relating to several matters, including payments to Daniels. The raid was conducted on behalf of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and is seen as likely to have resulted from information uncovered from Mueller's investigation. [11] Following the raid, Daniels was reportedly cooperating with federal investigators. [76]

Following the raid, Daniels was reportedly cooperating with federal investigators. April 26, 2018: In an interview on Fox & Friends , Trump said Cohen "would represent me and represent me on some things. He represents me like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal, he represented me."

[77]

April 30, 2018: Daniels's lawyer Michael Avenatti, tweeted about a lawsuit filed against Trump, in which Daniels is currently suing Trump for his "recent irresponsible and defamatory statements" made against Daniels. These statements can be seen in a tweet mocking the released police sketch of the man Daniels claims told her to drop her allegations of the affair, and have been claimed to be defamatory as they accuse Daniels of falsely accusing a person of threatening her.[78]

May 2018 [ edit ]

May 2, 2018: Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said on Fox News that "the president repaid" Cohen the $130,000 that Cohen had paid to Daniels. Giuliani also said that Trump "did know the general arrangement" of Cohen's payment, but not "the specifics". This appeared to contradict Trump's claim of April 5 that he had no knowledge of the payment. [79] [80]

May 3, 2018: Trump tweeted that Cohen had entered into a nondisclosure agreement with Daniels. In the tweets, Trump wrote Cohen was reimbursed for the $130,000 through monthly $35,000 retainer payments to him and wrote that "Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll [sic] in this transaction." [24]

May 4, 2018: Trump contradicted Giuliani's statements, saying that Giuliani "wasn't familiar with everything" and that "He started yesterday. He'll get his facts straight."

May 24, 2018: Daniels's lawyer Avenatti filed a motion in federal court to have a judge allow Daniels's lawsuit to move forward, instead of continuing the 90-day hold that been placed last month.[89] Avenatti cited recent statements by Trump and Giuliani, that potentially contradict Cohen's argument for the stay, with the recent disclosure of the Settlement Agreement and the "new facts call into question whether Mr. Cohen's Fifth Amendment rights..." in relation to the case are "as compelling as previously argued..."[90]

June 2018 [ edit ]

June 6, 2018: Daniels sued both Michael Cohen and her own former lawyer, Keith M. Davidson, accusing Cohen of encouraging Davidson to violate her attorney-client privilege. [91] The lawsuit also alleges Trump was aware of the efforts for Daniels to deny the affair on media interviews. [92]

June 6, 2018: Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, verbally attacked Daniels, saying: "The business you were in entitles you to no degree of giving your credibility any weight … Explain to me how she could be damaged … If you're going to sell your body for money, you just don't have a reputation … a woman who sells her body for sexual exploitation I don't respect." [93] [94] [95]

Daniels's May 24 motion was denied. Avenatti said he would file an appeal shortly.[96]

July 2018 [ edit ]

July 12, 2018: Daniels was arrested in Columbus, Ohio by undercover vice cops in a sting operation.[97] Officers alleged that Daniels "touched" three undercover officers in the club where she was performing, which is against Ohio law.[98] While Daniels was booked into the county jail, two other female adult entertainers who were arrested at the club for the same alleged violations were given summonses to appear in court and did not have their mugshots taken, unlike Daniels.[99] Daniels retained Columbus defense lawyer Chase Mallory,[100] who worked with prosecutors to dismiss the charges less than 12 hours later, citing that the law did not apply to out-of-town performers.[101] It was later reported that the lead detective on the vice squad in charge of the arrest was a supporter of Donald Trump.[102]

August 2018 [ edit ]

August 21, 2018: Cohen officially surrendered to the FBI. [103] That afternoon, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges: five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution at the request of a candidate or campaign. [104] [105] [106] The plea deal reportedly does not include any agreement to cooperate with investigators. [107] However, the plea does include jail time and a substantial monetary fine. [27] In his plea, Cohen implicated Trump, but did not identify him by name. [27] No charges had been filed in connection with the Stormy Daniels-Trump scandal prior to Cohen's guilty plea. [108] Following the plea, Daniels stated that she felt "vindicated." [109]
