Update - Friday, 12/9/2016

This is the list of counties in WI that are still counting as of Friday Morning 12/9/2016.

(We have tried to validate this list based on conversations with County Clerks by phone or posting on website over the week as they indicated being closed. We then called the remaining counties. Here is what is open as of now).

1. Dane: As of 10:30 "May go through weekend", clerk's office.

2. Oconto: As of 10:30 "Probably today (12/9)" , clerk's office.

3. Outagamie: As of 10:30 "70% counted, perhaps 12/10", clerk's office.

4. Waukesha: As of 10:30 "Not finished, unsure of status", Greg Banks.
