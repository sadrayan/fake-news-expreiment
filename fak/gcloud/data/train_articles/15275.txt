Texas moved forward with a long-planned rate adjustment to achieve savings directed by the Texas Legislature. The modification took effect Dec. 15 for providers for fee-for-service rates.

Rider 50 specifically directed HHSC to:

• Reform reimbursement methodology to be in line with industry standards, policies, and utilization for acute care therapy services while considering stakeholder input and access to care.

• In each fiscal year, achieve at least $50 million GR savings through rate reductions, and $25 million GR savings may be achieved through various medical policy initiatives, including but not limited to those laid out in Rider 50 (c). If that level of savings cannot be achieved through policy changes, the amount of unrealized savings should be achieved through additional rate reductions in fiscal year 2017

HB 1 was the agreed upon budget that included Rider 50. Here is a link to where you can find the record votes: http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill=HB1
