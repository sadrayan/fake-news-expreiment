Missouri CIT Council
For more information about creating a CIT Council in your area, please contact:

The Missouri Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Council is a network of representatives from each established local council across the state, Community Mental Health Liaisons (CMHLs), state agencies and associations, and those with lived experience. The Council works to address any structural barriers at the state level, and advocates for policy and legislatives changes that may be necessary to support health and wellness. The Council also provides direction and support on the CIT curriculum, training expansion, and implementation of the program.
