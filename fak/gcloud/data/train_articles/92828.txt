Rubio says he'd use federal law to crack down on marijuana
Marco Rubio says as president he would enforce federal law against states that have legalized marijuana.

“Absolutely,” he said Sunday on Meet the Press. “I believe the federal government needs to enforce federal law.” (That part of the interview was short so Rubio's ideas on how far to go are not clear; he's also championed states' rights on various issues.)

But the Florida Republican also said he is open to medical marijuana, provided it goes through the FDA approval process and has true medicinal benefits. “I’m not in favor of legalizing marijuana. I’m not. I never have been.”

The question, posed to Rubio from Facebook, marked the second time recently that Rubio has been asked about marijuana. During a forum in New Hampshire, he gave a more expansive response, insisting he would not favor anything used “as a way to get high.”

“This country is already paying a significant price for illegal use of drugs and even alcohol."

Rubio has declined to say whether he used marijuana in his earlier years.
