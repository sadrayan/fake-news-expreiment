Why are Beauty and The Beast VHS tapes selling for $500? : OutOfTheLoop
I just found a VHS copy of Beauty and the Beast and my coworker told me that they are selling for $500 on ebay. I looked it up and yes- there are several listings for used VHS tapes in the $300-$500 range.

Example: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rare-black-diamond-Beauty-and-the-Beast-VHS-1992-/181825225046?hash=item2a55a0c156

But then I also see the same tape selling for 99cents.

What is going on? Are the $500 VHS' actually a front for some illicit activity? I can't understand it and want to know if I could sell this tape i found for more then the $2 i think it's worth.
