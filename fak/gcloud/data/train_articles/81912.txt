Who is Kirsten Gillibrand? New York's junior senator takes on Trump
In the House, Gillibrand was a member of the so-called Blue Dog Democrats, a coalition of moderate to conservative Democrats. She opposed strict gun control, famously stating that she and her husband kept two rifles under their bed, and voted against policies that were seen as offering any sort of “amnesty” for immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally.
