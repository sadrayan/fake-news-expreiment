Va. bill to tighten rules for abortion clinics advances
RICHMOND

A bill to regulate abortion clinics in a similar manner as hospitals was passed by a House committee Thursday morning, lining up the legislation for a vote by the full House.

The bill, HB1428, would place Virginia's 21 abortion clinics under the eye of the state Department of Health. Supporters of the bill want to see the clinics subject to state inspection. Opponents say there is little evidence that any problems exist.

In Virginia, abortion clinics are categorized as outpatient facilities - similar to medical and dentistry offices and centers for plastic surgery, midwifery and endoscopy. Those facilities are staffed by licensed medical professionals.

Licensing by the state Health Department is required for outpatient surgical centers and hospitals. In Virginia, abortions beyond the initial trimester of pregnancy must be performed in a hospital setting.

Similar legislation has made the rounds in years past but is usually rejected in the Senate.
