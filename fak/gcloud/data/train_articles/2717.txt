Congressman Paul Broun, M.D.
A Commonsense Alternative to Obamacare



Five years ago, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law, promising increased access to health care for all Americans. But since then, we’ve seen nothing but increases in health care costs, higher taxes on small businesses, piecemeal delays, and warnings that Americans may not be able to keep their current insurance coverage, after all.

It’s clear that this law is not the solution that Americans need. Instead of more government control and fewer choices, we must empower patients to make their own health care decisions, whether related to treatment or payment. That is why I have introduced H.R. 2900, the Patient OPTION Act, which would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and replace it with market-based reform policies, many of which have enjoyed bipartisan support. My OPTION Act would:

· Fully repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;

· Provide 100% deductibility for all health care expenses, including health insurance;

· Increase contribution limits and add patient-friendly reforms to Health Savings Accounts;

· Move Medicare to a flexible, sustainable premium assistance program;

· Allow consumers to purchase health insurance across state lines;

· Make it easier for groups to establish Association Health Plans, which would allow small businesses, professional organizations, and community groups to band together for the purposes of negotiating lower health insurance costs;

· Create new tax incentives for physicians and clinics to provide care to indigent patients; and

· Move Medicaid and CHIP to a block grant program, allowing states to have full control over how they serve low-income families.

My OPTION Act would lower the cost of health care for everybody while stopping government’s overreach into the doctor’s office.
