BROWN: NEW HAMPSHIRE FAMILIES NEED MORE AFFORDABLE ENERGY
Brown Unrolls Energy Policy To Increase Supply, Decrease Costs

MANCHESTER – Today, Scott Brown introduced an all of the above energy policy, outlining an approach to increase supply and reduce costs for New Hampshire families.

“Every penny a working mom saves at the gas pump or in a home heating bill is a penny that she can use to build a better life for her children. Affordable energy is a key building block for New Hampshire families and small businesses,” said Brown. “That’s why I oppose Senator Shaheen’s new national energy tax that will drive up prices at the pump and kill jobs.”

His plan focuses on a true “all of the above,” energy approach for New Hampshire, as well as increasing domestic production, reining in the EPA’s regulatory authority, encouraging energy efficiency, and helping low income families and seniors stay warm.

Brown will also oppose Senator Shaheen’s national energy tax that she voted for in the Senate in 2013. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, this tax could eliminate up to 10,000 jobs, increase the cost of electricity, natural gas, and increase prices at the pump by as much as 20 cents per gallon.

Today, Brown will kick-off the “Making Energy Affordable” tour with a stop at the Waterhouse Country Store, a gas station in Windham, to discuss the negative impacts of high gas prices with local motorists.
