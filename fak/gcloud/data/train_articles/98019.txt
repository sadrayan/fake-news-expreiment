PM believes worst over for economy
OTTAWA (Sep 16, 2008)

Prime Minister Stephen Harper sought to reassure voters that the worst is over for the economy after a roiling financial crisis south of the border panicked investors around the world, including Canada.

"My own belief is if we were going to have some kind of crash or recession, we probably would have had it by now, a year into the (financial) crisis," said Harper, who once taught economics.

The crisis atmosphere that followed the collapse of one large U.S. investment house, and takeover of another, served to elevate fears about an impending economic slump in Canada. It also thrust to the forefront the question of which party can be most trusted to deal with the crisis.

Harper maintained the deteriorating economic conditions were no reason for "doom and gloom."

While the Canadian economy will continue to creep along at a slow pace, "I think we'll manage that without bloodshed," he said.

Liberal Leader Stephane Dion delivered a stinging rebuke of the Conservative record, while campaigning in St. John's, N.L.

"Stephen Harper has allowed what was a booming economy to hit a brick wall," Dion charged.

"Stephen Harper governs for the next day, the next poll. He wants to buy your vote with gimmicks for the next election."

Dion accused Harper of doing little to prepare Canada for the downturn -- something the Tories dispute, citing tax cuts introduced last fall -- nothing to improve productivity, and of overspending to the point of taking the government to the verge of the first deficit in over a decade.
