Robert Silverman

Professor of Urban and Regional Planning University at Buffalo School of Architecture and Planning

AREAS OF EXPERTISE:

Robert Silverman studies community development and inequity in urban communities.

He is co-leading a two-year study to make recommendations about where the government should place affordable housing in 10 of the fastest-shrinking U.S. cities, including Buffalo, Detroit and New Orleans.

Silverman's work challenges the notion that quality, affordable housing is readily available in struggling cities. He advocates locating low-income families in transit-accessible neighborhoods where schools, jobs, health care and cultural resources are all within reach, making it easier for those families to succeed.

Silverman's affordable housing research is funded by the the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and his past findings have appeared in the Journal of Urban Affairs and been presented at conferences in the U.S. and abroad.
