Quoted By:

I am a person that doesn't fall into any of /pol/'s nicely organized categories for people. I'm white with black hair and brown eyes. I have an Irish and Spanish heritage but have been claimed by everyone from Iranians to Armenians to Native and South Americans. I'm pretty good looking and have never had a hard time getting women ever, but I'm also an obsessive /pol/ browsing autist with a fiance.A few years ago I banged a girl from South Korea. It was amazing. I fucking highly recommend it.
