It is based upon the actual size of the equipment being requested, dates being requested and destination being requested. There are many factors that establish a rate. If an area is low on 10 foot trucks and another area has lots of 10 foot trucks - the rate going from the area with lots of trucks to an area that needs trucks, could result in a considerably lower rate but that is not always the specific reason for rates being established. Again, dates can determine a rate for instance spring break, holiday weekends, a natural disaster or the end of the month could result in higher rates versus moving a Sun - Thursday.

Thank you -

Sincerely,

Is the rate different in the routes I was checking because there are not enough trucks to rent in SF?
