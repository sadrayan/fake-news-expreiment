Ambassador From Mars Receives 181,634 Spam Emails - Says "Earthlings Are Not Ready" and Takes First Available Saucer Back Home
Somewhere in America - On a secret mission from Mars, Ambassador Husmaphilpi arrived here last week to offer our world their most valuable commodity, The Reversable Anorak, in exchange for a two years supply of Golden Grahams (which at this time they do not have the license to produce).

Says Ambassador Husmaphilpi, "All I did was post my email address on one of your Internet Notice Boards with the official Martian greeting (ie, Take Me To Your Leader). Well, not only did I NOT get a reply from your President, instead I received 181,634 spam emails asking me for my bank and credit card details. I knew immediately that this was suspicious, because that's what my wife used to do whilst I was at work. Anyway, now she's doing 15 to 20......it was a total shock ..... although it saved me a fortune in divorce costs .... but I still love her..... (contd on page 99, problems page)

So, back to the story.....Mr Elwin Bagaaaaaaha, from the planet Saturn who would give his address only as "Hanger 47 somewhere in Nevada" was not amused at this snub to a fellow alien and said the Ambassador should have gone to dotWORLDS (http://www.dotworlds.net) as they alone could have prevented this travesty.

Mr Bagaaaaaaha, (who arrived here by starship in the year 1743) is one of a growing band of Earth residents using dotWORLDS domain names unspammable email addresses. With over 26 million .com domain names currently registered, many to speculators, he found relevant and memorable names were almost impossible to find. As a highly intelligent being, he realised that dotWORLDS has now released a very large range of potential domain names to the Internet to provide unlimited possibilities for all those who want personalization and easy-to-remember options.

Unfortunately however, back on Mars, news of the Ambassador's treatment on Earth was not being taken well (Mars is not a place you want to be anywhere near when something like this happens). To try and quell the growing unrest and rioting in Slemelvoster (the capital of Mars), Mr Bagaaaaaaha immediately presented Ambassador Husmaphilpi with a signed picture of Jessica Simpson and his very own dotWORLDS email address "edward @ambassador.mars".

Now, edward @ambassador.mars can email president @the.whitehouse, and ask him about Breakfast Cereal Technology. He may not get the leader of America (he might only get a specialist monthly magazine), but there is no way Ambassador Edward Husmaphilpi is ever going get any more spam emails.

So, Earthlings, get with the programme and you could be responsible for peace in the universe and the first ever Trade Agreement between the Earth and Mars. Go to http://www.dotworlds.net today, join the growing band of converts and get there FIRST!
