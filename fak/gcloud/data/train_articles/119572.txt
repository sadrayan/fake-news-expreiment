Britain First Posts 'Muslim Auction Of Women In London' And Get It Very Badly Wrong
Britain First have posted a shocking video of Muslim women being auctioned off in the streets of London.

It is in fact a video of a mock 'Islamic State sex slave market' staged by Kurdish activists in 2014.

The group Compassion 4 Kurdistan were responsible for the stunt which saw a man declare: "We have four women for you here today and we are here to sell them courtesy of the Islamic State."

Actual facts didn't stop Britain First's supporters showing their utter disgust with their perceived state of the capital.
