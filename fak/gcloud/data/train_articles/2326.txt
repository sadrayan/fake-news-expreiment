Crist Signs Concealed Weapons Bill – Central Florida Political Pulse – Orlando Sentinel
As expected and without comment, Gov. Charlie Crist signed into law Tuesday legislation that allows 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to carry their guns to work — as long as they keep them locked in their cars.

The measure caused a rift within the Florida Republican Party’s base — setting the National Rifle Association and ardent gun enthusiasts against a host of state business organizations, which opposed the bill.

But Crist wasted no time in signing the measure (CS/HB 503), which won final passage last week in the Florida Senate.

At the time, Crist said, "The Second Amendment is very important. I understand there are competing interests; there always are in this process. But people being protected is important to me."
