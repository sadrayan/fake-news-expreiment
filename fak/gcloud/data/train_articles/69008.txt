Governor Scott Walker Releases Statement on Senate’s Approval of Blueprint For Prosperity
Madison – Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement after the Wisconsin State Senate approved more than $500 million in property and income tax cuts and $35 million for worker training programs:

The hardworking taxpayers of Wisconsin know how to spend their money better than politicians in Madison do, so I thank members of the Senate for helping us return the state’s surplus to the people who earned it.

Once our Blueprint for Prosperity is signed into law, we will have delivered $2 billion in much-needed tax relief for the people of Wisconsin and more than $135 million for worker training programs. This is in stark contrast to the failed policies of the past that saddled our state with double-digit tax increases, billion dollar budget deficits, and major job loss.

The facts show our historic reforms are working, and our state is in much better financial and economic shape than it was just four years ago. Instead of budget deficits, Wisconsin is producing budget surpluses. Instead of massive tax hikes on struggling families, we’re delivering significant property and income tax relief to help the middle class get ahead. Instead of devastating job loss, we’ve helped the private sector create more than 100,000 jobs for moms and dads and grandparents across our state.

I look forward to the Assembly’s vote and to signing this property and income tax relief into law.
