How much money will Floyd Mayweather make for his Conor McGregor superfight?
The overriding critique of the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight heading into the contest is that the entire thing was little more than a scam. A shameless cash grab, one that we already knew the outcome of.

In retrospect, that take is probably a touch harsh. The fight, in the end, was more entertaining than first expected, but the point remains: Both men are about to pocket an eye-watering sum of money.

How much, you ask?

As you can see, Mayweather is guaranteed $100 million and McGregor is guaranteed $30 million before any of the Pay Per View or Sponsorship money is divided up. Before the fight, Mayweather predicted he would pocket about $300 million when all is said and done. That means Mayweather will make more in one night than any NFL, NBA, or MLB player has made in their entire career (excluding sponsorships), according to Spotrac.

If that’s not crazy enough, that’ll also be close to three times more than Tiger Woods made in on-course earnings during his entire golf career, though, again, that doesn’t include Tiger’s off-course earnings, which put his total earnings over $1 billion.
