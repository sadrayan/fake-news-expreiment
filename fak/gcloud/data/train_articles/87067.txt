Prior to murdering Ms. Larson, Arevalo-Carranza had been deported in 2013 but was able to illegally enter the U.S.'s porous southern border again.



After illegally returning to the U.S., Arevalo-Carranza reportedly was arrested several time in San Jose in 2014 for drug possession, battery on a police officer and other crimes. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reportedly claimed that the federal law enforcement agency's detainer requests were ignored by Santa Clara County because of the county's illegal alien sanctuary policy. As a result, Arevalo-Carranza was not turned over to ICE for detention and deportation after being released by the Santa Clara County jail. Ms. Larson was a college graduate and worked in Silicon Valley. She was well liked and was described by friends as a wonderful kind woman. She is survived by a son, daughter, brother, boyfriend, and many other relatives and friends. OJJPAC Note: Another tragic example why cities, counties, and states, with alleged sanctuary policies need to be investigated and held accountable for any violations of law by the federal government.

Officer Singh, who has worked for the Newman Police Department since 2011, was shot and killed during a morning traffic stop involving Arriaga on December 26, 2018. Two days later Arraiaga was captured in Bakersfield, CA, 280 miles away from the City of Newman. Police stated they believe Arriaga was attempting to flee back to Mexico.



Arriaga, reportedly had been involved in a gang and arrested twice previously for DUI. He had also been previously deported back to Mexico. Arriaga is expected to be charged with homicide. OJJPAC note: This officer's death is the result of the radical sanctuary policies instituted by the Progressive Democrats that control many of the cities, counties, and overwhelmingly the legislature and executive branch in California. These leftist public officials have worked to encouraged the creation and expansion of illegal alien sanctuaries across California. These sanctuary policies protect law breakers from arrest by ICE agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and put the lives of all Americans at greater risk. The U.S. Department of Justice needs to sue the cities, counties and state of California that are violating federal law.

Jones, 51 Son , Father, Brother, Friend & Dairyman Allegedly murdered by Gustavo Garcia, 36 Gustavo Garcia, 36 , an illegal alien has been arrested for the murder of Rocky Paul Jones, 51, of Visalia, California. Garcia was caught on store video confronting Jones in a convenience store parking lot at 2:30a.m on December 16, 2018. Garcia is then alleged to have shot and killed Jones. That night Garcia also reportedly is believed to be involved in multiple shootings, including the shooting of a farm worker, and robbery of a gas station in another town.



Garcia is alleged to have a criminal record dating back to 2002 and apparently ordered to be deported in 2014 and had past multiple immigration holds.



Some in law enforcement have pointed out that the State of California's controversial passage of Senate Bill 54, also knows as California's illegal alien "sanctuary" law in 2017, is the reason Garcia was allowed to remain in the US and go on his crime spree and kill Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones was a dairyman who was born in Tulare California. He is survived by his daughter, brothers, stepfather, and nieces ands nephews. Family members said Rocky was a "loving and genuine" person.

Christian Ponce, 25 , an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested in the murder and dismembering of his neighbor Robert Page, 76, of Morrow, Georgia. Page's wife contacted police on November 8, 2018 to report her senior citizen husband missing. A trail of blood led police to an adjacent home where Ponce-Martinez was renting a room. At that home, investigators found bloody pieces of a body hidden in a cooler and under a tarp, which were determined to belong to Mr. Page.



Police found Ponce-Martinez hiding under a piece of furniture on the property. A news report indicated that security video showed Ponce-Martinez on Page's property prior to Mr. Page's murder and said that the two men may have been arguing before the murder. Ponce-Martinez, who reportedly moved to Morrow Georgia just 3 months earlier, has been charged with murder. Although Ponce-Martinez had just moved next to the Page family recently, Ponce-Martinez had been caught by the US Border Patrol attempting to illegally enter the US once before in 2015. Mr. Page is survived by his wife of almost 50 years, his children and grandchildren.

Blake Michael Zieto , 20 Son , Brother & Friend Allegedly killed by Jesus Maltos Chacon, 45 Jesus Maltos Chacon , 45, a Mexican national illegally in the U.S., is wanted by U.S. law enforcement in connection to the death of 20-year-old Blake Zieto on November 18, 2006.



The Louisiana State Police believe that Chacon was driving the truck that crashed head-on into Zieto's motorcycle in Denham Springs, LA. The State Police told reporters that Chacon fled the scene of the accident, leaving the badly injured 20-year-old to die in the street. Zieto's injuries were so severe, he died on the way to the hospital.

According to a WAFB TV-9 news report, "Chacon is wanted for negligent homicide, failure to yield, hit-and-run and operating a vehicle without legal presence." Judy Zieto, Blake Zieto's mother, claims that Chacon was not only in the U.S. illegally, he also had a criminal record and was awaiting a deportation hearing. Mrs. Zieto has been pursuing prosecution of Chacon since her son's death in 2006. Louisiana law enforcement believe Chacon returned to Mexico after the crash to avoid prosecution in the U.S. Blake is survived by his parents, two sisters, his fianc√©e, and many other family members and friends who grieve his loss and miss him every day.

Authorities have determined that Rivera, a Mexican national, is an illegal alien and has been living and working illegally in the US for several years.



Investigators believe that Ms. Tibbitts, a sophomore at the University of Iowa, encountered Rivera in July while she went running on July 18th in her rural Brooklyn, Iowa neighborhood. Ms. Tibbits never returned home from her run. She was reported missing and law enforcement began searching for the missing woman. Rivera was identified as a suspect thanks to security camera video captured him following Ms. Tibbits. Rivewra reportedly confessed to the murder of Ms. Tibbitts after getting angry after she rebuffed his advances and threatened to call police.



Rivera led law enforcement agents to a field where he claimed he put Ms. Tibbits body. A body was found at that location but it has not officially been confirmed to be Ms. Tibbitts.



Rivera has been charged with first-degree murder. Conflicting reports have bail set at $1-5 million.

According to Chrishia's family, Guevara was released in less than an hour after posting bond for two existing warrants. Chris Odette claimed that Rockwell TX law enforcement informed the family that they do not check a defendant's legal status or notify ICE unless the crime involved is a violent felony.



The family indicated that local law enforcement lacked interest in prosecuting Guevara. The family gives credit to Congressman Michael Burgess, for getting ICE involved into Ms. Odette's case.

Igor Zubko, 26 August, 2017 update: Russian national Igor Zubko admitted to the murder of Shayley Estes. He accepted a plea deal in which he will serve a life sentence in prison, which allowed him to avoid a possible death sentence conviction. Original entry below: Igor Zubko, 26, a Russian illegal alien was arrested for the brutal murder of Shayley Estes, 22, who was found dead in her Phoenix, Arizona home on July 24, 2015. Police caught Zubko at the Sky Harbor International Airport before he could flee on a flight to San Francisco, California. [OJJPAC note: San Francisco's extreme sanctuary policy protects criminal aliens from federal detention and deportation.] Zubko was charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping, among other criminal offenses. The victim, whom had befriended Zubko several months earlier, had allowed Zubko to move into her home. However, according to the victim's mother, the Russian national began threatening her daughter, so Shayley obtained a restraining order against Zubko. One news report stated that the order was served on Zubko on July 14, 2015, and death threats from Zubko followed.



The restraining order served on Zubko on or about July 14, 2015, did not deter Zubko. Zubko reportedly told police that he bought a gun, entered the victim's home using a house key he had retained, and shot Estes on July 24th. Zubko alleged that the shooting was an accident, a story police and prosecutors didn't believe--concluding that the young woman was shot after attempting to flee Zubko. Prior to her murder, Shayley was working a full-time job and also attending college where she was studying chemistry. The Estes family has been devastated by the loss of Shayley. Shannon Estes, Shayley's broken-hearted mother, wrote that her daughter was her best friend. Shayley is also survived by 4 loving brothers and a nephew, all whom she also loved very much.



Shannon Estes wrote that Zubko enter the U.S. legally but overstayed his visa, and remained in the U.S. illegally. The judge in the case set Zubko's bond at $1 million dollars.

Tzun pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence. Superior Court Judge Rafael A. Arreola sentenced Tzun to only nine months in jail. After serving his jail sentence, Tzun was deported in March, 2014. Mr. Durden's mother believes that Tzun has likely illegally returned to the illegal alien sanctuary of Riverside, California. OJJPAC note: Since originally adding "Dom" Durden's name to the Memorial in 2012, I have come to know his mother, Sabine Durden. Sabine has become a very active advocate for the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. She shares the story of her family's personal tragedy and heartache as a warning to others. Juan Zacarias Lopez Tzun, 32, a Guatemalan illegal alien living in California, has been arrested for causing the death of Riverside County Sheriff's department dispatcher Dominic Durden, 30, on July 12, 2012. Police said that Tzun, who was driving a Chevy pickup truck, turned in front of the victim's motorcycle, causing a crash, in which Durden died at the scene from his injuries.



Tzun reportedly attempted to flee the scene of the accident but was stopped and held by two U.S. Marines who witnessed the crash. Tzun initially pled not guilty to the charges of vehicular manslaughter without gross neglect and for driving without a license. Dominic Durden, better known as "Dom," had many friends, formerly served as a volunteer firefighter, and was a pilot. He was the 2002 Moreno Valley Volunteer of the Year. Sabine Durden, "Dom's mom," said that her only child's death shattered her heart in millions of pieces. Tzun and the failure of the Obama administration to enforce U.S. immigration laws ended her son's future and severely changing her's--she lost her only child, best friend, and will never experience being a mother-in-law or grandma.

Indiana State Police said that Orrego-Savala was driving drunk and crashed into the stopped vehicle in which Jackson was a passenger. Jackson and his Uber driver died from their injuries.



Like most cowardly illegal aliens, Orrego-Savala reportedly failed to aid the victims and attempted to flee the scene of the accident on foot but was taken down and arrested. It was reported that Orrego-Savala was not only allegedly drunk, but was driving without a license, and had previously been deported from the U.S. in 2007 and 2009. Jackson's teammates remembered their friend as someone who was not only a great football player but also someone who took the time to aid community groups and institutions such as Riley Children's Hospital.

Altamirano is accused of shooting Ronnebeck and stealing two packs of cigarettes after the 21-year-old clerk demanded payment before giving Altamirano any cigarettes. The murder was recorded on the store's security camera and police captured Altamirano after a high speed chase in Phoenix. Altamirano had previous run-ins with local police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In 2012, he pleaded guilty to facilitation to commit burglary and got probation but was placed in deportation proceedings.



Before the murder of Ronnebeck, Altamirano was released on a $10,000 bond in 2013 from ICE custody despite the defendant's own claims of ties to the Mexican Mafia. After his release, but before Ronnebeck's murder, Altamirano also allegedly threatened to kill two people, resulting in harassment injunctions against Altamirano. Altamirano reportedly entered the U.S. illegally at the age of 14 and prior to his arrest, worked illegally as a landscaper.

This young man's blood is on the hands of the Obama administration and those who support Obama's non-enforcement immigration directives. The Obama administration's conduct defies common sense. The harm it has caused has been of such an egregious nature, all its policy architects deserve the title of saboteur if not traitor, and all should be prosecuted for their acts of public malfeasance.

Kris Eggle was murdered while working as a U.S. National Park Ranger at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona. In 2000, Eggle accepted the ranger position at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Eggle had previously worked as a ranger at other NPS parks, including Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and Canyonlands National Park. Because of Organ Pipe's proximity to the US border with Mexico, NPS rangers duties included intercepting Mexican drug smugglers. Eggle was shot and killed August 9, 2002 while tracking Mexican drug smugglers through the national park in Arizona.

In honor of Eggle, the U.S. Congress passed a law in 2003 dedicating the visitor center at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument as the Kris Eggle Visitor Center. Eggle, who grew up in Cadillac Michigan, was an Eagle Scout and was an outstanding student. He graduated high school in 1991 and was the valedictorian of his class. He went on earn a degree in wildlife biology from the University of Michigan. He also received the Director's Award for outstanding achievement at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.

Martinez-Ramirez was found guilty of "special circumstances murder" after a long trial in 2018. Martinez-Ramirez was sentenced to life in prison without parole.



According to a news report, the jury found special circumstances of robbery, burglary, sexual penetration, and use of a deadly weapon. Martinez-Ramirez reportedly had prior assault and drug convictions. The Santa Maria P.D. had previously arrested him 6 times. He was arrested just one week prior to the Pharis attack on weapons and drug charges, and was released from jail 96 hours prior to breaking into Pharis' home. Because California prosecutors were reducing his criminal charges from felonies to misdemeanors, Martinez-Ramirez was able to avoid being turned over to federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and placed into deportation proceedings.



Ms. Pharis was a veteran and later employed at the Vandenberg Air Force Base prior to her murder. Friends said outside work, she was involved in charity work, rescuing animals, and had been planning a trip to Denmark. OJJPAC's Founder Note: After I put Santa Maria, CA on the OJJPAC illegal alien Sanctuary Cities List, USA (before Pharis's murder), the city had sent me a letter threatening legal action if I didn't remove the City of Santa Maria off my list.

Sergeant Wride was shot and killed while checking on a vehicle in which Jauregui and his 17-year-old accomplice occupied.



It is believed that Jauregui used a rifle to opened fire on Wride as he pulled behind Jauregui's vehicle, killing Wride before he exited his patrol car. Before Sergeant Wride was killed, he relayed a description of the assailant's vehicle to a department dispatcher. Another sheriff's deputy was then able to identify Jaurengui's vehicle and continue the pursuit. However, that officer was also shot in the head by Jauregui. (That officer survived his head wound.)



Jauregui continued to flee by carjacking a vehicle until that vehicle crashed after a pursuit and shoot-out with officers from the Juab County Sheriff's Department. Jauregui was wounded and taken to a hospital where he later died.



Megan Grunwald, Jaurengui's 17-year-old girlfriend and accomplice was arrested, charged, and convicted for her role in the duo's crime spree. She was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.

Dennielle N."Nikki" Schermock, 25 15th Anniversary Tribute Listing 5-24-1976 to 11-17-2001 Mother, daughter, sibling & friend Allegedly killed by Fernado Reyes Fernado Reyes , an illegal alien from Mexico, remains a wanted fugitive 15 years after his implication in the November 17, 2001 death of Dennielle "Nikki" Schermock, 25.



According to Vickie Lyon, the victim's mother, Fernado Reyes was high on cocaine and intoxicated and was driving in the wrong direction on Poinciana Boulevard. Reyes pickup truck smashed head-on into Ms. Schermock 1988 Toyota. The crash instantly killed the young mother. Ms. Schermock's two young children, Brieanna, 4, and 16-months-old Brandon were also in their mother's car. The 4-year-old sustained serious injuries too but paramedics were able to revive her at the crash scene. Schermock's toddler was in a car-seat that Lyon said saved the young boy's life, despite various skin abrasions. Both children were life-flighted to an Orlando, FL Trauma Center, where Lyon's granddaughter underwent emergency surgery.



Vickie Lyon then has the horrible task of going to the local morgue to identify her daughter's violently broken body--a task that is every parents worst nightmare--and an experience that haunts Ms. Lyon to this day.



Fernado Reyes was treated at an Orlando Medical Center and then at a rehabilitation center. Lyon says that Reyes's family "snuck him out in the middle of the night" [of the rehab center] and Reyes has been a missing fugitive from justice ever since. Lyon believes that Reyes was basically "allowed" to escape. She believes that the Florida Highway Patrol and the State of Florida's lax investigation and control over Reyes was purposeful because they didn't want to deal with the sticky issue of his illegal immigration status and Mexican authorities. "It was like dealing with the Keystone Cops" said Lyon. Ms. Schermock was a member of the New Community Baptist Church. She was survived by her parents, her brothers, grandparents, and her children.

Moralez beat, strangled, and tortured Joshua Wilkerson on November 16, 2010 until he died. After the young man didn't return home from school, police were notified. A search team found his burned body in a field the following day.



Moralez was sentenced to life in prison. Moralez's family are Belize nationals who entered the U.S. illegally on or about 2001, when Moralez was 10-years-old. Original entry: Hermilo Moralez, 19 , a suspected illegal alien from Belize, has been arrested for the brutal murder of Joshua Wilkerson, 18, of Pearland, TX. Police say Moralez has confessed to murdering Wilkerson, who reported was a friend of Moralez and gave Moralez a ride home. Police also stated that they believe Wilkerson was first murdered, then bound and moved to a field where his body was set on fire.

Espinosa had been arrested for the murder of Jamiel Shaw, 17, who was killed in an unprovoked March 2, 2008 attack. Shaw was brutally murdered three houses down from his family home in Los Angeles. According to the LAPD and District Attorney, 19-year-old Pedro Espinosa, has a long juvenile criminal record and is a member of of the 18th Street Gang. He is also a Mexican national in the U.S. illegally. Shockingly, Espinosa was released from jail for assault with a deadly weapon March 1, 2008, one day prior to the murder of Jaimel Shaw. Why was Espinosa given probation? Why was Espinosa not turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation prior to committing any crimes in the U.S.? The Shaw family now wants the City of Los Angeles to repeal Special Order 40 which prohibited police from inquiring about Espinosa's immigration status--and prevented his deportation back to Mexico. The repeal effort is called "Jamiel's Law" and more information is available at http://www.jamielslaw.com . Anita Shaw, Jamiel's mother, wants her son to be remembered as a hero and Christian-- a good example for young people to follow. Rumors that Shaw was a gang member seem unfair--and many supporters of the Special Order 40 repeal campaign believe the rumors are part of a smear campaign to stop repeal efforts. The fact is that Shaw was the victim and he had NO POLICE RECORD and even the police say Shaw was NOT known to hang-out with local gangs.

Brandy Lee Thorne, 22 Mother, daughter, sister & friend Killed by Jose Fransisco Flores Santos, 29 Jose Fransisco Flores Santos, 29 , is another arrogant and self-centered illegal alien from El Salvador with no concern for American lives. Flores Santos was arrested for causing the March 31, 2016 motor vehicle accident which resulted in the injury and eventual death of Brandy Lee Thorne,22, and her unborn child on April 24, 2016. Ms. Thorne was a young mother on her way home from work at an Aurora, Ohio restaurant, when Flores Santos is alleged to have been driving intoxicated and crossed the center line hitting Thorne's vehicle head-on. Thorne, who was pregnant with her second child, was severely injured and was transported to Hillcrest Hospital but died a few weeks later. Her unborn child died too. Flores-Santos reportedly was driving a vehicle owned by someone he knew but took the car without permission. Flores Santos' passengers [of unknown legal status in the U.S.] were also injured and transported to local hospitals. Although Flores-Santos' admitted to police that he was in the U.S. illegally, he was somehow able to get a drivers license (which at the time of this accident, had been suspended for a unknown reason). Flores-Santos was indicted by a Portage County Grand Jury and charged with a number of felonies and misdemeanors including aggravated vehicular homicide. He was held in the Portage County Jail and Judge Laurie Pittman set Flores-Santos' bond at $100,000. Update: Since that time, Santos was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in prison. [OJJPAC note: Thanks to the abysmal open US border policy of President Obama, this criminal was able to easily enter the U.S., obtain housing, apparently work illegally at a local Mexican restaurant, and then kill Americans and rip apart her loving American family.

Jesse Benavides, 33 Son, Father, Fianc√©e, Brother, & Friend Murdered by Santana Gaona, 34 Santana Gaona , a 33-year-old illegal alien had been arrested and put on tril for the 2011 murder of Jesse Benavides, 33, of Dallas, Texas. On April 16, 2015, a jury found Gaona guilty of murder and the trial judge sentenced Gaona to 50 years in prison. Jesse Benavides was shot and killed while attending a children's birthday party at a home in west Oak Cliff. Gaona shot Benavides 7 times in the back after an argument at the party. After the murder, the Benavides family found out that Gaona had been in the U.S. illegally and and been arrested for rape and was flagged for transfer to the Department of Homeland Security for deportation proceedings after release from jail. However, the FBI intervened and had the immigration hold removed because Gaona had been an FBI informant. So Gaona was eventually released from jail and remained in Dallas. The Benavides family is still attempting to get answers to their questions regarding how Gaona was allowed to remain in the U.S. after being identified as a criminal illegal alien. Jesse Benavides senseless murder has traumatized his family. He is survived by a 10-year-old son (who witnessed his father murder), his former fianc√©e, a brother, Juan Benavides, and other family and friends. Benavides was a loving father who enjoyed watching the Dallas Mavericks and playing practical jokes on family and friends.

In a special pleading called an Alford plea, Santillan avoids a possible life sentence for murder. Santillan now faces a maximum of 11 years in prison and deportation to Mexico after she serves her prison sentence. Santillan reportedly has lived in the US illegally for 11 years and was an in-home daycare operator. Baby Cortez was in the care of Santillan after which the baby ended up on a ventilator at the Akron Children's Hospital. Baby Cortez died several days later. Prosecutors were prepared to have medical experts testify that Baby Cortez suffered severe head injuries from blunt force trauma while in the care of Santillan.

OJJPAC note: How was it possible for Santillian to enter the US illegally, settle in Akron Ohio, and evidently run an in-home daycare without any interference from local, state, or federal authorities? This deserves further investigation to find out if authorities were aware of Santillan's presence and her apparent illegal business which resulted in the death of a baby.

Ms. Lancaster who was pregnant lost her child and the ability to have any other children due to a required hysterectomy. Ms. Lancaster's injuries also included a broken hip, pelvis, and femur and the loss of a kidney. During her recovery, she had two strokes and died twice before being resuscitated.

Olivera knew the victim because they both worked at the same pizzeria. Olivera strangled Dranko to death after an apparent sexual assault at her home in Hillsborough in April, 2014. Olivera is believed to have tried to cover up the theft of $6,000 and the murder by setting Dranko's body on fire. Eventually Olivera admitted to the murder, theft, and lying to police about the murder. Olivera's previous $1 million bail has been revoked and awaits sentencing. Members of victim's family attended Olivera's guilty plea court hearing. OJJPAC note: Olivera not only was in the US illegally, he was also working illegally in New Jersey. Perhaps if employers and public officials didn't make it so easy for illegal aliens to enter and remain in the US, Ms. Dranko would be alive today.

According to the victim's mother, her son had just dropped off his girlfriend after they stopped to get cookies. It was his girlfriend's birthday and Golvach's last words before he was murdered were to his girlfriend..."Happy birthday. I love you. See you tomorrow." According to news reports, minutes later, Mr. Golvach's truck was stopped at a stoplight when Reyes' vehicle pulled next to Golvach. Without provocation, Reyes shot into Golvach's vehicle, hitting the young musician in the head, killing him. Reyes was later shot and killed by a Harris County Sheriff's deputy after a separate shooting incident in which Reyes was involved. The family was told that Reyes had been previously deported from the U.S. on multiple occasions. The Golvach family has since attempted to learn how Reyes was able to keep illegally returning to the U.S. After getting the runaround from both the Houston Police Department and Harris County Sheriff's office, the Golvach family hired an investigate reporter to find out more about Reyes and their son's murder. Citing an ongoing investigation, the investigative reporter who filed public records requests was unable to get the HPD or th HCSO to turn over even basic information about Reyes.



What the family did find out was that Reyes had at least two other past arrests, including a 2002 burglary and an assault in 2003. Spencer Golvach was a self-taught musician who played bass in a progressive rock band. His family, friends, and band mates described Spencer as a nice, very funny, intelligent, and trustworthy person. Spencer's parents, Dan and Julie, miss their son every day. His mother said that "her laughter, her love, and her legacy were taken in an instant." Dan Golvach was quoted as saying "I'll never get over it." Spencer is also dearly missed by his brothers, Dylan and Christopher, and numerous extended family and friends.

Witnesses took photos of the killer which led them to Francisco Sanchez, who was captured later nearby Ms. Steile's home. At the time of the shooting, Sanchez reportedly had seven felony convictions and five prior deportations. He was also released from jail just months before the shooting because of the San Francisco's sanctuary policy for illegal aliens. Ms. Steinle was a 2001 graduate of Amador Valley High School and was employed by Medtronic, a medical device provider. The Steinle family is in shock over the death of their loved one. Her brother Brad said his sister was a loving and caring person who enjoyed making people laugh.

Bob Barry Jr., 58 Husband, Father, Son, Brother, Sportscaster, Friend Killed on June 20, 2015 by Gustavo Castillo Gutierrez, 26 This entry was edited and updated on February 5, 2016 to reflect Gutierrez's guilty plea and sentencing. Gustavo Castillo Gutierrez was a 26-years-old illegal alien from Mexico when he was arrested for killing Bob Barry, Jr., 58, a well-known veteran Oklahoma City sportscaster in June, 2015. Gutierrez, now 27, accepted a plea agreement and plead guilty in January, 2016 to possession of cocaine, driving without a license, and causing the death of Barry. Gutierrez has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for drug possession and 5 years for the additional charges related to the crash. Gutierrez may be deported to his native Mexico after serving his sentence. Barry was killed on June 20, 2015 in Oklahoma City after Gutierrez made an illegal U-turn into Barry's motorcycle path, causing Barry to be thrown off his motorcycle and suffer fatal internal injuries. Gutierrez reportedly had been working illegally in the U.S. as a roofer. After his arrest, Gutierrez was charged with drug possession, driving without a license, and first degree manslaughter. A police report reportedly said Gutierrez's only ID at the time was a "Mexican identification card." According to news reports, thousands of people attended Barry's funeral at the Crossings Community Church. Barry's life-long passion was sports--playing and reporting sports. At the time of his death, Barry, Jr. was Sports Director for KFOR-TV, where he worked for over 30-years. During his long sportscasting career, Barry became a beloved sports personality and celebrity in Oklahoma. Barry leveraged his popularity to help raise funds for a number of community groups and was honored as sportscaster of the year on several occasions. Barry is survived by his wife Gina, four children, and many friends. OJJPAC commentary on the Bob Barry Jr. case: While thousands of American families are being injured, maimed and killed every year, the Obama administration continues its unconstitutional immigration policies and neutering of all enforcment programs previously available to enforce U.S. Immigration laws. The Obama administration's actions are directly responsible for Barry's death. Under the Obama administration's enforcement protocols, illegal aliens can basically violate our immigration laws with impunity until public outrage forces it to act. It took Bob Barry, Jr.'s death for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) to place an immigration hold on Gutierrez, even though he was a repeat offender. Some cities and counties in the U.S. even protect illegal aliens by passing "sanctuary" policies that prohibit local law enforcement from honoring federal immigration hold requests. Some of these cities and counties also help the Mexican government by accepting and allowing the distribution of Matricula ID cards as valid ID, which they are not. I suspect this is what Gutierrez presented as ID to Oklahoma law enforcement. Like many other illegal aliens, Gutierrez has been caught entering the U.S. illegally on multiple occasions. US Border Patrol agents had captured Gutierrez three times prior to killing Barry. How did Gutierrez avoid a felony charge of illegal reentry before he even had a chance to kill Barry? Gutierrez apparently benefited from the Obama administration's "illegal alien catch and release policy." Gutierrez reportedly was "voluntarily" returned to Mexico two times in 2010 and once in 2013. Gutierrez's voluntary removal allowed him to avoid prosecution which might have deterred him from returning to the U.S. again, keeping him out of the path of Bob Barry, Jr's motorcycle of that fateful day, June 20, 2015. How many more Americans must die before we get true public servants in the offices of our three branches of federal government who are willing to protect and defend U.S. sovereignty and the citizens of the United States?

The prosecutor alleges that Kilova was driving erratically and struck Grubbs who was pushing his 18-month-old granddaughter in a stroller. Kilova faces one count of leaving the scene of an accident with injury or death. Witnesses allege that Kilova's vehicle struck Grubbs and the stroller carrying his grandchild. She then fled the scene of the crash with witnesses in temporary pursuit. Kilova got away, but witnesses were able to give police a partial plate number and one witness could identify her face. Kilova then went to her workplace but parked her now damaged car away from her usual parking place. A later tip to police from Kilova's employer may have led to Kilova turning herself into the police. Kilova entered the U.S. on a tourist visa in 2006 but illegally remained in the U.S. after the visa had expired. In 2007 she was arrested for DUI, [but apparently not placed into deportation proceedings.]



On New Years Eve, Kilova's bail was raised from 20,000 to $100,000. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have placed an immigration hold on Kilova after Grubbs death. OJJPAC note: Another one of Pres.

Jone's body was found on Huron Avenue in Suitland, Maryland. Authorities believe that the accused beat and stabbed Jones to death after Jones got in an argument with the defendants, two of which police believe are MS-13 gang members. The defendants are being held without bond. Mr. Joes's relatives said that Jones was a loving person and enjoyed fishing, basketball, and boxing. His relatives stated that Jones choose to be homeless and had once served in the military. OJJPAC note: Although it has been reported and is likely that the defendants are in the U.S. illegally, we are waiting for confirmation from the police department since the media doesn't seem to have written a follow-up story on this murder.
