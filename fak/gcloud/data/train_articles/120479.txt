Lake Arthur police officer fired after controversial picture sur - KATC.com | Continuous News Coverage | Acadiana-Lafayette
A Lake Arthur police officer is now out of a job over a controversial picture on Facebook.

The photo was apparently taken at a Ku Klux Klan meeting last summer in North Carolina.

At Wednesday's council meeting, the Lake Arthur council unanimously voted to terminate Raymond Mott.

Mott said his termination is illegal and that he has an explanation for the photo that cost him his job.

The former officer said the picture is being taken out of context.

"The picture speaks for itself," said Mott. "I'm standing at a rally against illegal immigration. There's not much to be said about the picture. I've never denied it was me."

Members of the community who were at the meeting think his absence on the police force is in everyone's best interest.

"Just not for the concerns of the citizens, for his safety concerns," said spokesman for Better Lake Arthur Ace Beverly. "Out here on the streets you never know what's going to happen. Nowadays, all over the United States cops are getting killed and cops are killing others. Me, myself, personally, I don't want that to happen right here in my own hometown."

Mott sad he is now planning to take legal action against the town.

"The process that it went through in order to terminate me was not within guidelines of Louisiana law," said Mott. "Some information was put out that puts my family's safety at risk. And I will be taking legal action. I've contacted an attorney already."

Mott has worked for the Jennings Police Department, Iberia Parish Sheriff's Office, Youngsville Police and the Eunice Police Department in the past -- leaving all of those positions for different reasons.
