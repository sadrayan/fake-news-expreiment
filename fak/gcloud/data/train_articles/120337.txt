Series Description: The Subjects series was created by the Kennedy Library staff out of many small original files which did not belong in any of the well-defined series. Three small files, "Civil Rights," "Polls," and "Democratic National Committee," were transferred to the new series in their entirety. Other documents from a "Special Topics" file, from the "Daily Reports" file, and from a large group of "Miscellaneous" files were added to the new series forming a large and varied topical file. The resulting series includes documents relating to non-government organizations such as patriotic societies, states and territories, and many miscellaneous topics from the U-2 incident to mental retardation. In many cases, particularly with organizations and institutions, similar material may also be found in other series such as the Speech Files and General Correspondence. Quantity and quality are uneven throughout the series. The material is arranged alphabetically by topic.
