Judith Sheindlin: 10% of college grads think Judge Judy is on Supreme Court
Nearly 10 percent of college graduates believe popular TV star Judith Sheindlin, aka “Judge Judy,” serves on the Supreme Court of the United States, a new poll has revealed.

Ms. Sheindlin, wife of fellow TV judge Jerry Sheindlin, is a retired New York judge who handles small-claims disputes on the long-running court show “Judge Judy.”

The poll, conducted by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a D.C.-based nonprofit, concluded from the 1,000 surveyed nationwide that college graduates “are alarmingly ignorant of America’s history and heritage,” CNN reported.

The report, titled “A Crisis in Civic Education,” found that 47 percent of graduates also couldn’t identify the term lengths for members of Congress, and nearly 40 percent didn’t know that Congress has the power to declare war.

ACTA President Anne D. Neal released a statement addressing the findings.

“Our country depends upon an educated populace; and while civic activity and service learning are important, they simply cannot substitute for substantive learning about our history and government,” she said on Jan. 13. “It’s time that colleges and universities replace their anything-goes approach to the curriculum with specific subject-matter requirements that will empower America’s next generation of leaders.”
