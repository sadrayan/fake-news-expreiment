James Alan Whitland, the man who shot and killed Ted Nugent this morning, was using the name Alex Hayne. That’s because Whitland is a known domestic terrorist whose history of violence goes all the way back to his days as a teenage hitman for the Black Panthers in the 1970s.

Whitland, who is a white sympathizer to causes like the panthers and more recently Black Lives Matter, is also wanted in connection to aiding and abetting the Dallas gunman who killed all those police officers by giving him the weapons and helping him train. He was caught by a Montana Game Warden on a random patrol as he tried to flee the scene.

Whitland told the warden that he was going to drive his Jeep to his kill and tag it. When they got there, he put on a show of fake tears for having killed a man. Little did anyone know at the time that he was there hunting Ted Nugent, not bear. His fingerprints came back clean, showing that he has powerful friends in high places. It wasn’t until he was run through the national facial recognition database that he was discovered to be a monster for hire.

Whitland is charged with conspiracy and first-degree murder for hire and will face the death penalty if convicted.
