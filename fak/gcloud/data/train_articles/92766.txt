Alan Grayson and Patrick Murphy go at each other in Democratic U.S. Senate primary
Alan Grayson fired first, of course. And Patrick Murphy hit back this morning.

The Democratic U.S. Senate primary is heating up with the rivals offering public criticism and challenges.

Grayson on Wednesday mocked Murphy as an ineffective legislator and offered to help him out. Today, Murphy sought to renew questions about what he deemed Grayson's "unethical hedge funds."

This is only the beginning of a contest between the liberal wing of the party and the establishment.
