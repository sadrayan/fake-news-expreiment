How Many People in the United States Use Medical Marijuana?
1. California has voluntary registration (as opposed to mandatory registration in all other legal medical marijuana states besides Washington). The Marijuana Policy Project estimated the number of California patients based on Oregon's patients per capita.



2. Connecticut's medical marijuana registration program started on Oct. 1, 2012, so data are not available yet.



3 . DC's medical marijuana law took effect on July 27, 2010, but, as of Dec. 28, 2012, its registration program does not yet exist.



4. Maine did not have a registration program until Dec. 31, 2010, when it began requiring patient ID cards. As of Jan. 4, 2011, no statistics are available for the number of registered patients. The Marijuana Policy Project estimated the number of Maine patients based on Michigan's patients per capita.



5. Massachusett's medical marijuana program goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2013, and patient data is not yet available.



6. Washington does not have a registration program. The Marijuana Policy Project estimated the number of Washington patients based on Oregon's patients per capita.



7. Two states (NJ, DE) have registration programs that took effect in late 2012 which is partially why the number of registered patients in those states is comparatively low. Since our national projections are based on the average of the 16 states with active registration programs, these two states lower the average and thus lower the overall projection of medical marijuana patients



8. If the average number of medical marijuana patients per 1,000 residents in states with legal medical marijuana is extrapolated to all 50 states (population 311,591,917 as of 2011, according to the US Census Bureau), then the total number of medical marijuana users as of Dec. 28, 2012 would theoretically be 2,421,069 [7.77/1,000 x 311,591,917 = 2,421,069].



[ Editorâ€™s Note: As of Dec. 28, 2012 we were unable to find any studies projecting the number of medical marijuana users nationwide. Our national estimate of 2,421,069 may not be nor is it intended to be scientifically or statistically sound. It is presented only to give a general reference point for discussion of medical marijuana use in the United States. Please see the statement below from Jeff Dang, MPH, for further critical discussion on the techniques used to create this estimate. Although Mr. Dang's statement is based on our 2009 patient estimate of 577,712, the method we used in 2012 to estimate patients is the same.]
