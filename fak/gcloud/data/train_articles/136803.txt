A world without nuclear weapons
Nuclear weapons threaten every city on the planet with staggering humanitarian, environmental and economic loss. So long as they exist we will never be safe.

30 years ago, there were 70,300 nuclear weapons on the planet. Today, an estimated 14,485 nuclear weapons remain. By 2030, we could remove all nuclear weapons from military service and consign them to the dustbin of history.

Working with political leaders, senior military commanders and national security experts from across the political spectrum and in every nuclear-armed region of the world, we are working to achieve historic Global Zero Accords that would ensure that all nuclear weapons are permanently dismantled.
