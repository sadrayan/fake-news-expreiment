UPDATED: Melania Trump will move to DC
UPDATED: The White House says fist lady Melania Trump will move to the White House at the end of the school year, and that a report published Wednesday by Us Weekly is incorrect.

The first lady will split her time between New York and Washington, D.C., starting at the end of the school year, said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who CNN reported is acting as an adviser to Melania Trump.

"Mrs. Trump is honored to serve this country and is taking the role and responsibilities of first lady very seriously," she said. "It has only been a short time since the inauguration and the first lady is going to go about her role in a pragmatic and thoughtful way that is unique and authentic to her."

US Weekly reported Wednesday that a decision would be made at the end of the school year on whether the first lady would shift to Washington based on what is best for the couple's young son Baron.

"They will reevaluate toward the end of the school year if they will keep this arrangement or if Melania and Barron will move to Washington," a family insider told the publication.

"They could go either way right now. They will ultimately do what's best for Barron."

The source told Us Weekly that although Melania Trump is not in the White House, she has been "actively building her team" since her husband assumed office, including "hiring a chief of staff, a senior adviser and a social secretary, among other key positions."

"While she is a mom first, she is very much embracing the role and responsibilities of first lady," the source said.

When the president was asked last month about whether he was lonely not having his wife in the White House, he said: "No, because I end up working longer. And that's OK."
