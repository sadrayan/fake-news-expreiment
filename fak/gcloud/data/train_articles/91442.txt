A Real Encounter with Healthcare.gov's "Live Chat" Service

Update, Oct. 10, 2013: Alice, our previous correspondent whose difficulty with PGSTX0534 is chronicled below, is still eager to find out how she will be covered under the Affordable Care Act, but her attempt to find out about coverage in Pennsylvania continues to be stymied. Here is her latest dispatch:

John Dickerson John Dickerson is a co-anchor of CBS This Morning, co-host of the Slate Political Gabfest, host of the Whistlestop podcast, and author of Whistlestop and On Her Trail.

Frustration abounds with healthcare.gov. I finally gave up and called the phone number that was provided in my faux "Live Chat." I got through to someone right away. When I asked what was causing so much trouble, she said it was that so many people were using the system that it was causing glitches. Did they not expect THE ENTIRE NATION to be doing this? Since it is now required? So she said she could mail me a paper form to fill out, which would take three weeks to get to me. And then I would fill it out and mail it back, and then they would let me know what my coverage options would be and any discount I could get. I asked her if she could email me the form, and she said, "No, we don't have that capability."

Original Post: I have been in regular conversation with a person in Pennsylvania trying to get information about coverage under the Affordable Care Act. She is optimistic about the coverage she might get, but also wonders why her existing plan, which is far from perfect, is being canceled on Jan. 1. (The president said if you like your plan you will be able to keep it.) She started trying at 8 a.m. on Oct. 1, the minute the website went live, and has tried about 10 times over the week. Mostly she has been shut out entirely. Recently she has been able to at least enter in some of her information, but the site doesn’t record the information correctly and doesn’t let her change it. She took her questions to the “Live Chat” to see if she could get some answers. This is what she got (the applicant’s name is the only item in this transcript that has been altered):
