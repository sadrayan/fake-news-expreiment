Subject: A fresh urgent fact-check query, PolitiFact Texas

Professor Perry:

Good morning—and hello again.

On behalf of the Austin daily newspaper and the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project, I seek your analysis afresh as we gauge the accuracy of the tweet by Gov. Greg Abbott I am picturing below. I am hoping to complete our review today.

My look this morning at BLS data seems to indicate the preliminary September jobless rate of 4.0 percent matches the state rate in late 2000. Is that right?

10:34 a.m.

Yes, you are correct, the 4% rate in Sept. matches the 4% jobless rate in November and December of 2000. I minor point I suppose, he could have maybe said “the lowest jobless rate in 40 years, matching the 4% rate in two months in 2000.”

I’ll check on the employment issue now and send a separate email.

Mark
