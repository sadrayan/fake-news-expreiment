Black Donor’s Sperm Mistakenly Sent To Neo-Nazi Couple

ANN ARBOR – WPXD-TV reported an Ohio woman wants to burn a cross in front of Chicago sperm bank’s office after claiming she was inseminated with a vial from what she called a “ghetto monkey” (racist slur for African-American) donor despite ordering a vial from a white donor.

Molly Cram says her now two-year-old daughter, Watermelon, has caused major problems with her beliefs.

“The neo-Nazi community don’t want me now. My daughter’s a disgusting little half-breed with baboon lips and she’s going to hell cause she ain’t pure. But part of me still loves that little half-human, cause she’s mine and all, but this ain’t good.”

Her boyfriend, John Steelhammer, broke it off with the mother. “I love Molly even though she’s now, technically, a n**ger lover, but you know how stupid I look in all this? I didn’t want to tell my white brothers I was shooting blanks, so now they think my girl was cheating around on me with a spear-chucker. My life is really stressful right now.”

In April 2012, Molly was wrongly inseminated with a vial from donor No. 330, an African-American man. The sperm bank did send a letter of apology and refunded her money, but Cram says she thinks the mix-up was intentional.

“I know that bank giving me a black sperm was a secret plot to embarrass the white race. But these milk duds are going to feel the force of white power. I’m burning a cross and that’s just the start. Hail Hitler!”
