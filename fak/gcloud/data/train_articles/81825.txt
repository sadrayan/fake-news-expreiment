The NRA has blocked gun violence research for 20 years. Let's end its stranglehold on science.
This was a blow to the NRA because "it saw that would not help them sell more guns," Rosenberg observed. Kellermann's paper, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993, noted that "protection from crime" was the most commonly cited rationale for having guns in the home. Forced entry by an intruder accounted for a tiny subgroup of real cases, though it loomed large in the fears of homeowners. "A gun kept in the home is far more likely to be involved in the death of a member of the household than it is to be used to kill in self-defense," Kellermann wrote. "In the light of â€¦ our present findings, people should be strongly discouraged from keeping guns in their homes."
