Background to the GradNation Campaign and Building a Grad Nation Report

The GradNation campaign, launched in 2010, included the creation of a Civic Marshall Plan, to bring together policymakers, educators, business leaders, community allies, parents and students to address the dropout epidemic by focusing on the dropout factory high schools and their feeder elementary and middle schools. In tune with the call from President Obama and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to increase the U.S. graduation rate to 90 percent by 2020, we are working to mobilize Americans to quicken the pace.
