Licensing Cars and Drivers As the number of motor vehicles reached tens of thousands, state and local governments assumed a new power: authorizing vehicles and drivers. In 1901, New York became the first state to register automobiles; by 1918 all states required license plates. States were slower to require licenses for drivers. Only 39 states issued them by 1935 and few required a test, despite widespread concern about incompetent drivers. Early motorists were taught to drive by automobile salesmen, family and friends, or organizations like the YMCA. By the 1930s, many high schools offered driver education.

Sizes varied until 1956, when a standard size was adopted nationwide. Coping with Traffic By the 1920s, congestion, accidents, and parking problems clogged city streets. Cities imposed speed limits, installed traffic signals, and tried one-way streets, parking restrictions, and parking meters to keep vehicles moving. More traffic also meant more traffic laws. William P. Eno, a crusader for better traffic management, composed Rules of the Road and other traffic guides, which became the basis for many cities traffic laws. Traffic management, road maintenance, expanded police departments, and new construction ate up large segments of municipal budgets, and cities looked for new sources of revenue to cope with the presence of motor vehicles.

Meters provided frequent parking turnover and much-needed revenue for municipal traffic programs. Parking meter, Dual Brand Parking meter, M. H. Rhodes Parking meter, Miller
