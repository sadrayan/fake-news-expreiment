John Cox for Governor 2018
John Cox is a businessman – not a politician. Raised by a single mom in the Midwest, John is a Californian by choice, deeply committed to restoring the Golden State to what it once was, and can be again. And John Cox has the knowledge and experience to do it.

John built his own business from scratch to a $200 million enterprise with almost 100 employees. He turned around a major food service manufacturing company, restored it to profitability and saved jobs. He is active in charitable organizations, and serves as a Board member for the San Diego USO. John also founded an organization that repairs the homes of low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities. Since 1991, that organization has mobilized 20,000 volunteers and repaired over 1,000 homes.

John Cox is running for California Governor to take California back from the special interests that own the politicians in Sacramento. Those special interests, and the politicians they bankroll, have given us the highest income tax as well as the highest poverty rate in the nation. They have wrecked our once-proud school system, driven small business owners to relocate their business and jobs to other states, and utterly failed to build the water storage facilities we need to manage California’s abundant water supplies.

John has four daughters and lives with his wife Sarah in San Diego where they are active in and attend Nativity Catholic Church.
