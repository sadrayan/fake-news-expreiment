White House won’t light up blue to honor Dallas cops
The head of a national law enforcement group said the White House is dealing a “slap in the face” to police by refusing to illuminate the president’s house in blue to show support for law enforcement after the assassination of five officers in Dallas.

Nate Catura, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, called the decision by the White House “outrageous,” noting that the White House was lit in rainbow colors last year after the Supreme Court affirmed gay marriage.

“I’m not surprised, but I’m very disappointed,” Mr. Catura said. “We have slain police officers that were intentionally targeted, they were assassinated. … He states that he’s sorry for the police officers and the families, but his actions in this case speak louder than his words.”

The group requested the blue lights in a letter to the White House, but presidential press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday, “That’s not something that we plan to do at this point.”

He said Mr. Obama ordered flags lowered to half-staff in honor of the slain Dallas police, and traveled to Dallas Tuesday to speak at their memorial service and meet members of their families.

“There a variety of ways that the president and this administration have chosen to conspicuously demonstrate our deep gratitude and our solemn condolences in the aftermath of the shooting that claimed the lives of five police officers in Dallas last week,” Mr. Earnest said.
