The “Inspiration” section of entertainment celebrity Oprah Winfrey’s magazine, “O,” promotes the founder of a movement to publicly celebrate abortion and her new “Shout Your Abortion” book.

The magazine’s July 2018 issue features “How One Woman Became an Activist With the Hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion,” also posted on Oprah.com on July 13. The “Inspiration” article is a narrative written by Amelia Bonow, describing how her support for federal funding of Planned Parenthood, and her gratitude for her own aboriton, prompted her to launch the #ShoutYourAbortion movement:

“[W]hen I found out that the House of Representatives had voted to defund Planned Parenthood. I kind of unraveled.” “I opened Facebook and, without thinking, wrote, ‘Like a year ago, I had an abortion at Planned Parenthood...and I remember this experience with a nearly inexpressible level of gratitude.’ I hit Post 153 words later, and everything changed.”

When a friend tweeted a photo of her Facebook post with the hashtag #ShoutYourAbortion, the movement took off, Bonow says, adding that she has no shame about killing her unborn child:

“On some level, I’d internalized the stigma—though I honestly wasn’t ashamed. Then why hide?”

According to “O” magazine’s media kit, her publication “reaches 1 in 13 women in America,” has ten million readers, two million social media followers and another four million unique visitors to its website version.
