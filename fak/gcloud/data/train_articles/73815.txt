Barney Keller - July 21st, 2014

Club for Growth President Chris Chocola: “Concerned citizens should encourage Marilinda to keep standing strong against higher taxes.”

Washington, DC – The Club for Growth, the nation’s leading group promoting economic freedom, announced today a six-figure TV ad campaign in the state of New Hampshire. The ads encourage people across New Hampshire to call State Representative Marilinda Garcia and thank her for standing against taxes and spending. Marilinda Garcia opposed SB 367, which raised New Hampshire’s gas tax. SB 367 increased the gas tax by 22% to 22 cents per gallon. She also voted against the big-spending budget pushed by liberals in Concord. The ads start tomorrow and will run throughout the state of New Hampshire.

“People in New Hampshire are hurting because their representatives in Concord have an addiction to higher taxes and spending,” said Club for Growth President Chris Chocola. “Fortunately, the people of New Hampshire have conservatives like Marlinda Garcia fighting for them. Marilinda opposed the gas tax increase and voted against the budget written by liberals in Concord. Concerned citizens should encourage Marilinda to keep standing strong against higher taxes.”

Script for “Hurting” (TV :30)

ACROSS NEW HAMPSHIRE, TAXES ARE GOING UP, AND FAMILIES ARE HURTING.

WITH GAS PRICES SKYROCKETING, THE LEGISLATURE RAISED OUR GAS TAX.

STATE BUDGETS ARE GROWING BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS.

WHAT’S NEXT, AN INCOME TAX?

ONE REPRESENTATIVE HAS TAKEN THE LEAD TO SAY NO – MARILINDA GARCIA.

SHE KNOWS GOVERNMENT HAS GOTTEN TOO BIG.

CONSERVATIVE MARILINDA GARCIA IS FIGHTING FOR MORE FREEDOM AND LESS GOVERNMENT.

THANK MARILINDA FOR OPPOSING HIGHER TAXES AND SPENDING.
