SCOUTING; Citizen Karolyi
His credentials certainly make him worthy of being the 1988 women's Olympic gymnastics coach: Bela Karolyi guided both Nadia Comaneci (1976) and Mary Lou Retton (1984) to Olympic gold, and these days he runs a Houston training center where he oversees the development of Kristie Phillips and Phoebe Mills, now America's top female gymnasts.

Under the rules, though, Karolyi can't coach the national team without being a citizen, and, as a Rumanian whom the United States granted political asylum in 1983, he won't be eligible for citizenship until Oct. 25, 1988 -after the Seoul Games have already ended. Now, to make it possible for him to be considered for the job by the United States Gymnastics Federation, a bill waiving the usual five-year waiting period has been introduced by Senators James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho, and Alan J. Dixon, Democrat of Illinois. ''There is no doubt that this citizenship will be granted; it's just a matter of when,'' McClure said in a Senate speech Friday. ''He has earned it. He is already a productive, patriotic American.''
