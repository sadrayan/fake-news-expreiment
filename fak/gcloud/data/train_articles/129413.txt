Quarters from 1970 Are Worth an Eyebrow-Raising Amount Now
We all have loose change sitting around, despite our promises to ourselves to roll 'em and bring 'em to the bank--or at least deposit them in one of those sorting machines. And while it's no surprise that many 200-year-old coins are worth more than the standard value, some 1970 quarters could be worth far more than 25 cents.

How much more? How about a yearly salary's worth!

AOL.com discovered an eBay listing for a 1970 quarter with a sale price of $35,000. And there are actually 22 people interested in paying that amount for a 25-cent piece!

The reason: Some of these quarters were formed over 1941 Canadian quarters, and the error is slightly visible.

Just above the word "DOLLAR" are the upside-down markings of the year, 1941. You can see it more clearly here in this ebay listing.

It's unlikely that one of these high-value quarters is in your junk drawer, but hey, you never know.
