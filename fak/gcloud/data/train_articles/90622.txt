It’s convention time! Florida is once again in the national (and international) spotlight as the nation’s premier electoral battleground. Presidential horse race polls in this “must-have” state been “tied” (within margin-of-error) for months on end and promise to remain so until Election Day. Some pundits believe there might even be another contested election, harkening up the ghosts of 2000. To be sure, both parties are already honing up their legal teams just in case.

Following the conventions, everything will be about GOTV—getting-out-the-vote. That makes it imperative for candidates, campaign strategists, and party activists to know where their voters (and their opponent’s) are concentrated. This graphic overview, based on August 1, 2012 data, is intended to give sayfiereview readers a visual comparison of registered Democrats and Republicans, broken down by race, gender, age, and media market location. (Graphics appear at the end of the column.)
