Part 2: Local government workforce breakdown
Part Two White-collar, black-collar:

Philly's public sector divide Does local government reflect the 1.5 million residents of this city? It makes sense that government should lead the way when it comes to diversity and fairness in the workplace and the public sector is integrated -- with blacks, whites and ethnic minorities on the city payroll. But a closer look at the numbers reveals a sharp division between whites and blacks, men and women when it comes to pay and power. It's a story of integration and inequality.

Today: Part II delves into the best- and worst-paying jobs and who works them.



A Closer Look



While all classes of jobs are created equal there is not an equal distribution of the better paying jobs when it comes to race and gender. Let's use the city's 561 police sergeants as an example. It's an important field position on the force and pays an average of $77,342 a year. Positions are filled through civil service exams.



Yet, these jobs -- and many of the better-paying jobs on the force -- are dominated by white males. Here is the racial/ethnic and gender breakdown for police sergeants.

The same pattern is evident in other jobs. Philadelphia's 8,225 public school teachers are mostly white, though this segment of the work force is predominantly female.



Here is the teacher data:

Diversity among full-time teachers

Note that although 20 percent of the students in the schools are Latino (25,100) and eight percent are Asian (10,500) there is only a relative handful of Latino and Asian teachers (440).



Teachers are paid an average of nearly $69,234 a year. The fact that most teachers are female is an anomaly. The majority of high-salary jobs in local government are held by white males, though the numbers vary depending on department or agency.



To underscore that point, here is a look at data from city government on two groups of employees: the 4,100 who make $70,000 a year or more and the 4,100 who make $35,000 or lower.



Sixty-four percent of the $70,000-plus jobs are held by whites, while 67 percent of the lowest paying jobs are held by blacks. Seventy-two percent of the high-pay workers are male.

High-earners are white City employees earning $70,000 a year or higher are mostly white, while those earning $35,000 or lower are mostly non-white. City employees earning $70,000 a year or higher City employees earning $35,000 a year or lower SOURCE: 2015 payroll data

The same pattern holds true if you look at the top of the pyramid across local government: the top 5% when it comes to salaries. In most cases, these are managers. The School District does better in terms of racial/ethnic and gender mix because its top 5% percent includes principals, counselors and some teachers -- which tend to be a more diverse group. It also has the highest percentage of women in the top 5%. When it comes to a diverse mix, the rest lag behind.

At the very tip of the pay pyramid are that select group of individuals who are the most highly compensated -- those earning $165,000 or more a year. These are the senior managers of local government. They number 67. There is only one Latino.

We've been dealing with averages to tell this story, but a look at the particulars tells us there are sometimes wide variations when it comes to gender, race and ethnicity. In city government, some departments are majority white -- the District Attorneys office, the Court system and uniformed members of the Police and Fire Department are examples. In each of these, whites make up about two-thirds of the work force.



Other city departments are majority black, Latino and Asian, with relatively few whites.



The Department of Human Services, the Streets Department and the Prisons are 85 percent minority.



There are also jobs dominated by a particular race or gender. For instance, 74 percent of all teachers are women, and 77 percent of uniformed police are men.



This list shows individual jobs that tilt one way or the other.

This helps explain the difference between white and black averages salaries overall. In these examples, the jobs that are majority white pay an average salary of $67,400. The jobs that are mostly minority pay an average of $42,096.



It oversimplifies, but a rule of thumb is that if you wear work boots and gloves the odds are you are black. If you wear a tie or a business suit that a city job requires of you, the odds are you are white.



And, while local government has a workforce that is diverse if you look at all the numbers, it clearly has positions (and some departments) that are not diverse at all. Some come close to being segregated.



When it comes to better paid employees, the local government workforce doesn't reflect the diversity in the city today or even 15 years ago. It more resembles the city of 1980.

Clearly, Philadelphia has made enormous progress since 1980 when it comes to racial and gender equity and equality. We have highly visible African-Americans in key positions -- Mayor Nutter, to name just one. But, these numbers show there is still work to be done if local government is to reflect the city of 2015 and its people.
