Pressure builds on Terhar to resign
UPDATE, Jan. 25 11:50 a.m.

The Toledo Blade called for Terhar to resign.

“Nothing Ms. Terhar could do to improve the education of Ohio’s children as president, or even a member, of the state board can offset or undo the damage she has done by setting an appalling example of intolerance and ignorance,” the Blade wrote. Read the rest here.

Original post

COLUMBUS — In an effort led by the Ohio Democratic Party, more than 65,000 letters were sent to the governor and members of the state school board demanding the resignation of Debe Terhar, president of the Ohio Board of Education.

Terhar, a Republican from Green Township, set off a waive of criticism Tuesday when she re-posted an item from a Facebook friend that linked President Barack Obama’s gun control proposals to Adolf Hitler.

Terhar later removed the post and then her whole Facebook page.

She emailed an apology to members of the school board and in a statement to reporters said she regretted “the consequences of carelessly sharing” the information about Obama.

That’s not enough, Democrats said, because she refused “to immediately and unequivocally apologize for her dangerous comparison.” They said they collected the tens of thousands of letters in less than four hours.

Terhar did not return a phone call from The Enquirer seeking comment.

Gov. John R. Kasich, who is in Switzerland, does not have the power to remove Terhar because she is elected to the state board. However, Democrats accused him of protecting “his political crony, refusing to do the right thing and call for her resignation.”

Kasich told the Columbus Dispatch Wednesday that Terhar’s Facebook post was a mistake and that she has “said she’s sorry.” He was referring to the email she sent to board members.
