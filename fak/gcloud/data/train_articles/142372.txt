The difference between Successories Framed Desktop Prints and other prints:

Framing: We use anodized aluminum that lasts for years. Others use plastic that warps and scratches. Our handcrafted, solid wood frames come from tree plantations ��� we DON���T use rainforest wood! Others use medium density fiber frames, which are a combination of sawdust and glue!

Glass: We use almost unbreakable tempered glass, which contains 20% recycled material. Others don���t even offer tempered glass as an option!

Print: We use digitally enhanced printing for crisp, colorful images. Others use low-tech printing techniques that are dull and flat.

Paper: We use high-quality stock that contains 10% recycled paper. Others use second quality paper.

Matting: We use high-quality matting that can be hot-foil stamped. Others use lower-quality matting that cannot be foil stamped. More Ideas The Essence of Destiny Framed Motivational Poster $164.99 Essence of Imagination 25-Pack Greeting Cards $19.99
