Crack the Mummy Case
could be the title of one of the betterepisodes. But instead of involving a cartoon dog and the interference of some meddling kids, this presentation is a real-life detective story that relies upon scientific principles to crack the case of the Child Mummy thats currently on display at the Saint Louis Science Center (5050 Oakland Avenue). Who was he? What was his life like? How did he die? Working together, a team of geneticists, radiologists, anthropologists and dentists shared knowledge and expertise to uncover a surprising amount of information about the lil fella. It sounds amazing, but its all in a days work for science. Tonight from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. on the Science Centers Center Stage, the team members discuss what they know and how they know it -- and none of them will remove a cheap rubber mask and reveal that they are, in fact, the killer. Tickets for Science Café are $22.25 (visit www.slsc.org or call 314-289-4424 to purchase), and that price includes one beverage and light refreshments.Thu., May 17
