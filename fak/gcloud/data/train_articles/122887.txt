Florida: Restrictions on Doctors Upheld
A federal appeals court upheld a 2011 law that prohibits doctors from asking patients about gun ownership or recording that information in medical records unless it was medically necessary. The law was declared unconstitutional by a federal district judge, Marcia Cooke, who agreed with doctors and gun control advocates that it violated doctors’ free speech rights. But a panel of judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, on Friday overturned that ruling, saying that the law was a “legitimate regulation of professional conduct” and that the limits it imposed were “incidental.”
