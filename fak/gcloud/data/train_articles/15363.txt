I would state that, “yes, Census data shows that full-time employed females in TX earn 81% of their male counterparts. According to BLS, for the U.S. “Women who usually worked full time had median weekly earnings of $713, or 82.0

percent of the $869 median for men.” In the aggregate Senator Davis statement is absolutely, positively correct. However has some have noted that when one controls for work experience, education, and other factors, the earning’s differential is reduced.
