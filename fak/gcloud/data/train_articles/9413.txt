Congress begins lame duck session, with Flint water crisis funding on the agenda
Michigan’s senior U.S. Senator says there are some things that Congress has to address when it returns to work this week.

Sen. Debbie Stabenow says her top priority during Congress’ lame duck session will be lining up federal money for Flint.

“We have a promise that was made to me by the Speaker of the House and the Republican Majority Leader that before the end of this year we would pass the money that’s critical to fixing the pipes in Flint,” says Stabenow.

The House and Senate passed different versions of the Water Resources Development Act with different amounts of money for Flint’s water crisis.

But a conference committee has been trying to hammer out a compromise bill that would include money for Flint’s water crisis.

Flint Congressman Dan Kildee does not expect a vote on that bill until December.

“The week that we come back in November is followed by Thanksgiving week,” says Kildee, “So we really don’t come back until the first part of December.”

Money for Flint will compete with a continuing budget resolution, Zika virus funding and defense spending.
