After last night's Super Tuesday results, a lot of Americans are looking to get out of Dodge and escape the juggernaut that is Donald Trump.

As noted by Mashable, Google Data Editor Simon Rogers pointed out early Wednesday that Google searches for "how can I move to Canada" surged as Super Tuesday results came in​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​:



Searches for "how can I move to Canada" on Google have spiked +350% in the past four hours #SuperTuesday — Simon Rogers (@smfrogers) March 2, 2016

Lo and behold, the data also show a post-mortem, seeking-refuge-in-the-Great-White-North surge Wednesday morning​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​:

The interest has even broken records, so to speak:

Interestingly, two states where people appear the most interested in finding out how to move to Canada were ones Trump won Tuesday: Virginia and Massachusetts.

Drill down a bit more, and the regions most likely to be interested in moving to the land of Mounties and politeness include areas with historically liberal populations, like Boston and the District of Columbia:

And in case you had any doubt about why the American people are so interested in moving to Canada, look no further than related search data:

For what it's worth, Cape Breton – which is among those related topics – is an island in Nova Scotia that's apparently experiencing a population dip, according to a website entitled "Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins."

"We welcome all, no matter who you support, be it Democrat, Republican or Donald Trump," the site's homepage reads.

However, if you're thinking of moving to Canada to escape The Donald, be advised that its immigration and citizenship website has been experiencing delays.

Trump-related? Maybe, maybe not.
