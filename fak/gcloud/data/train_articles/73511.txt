The Impact of ACA Taxes and Fees

CHRT Issue Brief August 2013

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) 25 million Americans are expected to obtain health care coverage by 2019. Many of those who are expected to get coverage under the ACA will either receive subsidies through health insurance exchanges to help make coverage more affordable or will be covered under an expanded Medicaid program. The federal government will fund the premium subsidies along with the majority of the cost of the Medicaid expansion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these coverage expansions will require $1.2 trillion in new federal spending over the period 2013–2022. The ACA offsets this new spending with reductions in other federal spending and revenues from new taxes and fees. Approximately half of the offset occurs through reductions in spending to providers of care or limitations to tax deductions/credits, with the remainder offset through new taxes and fees.

These new taxes and fees vary not only in terms of their purpose, but also in terms of who will be responsible for paying them. Some tax and fee provisions are directed toward individual consumers, but most are directed toward insurers, employers, and certain manufacturers. Even so, many economists believe that the taxes levied on these industries will eventually be passed down to individual consumers, who will then ultimately bear the cost. This brief describes these new taxes and fees and their likely impact on consumers.

Taxes and Fees Included in the ACA

The ACA includes 13 major new taxes and fees (directed toward individuals, employers, manufacturers, or health insurers) that will offset just over half of ACA financing. Collectively, these taxes and fees are expected to raise approximately $775 billion between 2013 and 2022. Figure 1 Figure 2

Approximately one-fourth of revenue ($374 billion) will come from new taxes and fees remitted by individual consumers, but only for specific groups or circumstances. For example, the Excise Tax on Tanning Services is levied only on those who obtain tanning services at tanning facilities (excluding phototherapy administered by a medical professional) while the Additional Hospital Insurance Tax increase only affects individuals whose annual adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for a married couple).

For employers, the most relevant fee under the ACA is generally the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment provision (also known as the Employer Mandate or “Play or Pay” rule), which will penalize certain employers who do not offer adequate and affordable coverage to full-time employees beginning in 2015. Previous CHRT reports detail this provision.

Certain manufacturers also face new taxes and fees under the ACA. For example, medical device manufacturers are now levied a flat tax of 2.3 percent on the sales price of taxable medical devices, while brand-name drug manufacturers remit a variable annual fee relative to their share of sales to government programs.

The majority of new tax and fee provisions, however, are directed toward health insurers or plan sponsors for self-funded arrangements. In all, there are six major insurer taxes and fees, expected to raise $242 billion from 2013 to 2022—nearly one-third of the new tax revenue under the ACA. The magnitude, applicability and purpose of insurer taxes vary. Many will specifically raise revenue to cover the operational costs of programs built into the ACA, such as the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the federal permanent Risk Adjustment Program. However, fees for operational costs represent only a small portion of overall revenues from insurer taxes. Indeed, the bulk of revenues from insurers will come from two taxes: the Health Insurance Provider Tax and the Excise Tax on High-Cost Health Plans (also called the “Cadillac Tax”). Combined, these two taxes alone are estimated to raise approximately $213 billion in general revenue from 2013 to 2022 (even though the Cadillac tax does not go into effect until 2018). Revenues from the Health Insurance Provider and Cadillac taxes will financially offset ACA spending, though neither tax directly funds specific ACA provisions. In other words, major coverage expansion provisions will not be affected if the revenue from these taxes falls short of projections.

Potential Impact on Consumers

Taxes and fees directed toward individual consumers will most obviously affect them, but taxes and fees directed toward industry groups will also have an impact on consumers. Even if a tax is nominally levied on health insurers, employers or manufacturers, economists believe that consumers end up paying most of it since these groups pass the cost on to consumers. Economists distinguish between the statutory incidence of a tax, meaning who directly remits the tax, and its economic incidence, meaning who ultimately bears the cost.

The taxes noted in this brief that are directed at health insurers, manufacturers, and employers could all affect consumers. Some of these impacts are intended to alter the behavior of certain groups. For example, the Cadillac tax was included in the ACA to discourage employers from providing health benefits deemed by some to be “excessive.” Other taxes and fees were designed specifically to raise general revenue to offset new federal spending related to the ACA, but there is concern that these taxes will indirectly result in a significant increase in premiums. Some taxes are likely to have eventual impacts on individual consumers, such as the Medical Device Manufacturer Tax, where the economic incidence will first be felt by insurers and employers, then passed down to consumers and employees in the form of higher prices or lower compensation. For other taxes, namely taxes and fees directed toward insurers, the economic incidence will directly impact the cost of coverage. For example, the industry-wide tax on health insurance providers (one of the larger insurer taxes) could potentially increase premium costs by an estimated 2 to 2.5 percent.

There are other components of the ACA, however, that could mitigate the indirect impact of insurer taxes on premiums paid by consumers. Specifically, there are three premium stabilization provisions built into the ACA: the permanent Risk Adjustment Program; the Transitional Reinsurance Program; and the temporary Risk Corridors Program. These programs are generally intended to protect against the effects of potentially insuring a higher-risk membership and inaccurate rate-setting as more previously uninsured Americans obtain coverage. The risk adjustment program is designed to transfer funds from insurers with lower-than-average risk to insurers with higher-than-average risk and is an ongoing component of the ACA that goes into effect with the coverage expansion in 2014. The transitional reinsurance program will create a pool of funds for health insurers applying for reinsurance payments for high-cost claimants and will be in effect from 2014 to 2016. Similarly, the temporary risk corridors program is designed to make adjustments to the initial rates approved for health plans sold on the insurance exchanges. This is to reduce the volatility in rate-setting in the first years of ACA coverage expansion as more individuals with unknown risk obtain health insurance.

These programs, combined with other market forces such as increased competition among insurers, will have an impact on premiums. The actual premium cost for consumers cannot be projected based on looking at taxes and fees alone. Premiums will be affected by many parts of the ACA—including affordability subsidies, coverage changes, and the individual characteristics of any particular consumer.
