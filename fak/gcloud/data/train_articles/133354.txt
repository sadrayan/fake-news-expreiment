CAPE TOWN - Ten Parow police officers and a former member of the South African Police Service, who were arrested on charges of corruption, have been released on bail.



They allegedly took bribes from suspects and stole crime scene exhibits.



The suspects were apprehended by the province's anti-corruption unit.



The cases have been postponed until next year.



The police officers' friends and relatives battled to get a spot inside the cramped public gallery during their first appearance in the Bellville Magistrates Court earlier today.



Some family members cried when the suspects entered the dock.



One relative told Eyewitness News that it's frustrating because the top brass involved in graft seldom get punished.



Meanwhile, Western Cape police commissioner Arno Lamoer says contingency measures have been implemented to ensure operations at the Parow Police Station continue.
