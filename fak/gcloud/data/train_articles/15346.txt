Another potential reason that Cecile Richards might have made this claim is that there is only a weak consensus among gender gap crowd regarding how to measure it. Traditionally, the gender gap is measured by subtracting the percentage of women voting for the Democratic candidate versus the percentage of men voting Democratic. Variation on this take the Democratic gap, the Republican gap (which is not necessarily the same as the Democratic gap), and averages the two. Some use the party of the winner to determine the gap. The reason the Democratic gap is typically the standard, is that it was male movement away from the Democratic Party that created the gap initially and the fluctuation in the gap is typically reflected in the movement of white men to and from Democratic candidates.

Hope this helps.
