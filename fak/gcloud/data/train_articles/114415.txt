Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye: Michael Eric Dyson: 9780465017690: Amazon.com: Books
Mr. Dyson at times nails the head so hard that you may think you are right there in the middle of it all. So speaking of Marvin's life that you would think Dyson was at Marvin's side. Sadly, Marvin has been gone for almost 30 years. I almost took a day off of work to mourn, that is how Marvin affected my life. His music was varied, but effective.

To the Motown collector, much of the information here is commonplace. If you read one book about the label, much inside the cover here is familiar. Otherwise, the truths about Marvin's upbringing, and sexual abuse against him from family members was a shock to read. Also was the short amount of time Marvin recorded one of pop music's most embraced album's, 'What's Going On'. In a matter of a week, Marvin's masterpiece was in place, and to much surprise, Motown's label owner Berry Gordy, Jr. refused to release it.

So, we almost lost a masterpiece, if it wasn't for those within the company who saw much potential in the work. This book takes us before that release, and much during, and of course, the aftermath, up until his death at the hands of his father.

The author makes this book a fast and easy read.

There are times where he may take us to an aside, like ranting about a comparison to R. Kelly, which was a little annoying, but nonetheless, you will enjoy this semi-biography about one of pop music's legends.
