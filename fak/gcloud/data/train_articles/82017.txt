Trump calls to end recounts in Florida's Senate and governor elections, and alleges fraud without evidence
The president acknowledged that some Senate races were still hanging in the balance, but marveled at the best-case scenario for his party: “Fifty-five is the largest number of Republican senators in the last 100 years.” His party will now hold, at best, 53 Senate seats, if Scott holds onto his lead in Florida and Republicans win a runoff election in Mississippi, as is widely expected.
