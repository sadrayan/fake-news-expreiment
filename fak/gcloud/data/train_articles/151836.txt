Premiere Screening: The Story of Us with Morgan Freeman

Academy Award-winning actor, documentary producer, and host Morgan Freeman embarks on a global journey to uncover the fundamental forces that shape people of many cultures with his new series for National Geographic The Story of Us with Morgan Freeman. From Freeman and Lori McCreary’s Revelations Entertainment, each episode of the series explores a single topic, such as love, belief, and freedom, which unites societies around the world. The Story of Us with Morgan Freeman will premiere in October on National Geographic and will be seen in over 170 countries. The series is an expansion of the network’s Emmy-nominated franchise The Story of God with Morgan Freeman, one of National Geographic’s most-watched series of all time.
