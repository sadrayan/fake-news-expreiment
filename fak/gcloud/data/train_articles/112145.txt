Jeb Bush domain name redirects to Trump site
A site with the domain name JebBush.com redirects to the real estate mogul’s official presidential campaign page, donaldjtrump.com , and features Trump’s slogan with options to support or donate to his campaign.

Bush’s official presidential campaign page uses the domain name Jeb2016.com.

The Daily Caller reported Monday that JebBush.com is registered to Fabulous.com PTY Ltd., which manages domain names, and noted that the website was updated on Nov. 21.

Two other domain names that incorporate Bush’s name and the word president already exist but aren't operated by his campaign.

JebBushforPresident.com is a blog about a gay couple who owns the website and JebBushforPresident.net is used to oppose Bush’s record. That website says it was updated on Dec. 7.

Trump remains atop the polls, with 29.5 percent support, and Bush lags behind in fifth place, with 4 percent, according to the latest RealClearPolitics average of national polls.
