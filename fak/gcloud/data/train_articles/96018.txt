Number of malaria deaths

Estimated deaths, 2000–2015

The number of malaria deaths globally fell from an estimated 839 000 in 2000 (range: 653 000–1.1 million), to 438 000 in 2015 (range: 236 000–635 000), a decline of 48%.

Most deaths in 2015 were in the WHO African Region (90%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (7%) and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (2%). The malaria mortality rate, which takes into account population growth, is estimated to have decreased by 60% globally between 2000 and 2015. Thus, substantial progress has been made towards the World Health Assembly target of reducing the malaria burden by 75% by 2015, and the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership target of reducing deaths to near zero.
