BREAKING: Pelosi Issues 'Impeachment' Announcement, Media Stunned
Tea Party loyalist – I haven’t heard back from you!

So, I’m wondering – do you still support President Trump?

It’s important that I hear back from you RIGHT AWAY, because as we speak House Democrats are banding together to launch a THIRD set of articles of impeachment against President Trump.

Take the flash poll:

Do you oppose the Democrats’ latest push to impeach President Donald Trump?

>> Yes, I stand with the President

>> No, President Trump should be impeached

Do you believe the Democrats are right when they say President Trump has reached the Constitutionally required level of “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” in order to be impeached?

>> No, the Democrats are getting desperate

>> Yes, President Trump should be impeached

As I’m sure you’ve heard, the threat of impeachment just reached a whole new level, and this time the Democrats aren’t holding back.

The Hill is now reporting this to be “the broadest effort yet to oust him as Commander in Chief.”

They’ve hired a huge team of D.C. Swap Lawyers to put together a case for impeachment that they’re now claiming will ‘not leave you lacking for reason.’

First it was the FALSE Russia claims against Donald Trump, and now THIS! He hasn’t even been in office a full year yet!

So please, before you do anything else, take the Tea Party Flash Poll and show your support for President Trump.
