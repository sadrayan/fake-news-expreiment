In the context of Senator Cruz's other statements and work on this issue, we can conclude that:

1. by "control of the Internet"‎ he means legal oversight of the IANA functions that translate Internet names to numbers, without which the World Wide Web could not function;

2. by "body akin to the United Nations," he means ICANN's 162-country Government Advisory Committee‎ which under the new ICANN structure can only be overruled by a supermajority of the ICANN board.

Therefore I would judge Senator Cruz's statement accurate.

Got it; do you still chair the Internet Freedom Coalition, which opposes the UN taking over the internet? To be clear, you see the GAC as a UN-like body?

I still chair the IFC.

UN "like" or "akin" to UN is a reasonable description in that the GAC is a global, massively multilateral institution but I would personally avoid it to make a clear distinction with the ITU.
