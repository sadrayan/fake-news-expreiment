Couple hospitalized after man gets his head stuck in his wife’s vagina
Tom and Janis Morrison, a young couple from the small town of Greensboro in Alabama, called 911 around 10:00 pm last night to ask for an ambulance.



Samantha Irving, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation.



“The woman told me that her husband had fallen and that his head was now stuck in her vaginal cavity. I really thought that it was a group of teenagers making a prank call.”



Despite Ms. Irving’s doubts, she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious.



Bill Austin, one of the paramedics who transported the couple, claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood.



“The woman kept screaming out in pain whenever the guy moved, but he had half of his face buried in there and he looked like he was going through Hell!”



The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital, where doctors were able to separate the couple.



Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable, while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises.



According to doctors, both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome.

Dr. Frank Olson, who treated the couple upon their arrival at the hospital, says that such extreme sexual practices are extremely dangerous and recommends to completely avoid them.



Incidents like this one are, indeed, quite unusual, but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse.



According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 3,213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3,789 in 2016.



According to the same data, the Morrisons are the first couple to be hospitalized for a head stuck inside a vaginal cavity since October 2007.
