CSG Justice Center
In Memoriam

Jason John Bryl

The Council of State Governments Justice Center lost a valued colleague, Jason J. Bryl, on August 15, 2010. Jason was a research and data consultant who worked from the Austin, Texas, office. His work provided needed support to the organization and to the many policymakers looking for data-driven answers to difficult challenges in states across the nation. He was also a talented musician and was known for his commitment and sense of humor. A 1994 graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, he is survived by his wife and child. Jason was 41 and will be missed by the CSG family and the many individuals whose lives he touched.

The CSG Justice Center also draws on a diverse group of other expert consultants who bring extensive experience and insights to the Justice Centerâ€™s project work.
