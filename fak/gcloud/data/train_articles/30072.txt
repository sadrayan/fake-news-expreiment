'First kid' Barron Trump is heading to a $40,000 private school in Maryland â€” here's where the other first kids went to school
Not everyone went to school in DC. AP Photo/Susan Walsh First Lady Melania Trump announced in May that her son Barron will start school this fall at St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland.

Melania and Barron Trump moved into the White House on Sunday, which they had delayed so that Barron could finish the year at his New York City-based day school rather than moving to Washington, D.C. right away.
