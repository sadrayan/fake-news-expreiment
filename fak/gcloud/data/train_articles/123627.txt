Donald Trump misspoke again.

Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, who repeatedly stressed that the Republican presidential front-runner misspoke last month when he suggested women be punished for having abortions if the procedure were outlawed, told CNN on Tuesday that he flubbed again when he referred to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as “7/11.”

“I watched our police and our firemen down on 7/11, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down, and I saw the greatest people I’ve ever seen in action,” Trump said Monday evening at a rally in Buffalo, New York.

CNN anchor Ashleigh Banfield asked Pierson to respond to what Banfield called a “critical faux pas in this state.”

“Well, I think after you’ve done several events over a short time period people misspeak all the time,” she said. “Slip of the tongue.”
