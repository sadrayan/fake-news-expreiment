Joe Jackson Shares Health Update as Family Gathers at Hospital: 'I Am 100% Alive'
Joe Jackson is providing reassurance to his fans.

An update was posted to the 87-year-old talent manager's website on Thursday, titled "I Am 100% Alive" where he shot down rumors of his death after being admitted to a Los Angeles hospital last Friday due to a high fever that occurred during a routine checkup.

"The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated," the note reads. "Please ignore all the stupid false rumors from people who seem to find humor in such topics."

The post, signed by Jackson, is accompanied with a picture of the Jackson family patriarch seemingly at a beachside resort.
