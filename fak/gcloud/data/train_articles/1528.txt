Jason Aldean Gig Canceled After He Sells Out To Liberals On SNL
Joining up with liberals to push gun control may not have been in country music star Jason Aldean’s best interest.

During the show’s opening moments, the guy who brought us “Dirt Road Anthem” and other tunes completely sold out his values when he said that “people should not own more than one gun” and blamed the Las Vegas tragedy on the NRA.

He then sang liberal Tom Petty’s “Don’t Back Down” as the crowd of liberals cheered and whooped and hollered like their grandpappy’s latest batch of moonshine was done.

“So I want to say to them, ‘We hurt for you, and we hurt with you.’ But you can be sure that we’re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way,” Aldean said, punctuating his anti-gun message. “Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit, it’s unbreakable.”

At the end of this statement, “he took a knee” as the house band played a few bars from the National Anthem.

Now he’s done!

In a statement after the show, Aldean said he chose “Don’t Back Down” because we need to be reminded “not to cave to the NRA’s terroristic agenda” and to “always stand up to gun violence and the policies that enable it.”

Already, more than 10,000 conservatives have tweeted that they will #BoycottJasonAldean for his attack on the Constitutional right to own guns and his show in Birmingham, Alabama has been canceled by the venue.

“Aldean went too far on Saturday and we don’t feel comfortable with him using our establishment to push an anti-American message,” The Opry House owner Teddy Stalls told the Nashville Times Saturday. The show was scheduled for Monday.
