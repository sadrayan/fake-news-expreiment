Blue Virginia:: Senator Mark Warner Signs Letter Pushing Keystone
Did you know that the 53 US Senators demanding that President Obama build the Keystone Pipeline got an average $551,051 from the oil lobby, a total of $27,500,000 altogether (according to 350.org)? That's a pretty staggering amount, isn't it? It's a sad commentary in this post-Citizens United country. And know who one of those senators is? You guessed it, the best friend oil friendly Americans for Prosperity has, Mark Warner of Virginia. So he's not only doing the bidding of right-wing hatchet-man and enemy of Social security and Medicare, Peter Peterson, on the budget. He's also helping out the Koch's and the rest of the oil lobby. Here's the list of the sell-outs to big oil. And note they all oversell jobs, which won't produce may local jobs along the route and won't produce nearly as many jobs overall as promised. Nor will the energy be used for the US. It's Canada's oil, remember? And it is headed for China, not the US. So, I wonder, how will this resolve our supposed "need" for more fossil fuel, as opposed to renewable energy?
