NH Mother Uses Child as a Prop to Question Rick Perry on Evolution
ABC News' Michael Falcone ( @michaelpfalcone ) and Arlette Saenz ( @arlettesaenz ) report:

Among the protestors at this morning's meet and greet in Portsmouth, N.H., a mother used her child as a prop to confront Rick Perry about his beliefs on evolution and science.

The mother pushed her son towards Perry and insisted he ask the governor about the age of the earth.

"How old do I think the earth is? You know what, I don't have any idea," Perry said. "I know it's pretty old so it goes back a long long way. I'm not sure anybody actually knows completely and absolutely how long, how old the earth is."

While Perry was answering the child's question, the mother continued to loudly whisper in the child's ear to ask him about evolution and why he doesn't believe in science.

"Here your mom was asking about evolution, and you know it's a theory that's out there, and it's got some gas in it. In Texas we teach both creationsim and evolution in our public schools," Perry said. "Because I figure you're smart enough to figure out which one is right."

Inside the restaurant, Perry was asked about his views on global warming, saying he's a "skeptic about the science." This came one day after he told New Hampshire voters he questions the theory of global warming.

"I do believe that the issue of global warming has been politicized. I think there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling in to their -- to their projects," Perry said in Bedford, N.H. Wednesday. "I think we're seeing almost weekly or even daily scientists who are coming forward and questioning the original idea that man made global warming is what is causing the climate to change."
