Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas
Peace Officers Memorial Foundation



The Peace Officers' Memorial Foundation strives to perpetuate the memory of Texas law enforcement officers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving their communities.

Since its inception in 1987, the foundationâ€™s uncompromising determination to preserve the rich history of Texas law enforcement and provide support for the families of peace officers has remained unparalleled. The foundation honors the fallen by providing assistance and support in a line of duty death.

The foundation also offers college scholarships, sponsors the biennial Memorial Service at the State Capitol and supports research to find and honor all Texas Peace Officers who throughout history have made the ultimate sacrifice. CLEAT is the founding sponsor of the foundation, which is funded solely by contributions. We do not raise money via telephone solicitations.
