Republican Fred Keller won a special election on Tuesday to fill a vacant congressional seat in Pennsylvania.

Keller, a state representative backed by President Donald Trump, easily defeated Democrat Marc Friedenberg, a Penn State professor, to win in the solidly Republican district.

Former GOP Rep. Tom Marino resigned from Congress in January, just weeks into his term and after he won reelection last November by 32 percentage points. The district, which covers northeastern and central parts of the state, voted for Trump overwhelmingly in the 2016 election, 66 percent to 30 percent, over Hillary Clinton.

The race drew little attention from national Democrats, but Trump traveled to the district on Monday for a campaign rally that also reinforced the president's reelection message in a critical Electoral College battleground.

“Our support for you was as strong today as it ever was,” Keller said standing alongside Trump in Montoursville. “In 2016, Pennsylvania put Donald Trump over the top. And in 2020, we’re going to do it again.”

Trump tweeted his support of Keller, who was long expected to win, as voters went to the polls Tuesday. “Fred is Strong on Crime, Second Amendment, Military, Vets, and Healthcare. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!” Trump tweeted.

Trump also made a last-minute push for Keller by recording a robocall.

Keller’s win fills one of the three vacant seats in the House. The other two are in North Carolina, which will fill both the 3rd and 9th district seats in elections on Sept. 10.
