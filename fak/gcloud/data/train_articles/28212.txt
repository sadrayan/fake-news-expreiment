Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations: John Bolton: 9781416552857: Amazon.com: Books
Ambassador John Bolton's "Surrender Is Not An Option" (2007 488 page hardback) is an eye-opening history from his public service career with the Bush State Department and the United Nations. Although the book presents few sources (keeping it from earning all five stars) it is informative with eight pages of black and white period photographs and 29 pages of index.



Lawyer Bolton's narrative is an eyewitness account from Barry Goldwater to George W. Bush. His Reagan administration work helped to prepare him for the Bush years (beginning as an undersecretary to Colin Powell until appointment as US Ambassador to the United Nations).



The retired Ambassador describes, with precision, various people and events that shaped history from 2000 to 2006. He has immense respect for Bork, Buckley, Powell, Rumsfeld, Cheney, McCain, and Bush (disliking, particularly, Annan, Eliasson, and career diplomats). Bolton says that US's closest friends at the UN ("Turtle Bay") are Israel, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. Canada is often a go-between among hostile nations. Britain and France at home with the UN's "culture of inaction" often vote for appeasement. On all issues Russia adopts its former Soviet politics while China remains an unknown, but predictable, factor.



Bolton, at the UN epicenter, understands the Human Rights Council to be always "directed against Israel", supports Japanese efforts for Security Council permanent membership, and witnesses Kofi Annan's deviousness, incompetence, and corruption during the Food for Oil scandal. Although he supported, and worked for, Ban Ki-moon's UN Secretary Generalship in late 2006, Bolton ends the book concerned for the South Korean's ability to change the UN's determined culture of passive inactivity.



This recommended book is a good, but long, read. Hopefully, Bolton will write more history of the United Nations.
