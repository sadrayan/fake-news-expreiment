Litigation Documents & Resources Related to Trump Executive Order on Immigration
President Donald Trump’s first executive order banning entry into the United States by immigrants and refugees from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, and his revised executive order banning entry from all those countries but Iraq, are facing legal challenges in a number of federal jurisdictions. On Sept. 24, 2017, President Trump issued a third executive order. On June 26, 2018, the Supreme Court rejected challenges to the third iteration of the ban on statutory and constitutional grounds, reversing a preliminary injunction against the ban issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Litigation remains ongoing.

Below is a roundup of the documents in ongoing litigation related to the executive orders. We will update this post as further information comes in.

Any queries or additional documents should be directed to Quinta Jurecic at [email protected].

Application (17A550) granted by the Court. The application for a stay presented to Justice Kennedy and by him referred to the Court is granted, and the District Court’s October 20, 2017 order granting a preliminary injunction is stayed pending disposition of the Government’s appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is sought. If a writ of certiorari is sought and the Court denies the petition, this order shall terminate automatically. If the Court grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, this order shall terminate when the Court enters its judgment. In light of its decision to consider the case on an expedited basis, we expect that the Court of Appeals will render its decision with appropriate dispatch. Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor would deny the application.

Amici Curiae

International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) v. Trump (U. S. Supreme Court)

This case has been remanded to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals with orders to dismiss the challenge to Executive Order 13780 as moot.

The parties are directed to file letter briefs addressing whether, or to what extent, the Proclamation issued on September 24, 2017, may render cases No. 16-1436 and 16-1540 moot. The parties should also address whether, or to what extent, the scheduled expiration of Sections 6(a) and 6(b) of Executive Order No. 13780 may render those aspects of case No. 16-1540 moot. The briefs, limited to 10 pages, are to be filed simultaneously with the Clerk and served upon opposing counsel on or before noon, Thursday, October 5, 2017. The cases are removed from the oral argument calendar, pending further order of the Court.

We granted certiorari in this case to resolve a challenge to “the temporary suspension of entry of aliens abroad under Section 2(c) of Executive Order No. 13,780.” Because that provision of the Order “expired by its own terms” on September 24, 2017, the appeal no longer presents a “live case or controversy.” Burke v. Barnes, 479 U. S. 361, 363 (1987). Following our established practice in such cases, the judgment is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit with instructions to dismiss as moot the challenge to Executive Order No. 13,780. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39 (1950). We express no view on the merits. Justice Sotomayor dissents from the order vacating the judgment below and would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.
