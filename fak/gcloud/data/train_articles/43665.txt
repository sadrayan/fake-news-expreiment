"A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies."

Editorial Notes

Washington was a strong proponent of a robust national defense. He took the opportunity of his first State of the Union address to argue that Congress should take a role in promoting the domestic manufacture of weapons and ammunition in the United States in order to avoid the supply troubles the Continental Army had faced during the Revolutionary War.
