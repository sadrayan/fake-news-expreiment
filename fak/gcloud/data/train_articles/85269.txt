Introduction

Introduction: A total of 35 states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, all of which are in force in 2018. Scroll over the map below for state-by state details.

The remaining 15 states use other methods to verify the identity of voters. Most frequently, other identifying information provided at the polling place, such as a signature, is checked against information on file. See NCSL’s Voter Verification Without ID Documents.

Please note that the information contained on this page contains information on the current, in-effect laws. A chronology of voter ID legislation since 2000 can also be found on NCSL's History of Voter ID page.

Proponents see increasing requirements for identification as a way to prevent in-person voter impersonation and increase public confidence in the election process. Opponents say there is little fraud of this kind, and the burden on voters unduly restricts the right to vote and imposes unnecessary costs and administrative burdens on elections administrators.

See State-by-State In-Effect Voter ID Requirements (Table Two, far below) for citations and details on what IDs are accepted and what happens when a voter does not have ID.
