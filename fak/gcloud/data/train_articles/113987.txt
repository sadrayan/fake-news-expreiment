Safyre Terry, who lost family to arson, receives Christmas cards as social media responds to wish

Updated

A young girl who lost her entire family to arson two years ago has asked for one thing this festive season — Christmas cards.

Safyre Terry's father, sister and two brothers died in an unsolved New York house fire in May 2013.

The eight-year-old was the only survivor and was found shielded from the flames by her father, though she suffered burns to 75 per cent of her body.

Safyre has since had over 50 operations and has lost her right hand and left foot, according to aunt and sole custodian Liz Dolder.

Ms Dolder had set up a Facebook page for the young girl, who has received a lot of support from local community organisations.

After Ms Dolder bought a card tree this year, she said Safyre was excited to fill it up but that she herself was a bit more sceptical.

"When she said she can't wait to fill up the card tree my response was 'I don't think it's gonna get filled up but I am sure we will get a few more cards'," she wrote on the Facebook page.

Ms Dolder shared a photo on the Facebook page of Safyre standing beside the tree.

The photo has since seen hundreds of thousands of views on Facebook and other social media sites like Imgur.

"I'm sure you have no idea who I am but ... your outlook on life makes me smile and your undefeatable attitude is what makes humans amazing," one card said.

Another card read: "You are a beautiful girl, and hope you will have a good Christmas."

Safyre should be expecting more to arrive in her mailbox soon, as several others have left comments on her Facebook page about sending their cards.

"It's magical," Ms Dolder told local media.

"You always hear about those horrible things happening. And for this to happen — it restores your faith in humanity."
