Enclosure: Notes respecting Tobacco, 16 March 1791
MS ( DLC : Gouverneur Morris Papers); at head of text: “Copy of the Paper referred to in the above letter.”

Morris’ cogent observations about tobacco culture were obviously framed to impress Lafayette, being far more explicit than the generalized statement he presented to Montmorin on 19 Feb. 1791 on behalf of Americans then in France (see note, Morris to TJ, 26 Feb. 1791, and enclosure). For very different reasons, Morris and TJ were both disturbed by the French decrees respecting tobacco.
