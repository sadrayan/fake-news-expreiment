That statement is demonstrably false. Most countries in the world use national law enforcement to policy their borders just like we do. Canada, for example, uses the Canadian Border Services Agency. See here:

http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/agency-agence/menu-eng.html States within the European Union have virtually open borders, with checkpoints manned by civilians. The list goes on and on. The only countries that rely on their military to police/defend their borders are nations facing severe instability involving lawlessness and/or refugees in neighboring countries and/or open warfare.

I suppose you could get into a semantic dispute over how one defines “military” and what it means to “secure” the border, but in practice there’s no question the statement is false. It’s the product of a frustrated law enforcement official facing the challenge of policing the US/Mexican border in Texas I presume, and I empathize with him. But he’s still wrong.
