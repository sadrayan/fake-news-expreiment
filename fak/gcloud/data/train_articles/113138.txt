Vicki Schneps,

WORC Founder It was 1966 when Robert Kennedy visited the Willowbrook State School and declared, "Willowbrook State School was not fit for even animals to live in." Six years later in 1972, Geraldo Rivera shocked the general public with his televised expose' on the abuse and horror that occurred at Willowbrook. It was this startling video that incited public outrage and resulted in the State of New York being charged with violating the basic human rights of those with mental retardation. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the filing of that lawsuit and the beginning of a new industry devoted to the individual development of persons with developmental disabilities and a vision of full community support and integration. WORC has a proud link to this early history through Murray and Vicki Schneps. Murray Schneps was one of the lead attorneys involved in filling the initial injunction against the State of New York. While Mr. Schneps was advocating for the Willowbrook consumers through our court system, Vicki Schneps was mobilizing her family and friends marching and picketing for the rights of her daughter, Lara, and the other people who lived at Willowbrook. It was her belief that every individual was deserving of respect and dignity, which drove her to create WORC in 1971. The efforts of Murray and Vicki Schneps, along with other pioneers in the field, were recently recognized. They were honored at a dinner celebration marking the 30th anniversary of the Willowbrook lawsuit on March 26th, 2002 at Lifespire Multi-Support Center, located on the grounds of the original Willowbrook State School.
