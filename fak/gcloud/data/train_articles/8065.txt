LaMalfa Food Stamp Reforms Added to Farm Bill
Washington, DC – Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) today successfully passed an amendment to the federal Farm Bill which requires electronic fraud prevention measures and eliminates bonus pay for signing up new recipients. Specifically, the amendment requires the use of existing electronic databases to determine whether applicants are prohibited from receiving food stamp benefits.

“The success of the food stamp program should be measured by how many Americans become self-sufficient, not how many are added to the rolls. Every dollar spent on bonuses is a dollar that doesn’t reach the families who need our help,” LaMalfa said. “Modernizing the program to ensure that assistance goes only to those who need it means that we can spend less while continuing to help friends and neighbors who have fallen on hard times.”

Congressman Doug LaMalfa is a lifelong farmer representing California’s First Congressional District including Butte, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou and Tehama Counties.
