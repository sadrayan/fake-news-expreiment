Wisconsin Deserves Better: Freedom Partners Launches $1.6 Million Ad Campaign Calling Out Senator Baldwin for Protecting a Rigged System

Post by Freedom Partners

The harder her constituents work, the more Washington takes — Senators like Tammy Baldwin are the problem

Arlington, VA – Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce today is launching a new $1.6 million television and digital ad campaign in Wisconsin highlighting Senator Tammy Baldwin’s long history of supporting higher taxes and preserving a broken system rigged against ordinary Americans. The campaign will include two ads – “$5 Trillion” and “Absolutely Wrong” – both focusing on how Baldwin’s tax policies hurt Wisconsinites, including business owners like Chris, president of Northwest Builders, Inc., whose testimonial is featured.

Baldwin has voted to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to the benefit of well-connected special interests at the expense of hardworking Americans who deserve more jobs, higher wages, and greater financial security to save and invest in their futures. She’s supported higher income taxes, sales taxes and energy taxes — making life harder and more expensive for everyone, especially those who can least afford it. As Congress moves ahead to craft legislation for comprehensive tax reform that would provide much needed relief, Baldwin remains opposed.

Wisconsin deserves better.

“$5 Trillion”





“Absolutely Wrong”



Freedom Partners spokesman Bill Riggs issued the following statement:

“When Wisconsin needed relief, Tammy Baldwin raised taxes. When Washington spent too much, Tammy Baldwin raised taxes. And now when Congress is trying to reform the tax code and let people keep more of their hard-earned money, Tammy Baldwin is standing with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to obstruct at all costs. Wisconsin deserves a Senator who will fight for more jobs, higher wages and greater financial security for all Americans. Tammy Baldwin is fighting to protect the rigged system, and Wisconsin is paying the price.”

The best thing Baldwin could do for Wisconsinites is to help pass historic tax reform that delivers a simpler, fairer and flatter tax code to create greater opportunity and a stronger economy to the benefit of all Americans. For years, Baldwin has been calling for tax reform, but instead of putting her words into action, she’s standing with Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Washington special interests fighting to protect the broken system.

Transcript: “$5 Trillion”

It seems like the harder we work the more Washington takes from us. Senators like Tammy Baldwin are the problem.

Baldwin voted for five trillion dollars in more taxes. And she voted five times to raise ours.

Baldwin supported higher income taxes, sales taxes – even energy taxes. Rigging the system against us. Standing in the way of more jobs and higher wages.

Wisconsin deserves better.

Transcript: “Absolutely Wrong”

Chris, president of Northwest Builders, Inc.:

We don’t have a team of lawyers and lobbyists who look out for our business. We just have to work hard and get the job done.

Tammy Baldwin has supported over five trillion dollars in new taxes. It’s absolutely wrong.

The hardworking folks simply can’t afford to be sending more to Washington. If Tammy Baldwin opposes tax reform, it’s proof that she opposes jobs. She opposes higher wages.

I know of nothing that she’s done to help working people like us.

Baldwin Opposed Cutting Income Taxes

Baldwin Opposed A 1996 Plan To Cut State Income Taxes By $130 Million. “The Wisconsin State Journal asked candidates in this area whether they would: A. Favor the Republican plan to cut state income taxes by $ 130 million. Can the state afford it? … Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison; says the state can’t afford large tax cut …” (Mike Flaherty, “Legislative Candidates Address Tax Cut, School Choice, Other Issues,” Wisconsin State Journal, 11/3/96)

In Comparison, Wisconsin Raised $4.1836 Billion From The Individual Income Tax In Fiscal Year 1996. (“1996 Annual Fiscal Report,” State Of Wisconsin, 10/11/96 At 7)

Baldwin Voted Against The Financial Freedom Act Of 1999. (H.R. 2488, Roll Call Vote #333: Passed 223-208: R 217-4; D 6-203; I 0-1, 7/22/99, Baldwin Voted No)

The Republican-Sponsored Tax Cut Of $792 Billion Would Have Cut Income Taxes 10 Percent Across The Board, Reduced Capital Gains Taxes, Phased Out The Death Tax, And Eased The Marriage Penalty. “House Republicans want to cut federal programs and spend budget surpluses before they materialize, charged Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. That money belongs to the American people, who should be allowed to spend it as they please, countered Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. The two lawmakers reflect the partisan divisions within the Wisconsin delegation and entire House, which on Thursday narrowly passed a Republican-sponsored tax cut of $ 792 billion over 10 years. The bill, which passed 223-208, uses up most of the projected $ 2.9 trillion surplus by gradually cutting income tax rates 10 percent across the board, reducing capital gains taxes, phasing out the so-called ‘death’ tax on real estate and easing the so-called marriage penalty. Wisconsin’s four Republicans voted for the cuts, while the five Democrats were opposed.” (Elizabeth Hurt, “Tax Debate Rages Among Wisconsin Lawmakers And Rest Of Congress,” States News Service, 7/23/99)

Baldwin Voted To Increase Income Taxes

Baldwin Voted For Representative Sander Levin’s Amendment To The American Taxpayer Relief Act Of 2012. (Levin Of Michigan Amendment To H.R. 8, Roll Call Vote #543: Failed 170-257: R 0-238; D 170-19, 8/1/12, Baldwin Voted Yea)

The Democratic Alternative Would Have Raised Taxes On Individual Income Above $200,000 And Family Income Above $250,000, Jeopardizing An Estimated 700,000 Jobs. “Last week, the Senate approved a bill that would let rates rise on annual individual income above $200,000, and annual family income above $250,000. … House Republicans allowed Democrats a vote on a proposal similar to the one the Senate approved, and predictably, it failed in a 170-257 vote, with 19 Democrats voting against their party. … John Boehner said that while Democrats claim the bill would raise taxes only on the wealthy, their proposal would hit many small business owners that would otherwise be able to create jobs. ‘Let me tell you who the so-called rich are. About a million of those people that you want to increase taxes on are small business owners,’ Boehner said. Boehner and other Republicans cited an Ernst & Young study saying that more than 700,000 jobs would be lost if taxes were raised on people with higher incomes, and said the key difference between the GOP and Democratic bill is that only their bill creates jobs.” (Pete Kasperowicz, “House Votes 256-171 To Extend All Bush-Era Individual Tax Rates,” The Hill, 8/1/12)

Baldwin Supported Higher Sales Taxes

As A Member Of The Dane County Board Of Supervisors, Baldwin Supported A 0.5-Cent County Sales Tax. “[Dane County Board candidate Jim] Bishop said students get minimal benefits from the county, and he believes Baldwin should have voted against the sales tax. The 1/2-cent sales tax, which took effect last April, has become a ‘big cookie jar’ for funding county programs, Bishop said. If elected, he said, he would seek to repeal the tax. … Baldwin said she would make a better County Board member because she’s more experienced. She believes the board made the right decision to impose the sales tax, she said.” (Joel Broadway, “Board Incumbent, Student Face Off,” Wisconsin State Journal, 3/10/92)

The Sales Tax Has Put Dane County Taxpayers On The Hook For Nearly $1 Billion:

(“2003 Dane County Adopted Budget,” Dane County Government Controller’s Office, 12/10/02; “2009 Adopted Budget,” Dane County Government Controller’s Office, 12/18/08; “2017 Adopted Budget,” Dane County Government Controller’s Office, 12/16/16 At 85)

Baldwin Voted For Online Sales Taxes

Baldwin Voted For The Marketplace Fairness Act Of 2013. (S. 743, Roll Call Vote #113: Passed 69-27: R 21-22; D 46-5; I 2-0, 5/6/13, Baldwin Voted Yea)

The Marketplace Fairness Act Would Have Allowed States And Local Governments To Require Large Internet Retailers And Other ‘Remote Sellers’ With Sales Over $1 Million Annually To Collect Sales Taxes And Send The Revenue To The Appropriate Location. “The Marketplace Fairness Act, as it’s called, would allow states and local governments to require large Internet retailers and other ‘remote sellers’ with sales over $1 million annually to collect sales taxes and send the revenue to the appropriate location. But this wouldn’t be automatic. The states would first have to pay for software that makes collection easier. States and localities would also need to simplify their tax system to make things easier for retailers — they’d have to have a single tax agency, a single tax return, and a single audit before they could require online retailers to collect.” (Brad Plumer, “Everything You Need To Know About The Senate’s Online Sales-Tax Bill,” The Washington Post’s Wonkblog, 4/22/13)

Baldwin Called This A “Pro-Growth Measure.” “U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin today voted in favor of the Marketplace Fairness Act, S. 743, which passed the Senate with bipartisan support, 69-27. ‘Today, I joined a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate in support of the Marketplace Fairness Act. This pro-growth measure will level the playing field for Wisconsin small businesses and allow local brick-and-mortar retailers to compete more effectively against out-of-state Internet sellers,’ Baldwin said.” (Press Release, “U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Levels The Playing Field For Wisconsin Small Businesses,” Senator Tammy Baldwin, 5/7/13)

Baldwin Cosponsored The Marketplace Fairness Act Of 2015. (“S.698 – Marketplace Fairness Act Of 2015,” Congress.gov, 3/10/15)

Baldwin Cosponsored The Marketplace Fairness Act Of 2017. (“S.976 – Marketplace Fairness Act Of 2017,” Congress.gov, 4/27/17)

Baldwin Voted For Higher Energy Taxes

In 2009, Baldwin Voted For The American Clean Energy And Security Act (Also Known As The Waxman-Markey Cap And Trade Bill). (H.R. 2454, Roll Call Vote #477: Passed 219-212: R 8-168; D 211-44, 6/26/09, Baldwin Voted Aye)

The American Clean Energy And Security Act Was Estimated To Raise $846 Billion Over Ten Years. “CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that over the 2010-2019 period enacting this legislation would: Increase federal revenues by about $846 billion …” (“H.R. 2454 American Clean Energy And Security Act Of 2009,” Congressional Budget Office, 6/5/09)
