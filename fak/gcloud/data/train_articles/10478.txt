The START-UP NY report badly missed its deadline and the program is completely missing its goals. Taxpayers have invested millions of dollars to promote a job-creation initiative that has turned out to be long on promises but woefully short on actual jobs.

With only 332 jobs created in 2015, it is time to reevaluate the START-UP NY program and its future. Despite political rhetoric and false Open For Business claims, this program is not working for communities across the state. If START-UP NY was truly effective, New Yorkers would not have waited three months for an update and details would not have been secretly posted on a website late on a Friday afternoon.

Multi-million dollar advertising campaigns cant sell START-UP and cant mask the fact that New Yorks oppressive business climate  made even worse during the 2016 legislative session  prohibits true economic growth.

Job creation and economic development will never by realized through gimmicks, casinos, or grant programs that choose winners and losers. New York needs serious policy reforms that reduce onerous regulations and lessen the burden of taxes and fees that stifle success and opportunity.
