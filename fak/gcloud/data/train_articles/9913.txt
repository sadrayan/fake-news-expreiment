District: Post saying Hilliard student was suspended for not participating in Walkout Day is fake
HILLIARD, OH (WCMH) — A social media post claiming a student from Hilliard City Schools was suspended for not participating in National Walkout Day is not accurate, according to the district.

The note circulating on social media dictates the Hilliard Davidson student has a one-day suspension that should be served Thursday, March 15.

Stacie Raterman, the Hilliard City Schools Director of Communications, says no students were suspended for participating or not participating in the walkout.

Jake Shoemaker, the student in question, tells NBC4 he did not want to participate in the walkout, and he did not want to go to the area where non-participants were.

“I told them I would have to be dragged out of my seat,” Jake told NBC4.

He explained his reasoning for not participating and what really happened for him to receive a suspension.

Jake’s dad’s phone number is listed on the suspension letter.

“Some of the phone calls I got people thought I was the principal,” said Scott Shoemaker. “I even got several death threats.”

NBC4 Reporter Rick Reitzel will have that and reaction from Shoemaker and his father during a live report tonight on NBC4 at 6pm.
