Cannabis smoking and lung cancer risk: Pooled analysis in the International Lung Cancer Consortium
Abstract To investigate the association between cannabis smoking and lung cancer risk, data on 2,159 lung cancer cases and 2,985 controls were pooled from 6 case-control studies in the US, Canada, UK, and New Zealand within the International Lung Cancer Consortium. Study-specific associations between cannabis smoking and lung cancer were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic factors, tobacco smoking status and pack-years; odds-ratio estimates were pooled using random effects models. Subgroup analyses were done for sex, histology and tobacco smoking status. The shapes of dose-response associations were examined using restricted cubic spline regression. The overall pooled OR for habitual versus nonhabitual or never users was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.66–1.38). Compared to nonhabitual or never users, the summary OR was 0.88 (95%CI: 0.63–1.24) for individuals who smoked 1 or more joint-equivalents of cannabis per day and 0.94 (95%CI: 0.67–1.32) for those consumed at least 10 joint-years. For adenocarcinoma cases the ORs were 1.73 (95%CI: 0.75–4.00) and 1.74 (95%CI: 0.85–3.55), respectively. However, no association was found for the squamous cell carcinoma based on small numbers. Weak associations between cannabis smoking and lung cancer were observed in never tobacco smokers. Spline modeling indicated a weak positive monotonic association between cumulative cannabis use and lung cancer, but precision was low at high exposure levels. Results from our pooled analyses provide little evidence for an increased risk of lung cancer among habitual or long-term cannabis smokers, although the possibility of potential adverse effect for heavy consumption cannot be excluded.

Background Cannabis is the world's most widely used illicit substance with between 119 million and 224 million users worldwide. In 2010, the proportion reporting use of cannabis in the past year was 2.6–5% for persons aged 15–64, with highest frequency observed in Oceania (9.1–14.6%) and North America (10.8%).[1] In the US, frequency of cannabis use has continued to rise[2] especially among teenagers, a trend that has been attributed to falling perceived risk.[1] The three main forms of cannabis products are the flower or herb (marijuana), resin (hashish), and oil (hashish oil), and their relative levels of consumption vary globally by region. Resin dominates the markets in the Near- and Middle-East as well as Southwest Asia; resin and herb markets are comparable in size in Northern Africa and Europe; whereas cannabis herb dominates the rest of the world including North America.[1] Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and use of tobacco is recognized as the main risk factor.[3-5] Cannabis is mainly consumed by smoking, and cannabis smoke shares carcinogens with tobacco smoke including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[α]pyrene and phenols.[5-7] Different smoking techniques result in 3-fold higher levels of tar and 5-fold higher levels of carbon monoxide being retained in the lungs during cannabis smoking as compared to tobacco smoking.[8] Therefore, cannabis has been hypothesized to be a risk factor for tobacco-related cancers including that of the lung. Previous studies have demonstrated precancerous histological[9, 10] and molecular abnormalities[11] in the respiratory tracts of cannabis smokers. In addition, in vitro[12] and in vivo animal studies have demonstrated the carcinogenic effects of cannabis or its constituents.[13, 14] However, epidemiological studies investigating the association between cannabis smoking and lung cancer have been limited, sample sizes generally small, and results conflicting.[15-22] Established in 2004, the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) brings together an international group of lung cancer researchers with the aim of sharing comparable data from ongoing and recently completed lung cancer case-control and cohort studies from different geographical areas and ethnicities. One of the key goals of the ILCCO is to explore potential lung cancer risk factors that are difficult to evaluate in individual studies. To address the limitations of prior studies and to further explore the link between cannabis smoking and lung cancer development, particularly nonlinear dose-response relations and associations among never tobacco smokers and other subgroups, we conducted a pooled analysis based on individual-level data from participating ILCCO studies.

Methods Data collection Details of the International Lung Cancer Consortium and the requirements for inclusion of studies have been previously published[23] and are available on the Consortium portal (http://ilcco.iarc.fr). Six ILCCO studies have collected information on cannabis smoking and contributed primary data in this pooled analysis investigating the association between cannabis smoking and lung cancer risk. Two studies had previously reported effect estimates for cannabis smoking,[15, 16] whereas the remaining studies represented unpublished data for the association of interest. All studies considered primary, incident and histologically confirmed lung cancer cases. Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects, and individual study protocols were approved by site-specific institutional ethic review boards. Deidentified data received from individual studies were checked for missing values, inadmissible values, aberrant distributions and inconsistencies. Subjects with unknown age, sex, race or habitual versus nonhabitual cannabis smoking status were excluded. An additional 6 subjects, whose joints smoked per day exceeded 40 or lifetime duration of cannabis smoking exceeded 70 years, were deemed outliers or potential data errors based on the overall distribution. The final pooled analysis sample consisted of 2,159 cases and 2,985 controls. Statistical methods Data on individual-level cannabis smoking consumption were based on self-reported responses to questions on study-specific questionnaires. We defined lifetime habitual use of cannabis as having a cumulative consumption of at least 1 joint-year (i.e., equivalent to smoking 1 joint/day for 1 year). Joint-equivalent was defined as the average cannabis plant matter contained in a typical joint or 0.75 g/joint when the unit of reporting was weight or the mode of consumption was other than joint.[24] We also harmonized variables pertaining to total duration (years) and intensity of cannabis smoking (average joint-equivalents smoked per day during periods of cannabis use); and cumulative cannabis smoking in joint-years, calculated by multiplying the first two variables for each subject. Variables for demographic characteristics and well-established lung cancer risk factors were harmonized across studies. Self-reported tobacco smoking status at interview was defined as never smokers (<100 cigarettes over lifetime or according to study-specific cut-offs), former smokers (stopped smoking at least 2 years prior to interview), and current smokers (smoked within the past 2 years). The latter two categories make up the ever group in never versus ever definition for tobacco-smoking status. For current and former tobacco smokers, cumulative tobacco smoking expressed in pack-years was calculated as the product of smoking intensity (pack-equivalent per day) and the sum of smoking periods over the person's lifetime. When education level (<3%) or tobacco pack-years were missing (<5%), values were imputed using the median of the study-, age-, and sex-specific control population for education, and the median of the study-, age-, sex-, and smoking status-specific control population for pack-years. The overall association between cannabis smoking (habitual vs. nonhabitual or never users, joint-equivalents per day, duration, total joint-years, and age of cannabis smoking onset) and the risk of all lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma (as sample size permitted) was assessed by odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) obtained from unconditional logistic regression in each study, adjusting for age, sex, race, highest education, status of tobacco smoking (never vs. ever) and pack-years of tobacco smoking (continuous). Because of collinearity and small sample sizes, models for continuous exposure variables for the Moffitt Cancer Study and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Study were restricted to the adjustment of the essential covariates: age, sex and tobacco smoking pack-years. Tobacco smoking status (never vs. ever) was additionally adjusted where possible. Study-specific effect estimates were pooled across studies using random effect models to account for heterogeneity between study populations. Interstudy heterogeneity was evaluated based on the Q-statistic and I2 statistic.[25] When the p-value for heterogeneity across studies was less than 0.05, influence analysis was performed to evaluate the source of heterogeneity from single studies using Galbraith plots,[26] and excluding the study contributing most to the Q-statistic. Stratified analyses were done to examine the associations between cannabis smoking and all lung cancer for males and females separately. As an alternative method to control for confounding by tobacco smoking, as sample sizes allowed, we also conducted analyses restricted to those who never smoked tobacco (370 cases and 1,358 controls) by pooling individual level data of never smokers from all available studies; the associations between cannabis and lung cancer risk was then assessed with unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, highest education, race and study. The shapes of nonlinear dose-response associations between the continuous exposure variables (joint equivalent per day, duration and overall joint-years) and lung cancer were examined using restricted cubic spline regression with 5 knots, adjusting for age, sex, race, highest education, tobacco smoking status (never vs. ever) and pack-years, as well as study.[27] Study-specific multivariable unconditional logistic regression and pooled analysis for never smokers were conducted in SAS, while the pooled effect estimates and restricted cubic spline analyses were done in R package.

Results The characteristics of the 6 participating case-control studies in ILCCO are summarized in Table 1. Except for one family-based study, the remaining studies include 2 that used population-based controls and 3 that used hospital or clinical-based controls that were frequency matched to cases on at least age and sex. Four studies were conducted in North America (3 in the US and 1 in Canada), while the remaining 2 studies were set in the UK and New Zealand. In all studies, cannabis consumption was assessed using self-reported levels on standard questionnaires or surveys. In total, 2,159 lung cancer cases and 2,985 controls were included in the analysis. The frequency distributions of demographic, histology and lung cancer risk factors for both the total population and never tobacco smokers are summarized in Table 2. Although the average age of controls was slightly younger than cases (median age was 53.0 ± 10.4 for controls vs. 57.3 ± 10.5 for cases), subjects were comparable with respect to sex and race distributions, with over 75% of subjects being White/Caucasian. As expected, controls were less likely than cases to have ever smoked tobacco. Squamous cell carcinoma (n = 394), adenocarcinoma (n = 913) and small cell lung cancer (n = 273) histologic subtypes make up over 70% of all cases in the study sample (Table 2). Table 1.

The estimated ORs of all lung cancer associated with habitual cannabis smokers as compared to nonhabitual or never cannabis smokers in the participating studies ranged from 0.57 (95% CI: 0.30–1.07) in the Mount Sinai Hospital-Princess Margaret Hospital (MSH-PMH) study to 2.17 (95% CI: 1.04–4.52) in the New Zealand study (Fig. 1). The overall summary OR was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.66–1.38, p for heterogeneity: 0.17) (Table 3), and there was no detectable heterogeneity in the effect estimates for studies that used population-based controls vs. hospital or clinic-based controls (p = 0.24).

Pooled, pooled OR according to a random effects model (p-heterogeneity = 0.17). Abbreviations: No.: Number; Exp.: Number exposed; CI: confidence interval. MSH-PMH study, The Mount Sinai Hospital-Princess Margaret Hospital Study; MSKCC study, The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Study; UCLA study, The University of California at Los Angeles Study. Compared to nonhabitual or never users, the pooled OR was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.63–1.24) for individuals who smoked 1 or more joint-equivalents per day and 1.03 (95%CI: 0.54–1.98) for individuals who smoked cannabis for 20 years or more (Table 3) for all lung cancer cases. Also, compared to nonhabitual or never users, the OR for those who started smoking cannabis before 19 years of age was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.62–1.19). In general, sex-specific analyses yielded results comparable to those obtained for all lung cancer cases and were therefore not presented in detail. For example, compared to nonhabitual or never cannabis users, the ORs for habitual users are 0.84 (95%CI: 0.60, 1.18) for men and 0.94 (95%CI: 0.62, 1.40) for women. The OR for those who smoked cannabis more than 20 years was 0.80 (95%CI: 0.55, 1.16) for men and 1.05 (95%CI: 0.48, 2.82) for women. No overall association between cannabis smoking and all lung cancer was detected among never tobacco smokers; habitual versus nonhabitual or never user OR was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.51–2.08). Effect estimates for the other categorical cannabis variables were too imprecise to be informative due to the small numbers of exposed cases. For example, the OR was 1.64 (95%CI: 0.45–6.00) for those who smoked 20 years or more versus those nonhabitual or never smokers (Table 3), and it was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.12–2.55) for 10 or more joint-years of cannabis use versus less than 1 joint-year. The majority of the never tobacco-smoking lung-cancer cases are female (272 out of a total of 370), and restricting the analysis to female nontobacco smokers yielded comparable results: Compared to nonhabitual or never users, the OR was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.62, 1.40) for habitual cannabis users and 1.05 (95%CI: 0.48, 2.28) for those who smoked for 20 years or more. The results for the largest histologic subgroup, adenocarcinoma, are presented in Table 4. There was a suggestive association between high intensity and cumulative cannabis smoking on adenocarcinoma lung cancer. Compared to nonhabitual or never users, the OR for users who smoked one or more joint-equivalents per day was 1.73 (95% CI: 0.75–4.00), and OR for those with cumulative exposure of 10 joint-years or more was 1.74 (95% CI: 0.85–3.55) (Table 4). Nonetheless, we observed little association with the duration of cannabis smoking; the OR was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.60–1.96) for those who smoked for 20 years or more. Only 4 of the studies have sufficient data for squamous cell carcinoma. Compared to nonhabitual or never users, the estimated OR for squamous cell carcinoma was 1.55 (95%CI: 0.35–6.87) for those who smoked one or more joint-equivalents per day and 1.58 (95%CI: 0.48–5.20) for smokers of more than 20 years. The estimated OR for the association between cumulative exposure of 10 or more joint-years (vs. less than 1 joint-year) and lung cancer was 2.35 (95%CI: 0.48–11.46). The confidence intervals were very wide due to smaller sample sizes of squamous cell carcinoma. Table 4.
