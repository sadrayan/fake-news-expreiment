BREAKING: A Witness Will Testify Against Hillary Clinton
Former Secretary of State and eternal failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton may think she can just go quietly into the night, free from consequences from the many wrongdoings she has been charged with.

However, many have still been working to hard to hold Clinton accountable. This effort reached greater visibility when President Trump called his Attorney General Jeff Sessions to more deeply investigate Clinton and her shady connections to Russia. Things just took a bad turn for Clinton when a key witness agreed to testify against her.

Glenn Simpson has been friends with the Clinton family for many years. Not coincidentally, he is also a co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS that disseminated the widely debunked fake news dossier containing over-the-top stories about Donald Trump going to Russian hotels and engaging in “golden showers.”

The Senate Judiciary Committee asked Simpson to testify about his actions to smear Trump, and he declined. After the Committee subpoenaed Simpson, however, he finally agreed to testify.

Stated Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, “However, since that time, Mr. Simpson, through his attorney, has agreed to provide a transcribed interview and requested that the subpoena compelling his attendance at Wednesday’s hearing be waived. We’ve reached an agreement on this request and have withdrawn the subpoena.”

Do you think he will share crucial information about how Hillary attempted to frame Donald Trump?
