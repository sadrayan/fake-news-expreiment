Dallas-area boosters feature prominently among Bush Center’s major donors
The mega-donors who fueled the unprecedented fundraising for the George W. Bush Presidential Center included philanthropists, corporate leaders, GOP kingmakers, ambassadors and a couple of Middle Eastern countries.

But prominent North Texas boosters — especially early on — provided the high-dollar driving force behind the more than $500 million in donations that poured into the center at Southern Methodist University.

More than 160 donors have their names chiseled on a wall at the Bush Center, signifying that they gave $1 million or more. About a of third reside in the Dallas area, and many helped jump-start George W. Bush’s political career.

The elite donor group gave the Bush Center at least $278 million and probably much more than that, according to a Dallas Morning News analysis.

“The selection of Dallas and SMU has to be considered a big part of their success,�? said Dallas developer Harlan Crow, whose family donated $10 million. “For Texas to honor our native son, it’s just the right thing to do.�?

The Bush Center — set to be dedicated Thursday and open to the public May 1 — has proved a fundraising powerhouse.

More than 325,000 donors helped the center surpass the initial goal of $300 million to build the complex and launch the George W. Bush Institute, a public policy think tank.

“Some donations were large. Most were small,�? said Mark Langdale, president of the George W. Bush Foundation, which funds the center.

Even though the Bush Center must release general financial information, it’s difficult to ascertain the center’s full fiscal picture. The center, like other presidential libraries, it isn’t required to disclose specific gifts or donors’ names, and not all names were released.

‘Who’s who’ of Dallas

Most donors will be listed in the “Freedom Registry,�? which visitors will be able to scroll through on two computers near the center’s entrance. The names of major donors are etched on the wall, which The News reviewed this week.

The group is a veritable “who’s who�? of Dallas’ elite: Kenneth and Ruth Collins Altshuler, Rusty and Deedie Rose, the Hunt family, Gene and Jerry Jones, Jan and Trevor Rees-Jones, Tom and Cinda Hicks, and Sarah and Ross Perot Jr.

That local focus was by design.

Bush said in an interview that part of SMU’s appeal was that “the alumni base pledged they would help fund the facility.�? Cary Maguire, an SMU trustee emeritus, said area support was crucial in proving the “viability�? of the city and university.

“The Bush committee could’ve looked at other universities,�? said Maguire, who gave $1 million. “It was important to show good faith that the university and the community was really behind it.�?

Bush’s vast political network also features prominently among the large donor group.

A dozen former ambassadors gave major gifts, as did former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, former Commerce Secretary Don Evans and former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao.

Among the notable GOP boosters are casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, the late Dallas businessman Fred Meyer, the late Houston homebuilder Bob Perry, Dallas businessman Harold Simmons and Amway co-founder Richard DeVos.

Included are about 30 “pioneers,�? who raised more than $100,000 for a Bush presidential campaign, according to data by Texans for Public Justice, which tracks campaign funds. Nearly 20 were “rangers�? for Bush’s re-election, meaning they raised more than $200,000.

All told, the Bush Center’s known mega-donors directly gave at least $480,000 to Bush’s two presidential campaigns, according to a News review of campaign finance databases maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics.

Donor secrecy

The secretive nature of high-dollar donations to presidential libraries often raises questions, though legislation to require more transparency has repeatedly fizzled.

Meredith McGehee, policy director for the Campaign Legal Center watchdog group, said the biggest issues are presidents raising money in office and the “pitfalls of access, influence and conflict of interest.�?

Unlike political campaigns, presidential library fundraisers can take foreign donations. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, for instance, each gave the Bush Center $1 million or more after Bush left office.

There have also been connections between presidential pardons and library donations. Former President Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich — accused of tax evasion — after the financier’s ex-wife donated to Clinton’s library.

An initial review of the Bush Center’s major donors showed no apparent ties to pardons.

But a top Bush Center booster, California investor Elliott Broidy, pleaded guilty in 2009 to a role in a corruption scandal. Another big donor, Dallas oilman and major SMU supporter Edwin L. Cox, had his son pardoned by former President George H.W. Bush.

Bush Center officials declined to discuss individual donors and focused instead on how the center’s George W. Bush Institute has been a particular draw for philanthropists, corporations and others. The think tank centers on issues like education reform, global health and military service.

Among those giving specifically to the institute, which launched in late 2009: The News Corp. Foundation, AT&T, the Sid W. Richardson Foundation and the Bass Foundation.

“We share the Bushes’ commitment to improving public education in Texas and around the country,�? said former U.S. Rep. Pete Geren, D-Fort Worth, who heads the Richardson and Bass foundations. “We’re pleased to see the progress they’ve already made.�?
