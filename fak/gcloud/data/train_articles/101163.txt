No need to polish Kalla for debate: Anies
Spokesman for the Joko "Jokowi" Widodo-Jusuf Kalla presidential ticket, Anies Baswedan, has said there is no need to train Kalla in how to present himself for the fourth debate on Sunday.

"His [Kalla'] strength lies in his authenticity," Anies told tempo.co on Friday.

Anies said that both Jokowi and Kalla had their own characteristics that did not need any manipulation to make them appear better on television. While Jokowi had a simpler style, he said, Kalla possessed a different oratory style.

He added that the pair's campaign team had not focused too much on changing the former vice president's style, given his already extensive experience in front of the camera.

However, Anies acknowledged that Kalla would still be provided with some training and debate-material preparation.

Coordinator of the Jokowi-Kalla debate team, Murarar Sirait, agreed with Anies' assessment, saying that both men should be allowed to be themselves during the debate.

The fourth debate will be a vice-presidential debate focusing on developing human resources and science and technology.

The debate will be broadcast live on RCTI and MNC TV on Sunday at 8:30 p.m., half an hour later than the three previous debates.(fess)
