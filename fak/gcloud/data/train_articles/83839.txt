BinC Watch: Donald Trump Has Now Changed His Mind on the Minimum Wage Three Times In Three Days
Does Donald Trump think we should raise the federal minimum wage? Let's roll the tape:

November 10, 2015: NO! CAVUTO: So do not raise the minimum wage? TRUMP: I would not do it. May 8, 2016: YES! I think people have to get more....Sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. May 8, 2016: NO! I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour....I think people should get more....But I would say let the states decide. May 11, 2016: YES! Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaâ€”asking for increase!

So what does Trump really think about the minimum wage? There's no telling. Maybe he really has changed his mind over and over. Maybe he didn't realize there were separate state and federal minimum wages until someone clued him in on May 8. But his tweet today sure makes it clear that he wants an increase in the federal minimum wage. He even capitalized it to make sure we got the point. I wonder how long we'll have to wait before he claims he never said this and he really wants the states to decide after all?

It's easy to write this off to Trump's general buffoonery, and that would be fair. What gets me is that his fans continue to believe everything he says even though he does stuff like this all the time. Do they really believe he's going to build a wall? Why? I don't think it would take him more than a few days in office to change his mind and insist that he had said all along that everything was up for negotiation.
