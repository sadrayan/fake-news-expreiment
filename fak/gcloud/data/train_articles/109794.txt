Donald Trump is selling a subscription box no one asked for
President Donald Trump will reportedly take a page from the subscription box business model with his own monthly box full of stuff people probably don't want.

As CNN reporter Betsy Klein tweeted Monday, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee will offer "Big League Boxes," packed with "exclusive and vintage" (read: old) Trump merchandise and delivered monthly to recurring donors' doors.

Dave Levinthal of the Center for Public Integrity noted that the starting price for a Big League Box is a monthly donation of $69 toward Trump's reelection campaign.

The takeaway: Trump really wants everyone to know that he's been saying "big league," and not "bigly."
