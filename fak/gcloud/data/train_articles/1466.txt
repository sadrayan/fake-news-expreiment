Florida's universities allowed to increase tuition 15 percent
The cost of attending college is rising swiftly again at Florida's 11 public universities.

Students will have to pay 15 percent more in tuition this fall, after the Florida Board of Governors on Thursday allowed each university to add a 7 percent "tuition differential" to the 8 percent increase already approved by the Legislature in April.

Student fees are going up as well, bringing the required costs of college to an average of $5,440 per year for a full-time student taking 15 hours a semester. Some universities, such as Florida State University and the University of South Florida, are charging as much as $5,800. For five universities, it's the fourth year in a row for a 15 percent increase.

"To keep seeing 15 percent increases year after year is alarming," said Ayden Maher, student government president at Florida Atlantic University. "One of the reasons students come to our schools and our state is because of affordability."

Universities say that the increases are needed to offset state budget cuts and that Florida's colleges remain a good deal. Florida used to have the lowest tuition in the country; a 2010 study showed it's now the 48th lowest, ahead of Louisiana and Wyoming.

Here are some commonly asked questions about college costs.

Q: Why are tuition and fees higher at some state universities than others?

A: Before 2007, most universities charged roughly the same amount. Then the state allowed the University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of South Florida to charge a "tuition differential," an amount above the rate set by the state. In 2008, the University of Central Florida and Florida International University were added. The remaining six universities received authority in 2009.

Universities can also levy their own fees. Schools with long-established sports programs, such as UF and FSU, charge less in athletic fees than those with newer programs.
