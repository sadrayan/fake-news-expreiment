The end of McDonald's Dollar Menu as we know it
McDonald's is tweaking its fabled Dollar Menu to try and rise out of its sales slump.

McDonald's (MCD) renamed the menu Dollar Menu & More. Some of the items will still cost a dollar, but other items will cost more.

It sent this tweet from its official account on Wednesday: "Dollar Menu fans, don't worry...our new Dollar Menu & More will offer many options that are still $1 and some new choices too!"

The new menu will officially roll out on Nov. 4, according to a McDonald's spokeswoman, who said it will include some new items, which she declined to identify.

McDonald's could use a revenue boost. Last week, the fast food giant reported disappointing same-store sales, up less than 1% worldwide for the quarter compared to the prior year.

The company fared particularly badly outside of the U.S., with same-store sales dropping 1.4% in the Middle East, Africa and the Asia/Pacific region. Operating income plunged 12% in China, Japan and Australia because of an "ongoing challenging environment."

In test markets like New York City, a similar menu called the Extra Value Menu & More is already available. A worker at a Manhattan restaurant featuring an Extra Value Menu & More said it's been on offer since at least February, when he started working there.

At that restaurant, the following items are still available for $1: two slices of apple pie, two bags of apple slices, and a "cone" (presumably with ice cream in it, but the menu didn't specify.)

Most of the other items cost a dollar and change, including the McDouble and McChicken, which each go for $1.69, and the four-piece McNugget, which costs $1.59.

The prices climb higher from there; the double cheeseburger costs $2.19 and the McFlurry is priced at $2.89. The most expensive item on the Extra Value Menu & More was the 20-piece McNugget for $4.99.
