Tampa for Yemen: An Emergency Benefit Dinner for Yemen with Ilhan Omar
If Yemen was 100 people:

80 need aid to survive

60 barely have anything to eat

58 have no access to clean water

52 have no access to healthcare

11 are severely malnourished

But Yemen is not 100 people. It’s 30.5 million people.

And right now, more than 24 million Yemenis are trapped in what’s being called the world’s “worst humanitarian crisis.”
