Earlier this year, you were widely quoted saying the change in law partly explained your willingness to consider non-UT jobs including your current position. Does that hold up? Anything you’d add?

(Steiner) Yes. That holds up. One part of the law that I think is unfair is that it is required for public universities but not private universities. It might be worth noting that the University of Pennsylvania is a private university. That isn’t widely known outside of university circles.
