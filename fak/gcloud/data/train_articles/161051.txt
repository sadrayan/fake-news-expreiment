The annual Tribal Nations Conference gave President Obama another chance Thursday to call on the Washington Redskins football team to change its nickname.

The nation needs to "break stereotypes," Obama told delegates from various Native American nations, and "I believe that includes our sports teams."

Later, Obama praised the Adidas company for offering to help schools with Native American mascots to change their sports branding.

"I don't know if Adidas made the same offer to a certain NFL team here in Washington," Obama said. "But they might want to think about that as well."

Redskins officials, saying the name is not offensive, have so far resisted calls to change their name, including those from the president.
