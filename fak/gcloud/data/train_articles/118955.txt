US President Obama Visits Dresden
US President Barack Obama chats with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a bilateral meeting in the 'Gruenes Gewoelbe' at Dresden Castle on June 5, 2009 in the center of the eastern German town of Dresden, where Allied bombing in the final months of World War II flattened the city in 1945 and killed an estimated 35,000 people. After policy talks and a news conference in Dresden, Obama and Merkel are due to travel to Buchenwald, the former Nazi concentration camp where more than 56,000 prisoners died in horrendous conditions.
