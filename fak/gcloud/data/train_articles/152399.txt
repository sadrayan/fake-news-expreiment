LPT: If you are in a natural disaster, place your valuables in your dishwasher. It is waterproof.

I can't take credit for this; I saw it on a Hurricane Harvey post. But I thought it deserved to be out there more!

Edit: Perhaps a washer or dryer would be better, as they are generally waterproof. If you have a top loader, set the lock on it before evacuating, so it will remain waterproof. If you have a side load washer and dryer, I believe just shutting the machines will waterproof them.

Edit #2: Instead of a dish washer or clothes washer, perhaps put your valuables in several layers of trash bags in a waterproof tub/safe! You could, however, put stuff in the dishwasher to distract potential looters! ;)
