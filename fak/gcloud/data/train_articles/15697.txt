Subject: RE: Following up

Could you be more specific about Texas on this question: How many people were employed by the pipeline in Texas at the time Cornyn made his statement?

We don’t segment our workforce in the way you are looking for – either employees or full-time contractors – by segments of pipeline. We have people working in our terminals, supporting pipeline operations, providing support in a variety of roles that may not even be located “on the pipeline.” We have almost 750 employees and full-time contractors based in Texas alone – and many of them will provide some level of support to our oil operations and maintenance there. That doesn’t include people in other parts of the U.S. who would provide support or expertise to pipeline operations in Texas, or who may be considered “corporate overhead”. Some of our people in Texas may also support other parts of our operations. For example, an environmental inspector or field technician may support a number of things, which is why it is hard to give an exact number for you. Once a project is completed it then becomes part of our operations organization but we don’t maintain separate silos of people who work on a single project.
