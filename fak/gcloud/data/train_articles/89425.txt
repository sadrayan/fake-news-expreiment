'Forensic investigation' financed by union blasts Raimondo's handling of R.I. pension fund
Financial industry critic Edward "Ted" Siedle alleges multiple potential and actual violations of state and federal law.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- In a scathing report commissioned by the largest state employees union, national financial industry critic Edward "Ted" Siedle accuses Gen. Treas. Gina Raimondo of selling out Rhode Island's public workers and retirees to create an "opportunity to enrich herself and her hedge fund backers.''

Siedle titled the report, unveiled Thursday afternoon at the Charles Street headquarters of Rhode Island Council 94, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, "Rhode Island Public Pension Reform: Wall Street's License to Steal.''

"Two years ago, Rhode Island's state pension fund fell victim to a Wall Street coup,'' the report begins.

"It happened when Gina Raimondo, a venture capital manager with an uncertain investment track record of only a few years -- a principal in a firm that had been hired by the state to manage a paltry $5 million in pension assets -- got herself elected [general treasurer] ... with the financial backing of out-of-state hedge fund managers.

"In short, the foxes (money managers) had taken over management of the henhouse (the pension),'' the report says.

Siedle alleges multiple potential and actual violations of state and federal law and repeatedly calls on "law enforcement and securities regulators'' to investigate.

He accuses Raimondo of "misleading the public as to fundamental investment matters, such as the true costs and risks related to investing in hedge, private equity, and venture capital funds ... understating the investment expenses and risks ... [and] misrepresenting the financial condition of the state of Rhode Island to investors.''

"In our opinion ...an investigation by state or federal securities regulators would reveal intentional withholding of material information and misrepresentations regarding state pension costs,'' he wrote.

Among his over-arching conclusions: "The Treasurer has emerged as the leading national advocate of a disingenuous form of public pension 'reform' which involves slashing worker's benefits and thwarting public access to information regarding the riskiest of pension investments while, in secret, dramatically increasing the risks to retirement plans and the fees they pay to Wall Street.''

"In summary, the likelihood that any meaningful COLA will ever be paid in the future under the new statutory scheme is remote -- a fact which has not been shared with workers and retirees.''

Democrat Raimondo, a likely candidate for governor in 2014, has not yet had a chance to comment on Siedle's report. But responding to past criticisms, she has said the changes in the pension system were necessary to address chronic underfunding and protect retirees' pensions.

She has defended the hedge fund investments as a way to mitigate potential losses in any future economic downturn.

Raimondo was the architect of the sweeping 2011 pension overhaul, passed by the Democrat controlled General Assembly to address what was seen as a severe pension-funding crisis. The overhaul raised the minimum retirement age, suspended annual cost-of-living increases and replaced the state's defined-benefit pension with a hybrid that includes a 401k-style plan.

Council 94 is among the public employees unions who brought a lawsuit seeking to overturn the pension overhaul and, at the very least, reinstate annual COLAs. The case is pending in Superior Court.

The Siedle report echoes and expands on the criticism that Siedle, a former federal securities lawyer and investment banker, lobbed at Raimondo earlier this year in a series of online columns for Forbes magazine.

In those columns, he called Raimondo's decision, approved by the pension fund investment committee, to put $1 billion of the state's $7.6-billion pension fund into hedge funds a "blatant Wall Street gorging," given the risks, high fees and lack of transparency in the industry.

According to Siedle, his company -- Benchmark Financial Services, Inc -.- was hired May 30 by Council 94 to "provide a preliminary expert forensic review'' of the investments made on behalf of the Employee Retirement System of Rhode Island.

"We were also asked to examine whether the Treasurer's so-called reform agenda was actually enhancing the security and sustainability of ERSRI and the true costs and risks of the sweeping changes she has implemented.''

He also delved into Raimondo's personal gains from her blind-trust holdings in what Siedle describes as "two illiquid, opaque venture capital partnerships she formerly managed at Point Judith Capital,'' in which the state pension fund has a $5 million investment.

The state has paid Point Judith $767,353 in management fees since 2007, according to the treasurer's office.

Raimondo derived between $201,000 and $500,000 in personal income last year from the "Raimondo blind trust'' in which she placed those holdings, according to her most recent financial disclosure filings with the state Ethics Commission.

Siedle raised conflict-of-interest question about the extent of the state's rights, as a limited partner, in Point Judith "investment decisions ... the exercise of which may conflict with her financial interests.''

He also questioned whether Raimondo as a "Point Judith insider ... may have been granted special rights more favorable than those granted to the state,'' and "a share of the incentive allocation, management fee or other amounts earned by the general partner or its affiliates.''

"Ironically, the Blind Trust scheme she proposed to the Ethics Commission coupled with her nondisclosure policy ... has resulted in only the public being "blind" as to the Point Judith II fund,'' he wrote.

Siedle acknowledges that "forensic investigations of pension require access to evidence.''

He said the treasurer's office charged approximately $5,000 for the records it produced for him, but was unwilling to provide "fundamental investment information ... such as the level of investment advisory, performance and other fees paid for money management.''

He labeled this a violation of the state's open-records law, despite Raimondo's claim "the state is contractually obliged'' to let certain money managers decide what "supposedly proprietary information" it can release.

He also challenged the core-argument for investment of public-pension dollars in hedge funds. Of the $70 million in investment fees the state paid last year, $45 million went to 18 hedge funds.

While Raimondo touts the relative "protection'' of hedge fund investment against another market crash, Siedle said he obtained "offering memoranda'' that "prominently warn that an investment in a hedge fund is speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and is only suitable for persons who are willing and able to assume the risk of losing their entire investment -- hardly an appropriate investment for a public pension plan.''

Siedle recommends his report be provided to securities regulators and law enforcement for appropriate action.

"In our opinion, based upon our knowledge of pension investment operations, an investigation by state or federal securities regulators would reveal intentional misrepresentations and manipulation of ERSRI's disclosed investment expenses,'' he wrote.
