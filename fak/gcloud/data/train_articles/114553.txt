We have volunteer Soldier "contacts" on the "Where To Send" page. They list what the folks they represent want and need. Click through the names and YOU select who YOU wish to support, then YOU send direct to them. We have a unique search capability so you can easily identify what the troops need, who you wish to support, etc. All the Soldiers involved in this effort are military volunteers stationed in areas that are overseas. You send your support (letters and/or packages) addressed to them and when they see the "Attn: Any Soldier Â® " line in their address they put your letters and packages into the hands of Soldiers who don't get much or any mail first. Everything is shared.
