Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine release tax returns while Donald Trump defies decades-old tradition of disclosure

Today, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 personal tax return and Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of their returns.

“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency as she releases her 2015 personal tax return and builds on the Clintons’ tradition of making their returns public since 1977 and Kaine releases 10 years of his returns,” said Hillary for America communications director Jennifer Palmieri. “In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns. He has failed to provide the public with the most basic financial information disclosed by every major candidate in the last 40 years. What is he trying to hide?”

In 2015, the Clintons paid an effective federal income tax rate of 34.2 percent and an effective state and local income tax rate of 9 percent for a combined federal, state, and local effective tax rate of 43.2 percent. They donated 9.8 percent of their adjusted gross income to charity.

Clinton’s and Kaine’s newly released returns have been added alongside the past eight years of Clinton’s personal tax returns, covering 2007–2014. This supplements the public release of the Clinton family’s tax returns from 2000–2006 during her 2008 campaign, returns from 1992–1999 disclosed annually during her husband’s tenure in the White House, and prior returns released by her husband’s presidential campaign. All told, the Clintons have made their tax returns public for every year dating back to 1977.

The table below shows the effective federal tax rate, effective state and local tax rate, and the combined effective federal, state and local rate.
