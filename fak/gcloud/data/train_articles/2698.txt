Brat Statement on Repealing Death Tax
WASHINGTON (April 16, 2015) – “Today, I voted for H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015, which would permanently end the federal estate tax’s chokehold over American families.

“This tax currently seizes up to 40% of a person's property upon death, often on property that has been taxed once already. Regardless of the wealth of those who are hit with it, this tax is just plain immoral. And it’s not just the super wealthy who are affected. It’s also small business owners and farmers whose wealth may not be in cash and stocks, but in the value of their land and equipment.

“Our government ought not punish those who subscribe to the American dream. Central to that ideal is the underlying principle that, through entrepreneurship, thrift, and tenacity, people should be able to leave to their children a better quality of life than perhaps they had. My constituents and their children – not politicians – are entitled to be the primary benefactors of the fruits of their own labor. Our government should work to ensure and protect that fundamental principle.
