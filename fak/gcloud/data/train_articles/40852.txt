IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2017 prices here donâ€™t reflect the lower costs an applicant may qualify for based on household size and income. Many people who apply will qualify for reduced costs through tax credits that are automatically applied to monthly premiums. These credits will significantly lower the prices shown for many of those applying. Final price quotes are available only after someone has completed a Marketplace application.

2017 data is also available on stand-alone dental plans. See available stand-alone dental plans.
