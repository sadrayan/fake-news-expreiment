Ted Cruz Heckled Out of D.C. Restaurant: ‘We Believe Survivors!’
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) was forced out of the D.C. restaurant Fiola on Monday night by protesters denouncing his friendship with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. An activist group posted a video on Twitter showing Cruz and his wife being chased out of the restaurant by protesters chanting “We believe survivors!” At one point, a man tells Cruz that Beto O’Rourke, the Democrat running against him in November, is “way hotter” than him. Another asks if he will “confirm [his] best friend Brett Kavanaugh?” Cruz then tells the loud crowd “God bless you” and asks them to let his wife through. In a separate clip, a woman claiming to be his constituent asks him how he will vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation and if he “believes survivors.” Cruz responds, “God bless you, ma’am.” Protesters also gathered outside Cruz’s Austin office earlier Monday to support Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, who have both accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. O'Rourke responded to his opponent’s ouster via Twitter with support for the Cruz family. “Not right that Senator Cruz and his wife Heidi were surrounded and forced to leave a restaurant last night because of protesters,” he wrote. “The Cruz family should be treated with respect.”
