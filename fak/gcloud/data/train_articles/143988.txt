Why we can’t wait:

How youth are responsible for social change and what we can do about it

Alexandria’s talk will focus on the role of youth in the Civil Rights and other social change movements. She’ll share some stories from her work in the South Bronx, and will explore current trends to identify what we can do together to contribute toward a better world.

Alexandria founded Brook Avenue Press, a social enterprise dedicated to providing relevant educational products to children and parents in urban areas. Recently, she partnered with the Sunshine Bronx Business Incubator to design entrepreneurial curricula for those interested in launching their own enterprise. They use methods informed by the collective real-world experiences of Sunshine’s large community of successful start-up entrepreneurs. Her primary interests lie in entrepreneurship and developing innovative, healthy, enterprising communities for generations to come.
