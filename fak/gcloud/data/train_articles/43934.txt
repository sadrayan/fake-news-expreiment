National Public Safety Partnership
About

The National Public Safety Partnership (PSP) was established in June 2017 by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in response to President Trump’s Executive Order on a Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, which emphasizes the role of DOJ in combating violent crime and states:

“The Department of Justice shall take the lead on federal actions to support law enforcement efforts nationwide and to collaborate with state, tribal, and local jurisdictions to restore public safety to all of our communities.”

PSP provides an innovative framework for DOJ to enhance its support of state, tribal, and local law enforcement officers and prosecutors in the investigation, prosecution, and deterrence of violent crime, especially crime related to gun violence, gangs, and drug trafficking. This approach serves as a platform for DOJ to directly engage with cities to identify and prioritize resources that will help local communities address their violent crime crises.

PSP serves as a DOJ -wide program that enables cities to consult with and receive coordinated training and technical assistance and an array of resources from DOJ to enhance local violence reduction strategies. This model enables DOJ to provide American cities of different sizes and diverse needs with data-driven, evidence-based strategies tailored to the unique local needs of participating cities to address serious violent crime challenges tailored to their unique local needs.
