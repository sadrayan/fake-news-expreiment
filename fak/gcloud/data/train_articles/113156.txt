Apollo11
At 4:17 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, on July 20, 1969 Neil Armstrong was seen on television by millions of people around the world apparently walking on the surface of the moon, and making one giant leap into the pages of history. BUT DID HE? Conspiracy theories abound on the Internet.

We have obtained footage - apparently authenticated by THIS document - showing that the Apollo 11 moon landing footage was faked.

As this footage reveals, the event was actually recorded, presumably by a group of covert operatives in a film studio at an unknown location. An elaborate stage set had been built to resemble what would have been the Apollo Eagle landing craft on the surface of the moon.

The rumours are true. The world has been hoaxed.

Conspiracy theorists blame the Nixon Government, which was unable to maintain the huge spending budget necessary to continue a Military Space Program of such magnitude. They felt defeated by the successful Russian launch of the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin, and were desperate to prove their dominance in the Cold War by 'winning' the Space Race: FACT.

As millions of trusting viewers watched the transmission of this footage, the world was completely deceived.

It is undeniable that the film of this "Moon Landing", with a global audience of millions, was the perfect propaganda opportunity for a high level covert organisation with untrustworthy ulterior motives.

The moon landing footage was faked.
