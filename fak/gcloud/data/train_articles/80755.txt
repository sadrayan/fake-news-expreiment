Walker alters state's welcoming signs
The road signs welcoming visitors to Wisconsin have been altered to add the words "Open for Business."

Gov. Walker ordered the change for the 23 welcoming signs around the state. Traditionally, the signs included the name of the governor.

Now Walker has put "Open for Business" up instead.

“These signs proudly proclaim Wisconsin is open for business,” Walker said in a statement. “Along with the symbolic nature of these signs, there are going to be substantive changes to the way our state government treats job creators."
