I am not sure about the latest AFGR figures, but here is a link to our attrition analysis that we have done for 30-years and counting. I excerpted the Method below.

IDRA’s attrition studies involve an analysis of ninth-grade enrollment figures and twelfth-grade enrollment figures three years later. IDRA adjusts the expected grade 12 enrollment based on increasing or declining enrollment in grades 9-12. This period represents the time span during which a student would be enrolled in high school. IDRA collects and uses high school enrollment data from the TEA Fall Membership Survey to compute countywide and statewide attrition rates by race-ethnicity and gender (see box on Page 10). Enrollment data from special school districts (military schools, state schools, charter schools) are excluded from the analyses because they are likely to have unstable enrollments or lack a tax base for school programs.
