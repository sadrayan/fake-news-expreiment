More from the Guardian’s Sam Levin in Oakland.



There was a huge crowd of protesters outside city hall in Oakland, considered one of the most liberal cities in the country.

A lone pro-gun protester showed up with a large “SUPPORT THE NRA” sign that towered above the crowd.

Protesters, including many high school students, repeatedly shouted him down, some linking hands and forming a circle around him.

“Talk to the kids! Talk to the kids!” they shouted.



There was also a strong showing of teachers at the Oakland rally, which took off just before a sister protest in San Francisco across the bay.
