Michie's Annotated Code of Maryland is the most current public record of all statutes still in force in the State of Maryland. The "Annotated" in the title refers to a variety of relevant information which may be appended to the text of a specific law. This information may include references to earlier editions of the Code, appellate court decisions where the point of law was quoted or cited, a discussion of the way the law was applied in a specific case, or a reference to a legal periodical article on the subject.

A print copy of Michie's Annotated Code of Maryland is available at Hornbake Library Maryland Room Maryland Reference KFM 12 1973.A4.
