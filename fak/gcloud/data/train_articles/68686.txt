The U.S District Attorney Has Announced That He Will Be Pursuing Charges Of TREASON Against The Former President Barack Obama!

As we all know Obama’s presidency brought this country to the worst level ever. Soon after he left the Office he came back with the shadow government scandal. His plan was to take down President Trump.

The President took oath in office in the best moment possible. When Trump was sworn in as US President, he signed an executive order, that reversed a previous order signed by Barack Obama just days before he left office. He was caught in the mess Obama created, and luckily, he found a way to sort things out.

One of the many things he did before leaving was removing Dana Boente from his position behind Attorney General as second in line.

Dana Boente was bumped down the power scale without any explanation from Obama, but with his renewed authority, it is alleged he now says he will bring charges against any liberals or Democrats that are working to undermine the president. It’s widely believed that Obama, along with Hillary Clinton, is working with the Deep State in a bid to overthrow Trump’s presidency by inciting riots across America which Boente considers to be an act of domestic terrorism.

It seems like the FBI has enough evidence to implicate the former president for sedition and treason.

We all hope that justice will find its way.
