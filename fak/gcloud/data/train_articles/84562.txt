Bexar GOP wants Straus replaced as speaker for lack of party fidelity
With a special legislative session he has little use for just days away, House Speaker Joe Straus got a vote of no confidence Monday night from the county Republican Party in San Antonio, his hometown.

On a 36-28 vote, the executive committee of the Bexar County GOP approved a resolution, “that there should be a change in leadership in the Texas House speakership due to the non-support of the Republican Party of Texas platform by the current incumbent.”

The resolution, which wasn’t on the agenda, drew the support of only a fraction of the county’s 244 precinct chairs who make up the executive committee, and Bexar County Chairman Robert Stovall, who attempted to rule it out of order, said the outcome would have been different if more members had known about it and showed up.

The resolution was another sour note for Straus, who is facing a special session that commences Tuesday in which he is the odd man out among the Big Three — Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov.
