Stories from Syrian Refugees
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC Lebanon) 31 May 2013 The ICRC has been present in Iraq since the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war

in 1980. Protection activities focus on people detained by Iraqi

authorities, including Kurdistan regional authorities. ICRC delegates

visit tens of thousands of detainees throughout the country, talk to them

in private, and provide the relevant authorities with confidential

feedback on the detaineesâ€™ treatment and living conditions.



The visits also enable detainees to keep in touch with their loved ones,

through Red Cross Messages, distributed in cooperation with the Iraqi Red

Crescent Society to families in Iraq and abroad. The ICRC, in close

cooperation with the respective governments, is also following the fate of

thousands of missing persons as a result of the several conflicts in the

region, and provides support and expertise in forensic medicine as well as

in conducting joint excavation missions.



Assistance activities, which focus on remote and neglected areas prone to

violence, involve helping IDPs and residents restore their livelihood,

with a focus on households headed by women, supporting primary health care

centres and physical rehabilitation centres through the provision of

material and training of medical personal and repairing and upgrading

water, sanitation, health and detention infrastructure.



The ICRC also continues to promote IHL among weapon bearers and to support

the Iraqi Red Crescent Society in building up its capacities in the field

of First Aid and Disaster Management.



In a nutshell, in 2012 the ICRC:

- further extended its operational out-reach into remote areas prone to

violence in the centre of the country and the disputed territories;

- conducted 231 visits to 109 places of detention holding approximately

38'161 detainees under Iraqi central or Kurdish authorities;

care for 1'844'522 residents, IDPs and returnees through the

rehabilitation of water and health infrastructure, material support,
