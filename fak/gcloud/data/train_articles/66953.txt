Trump: If I win, I’ll send Syrian refugees back
ADVERTISEMENT “I’m putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of this mass migration,” he told an audience in Keene, N.H.

“If I win, they’re going back. They’re going back. I’m telling you. They’re going back.”

Trump last week accused his GOP rivals of seeking to “start World War III over Syria.”

He suggested at the time that the U.S. should let Russia take up the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
