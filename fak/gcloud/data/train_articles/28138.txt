How Tax is calculated

The amount of tax charged on your order depends on many factors including the following:

The identity of the seller

The type of item or service purchased

The time and location of fulfillment

The shipment or delivery address of your order

These factors can change between the time you place an order and when your shipment is complete. As a result, the tax calculated on your order may change. We provide an "Estimated Tax" is displayed at Check Out when confirming an order. The amounts displayed as estimated tax may then be updated later when your order is finalized and completed.

The tax rate applied to your order will be the combined state and local rates of the address where your order is delivered to or fulfilled from. For example, if you live in a state that does not impose a sales tax, you may still see tax calculated on your order if shipped to another state. Moreover, the tax rates applied to your order may also be different for a variety of reasons, such as a shipment to a residential home versus a business address. Also, the total selling price of an item will generally include item-level shipping and handling charges, item level discounts, and gift wrapping charges. If applied at an order level, these charges, may be allocated to the individual items in an order.

Note:

No tax is charged when purchasing gift cards; however, purchases paid for with gift cards may be subject to tax.
