Cohasset Police seize 100 firearms and military shells from Doane Street home
Cohasset police seized approximately 100 unsecured weapons including shotguns, rifles and pistols from 50 Doane St. Friday afternoon. A Navy unit out of Newport, R.I. took custody of five military-grade ordnance shells also found in the home.

Police received information from a credible source that the resident at that address had numerous unsecured rifles and shotguns strewn about his house and as a result, obtained a search warrant issued by a Clerk Magistrate at Quincy District Court. They executed the search warrant at 2 p.m.

When the military shells were found, officers backed out of the home and notified the Massachusetts State Police Bomb Squad. Members of the bomb squad arrived, assessed the shells, notified the United States Navy, and requested that they respond to take custody of the items. It is not known if the shells are live or not.

Chief Bill Quigley explained that under state law firearms have to be secured in a locked cabinet or with a trigger lock. The 65-year-old man, who lives alone, did have a license to possess rifles and shotguns, which was revoked by Quigley on Friday. All of his weapons have been seized.

“There are no more firearms in the house and in the adjacent building which he also owns that was searched as well,” Quigley said.

This case remains under investigation by the Cohasset Police.
