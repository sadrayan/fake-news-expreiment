There were heavy patrols along Milwaukee's lakefront over the weekend, but not all of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department officers were deputies.WISN 12 News reporter Terry Sater talked to Sheriff David Clarke about his decision to use corrections officers to help guard the beach.The sheriff said it's about doing more with less after budget cuts, but because corrections officers were called to the lakefront on Sunday, the union is filing a grievance Wednesday over safety issues.Warm weather and a sudden flood of people at Milwaukee's Bradford Beach on Saturday led to deputies scrambling to maintain law and order. So on Sunday, the sheriff also called in corrections officers."Look, when we have major situations going on, major incidents, it's all hands on deck," Clarke said.But corrections officers don't have the arrest powers and safety equipment deputies have leading to union complaints. The sheriff defended using the corrections officers for traffic control to serve beach goers, and said he'll do it again."Everybody is struggling with not having the resources they would like, and so you have to be creative," Clarke said.Frequent lakefront user Syeeda Hensen agreed with the sheriff."My son and his friends were down here on Sunday, and he had an altercation with someone and the sheriffs were right there. And they even did a follow up call with me. I was very glad they were here," Hensen said.The union said the corrections officers weren't just used to direct traffic. They were patrolling alongside deputies.Jon Gustavson said the more law enforcement, the better. He wants to feel safe when he brings his 2-year-old daughter to a busy lakefront."No, I think it's not been enough, and so I think we might need to overcompensate a little bit and have a few extra officers down here to kind of straighten things out. And make it more family friendly," Gustavson said.The union said it has also filed a lawsuit against Clarke for not calling back laid off deputies to fill the need.
