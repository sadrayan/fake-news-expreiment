Our group formed this week. We have three generators on our board (Calpine, Nextera, and NRG). We are building a broader-based, diverse group of folks concerned about the reliability of the grid. Our group is focused on changing the market structure so there are incentives to build new generation and prevent a reliability crisis and a large increase in blackouts in the years to come.

...If you have access to how this group reached its conclusion that Texas is the fastest-growing state – the information shows it’s fourth-fastest of late—please advise.

Sure...look at the chart. Raw growth in Texas is number one from 2012 to 2013. Our growth is 380,000 people, and no other state matches that. Other state has a higher percentage of growth from their current population, but that is my concern. Because in the end we are talk about the raw number individuals who rely on the grid.
