Michael Moore: I Was Taught Snipers Were "Cowards"
Moore tweeted Sunday that his uncle was killed by a sniper.

Michael Moore has taken to Twitter to share his thoughts on snipers.

The Fahrenheit 9/11 director wrote that he grew up being told that snipers are cowardly. "My uncle killed by sniper in WW2," Moore wrote. "We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot you in the back."

"Snipers aren't heroes," he continued. "And invaders are worse."

Moore spoke directly about director Clint Eastwood's film American Sniper on his Facebook page. He praised the film for star Bradley Cooper's performance and for its antiwar sentiment, but he also wrote: "Too bad Clint gets Vietnam and Iraq confused in his storytelling. And that he has his characters calling Iraqis 'savages' throughout the film."

His comments come on the same weekend that the film earned $105.2 million over four days, marking the biggest opening haul ever for a nontentpole film. It landed six Oscar nominations Thursday, including best picture and best actor for Cooper.

American Sniper centers on real-life Iraq War soldier Chris Kyle, who tried to balance his career as the most prolific U.S. sniper with his family life.

But if you're on the roof of your home defending it from invaders who've come 7K miles, you are not a sniper, u are brave, u are a neighbor. — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) January 19, 2015
