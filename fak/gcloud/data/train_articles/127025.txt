Vote early by mail
Apply online

The online application is only for federal, state or county elections.

Application deadline

You can apply for a ballot any time during the year, except the day of the election. Leave time for election officials to mail your ballot and for you to return it on or before Election Day.

Deadline to return your ballot

Your ballot will not count if it is received after Election Day. Return your ballot by mail or package delivery service (such as FedEx or UPS). You can also return your ballot in person no later than 3 p.m. on Election Day to the election office that sent your ballot. You can drop off ballots for up to three other voters. You will need to show identification with name and signature when returning a ballot for someone else.
