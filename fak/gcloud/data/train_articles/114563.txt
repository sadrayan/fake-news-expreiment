World Day for the Prevention of Child Abuse
Why Child Maltreatment Happens

There are many reasons and factors that make adults maltreat children. Parents can be totally unaware of the magnitude of force they use while striking a child. Another reason is the lack of knowledge about alternative positive discipline methods resulting in frequent use of inappropriate and harsh discipline such as physical punishment. Contributing factors of child abuse include:

The parent was abused as a child and is continuing the cycle

Lack of parenting skills

Unrealistic expectations about children's behavior and capabilities

Difficulty to control and manage anger feelings and stress

Frequent family crises

Drug or alcohol abuse

We know that parents want the best for their children and don't want to hurt them. But some end up maltreating their children out of frustration due to a lack of knowledge about what children are capable of doing and understanding at different ages; also some lack skills and strategies to discipline and respond to the children's difficult behaviors in age appropriate ways.

To stop the abuse and prevent its consequences on children's lives, families need to become aware of how they're treating their children. They also need to know how damaging their behavior is and the consequences for their children. Children who are exposed to violence early in life are more likely to become abusers later, have health problems, be depressed, have low self esteem, and fail in school. Parents who maltreat their children may need help from an outside source, such as a parenting education program, a psychologist or some other type of mental health counselor or a member of the clergy.
