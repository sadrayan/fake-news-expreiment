Target solicitation policy
This policy does not diminish Target's support of communities. Since 1946, Target has given 5 percent of its profit—which today equals millions of dollars a week—to local communities. Our company also has many other means through which we support organizations whose programs fall within our corporate giving guidelines. For more information on these guidelines, please visit the Grants section on A Bullseye View.

how we enforce our policy

To ensure a distraction-free shopping experience in our stores, we take the following steps:

We ask solicitors and petitioners to respect our policy by ceasing their activities and leaving our property. However, often they refuse to comply. We partner with local law enforcement agencies to assist us in having unwanted solicitors and petitioners removed from our property. In certain circumstances, we file lawsuits to obtain court orders prohibiting solicitors from returning. This is not a quick process and may not result in the immediate removal of unwanted disturbances.

what you can do

Target firmly believes that our guests should enjoy a distraction-free shopping experience in our stores. If you feel harassed or bothered by a solicitor or petitioner outside a Target store, please alert a store team member. We appreciate your patience and patronage as we continue to do everything we can to provide you with a respectful, distraction-free shopping experience.

Based on Target's commitment to maintaining a distraction-free shopping experience for our guests, we do not allow Salvation Army bell ringers outside our store nationwide. However, Target proudly supports The Salvation Army, which serves more than 30 million people across the United States each year. Some of our year-round efforts include grants to local chapters, volunteerism and in-kind donations to help those who need it most. Target also partners with The Salvation Army to support its disaster relief efforts in communities across the country.
