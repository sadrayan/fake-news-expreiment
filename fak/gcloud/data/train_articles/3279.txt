Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul and Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen address trailblazers from across the state
It's hard to ignore that the election of Donald Trump to the White House has ignited a women's movement of historical proportions. From the March on Washington to the influx of first-time female candidates on the local level, women from both sides of the aisle are flexing their political muscle. On Thursday, May 25, City & State hosted the State of NY Women forum, bringing together over 250 elected officials, public sector leaders, nonprofit and business trailblazers from across the state.

Among the keynote speakers were Alicia Glen, New York City deputy mayor for housing and economic development, and the Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul â€“ two of the most prominent women in city and state government. Below are their addresses in full.
