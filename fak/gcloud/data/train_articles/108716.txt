All terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning given to them in the Credit Agreement.

2. Pursuant to Section 2.17 of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower has the option, without the consent of the Lenders, from time to time to cause one or more increases in the Aggregate Commitments by adding, subject to the prior approval of the Administrative Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), to the Credit Agreement one or more financial institutions as Lenders (collectively, the “ New Lenders ”) or by allowing one or more Lenders to increase their respective Commitments; provided however that (a) prior to and after giving effect to the increase, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred thereunder and be continuing, (b) no such increase shall cause the Aggregate Commitments to exceed $3,750,000,000, (c) no Lender’s Commitment shall be increased without such Lender’s consent, and (d) such increase shall be evidenced by a commitment increase agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Administrative Agent and executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, New Lenders, if any, and Lenders increasing their Commitments, if any.

3. In consideration of the foregoing, upon the Increase Effective Date defined below, each Supplemental Lender shall have the Commitment listed next to its name on the attached Exhibit A , which, in the case of any existing Lender, shall replace the prior Commitment of such Lender in effect immediately prior to this Agreement, as listed next to its name on the attached Exhibit A , and any Supplemental Lender that is a New Lender hereby assumes all of the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Lenders are a party and agrees to perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of the Credit Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender. This Agreement shall not affect the Commitments of Lenders who are not Supplemental Lenders.

4. Each Supplemental Lender represents and warrants that (a) it has full power and authority, and has taken all action necessary, to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and, if it is a New Lender, to become a Lender under the Credit Agreement to the extent of its Commitment set forth on Exhibit A hereto, and (b) it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement, the most recent financial statement of the Borrower made available pursuant to Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement and such other documents and information as it has determined appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter

1

5. The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that (a) the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that any such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality) on and as of the Increase Effective Date, both prior to and after giving effect to this Agreement and to any Credit Extension required by Section 6 hereof, and for such purpose all references in such representations and warranties to “Loan Documents” shall include this Agreement, provided , however , for purposes of this Section 5 (i) to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.06(a) of the Credit Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the most recent financial statements furnished pursuant to Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement and (b) as of the Increase Effective Date, both prior to and after giving effect to this Agreement and to any Credit Extension required by Section 6 hereof, no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

6. Upon the Increase Effective Date defined below, (a) Schedule 1 to the Credit Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety to read as set forth in Schedule 1 attached hereto, and (b) the Borrower shall borrow additional Loans and/or prepay any Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05 of the Credit Agreement) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with the revised Applicable Percentages set forth in Schedule 1 attached hereto. 7. If requested by a Supplemental Lender at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Increase Effective Date, the Borrower agrees to execute and deliver to such Supplemental Lender on the Increase Effective Date a new or replacement Note in the form provided for in the Credit Agreement to evidence the new or increased Commitment of such Supplemental Lender. 8. This Agreement shall be effective (the “ Increase Effective Date ”) when (a) this Agreement shall have been executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Supplemental Lender, (b) the Borrower shall have paid to Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as the Lead Arranger, for the account of each Supplemental Lender, upfront fees equal to 0.175% of the amount of the Commitment of such Supplemental Lender that is a New Lender and the amount of the increase in the Commitment of such Supplemental Lender that is an existing Lender, in each case as set forth on Exhibit A hereto, and (c) the Administrative Agent shall have confirmed that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 2.17(b) of the Credit Agreement shall have been satisfied. 9. The Credit Agreement, as hereby amended, is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects. The Loan Documents, as they may be amended or affected by this Agreement, are hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects. Any reference to the Credit Agreement in any Loan Document shall be deemed to be a reference to the Credit Agreement as hereby amended. The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Agreement shall not, except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any other Loan Document nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Credit Agreement, the

2



Notes or any other Loan Document. This Agreement is a Loan Document, and all provisions in the Credit Agreement pertaining to Loan Documents apply hereto. 10.
