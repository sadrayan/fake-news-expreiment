Trump said Mueller’s team has ‘13 hardened Democrats.’ Here are the facts.
President Trump on Sunday renewed his attacks on the political affiliations of the members of the special counsel team investigating his 2016 campaign for possibly coordinating with Russia, alleging that the group has "13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans.”

“Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair?” Trump wrote on Twitter. “And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!”

The president is ignoring one important fact: Robert S. Mueller III, who heads the team, is a longtime registered Republican. He was appointed by another Republican, Rod J. Rosenstein, whom Trump nominated as deputy attorney general. But publicly available voter registration information shows that 13 of the 17 members of Mueller's team have previously registered as Democrats, while four had no affiliation or their affiliation could not be found.

Nine of the 17 made political donations to Democrats, their contributions totaling more than $57,000. The majority came from one person, who also contributed to Republicans. Six donated to Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent in the 2016 race.

In the months after Mueller was appointed to lead the investigation, Trump and his supporters had called attention to what they perceived as conflicts among those on the special counsel's team. In June, Trump tweeted that the probe was “led by some very bad and conflicted people!” and he said on Fox News that “the people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters; some of them worked for Hillary Clinton.”

The new attacks come in the wake of Attorney General Jeff Sessions's firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe over allegations made by the Justice Department's inspector general that McCabe authorized an inappropriate disclosure to the media, then misled investigators about it. McCabe had been involved in the Russia probe, and Trump and his attorney seized on his ouster to attack the special counsel.

“The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,” Trump wrote Saturday night. “It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!”

A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment for this report. The special counsel team is composed of veteran white-collar lawyers and prosecutors who are among the most respected in the legal world. They have a broad range of experience in fraud, public corruption, cyber and terrorism cases. Legal analysts have said previously that they could see no significant legal or ethical concerns with the team members' political giving, and they noted that Justice Department policies prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of politics.

Some lawyers, though, said the team's makeup creates an optical problem for Mueller, as conservatives might not trust what the team ultimately finds, especially with respect to Trump. Mueller's critics, too, already had ammunition to criticize the investigators as biased, after messages were released showing two top FBI officials involved in the case — agent Peter Strzok and lawyer Lisa Page — exchanged texts disparaging Trump.

The two no longer work for the special counsel. Mueller removed Strzok after the Justice Department's inspector general found the texts, and Page already had left for what officials said were unrelated reasons. Federal records show that neither Page nor Strzok made any political donations.

Lawyers at the Justice Department — from which Mueller drew the bulk of his team — are generally thought to be left-leaning, while the FBI is generally thought of as a more conservative institution. FBI agents are intimately involved in the work Mueller is doing, though their identities and donation and voter registration histories are not known.
