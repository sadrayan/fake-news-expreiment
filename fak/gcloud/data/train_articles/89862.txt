AMERICAN LEGACY FOUNDATION

Many national consensus documents emphasize the enormous potential to maximize the reach, use, and population impact of smoking cessation interventions via tobacco quitlines. The population impact of quitlines remains small (reach x effcacy / cost), because while their potential for outreach is unrivaled, they are principally a time-limited counseling service, neither intended nor staffed to provide intensive, momentary support following the dozens of temptations and lapses that typically characterize a cessation attempt. The project is an addictive two-group randomized controlled trial to test whether the addition of a web-based mobile quitline enhancement(MQE) system improves abstinence rates at 1-,3-, 6-, and 9-months relative to standard care provided by the Washington D.C. Quitline (DCQL) program. This MQE system is designed to fill the gaps between quitline calls with ready access to a menu of evidenced-based treatment components, while also providing DCQL counselors with detailed information about their clients' ongoing progress with cessation - two developments that constitute a major advance over standard quitline programming. Participants will be 700 smokers who contact the DCQL and are randomized to receive either standard DCQL programming (N=300) or DCQL plus MQE (N=400). Participants assigned to standard DCQL programming will receive 6 proactive counseling sessions and free nicotine replacement therapy NRT). Participants assigned to DCQL plus MQE will also receive mobile access to the MQE system via a web-enabled cellular telephone provided by the study. Relative to usual care, we expect that MQE will improve outcomes by improving delivery, utilization and thereby effectiveness of DCQL programming. This project is well suited for the ARRA funds because it represents an extraordinary opportunity to jump-start a collaborative effort that spearheads the use of web-enabled mobile devices to enhance the efficiency, fidelity, and impact of an established tobacco quitline program that benefits underserved communities in Washington D.C. To meet this challenge our transdisciplinary team brings expertise in tobacco control, behavioral informatics, data analysis, and clinical health psychology together with solid collaborative relationships across the DC Tobacco Consortium. As such, the project is positioned to take full advantage of DCQL infrastructure to conduct a randomized trial in an accelerated timeframe. The study is unconventional and innovative in the way it leverages web-based ecological assessment methodology to literally "close the loop" between research and practice. Bolstering the effectiveness of tobacco quitlines is a critical and timely endeavor, promising to expand the potential public health impact of this "broad reach" treatment modality.

Projects and Jobs Information Projects and Jobs Information Project Title Comparative Effectiveness of Web-based Mobile Support for the DC Tobacco Quitline Project Status Less Than 50% Completed Final Project Report Submitted No Project Activities Description Smoking Cessation Quarterly Activities/Project Description As outlined in the initial application, over the first three months the project team focused their effort on development of logistical infrastructure and partnership building. This included ongoing collaboration with our local partners at the DC Department of Health Tobacco Control Program, the American Lung Association of DC Tobacco Free Families Program, the Georgetown University Lombardi Cancer Center Health Disparities Initiative, and other academic colleagues. We have now finalized negotiations with required academic and private service vendors that will support the project, including our cellular services vendor and mobile software development vendor. We have completed development of the mobile smoking cessation support applicaiton described in the initial application. We have developed the materials, identified and secured venues, staffing and data processing resources to support to implement all aspects of the proposed study. The project start date has been delayed several times due to unforeseen circumstances faced by our partners, including the DC DOH, but we have now resolved all sources of delay, and have arranged to commence recruitment for the study on July 14, 2010. Jobs Created 1.30 Description of Jobs Created The project has hired a full-time project coordinator that spends 100% of her time managing ongoing project development while serving as liaison to the DCQL progrm. The Principal Investigator on this project has been spending 30% of his time on it - 1.30 jobs saved for the quarter.
