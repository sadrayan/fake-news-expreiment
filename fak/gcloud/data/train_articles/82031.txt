'I have, in fact, done the crime': Rep. Ami Bera's father admits illegal campaign contributions
Prosecutors said that the investigation began with an anonymous tip to the FBI in the fall of 2014 and that the donations were made and later repaid by people in various parts of the country. Babual Bera was interviewed by agents last October about the campaign contributions. He was arraigned shortly before appearing in U.S. District Court Judge Troy L. Nunley's courtroom and was escorted away without answering questions from reporters.
