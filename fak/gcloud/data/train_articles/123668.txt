Those resolving to see less of Donald Trump in 2016 may have a new Google Chrome browser extension to install.

Dubbed "Trump Filter" by creator Rob Spectre, the open-source extension searches websites that users visit and strips out any mentions of the Republican presidential candidate, claiming to scrub Trump "from all your web browsing without leaving the Internet."

POLITICO's page with all items tagged with "Donald Trump," for example, is blank with the extension installed.

On the Trump Filter website, Spectre writes that he was not put up to creating the filter by either party, "the Obama Administration, my mother or any other possible sphere of influence."

"I am doing this out of a profound sense of annoyance and patriotic duty," writes Spectre, whose site describes him as a Brooklyn-based "punk rock technolologist [sic] having a barrel of monkeys on the Internet."

"Tragically, Trump Filter cannot be installed on your television," Spectre writes. "However, we hope that enough installs will be a strong signal to the international media that America is ready to move on from this inveterate jackass."

Spectre's is not the first filter to attempt to create a Trump-free or altered browsing experience, however, as evidenced by a search of Chrome extensions featuring Trump's name. One changes all references to Trump to Voldemort, the villain of the Harry Potter series, while another, the URL "FriendsWhoLikeTrump.com" redirects visitors to a Facebook search page featuring a list of users friends who like the candidate on the social network.
