Working at Remington Arms: 206 Reviews
Remington has a lot of Awesome people. They work hard in stressful situations and still smile and try to help where they were needed. There was a lot of change in management, layoffs, budget cuts so we worked a lot as salary employees. There was a lot of finger pointing in management instead of taking ownership, finding the issue, correcting the issue and preventing the issue from re-occuring, I controlled the inventory in the entire plant for all 3 shifts. Knowing what materials we had, I would inform the planning team, which machines, cells or processes needed to scheduled. I informed our buyers of what materials were short for the month. I would inform machining, cells and processing team of what material needed to be produced. The buyers, planners, machine operators and processing team all communicated with me and we worked as a Team.

Pros Stayed busy. Built trust. Great Teamwork Cons Doing 4 people's jobs for 3 years, working 18 hour days, 6-7 days a week
