..LowDjo..: Presenting Dr. Green Cheese...
hiphop, wonky and glitchy music , my last Cheez set:Together with Sheperd I mixed a whole Cheez-trilogy together, called Give 'Em Enough Cheese! That's definitely worth checking out:The first Cheez mix I did, about 6 months ago:As this is not enough to keep me busy I also created a more 'experimental' alter ego, called Dj SickSickSick .. who focuses mostly on ambient drones and noise . For this I also deejay but also use Buddha Machines and other 'musical machines'. Listen to the first buddha-experiment I did about 8 months ago:+ mixed:or a psychedelic mix by Sick:Much more secrets hidden in Lowdjo's vaults..... SO STAY TUNED!
