Netflix Finally Realized Nobody Liked Their Movie Selections, Will Start Streaming Every New Disney Flick This Fall
Update: According to Netflix, this exciting new deal is only going to include brand new Disney theatrical releases. That means that while we'll be able to stream everything that hits theaters in 2016, we won't be able to burn through the entire Disney archives. Stay tuned to E! for all the latest details on exact titles and release dates.

Everybody loves Netflix. It's the company who brought us the funniest group of prison inmates yet. They gave the world the Full House reunion we've been waiting decades for. It allows us to watch Kyle Chandlerliterally whenever we please. What could go wrong?

Except that, lest we forget, before all those awesome original series the streaming service was kind of just a collection of B-movies and the occasional classic sitcom. Its movie selection has always been pretty lackingâ€”sure, every month in the new additions they give us a goodie like a recent Oscar winner or new release, but those flicks rarely stick around for the long haul. And in between these rare gems we're forced to choose between watching, say, Kindergarten Cop 2 or Christian Mingle The Movie. (And yes, those are real options.)

But now, it seems that Netflix has finally gotten wise to this deficit. They're not doing a total overhaul of movie content, but they are pushing a pretty big improvement come fall.
