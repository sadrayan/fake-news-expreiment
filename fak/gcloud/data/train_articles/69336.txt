We know that we’re close to the bottom in many of our achievement statistics. Our state graduation rate is 54% in aggregate ( 44% (African American), 32% (Latino), 61% (White) ). Our ranking is 46th out of 50 states. (That is also with an inflated rate of 64%).

So, how much money are we spending?

We keep hearing that education spending has been cut in Georgia. You can see the amount of money Georgia has spent on Education since 1996. There are only 3 years where the state has sent less money to school districts (2004, 2009, 2010 – by 2011, funding went up again).
