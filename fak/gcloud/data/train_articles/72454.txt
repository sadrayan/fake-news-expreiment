Nancy Pelosi Speaks In Support Of Dream Act To A Friendly Crowd At Sac State
Nancy Pelosi expresses her support for passing the DREAM act at Sacramento State University on Monday, Sept. 18, 2017.

House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was met by a friendly crowd Monday at a Sacramento State event where she and other leaders spoke in support of the Dream Act - which would protect certain so-called Dreamers from deportation.





The applause was in stark contrast to an event in San Francisco Monday morning ...when protesters spoke over Pelosi and forced her to cut the press conference short.

CapRadio Reporter Julia Mitric, who attended the event, spoke with host Randol White Monday afternoon with some details on the event and the fate of DACA:
