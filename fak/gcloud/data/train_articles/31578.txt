Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS)

About the BDS

2016 Update!

The Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) provides annual measures of business dynamics (such as job creation and destruction, establishment births and deaths, and firm startups and shutdowns) for the economy and aggregated by establishment and firm characteristics. The BDS is created from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), a confidential database available to qualified researchers through secure Federal Statistical Research Data Centers. The use of the LBD as its source data permits tracking establishments and firms over time.

BDS data tables show key economic data: Employment – job creation and destruction

Job expansions and contractions

Number of establishments

Establishment openings and closings

Number of startups and firm shutdowns

This release of the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) provides a limited set of statistics for the year 2016. Historical time series are available from earlier releases. This temporary reduction in detail will allow the team supporting the program to focus on modernizing the methodology that generates the BDS. The goal for the next release is to provide an expanded set of tables that incorporate long-planned enhancements, including a switch from the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).
