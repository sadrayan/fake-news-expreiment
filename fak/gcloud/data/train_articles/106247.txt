Ilhan Omar is a Democratic member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 60B. She was first elected in 2016. Omar was the first Somali muslim legislator elected to office in the United States.

In January of 2017, Omar was sworn into office with her hand on a quran. Not just any quran, but the biggest quran that Omar could find.

Ilhan Omar is currently running for Congress in Minnesota.

Will she be sworn in with her hand on the quran, again?

Minnesota voters, it’s up to you! Get out and vote for Omar’s opponent, Jennifer Zielinski, on Nov. 6th 2018!
