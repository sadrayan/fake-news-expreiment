PhonepayPlus : Consumers: Register a complaint
How do I log my complaint?

The complaint form we will ask you to complete is split into 3 main sections and is structured in such a way as to gather as much information as possible. It is important we request this information to ensure we can fully investigate your complaint,

First, after you have entered the number you are complaining about, we will let you know the type of service the number relates to and the name of the company operating the service (if we have this information). This may be useful as a reminder if you cannot recall using the service.

You will then be asked to enter personal information such as your name, address and contact details and the phone or mobile network you use. This will enable us to notify you of the outcome of our investigation. We will also ask for information about when you were charged on your phone bill for using the service

Please try to have this information to hand when making your complaint

Finally, we will request specific information about the service itself and question why you wish to complain. Please enter as much information here as you can as this will be important in enabling us to fully investigate the service.

Please remember, if you encounter any problems along the way you can always call our helpline to speak to a contact centre advisor on 0800 500 212 (open 0800 - 1800 Monday to Friday).
