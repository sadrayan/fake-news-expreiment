Foxconn, Kwik Trip, Haribo Top List of Wisconsin’s 2017 Economic Development Projects
MADISON – Governor Scott Walker today announced that the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) had a record year for economic development in 2017 with 59 companies from Wisconsin and around the world agreeing to locate to or expand in Wisconsin. These projects are expected to create or retain nearly 30,000 jobs and result in more than $11.6 billion in capital investment across the state.

“When it comes to economic development, 2017 has been a historic year for Wisconsin as global companies such as Foxconn, Haribo and Nestle decided to establish operations in our great state after looking at many other options around the country,” Governor Walker said. “At the same time, many of Wisconsin’s major employers – including Kwik Trip, Generac, Mills Fleet Farm and Johnsonville – announced major expansion plans this year because of our dedicated workforce and the strong pro-business climate we’ve created.”

Not surprisingly, topping the list of projects is Foxconn’s Technology Group’s historic investment in Racine County – a project expected to create up to 13,000 good-paying, family-supporting jobs and generate up to $10 billion in capital investment. WEDC has agreed to provide Foxconn with up to $2.85 billion in tax credits for what is the largest economic development project in Wisconsin history and one of the largest ever in the United States.

The second-largest project of 2017 is Kwik Trip Inc.’s $309 million expansion project in La Crosse that will enable the growing company to meet its current and future capacity needs. The project is expected to create more than 300 new jobs.

Rounding out the top three projects of the year is Haribo’s planned $220 million manufacturing facility in Kenosha County, a project expected to create 385 jobs. WEDC has awarded Haribo up to $21 million in tax credits for the project, which will be the German candy-maker’s first manufacturing facility in North America.

“Each of these companies plays a significant role in continuing to grow the state’s economy by creating family-supporting jobs and investing in Wisconsin,” said Mark R. Hogan, secretary and CEO of WEDC, the state’s lead economic development organization. “2017 was a successful year for WEDC as we assisted more than 300 businesses and communities as part of our mission to advance and maximize opportunities to help them thrive in a globally competitive environment.”

The list is based on all corporate expansion and attraction projects in which contracts between WEDC and the company were executed in 2017. The job projections, estimated project costs and the award amounts from WEDC are based on the requirements set forth in each contract. All WEDC tax credits are performance-based and the amount of credits a company receives is contingent upon the actual numbers of jobs created.
