Coop Italia To Remove 200 Products Containing Palm Oil

Italian supermarket chain Coop has announced that it will remove over 200 products containing palm oil from its shelves.

The decision follows the publication of a report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) that highlights the presence of certain contaminants in palm-oil compounds.

Based on these new developments, Coop, in line with the 'precautionary principle' it has always applied, has suspended production of own-brand products that contain palm oil, explained company president Marco Pedroni.

For these products, Coop will seek to use extra-virgin olive oil or single-seeded oils, and resort to recipes and formulations that are more nutritionally balanced.

Pedroni explained that the first 100 products with palm oil have already been replaced, in particular those aimed at younger audiences, such as chocolate spread. The remaining 120 will be removed in the coming months.

Other Italian supermarkets, such as Carrefour, Esselunga, U2-Unes and Pam Panorama, are also moving in the same direction, introducing more palm-oil-free products.
