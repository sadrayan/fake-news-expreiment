There is a proposal that would change the immigration system to a merit-based system that favors applicants based upon their skills, education, and ability to speak English. If the system changed, this would mean that many immigrants who have family members in the United States would not be allowed to live here permanently and would effectively cut legal immigration by about 50 percent.
