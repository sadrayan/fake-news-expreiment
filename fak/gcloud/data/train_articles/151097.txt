Work

Contracts play a fundamental role in society and the economy. They can protect against uncertainty and contribute to cooperation. Oliver Hart has developed theories on contracts. In the mid-1980s, he contributed to the theory of incomplete contracts. Since it is not possible to specify every eventuality in a contract, the right to make decisions under different circumstances should be assigned in an optimal manner. These analyses have been significant for, among other things, governance of companies and the design of laws and institutions.
