Family-Supporting Jobs are at Risk
According to the Miami-Dade County website, PortMiamiâ€™s maritime cargo and cruise activity supports 207,000 jobs in South Florida and generates over $27 billion dollars in economic activity. Even the hint of a disruptive non-port-related activity, such as a stadium, could force a cargo or cruise ship to leave the port, which would result in the loss of thousands of jobs. We cannot jeopardize these good-paying jobs with benefits, including crane operators, stevedores, truck drivers, and harbor pilots, for a few low-paying stadium jobs, such as concession sales.

PortMiami is the cruise capital of the world, a global cargo gateway, and, along with tourism, is the economic engine of the area. If the stadium is built at PortMiami, thousands of port jobs could be lost. The average salary for someone working at the port is $37,500. Why would we trade good paying port jobs with benefits for part-time jobs at the stadium, where concession workers make less than $18,000?
