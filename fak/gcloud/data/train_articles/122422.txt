Polk County police investigating claims made by 12-year-old girl before she live streamed suicide
CEDARTOWN — The focus of an investigation into the suspected suicide of a 12-year-old Polk County girl has changed from determining the manner of death to why she might have taken her own life, police said.

The girl, who died of self-inflicted wounds on Dec. 30, streamed her death online, Polk County Police Chief Kenny Dodd said. It has since been posted and reposted on various sites across the internet.

Investigators are looking into allegations of abuse and attempted rape the girl posted in an online diary on Dec. 27, Dodd said.

That posting was removed from the website.

Dodd said on Wednesday no charges have been filed and police would not comment further on the investigation.

Dodd said the department is well aware of the videos and online content, and are asking people to stop sending the information and requesting the police get it taken down.

“We have no control over where this is posted, and we can’t force anyone to take it down,” he said.

Polk County Corner Tony Brazier said a cause of death has not yet been determined as tests continue at the GBI’s crime lab.

“Those test results will be forthcoming soon,” he said.
