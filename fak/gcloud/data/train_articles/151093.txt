T.I. and Busta Rhymes claim Bob Marley was assassinated by the CIA
The truth is very different...

Rappers T.I. and Busta Rhymes have shared a debunked conspiracy theory that claims Bob Marley was killed by the CIA.

Posting on Instagram, the music stars shared a screenshot of a debunked news article which quotes ex-CIA agent Bill Oxley as claiming he “infected Marley with cancer”.

Although the reggae legend died from brain cancer in 1981, the story claims the US killed him because he was “starting a revolution”.

The story alleges that Oxley admitted the act on his deathbed, claiming that Marley was one of 17 people he killed for the CIA between 1974 and 1985.

The article, which has been shared online for several years, also details how Oxley posed as a New York Times photographer in order to gain access to Marley at his Blue Mountains retreat in Jamaica. He claims to have infected Marley with cancer by pricking his toe.

“I gave him a pair of Converse All Stars. Size 10. When he tried on the right shoe, he screamed out”, a quote from Oxley states.

But a quick search on renowned debunking site Snopes reveals the truth behind it.

“Whether or not there was anything more to Bob Marley’s death than natural causes — and there is no solid evidence to the contrary — we can say with certainty that a CIA agent named “Bill Oxley” did not confess while on his death bed in Maine to assassinating the singer”, a Snopes article states.

It’s believed that the story originated on the website of a former BBC journalist who previously worked for notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke.
