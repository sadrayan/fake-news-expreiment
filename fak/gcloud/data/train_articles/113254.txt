Reynolds Starts Two New Jobs

In one of his last official acts President Clinton commuted Mel Reynolds sentence. The former congressman had two years left to serve for tax evasion.

Now, he'll serve the rest of that sentence in a halfway house and he'll be working two new jobs. Former congressman Mel Reynolds was greeted warmly by members of Salem Baptist Church. Among the first to embrace him was U.S. congressman Jesse Jackson Junior, who replaced Reynolds in Congress. During church services Salem Baptist pastor Rev. James Meeks offered Reynolds the job of managing various church related projects, including building new homes in the Roseland neighborhood, helping the homeless and working with jail and prison inmates. Rev. Jesse Jackson, who along with others including Rev. James Meeks, also offered Reynolds a job. Rev. Jackson said Reynolds will consult the Rainbow Coalition/Push organization's efforts to help jail and prison inmates. Mel Reynolds said, his intention is to dedicate the rest of his life working to try and help homeless and working with men and women locked-up in jails and prisons. There's no start date set for both of Reynolds new jobs.
