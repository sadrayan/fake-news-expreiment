Writing on Air by Jim Paredes
Posted on April 01, 2019 by jimparedes

This is very difficult for me to write, and for many of you, it will

be painful to read.

The video was real. It was private, and not meant for public

consumption. I do not know how it became public. I can only surmise

that in this ugly season of toxic politics, muckrakers determined to

neutralize my influence by violating my privacy and digging up dirt on

me are at work.

When I saw it on social media, I was in a quandary how to respond. But

after mulling and praying over it, I decided to come clean. There are

already too many lies and liars in this world. I do not wish to be a

part of that cabal. I have chosen to be truthful because I know that

painful as the truth can be, it will eventually set me free.

I have never tried to project myself as perfect. Of all the sins in

this world, I believe sex is the most human of all. I am not saying

this to excuse what, I regret, was broadcast on social media. I have

always expressed my feelings freely. Today, I wish to express my

truth. I am a flawed person, a human being, much like everyone else.

I made a mistake, I was irresponsible. And I am truly sorry.

I know many of you have judged me and condemned me, and those who held

me in high esteem are disappointed in me, to put it mildly. I

apologize for my irresponsibility. But most especially, I stand in

bottomless sorrow and contrition before my family who are reeling from

the hurt and aggravation, and the embarrassment and shame, that should

only be mine. I pray that they be spared any more wicked trolling by

those who would revel in their pain. ###
