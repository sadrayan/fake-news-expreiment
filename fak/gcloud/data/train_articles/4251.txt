BREAKING: Crash That Killed Tucker Carlson Was No Accident
Fox News superstar Tucker Carlson succumbed to his injuries and died overnight after being hit head-on while driving home. The Ford Explorer that crossed the median to slam into him was stolen, reinforced to sustain a head-on collision without killing the driver and left at the scene. After a preliminary investigation, police have ruled out an accident and Carlson’s cause of death has been ruled a homicide.

Carlson’s secretary, Beth Anne Wiles, told Breitbart that her boss was working on two huge stories, either of which could have put him in danger. Before leaving work he was in a shouting match with a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation over the location of two cargo ships that a source of his believes they found and he had several taped conversations with James Comey from an interview nearly a month ago that have suddenly become very “interesting.”

Both the Clinton Foundation and James Comey have strong ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, who are known to solve their problems by making them disappear. While the investigation is in its early stages, you can be certain that if these heathens had anything to do with it…no evidence linking them will ever be found.

In the meantime, thoughts and prayers are pouring into Fox News on their Twitter and Facebook feeds. God Bless you, Tucker; we’ll miss you.
