2016 Presidential Race
The 2016 race started early with a large field of potential candidates, some of whom acted very much like, well, candidates — making appearances in early primary states, vying for commitments from big donors and assembling teams that could quickly pivot and become campaign staff. Meanwhile, constellations of groups working on behalf of each of the most serious White House hopefuls – including leadership PACs, super PACs, 501(c)(4) dark money outlets and more – cropped up like spring flowers, all but inviting spending records to be broken.

Amount raised by candidates: $2.6 billion

Amount raised by super PACs supporting them: $618 million
