Walden introduces SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to combat the opioid crisis

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Hood River), joined by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX), Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), and Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Richard Neal (D-MA), yesterday introduced the bipartisan H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act.

H.R. 6 will serve as the legislative package for the majority of House-passed bills to combat the opioid crisis to move over to the Senate.

"All across the country, families and communities have struggled for far too long against the scourge of opioid addiction. These are our friends, our neighbors, and our family members, and we as a Congress are committed to doing all we can to combat the opioid crisis and save lives,” said Walden in a joint statement with Reps. Brady, Pallone, and Neal. “H.R. 6 will be an important step forward in our efforts to stem the tide of addiction by improving prevention and public health efforts, enhancing treatment and recovery programs, and providing communities more tools in our fight.”
