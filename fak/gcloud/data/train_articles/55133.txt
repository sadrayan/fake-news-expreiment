Judge stands by ruling against Broward elections chief
Broward Circuit Judge Raag Singhal on Tuesday stood by his ruling that changes the way the Supervisor of Elections Office is required to handle absentee ballots.

Supervisor Brenda Snipes had asked the judge to reconsider his ruling, arguing that her office already complied with Florida law by requiring a single canvassing board member to oversee the opening of ballots that arrived by mail.

The office had received more than 43,256 mailed-in ballots by early Tuesday, according to state election officials.

Lawyers for the Republican Party of Florida complained that in previous elections, the supervisor’s office separated the ballots from the envelopes in which they came without giving candidates a proper opportunity to review and challenge the signatures.

Once a ballot is separated from its outer envelope, it is impossible to reconnect them. If a signature were found to be invalid, there would be no way to find the disqualified ballot.

Snipes’ lawyer, Burnadette Norris-Weeks, had argued that the law and canvassing board policy only required one member of the three-member canvassing board to be present while elections office staff members reviewed the signatures.

Singhal sided with the state Republican Party: His ruling requires two canvassing board members to be present and in agreement before a mail-in ballot is separated from its envelope.

The mailed-in ballot envelopes are available for inspection before they are opened for a half-hour each morning during the 15 days prior to an election. The next primary is Aug. 28.

If a signature doesn’t match the one on file, the voter is sent an affidavit for them to sign verifying that they mailed in the ballot, Snipes said Monday.
