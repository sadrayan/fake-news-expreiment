Kanhaiya Kumar was fined for 'misbehaving' with girl in 2015
Following a complaint by her, the JNU administration held a proctorial inquiry that found Kanhaiya guilty.

Amid a raging row at JNU, it has now emerged that its students' union president Kanhaiya Kumar, who is facing sedition charge, was fined by the varsity administration last year for allegedly "misbehaving" with a girl student and "threatening" her.

The incident had occurred on June 10, 2015, when the girl student asked Kanhaiya, who at the time was not the students' union president, to not urinate in the open inside the campus.

The girl, who now teaches at Delhi University, alleged that Kanhaiya "misbehaved" with her when she objected and also called her a "psychopath" while threatening her with dire consequences.

Following a complaint by her, the JNU administration held a proctorial inquiry that found Kanhaiya guilty.

"Kanhaiya is fined Rs 3,000 and also warned to be careful and not get involved in any such incidents in future. Otherwise, strict disciplinary action will be taken against him," the order said.
