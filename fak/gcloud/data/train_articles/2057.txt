John Kasich asks for an end to Ohio's passenger rail; where should the money go? Take our poll
Gov.-elect John Kasich is imploring outgoing Gov. Ted Strickland to halt spending on a passenger train project that Kasich said he will kill when he takes the governor's seat.

Kasich is also asking President Barack Obama if the $400 million in federal stimulus money for the Cleveland-Columbus-Cincinnati passenger rail can be used for other infrastructure needs.

Kasich believes the rail project is a money pit and has guaranteed he will ax it when he becomes governor in January.

Kasich's camp this afternoon sent letters to Strickland and Obama.

He asked Strickland to "immediately cancel all contracts relating to your passenger rail program in the most cost-efficient manner possible."

"I am sure that you will agree that it would simply be wasteful to spend any additional money on this program," Kasich wrote.

To Obama, Kasich requested "that you make provisions for the $400 million to be used to support other vital transportation infrastructure projects in Ohio."

If Obama cannot grant the request, then Kasich asked that the money go to reducing the federal government's $1.4 trillion deficit.

Strickland said last week the project will continue.

"If governor-elect Kasich wants to return the funds for rail startup and send 16,000 jobs to another state, that will be his decision to make when he becomes governor," said Strickland spokeswoman Amanda Wurst.

The jobs number is the top-side of direct and indirect jobs created by the rail project, according to one estimate.
