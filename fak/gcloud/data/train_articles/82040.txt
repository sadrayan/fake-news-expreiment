Trump: 'Racism is evil ... including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists'
The Pentagon revealed Wednesday that roughly 11,000 U.S. troops are currently deployed in Afghanistan, 2,600 more than the U.S. military had previously disclosed to the public.

The Obama-era policies did not include troops deployed for less than six-months -- a stint the military considers a "temporary basis" -- as part of the military's total for Afghanistan. Because the Obama administration had set caps on the number of troops allowed to be deployed to active war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, U.S. commanders found ways to supplement their forces by “temporarily” adding additional troops who would not be counted.
