You don't have to read the IMDb description to figure out what Creed II, the sequel to the Rocky spinoff, is about. All you need to do is look at the fan art that Rocky Balboa himself, Sylvester Stallone, shared on Instagram.

Clearly, the movie is about abs and hoodies.

Kidding. It's about Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan), Apollo Creed's son, getting ready to fight the son of Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren).

A quick refresher on who these characters are: Rocky, who's standing behind Adonis (front right), is of course the longtime protagonist of the Rocky boxing-movie franchise. In 2015's Creed (directed by Black Panther filmmaker Ryan Coogler), he becomes the ailing coach of Adonis, the son of Rocky's former opponent and dear friend. Adonis is Rocky's protégé who wants to fight like his late father.

At the left, we have the "if he dies, he dies" Drago dynasty. The elder, Ivan Drago, is responsible for killing Adonis' father, Apollo, in the ring (in Rocky IV). Rocky goes on to avenge his friend's death at the end of that film by defeating Drago in a knockout.

So, yeah, there's a lot of history there. In Creed II, Drago's son, Viktor Drago (played by Romanian boxer Florian Munteanu, front left), looks set to face Adonis, under the tutelage of his father.

The fight heads to theaters Nov. 21.
