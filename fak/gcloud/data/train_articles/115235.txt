Does the billboard itself actually exist of Highway 52? The leaves on the trees look a bit too green for Minnesota in the winter. [end update]

[Update #2] There's another, earlier version of the billboard shot from a different angle reported by Grant Nelson (grantnel2002) on reddit in from October 2017. The discussion notes:

[–]grantnel2002[S] 1 point 2 months ago Yeah basically. Was on the frontage road of a highway.

If this discussion is honest, it's real. Campaign finance records indicate Hampton is the home of Robert Johnson, president of "Republicans for Honesty in Government and a major DFL donor on the federal level.

On Sunday, "Paladin Cornelia" tweeted the photo above. Today, a friend of Bluestem provided a bit on research into just who those "Republicans for Honesty in Government" are:

step 1 look up "Republicans for Honesty in Government" on the MN Sec. of State website https://t.co/PwtEiKjNz5

step 2 google the address listed, which leads you here https://t.co/ccIWvgDNJ7

step 3 look up AEI on MN SOS, realize they are located in Delaware https://t.co/QYmlc70XfW — Andy (@tacomachine) January 2, 2018
