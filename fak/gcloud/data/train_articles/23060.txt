Charter School Finance
The Foundation School Program (FSP) is the primary source of funding for charter schools. The number of students attending as well as their program participation determine the amount of funding for each charter. Schools that choose to provide transportation to students receive additional state funds. Charter schools are not entitled to participate in the Instructional Facilities Allotment program.
