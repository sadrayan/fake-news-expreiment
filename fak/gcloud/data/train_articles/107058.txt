Obama: Hillary Will 'Say Anything and Change Nothing'

No matter what you think about which Democrat is best suited to be the nominee, or president, or who's at fault in the bitter back-and-forth that has emerged between them, one thing is clear in this primary fight: It's on.

Oh yes, it's on.

The campaign of Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., is hitting back hard -- quite harshly, in fact -- against the misleading radio ad from Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., (LINK), which feeds into a pattern by the Clintons of misrepresenting comments he made in an editorial board meeting in Reno, Nev., about Republicans.

The ad is so harsh, in fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see whomever the GOP nominee ends up being using it in his ads against Clinton, should she become the Democratic nominee.

You can listen to the ad HERE.

The script reads as follows:

Obama: "I’m Barack Obama, running for president and I approve this message."

Announcer: "It’s what’s wrong with politics today. Hillary Clinton will say anything to get elected. Now she’s making false attacks on Barack Obama.

"The Washington Post says Clinton isn’t telling the truth. Obama 'did not say that he liked the ideas of Republicans.' In fact, Obama’s led the fight to raise the minimum wage, close corporate tax loopholes and cut taxes for the middle class.

"But it was Hillary Clinton, in an interview with Tom Brokaw, who quote 'paid tribute' to Ronald Reagan’s economic and foreign policy. She championed NAFTA –- even though it has cost South Carolina thousands of jobs. And worst of all, it was Hillary Clinton who voted for George Bush’s war in Iraq.

"Hillary Clinton. She’ll say anything, and change nothing. It’s time to turn the page. Paid for by Obama for America."

What do you think? I'm certain the campaigns of Mitt Romney, John McCain, et al, will record the commercial for possible future use.
