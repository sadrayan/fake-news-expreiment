Subject: For a fact check, seeking your comment and guidance on claim that 90% of eligible Travis County voters are registered to vote

James:

Hello again.

I seek your comment, if you like, or guidance to experts in this field.

My question: What do you make of this Travis County official’s method for concluding 90 percent of the county’s eligible voters have registered to vote?

The official, Bruce Elfant, responded to our request for backup information with the email below.

Thanks,

G.

These numbers all look plausible, though the CVAP is of course an estimate, and the number of registered voters is also bound to have some error that comes from things like people moving and dying but not being removed from the rolls. Given that Texas doesn't participate in the major systems that crosscheck the rolls among states and check for accuracy, the estimate is likely a little high, in my view - though probably not a lot.
