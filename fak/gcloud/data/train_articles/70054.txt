More than $2.2 million in spending against recreational marijuana, Proposition 205, in October
PHOENIX - The effort to stop the legalization of recreational marijuana in Arizona is kicking into high gear, at least according to spending on the initiative.

An ABC15 analysis of state campaign finance data of contributions of at least $10,000 -- since Oct. 1 -- shows more than $3 million has been spent against Proposition 205, which would legalize recreational marijuana if passed in November.

On the other side, more than $600,000 has been spent in support of Prop. 205 so far this month.

Discount Tire is the largest anti-pot contributor, with a $1 million contribution on Oct. 12. Las Vegas mogul Sheldon Adelson contributed $500,000 against the initiative on Oct. 20.

The home builder industry has also lobbied against Prop. 205, with various contributions from Tempe-based Fulton Homes and Scottsdale-based Taylor Morrison.

Take a look at other significant contributions (of at least $10,000) both for and against Prop. 205 below:
