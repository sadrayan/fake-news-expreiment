Important Information Regarding Industry Productivity and Costs Data Tables
Industry Labor Productivity and Costs Data Tables The industry labor productivity indexes show changes over time in the relationship between the output of an industry and the labor hours expended on that output. Measures of output per hour (labor productivity) are useful for studying changes in labor utilization, projecting future employment requirements, analyzing trends in labor costs, examining the effects of technological improvements on employment and unemployment, analyzing related economic and industrial activities, and comparing productivity progress among countries. Although the labor productivity measures relate output to one input—labor time—they do not measure the specific contribution of labor, capital, or any other factor of production. Rather, they reflect the joint effect of a number of interrelated influences such as changes in technology, capital investment per worker, utilization of capacity, layout and flow of material, skill and effort of the work force, managerial skill, and labor-management relations.
