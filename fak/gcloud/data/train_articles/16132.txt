Below is a statement from Commissioner Staples about his opposition to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants:

"I oppose giving benefits to those who have violated our nation’s entry laws. If that bill came up for a vote today, it would not pass, and I support its repeal. Individuals that that came here illegally didn’t come here for in-state tuition. The real problem is that Obama and the Federal government have failed to secure our border. I have a 6 point plan to address this problem that doesn’t not include amnesty and starts with border security." -Todd Staples

Additionally, here is a link to a clip from a recent debate in Clear Lake, in which Commissioner Staples makes his opposition to in-state tuition to illegal immigrants crystal clear.
