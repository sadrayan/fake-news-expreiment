San Francisco Begins Registering Illegal Aliens To Vote
The Department of Elections in San Francisco on Monday issued voter registration for illegal aliens to allow them to vote for members of the city's Board of Education in the Nov. 6 election.

Becoming California's first city to allow non-American citizens to vote in local elections, Supervisor Norman Yee said, "We want to give immigrants the right to vote."

[For the record, "immigrants" are people who come to America through the legal process, while "illegal aliens" sneak into the country.]

ABC-7 reported. In order to vote, the illegal aliens must live in the city, be at least 18 years old and be the "parents, legal guardians or caregivers of children under the age of 19 who also reside in San Francisco,"reported.
