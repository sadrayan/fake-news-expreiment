Rick Scott 'convinced' fast rail is too risky
We caught up with Gov. Rick Scott this afternoon on his way back from a ribbon cutting in Melbourne. Here were his thoughts on high-speed rail:

"I remain convinced that there's no way that they can do a project that the state taxpayers are not going to be on the hook for the cost overruns, the operating costs and, if it ever gets shut down, the $2.4 billion that we would have to pay back."

Is there any way to convince you?



"I don't see any way that we're not going to be on the hook.

"Let's all remember. We have Tri-Rail right now. Tri-Rail costs us $64 million to operate. The fares only cover $10 million of it. The state's funding almost $35 million of that. So I'm not going to put our state taxpayers in a similar position."

What's your position on SunRail?

"We're in the process of reviewing SunRail."

U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson seemed to think you were leaving the door open on high-speed rail. Was he wrong?

"I'm convinced it doesn't work."
