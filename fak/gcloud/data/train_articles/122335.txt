Marine Wedding

Marine Sgt. Tyler Ziegel was seriously wounded by a suicide car bomber while serving his second tour in Iraq.

He spent 19 months in surgery and recovery at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas. He was supported

through this time by his fiancee, Renee Kline and his family. In 2006, Ziegel and Kline married and divorced

shortly thereafter. Ziegel tragically died of heroin and alcohol poisoning in 2012.
