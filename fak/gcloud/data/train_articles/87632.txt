Anti-ObamaCare Rally Set for Monday
Americans For Prosperity Georgia is set to hold an anti-ObamaCare rally at the state capitol on Monday.

“The Affordable Care Act has been disastrous for Georgians, causing premiums around the state to shoot up dramatically and causing many Georgians to lose their previous insurance. All this, despite the President’s promise that ‘if you like your plan, you can keep it,’” said AFP Communications Director Joel Aaron Foster. “The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says ObamaCare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021.”

The rally will also be held to support for House Bill 707, which states Georgia will not use any state resources to implement the federal law.

Set to appear at the rally are Attorney General Sam Olens; state Reps. Jason Spencer and Scott Turner; state Sen. Judson Hill; and representatives of the Georgia Tea Party.
