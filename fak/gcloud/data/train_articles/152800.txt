A man killed as he was arriving to his church Monday in the central valley has been identified.

He was Hector Antonio Lemus-Flores, 45, of North Las Vegas, Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin said. His death was ruled a homicide.

Members of his church found him lying on the ground next to his car. His Bible, police said, was found about 10 feet from where he had been left for dead.

“It’s very sad because he was just arriving to church,” Metropolitan Police Department homicide Lt. Dan McGrath said Monday. According to the parishioners who found him, he was a regular at the church’s early morning service.

Just after 5:35 a.m. Monday, Metro officers received the report of a man down outside Iglesia La Luz del Mundo, or Light of the World Church, at the intersection of Eastern and Cedar avenues. When officers arrived, McGrath said, they found another churchgoer performing CPR on Lemus-Flores, who had a gunshot wound.

Lemus-Flores was taken to University Medical Center’s trauma unit, where he died of a gunshot wound to the right chest about 6:15 a.m.

McGrath said there might have been a struggle between Lemus-Flores and the shooter.

Anyone who may have information on the shooting can anonymously call Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.
