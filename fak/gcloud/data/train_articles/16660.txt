Cynthia Cox is on leave, so she is not able to help you with this.

We have been tracking the changes in premiums for the benchmark silver plan available to individuals through the marketplaces since they were created for 2014. You can see the average nationally and by state in this data table: http://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/marketplace-average-benchmark-premiums/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D

More information about that analysis is found here: http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/

We don’t yet have complete data to do the same analysis for 2018 - but I’d expect us to sometime in early November after final rates are available across the country. Probably too late for this fact check, though.

Separately, Kaiser’s work was cited as a basis for this finding. Any changes since?

No change in our research county-level insurer participation. More on insurer competition in the marketplaces from 2014-2017 here:
