Chelsea Clinton to Leave Well-Paid NBC News Job
Less than three years after she embarked on a new and lucrative career as an NBC News special correspondent, Chelsea Clinton said on Friday that she would leave that position.

In a letter posted on her Facebook page, Ms. Clinton said she had decided to depart NBC News to focus on philanthropic work at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. She and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, are also expecting their first child this fall. At the same time, her mother, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is mulling a presidential bid in 2016.

“I am profoundly grateful to NBC viewers who responded to the stories I shared,” wrote Ms. Clinton, whose reports were part of NBC News’s “Making a Difference” series. Those reports were often in line with the charitable work Ms. Clinton does at the Clinton Foundation.
