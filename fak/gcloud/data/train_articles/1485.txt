Florida Bright Futures
It's disheartening to see Florida break the promise of Bright Futures, the merit-based college scholarship meant to keep our best and brightest students in-state. And sadly, planned cuts will hurt minority and middle-class families the most.

Three years ago, Florida spent $423 million a year to help high school graduates pay for college. But in the budget passed last week, lawmakers shrank that number to $266 million, down from $309 million this year.

To make the cuts work, lawmakers keep raising the bar for the award, which can pay as much as $2,600 per year. To receive the top award next year, high school graduates must have a minimum SAT score of 1170, up from 1020 this year. The minimum ACT score will jump, too, to 26 from 22.

As a result, the number of new Bright Futures scholarship students will be cut almost in half – from 41,107 last fall to 21,340 this fall.

Yes, the state is saving money by cutting the promise of Bright Futures.

But at what cost?

Floridians were promised something better in 1997, when we created the scholarship program with funds from the Florida Lottery. If our children worked hard in school, scored well on standardized tests and spent time volunteering in the community, they were promised help with the high costs of college.

Without question, Bright Futures became a bit too easy for average students to obtain. Still, next year's cuts go too far, too fast.

Since the last year of former Gov. Charlie Crist's term and throughout the tenure of Gov. Rick Scott, the number of scholarship winners has dropped dramatically. In 2011, Bright Futures served 179,076 students. Next year, that number will be closer to 127,573 — close to a 30 percent reduction.

Yes, the program has helped many wealthy families who could otherwise afford college tuition. One study says close to 30 percent of recipients have had an average family income of more than $122,000.
