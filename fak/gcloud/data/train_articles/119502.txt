Did Officer Nakia Jones Get Fired For Speaking Against Police?! [PHOTO]
Officer Nakia Jones became a viral sensation soon after the killing of Alton Sterling for speaking passionately about policemen around the country.

Jones called out racist officers and some black on black crime during her passionate statement on social media.

If you are white and you’re working in a black community and you are racist, you need to be ashamed of yourself. You stood up there and took an oath.

If this is not where you want to work, then you need to take your behind somewhere else.

Put these guns down because we’re killing each other. And the reason why all this racist stuff keeps going on is because we’re divided. We’re killing each other, not standing together.

It is now rumored that she was relieved of her duties, or suspended from her job in Ohio after her statement.

The mayor of Warrensville, Ohio, Brad Sellers shot down the rumors during a recent press conference.

According to Cleveland19:

Mayor Brad Sellers said Jones did not violate the social media policy that is currently in place. She is currently on full duty at the police department and there was not violations of any policies with the City of Warrensville Heights.
