Examining Mitch McConnell’s Claims on Health Care Overhaul
The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, made a vigorous and urgent argument this week to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

Speaking on the Senate floor Monday and Tuesday, he argued that drafting a replacement bill behind closed doors is not unusual, and discussed various criticisms of Obamacare.

Here is an assessment.

McConnell overstated the number of people who canceled Obamacare plans because of high costs.

Referring to a recent report from the Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. McConnell claimed that “nearly two million Americans” opted out of public health care exchanges, “and the most common reason they cited for doing so was because it was too expensive.”

In his statement, Mr. McConnell was referring to mostly people who picked a plan, but then never took the final step of paying a premium and enrolling — not people who left the exchanges after paying for insurance. Of the 12.2 million people who signed up for a plan by the end of open enrollment on January 31, according to the H.H.S. report, 10.3 million had actually paid for their coverage by February — a difference of 1.9 million.
