Congressman Zeldin Statement Supporting New Iran Sanctions
Washington, DC - Congressman Lee Zeldin (R - NY-1), member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, just released the following statement in support of new sanctions just announced on Iran's Ballistic Missile Program and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC):



“The party's over for Iranian leadership. We have a new President and Congress dedicated to a better direction that refuses to prop up the current Iranian regime.



Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism. The sanctioning of individuals and companies affiliated with Iran's Ballistic Missile Program and IRGC will assist with efforts to reduce Iran's destabilizing activities, which included a missile test just this week that violated a UN resolution, as well as their continued work to overthrow foreign governments, pledge to wipe Israel off the map, chanting Death to America in their streets, and so much more.



We need to pursue a stronger, more consistent foreign policy, which strengthens our relationships with our allies and treats our adversaries as our adversaries. Our enemies do not respect weakness, they only respect strength. We cannot be silent, not because we want war, but because we want to prevent it.”



This week, Congressman Zeldin joined with Congressmen Peter J. Roskam (R, IL-6), Leonard Lance (R, NJ-7), and Doug Lamborn (R, CO-5), co-chairs of the House Republican Israel Caucus, to introduce the Iran Nonnuclear Sanctions Act of 2017 (H.R.808), which targets the Islamic Republic’s support for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missile program, and restores sanctions to hold Iran accountable.
