Some bad Credit Karma advice? : personalfinance
So, there's a post going around my facebook friends claiming the following:

"If your original creditor sold your debt to a collection agency, they also wrote off your debt on their taxes which wrote off your obligation to pay. you can dispute the transaction via dispute.transunion.com (along with any other collection agency owned items lingering on your report.) Your dispute reason is "contract was cancelled" and write "NO CONTRACT" in the dispute comments. I have cleared THOUSANDS off my own report and have been working to help my friends and fmaily do the same! for FREE! Peace and love to all! Knowledge is power!"

Now, I'm pretty sure this is not legit at all--otherwise there wouldn't be a debt collection industry. But can anyone point me to exactly why this is bad advice? Or, on the off chance I'm wrong, explain to me why this isn't common knowledge?
