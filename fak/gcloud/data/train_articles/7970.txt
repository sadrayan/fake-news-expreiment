Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples Says Border Security Is Major Part Of Plan For Lieutenant Governor Campaign [AUIDO]
On the Thursday edition of The Chad Hasty Show, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples spoke with Chad Hasty about his campaign for Texas lieutenant governor.

Border security is one of the top priorities for Staples' campaign. He explained that he has come up with a 6-point plan to reform immigration that starts with protecting the borders and does not include amnesty. Staples said that the federal government has failed to protect the borders and now it's time for Texas to take steps to protect itself.

"I think Texans understand this: they know that a lot of these issues, these solutions may end in Washington. But it doesn't mean they have to start there. [We] can exercise our states rights, we can formulate policies, and then we can join together."

Staples also said he is a staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment. However, when asked about whether or not he supports open carry, he seemed to be hesitant to support it. He said he believed concealed carry would actually be more effective than having firearms out in the open.
