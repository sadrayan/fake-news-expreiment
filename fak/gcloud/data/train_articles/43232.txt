An Update on the Medicaid Primary Care Payment Increase : MACPAC
The final chapter in the March 2015 report provides an update on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid primary care payment increase. The increase, which was funded at the federal level and expired at the end of 2014, required all state Medicaid programs to pay for primary care services at Medicare payment levels during calendar years 2013 and 2014.

In the Commission’s view, there is not enough evidence to definitively determine whether the payment increase had an effect on provider participation or enrollee access to primary care in Medicaid.
