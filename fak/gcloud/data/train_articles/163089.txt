NSPCA issues alert of fake notice
THE National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) has urged people not to share an image which warns pet owners about criminals’ alleged new modus operandi.

The image advises pet owners, specifically dog owners, to be aware if red, yellow or pink stickers are stuck to their gates, walls, fences or doors because this is how gangs are marking properties containing dogs.

It says gangs are using the stickers to mark the number of dogs at the premises, to steal the dogs and use them for dog fighting.

The SPCA logo appears on the image.

The NSPCA said as far as it is aware, neither they nor any SPCA has published this post, although some branches may have shared it thinking it was NSPCA-approved.

‘NSPCA has not approved the use of the logo in this case and therefore the creator of the post is in contravention of the Trademark Act,’ said Veronica van der Merwe of the NSPCA Society Liaison Unit.

‘We urge SPCA staff, committee members and volunteers not to share this post and to inform any friends or family not to do so either.

‘The information only gives criminal elements more ideas of ways to either improve or amend their dastardly deeds.’
