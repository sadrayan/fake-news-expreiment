Gillum cites 7,000 donors to campaign for governor
As the fundraising race heats up in the campaign for the 2018 Democratic nomination for governor, Andrew Gillum may not have the most money, but he has the most donors.

Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, “took some well-deserved time off the campaign trail” in May due to the birth of his third child, his spokesman Geoff Burgan said.

But since he kicked off his campaign for Florida governor in March, his campaign and related PAC have brought in $1.2 million, Burgan said.

“We’re excited to have more than 7,000 contributors, the most in the race, and we’re raising the resources to compete in all 67 counties,” he said. “The mayor doesn't have a famous last name or personal wealth, but we're proud to have the support of thousands of Floridians.”

Burgan’s Democratic opponents, Winter Park businessman Chris King and former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, have each raised more than $2 million since they joined the race.

Those totals include $1 million King contributed to his campaign and about $1 million transferred over from Graham’s congressional campaign.

On the Republican side, the PAC for Adam Putnam, the state agricultural commissioner, has raised more than $11 million since it was created in 2015, two years before Putnam announced his candidacy in May.
