Setting the record straight
Democratic candidate for the US Senate Phil Bredesen recently released an ad touting his record on jobs. Well since he brought it up, let’s talk about Phil's actual jobs numbers and set the record straight. While Phil Bredesen was in the Governors office, the number of unemployed Tennesseans nearly doubled. Even further, he's now said emphatically that he would have voted against the tax cuts that have been creating jobs across the country even before the cuts were implemented.

"When Phil Bredesen was governor, unemployment jumped from 5.1 percent to 9.5 percent. He is backtracking to change his weak record, but Tennesseans won’t be fooled by misleading ads. They know Bredesen will just be a shill for Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, and Marsha Blackburn is the only one who will represent their shared values in the Senate."
