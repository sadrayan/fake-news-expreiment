Prominent NY Holistic Doctor Found Dead of Alleged Suicide | Health N…
It is with a heavy heart that break this tragic news of another doctor death. This time it is a prominent holistic doctor who practiced in Long Island, New York. His website video actually calls him a “leading physician of the world” and his patients are posting on my Facebook page (and sending emails) that they don’t believe it was suicide.

Dr Alex Shvartsman, was a well known holistic dentist AND an ND (a Naturopathic Doctor ). He was found dead this past weekend at his home and allegedly took his own life.

It’s not unusual for many in this sad, unintended series to have multiple degrees as a doctor. This well loved doctor was a dentist and an ND, while others were MDs and PhDs or DCs with PhDs, and so on.

Dr Schvartsman’s patients who have written are still in disbelief. His staff also sounded as if they were still in shock, but I didn’t ask them to elaborate on the matter.

Our heart goes out to his friends and family. Multiple biographies list him as having a wife and young child (his patients confirm he had been married with a son). We will withhold those names from this article.

Besides being an ND, Dr Schvartsman practiced mercury and drill free dentistry (we can’t even find a dentist in Florida who does drill free).

Of course countless other deaths don’t add up either and there are multiple families of these prominent holistic doctors (several others in New York, as well) who have either questioned the death of their loved ones publicly, hired private investigators (with more hiring firms every month), or questioned the deaths privately- and we respect their privacy.

Again, I will keep you updated and wish for all holistic doctors (including my better half of 7 years) to stay safe.
