Buhari Government has also reacted to the attempt of Atiku to truncate Nigeria democracy, saying that “the Federal Government has strongly decried the increasingly unpatriotic and desperate opposition politics being played by the PDP and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, warning that such dead-end opposition could be toxic for the nation’s democracy, if left unchecked.



“Never in the history of politics in Nigeria has an opposition party and its presidential candidate exhibited the kind of desperate tactics being deployed by the duo of the PDP and its flag-bearer, especially since President Muhammadu Buhari overwhelmingly defeated Atiku to win the 2019 presidential election.

(1077 | Gistmaniac) (m) olowoinlionsden at(1077 | Gistmaniac) Belated Story. That was Atiku's initial Plan, before the Presidential Election's initial Date was shifted and the CJN removed. Atiku knew full well he had no chance of defeating Buhari in the election, but he wanted to act as a Spoiler, a case of the Rat and the Beans. Atiku knew a successful military coup in Africa, not to talk of Nigeria, will forever remain a pipe dream at the moment. Belated Story.

(1435 | Gistmaniac) Online (m) Online kingcalors at(1435 | Gistmaniac) Anyone who knows he truely won the election shouldn't bother himself about coup. It is only the guilty that will always use be afraid and look for a flimsy excuse to use and arrest someone who wants to reclaim his mandate. After all he was told that he should go to court. Now he is in court some people are crying foul play. Anyone who knows he truely won the election shouldn't bother himself about coup.
