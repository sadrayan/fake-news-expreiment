Ask Michael Kors a Question

Written by PETA |

Project Runway‘s eighth season premieres tonight, and coincidentally I just heard about an opportunity to let judge Michael Kors know what we think of his designs—which include real fur. Kors tweeted that he will be answering questions from his fans in a Facebook video on August 4. Let’s take him up on his offer and flood him with questions, such as “Did you know that animals are skinned alive for their fur?” and “With all the luxurious faux furs that are available, why do you continue to kill animals?” or maybe “Would you submit to a brain scan to see if your empathy neurons are underdeveloped?”

Perhaps your question will be the nudge that Kors needs to get him to follow the lead of Runway star and PETA’s 2009 Man of the Year Tim Gunn. Tim narrated PETA’s video exposing what animals endure for fashion, he ensures that Project Runway‘s challenges are never fur-related, and he has worked to make a fur-free zone out of Liz Claiborne, where he is chief creative officer.

Let’s all urge Michael Kors to say “auf Wiedersehen” to fur! E-mail your questions to: [email protected]
