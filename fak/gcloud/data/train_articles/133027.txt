Ukraine has no alternative but European integration, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych said.

"An alternative for reforms in Ukraine and an alternative for European integration do not exist," Yanukovych said when speaking at the Ukrainian-Austrian business forum in Vienna on Thursday when responding to Austrian President Heinz Fischer, who said he heard of some decree of the Ukrainian government on the topic but was not aware of its essence.

Temporary difficulties might exist on Ukraine's path to the European integration, Yanukovych said. "Probably, the weather is not favorable at some stage of our climb to this altitude and so on," he said.

"We are walking along this path and are not changing direction," the Ukrainian president said.
