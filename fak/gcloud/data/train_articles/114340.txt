This book could have done with a lot more editing and review. The story could have been quite a bit better if the author had had more support/ a better editor, and there is an inconsistence with one of the character's hair colour. On one page it is brown when it should be red. The reasons the princess don't want to marry are not really clear, and she looks to be the same age as her father. Minor things, but annoying once you've read the book 100 times.

With that said, it is the best of its type available. There's zero objectionable material, and it teaches my kids exactly what I want it to teach them - that anyone can fall in love with anyone else. My kids particularly like the facial expressions on the characters. I would recommend this book to other parents.
