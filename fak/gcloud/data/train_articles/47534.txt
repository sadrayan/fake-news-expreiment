Fact Check on Cuomo-Molinaro Debate
But, Mr. Cuomo has played a key role in the system’s demise by not providing it with sufficient funding. In fact, he has even diverted funding away from the subway. Moreover, he has repeatedly blamed Mayor Bill de Blasio for the state of the system, emphasizing the city’s ownership of the subway.

Legalizing Medical Marijuana

As state officials mull whether to legalize recreational marijuana, the candidates sparred over the process of legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, which the state approved in 2014. Mr. Cuomo blamed Mr. Molinaro and other Republicans for delaying the process.

“I think you should ask my opponent why he voted against it,” Mr. Cuomo jabbed.

Mr. Molinaro, who said he now supports the use of marijuana for medical purposes, did vote against a bill to legalize medical marijuana when he served in the State Assembly. When Mr. Cuomo pressed him on his vote, Mr. Molinaro deflected, saying he has not been in the Legislature for years.

But Mr. Cuomo has not always favored legalizing medical marijuana. During his first run for governor, Mr. Cuomo stated his opposition to medical marijuana, saying the dangers of the drug “outweigh the benefits.” He reversed course in January 2014, signing an executive order that allowed limited use of the drug by those with serious illnesses.

Molinaro’s Support of Trump

In recent months, as Mr. Cuomo has ratcheted up his attacks against President Trump, he has sought to portray Mr. Molinaro as “an acolyte of Donald Trump.” On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo continued that effort, in one instance pointedly asking Mr. Molinaro if he supported Mr. Trump.

“Let’s get out of this conversation,” Mr. Molinaro said.

Although Mr. Molinaro has said he did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, he has not always been so evasive in seeking the president’s support.
