We will have a further discussion of Cornynâ€™s draft dodging at the appropriate time. It is well documented that John Cornyn continually votes to send others to war, but declined to serve in the military himself. Cornyn enthusiastically voted for and supported the disastrous Iraq mistake, which cost trillions, took four thousand American lives, and wounded tens of thousands more. Washington insiders like Cornyn are willing to send the sons and daughters of working families to war after war, but they and their friends don't have to fight or serve themselves.
