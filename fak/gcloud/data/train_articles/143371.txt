Kissinger: The Secret Side of the Secretary of State: Gary Allen: 9780686313113: Amazon.com: Books
I purchased this book after previously purchasing a reprint of "None Dare Call It Conspiracy";. While this work was informative , it was not on the same plane as the aforementioned NDCIS. The events in this book toook place before my birth (1983) but are still of significence to modern patriots. I do recommend this book if you are young enough not to remember Kissinger's actions.
