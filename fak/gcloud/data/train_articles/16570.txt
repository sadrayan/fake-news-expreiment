Folks:

Sen. Cruz said in the Tribfest public interview Sunday: “In 2017, I’ve done 17 town halls.”

For a PolitiFact Texas fact-check, could you specify those events?

In each case, was the event an open-to-the-public gathering where anyone could offer a question? If not, how was the respective event organized?

Thanks,

g.

Sen. Cruz has in fact held 19 town halls with Texas constituents in 2017, organized by third parties who determined attendees, where he has taken unvetted questions from anyone in the crowd - at businesses, factories, chambers of commerce, and in public venues. 11 were open to the media, 4 were broadcast live, 3 were open for the general public to register and attend.

Can you break out the 12, 4 and 3 per the chart you sent?

1:06 p.m.

Correction (amended below): 11 open to the media. They are bolded in the table

The 3 CVA town halls were open for the general public to register and attend. Those 3 plus the Border Patrol Union Town Hall were also livestreamed. That number (4) does not include events which were carried live by local TV stations in attendance.

You have asked us to provide backup about the town halls we have conducted. The definition of a town hall by Merriam Webster is "an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members.” The events we have provided fall under that definition. I realize that under the guise of asking about town halls, Politifact might instead be intending to count the events at which protestors have been able to shout at Sen. Cruz, to which I would note the numerous times that Sen. Cruz has willingly engaged with those who have come to protest, here, here, here. And here.

Thanks.



Maybe I should ask a broader question. What events has Sen. Cruz had in Texas this year open to the public without registration where anyone could ask a question, on any topic, to him?

Gardner, I appreciate your efforts to move the goalposts but we’ll stick with the premise of your original question to us.
