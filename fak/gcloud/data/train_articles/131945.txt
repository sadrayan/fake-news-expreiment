Writer Confirms "The Electric Slide" Is About A Vibrator
71 year old songwriter Neville Livingston aka Bunny Wailer is putting a rumor to rest by clarifying that the Electric Slide, also known as the Electric Boogie is indeed about a vibrator. Rumors of the songs meaning began circulating on social media a few weeks ago and everyone has been desperate for answers. According to a source close to Livingston, word of the question about the origins of the song reached him in Kingston, Jamaica where he currently resides and he put the rumors to rest. "I'm surprised it took people this long to figure out" the source tells us he said. Apparently Livingston wrote the song after a girlfriend told him she didn't need him because she had a toy she nicknamed the "electric slide"

Lets examine the lyrics:

It's electric!

You can't see it (it's electric!)

You gotta feel it (it's electric!)

Ooh, it's shakin' (it's electric!)

Jiggle-a-mesa-cara

She's a pumpin' like a matic

She's a movin' like electric

She sure got the boogie

You gotta know it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie!)

Now you can't hold it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie!)

But you know it there,

Here, there and everywhere

I've got to move,

I'm going on a party ride

I've got to groove, groove, groove,

And from this music

I just can't hide

Are you comin' with me?

Come let me take you on a party ride

And I'll teach you, teach you, teach you

I'll teach you the electric slide

Some say it's mystic

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

You can't resist it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

You can't do without it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin' like a matic

She's movin' like electric

She sure got the boogie

Don't want to lose it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

But you can't choose it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

But you know it's there,

Here, there and everywhere

I've got to move,

Come let me take you on a party ride

And I'll teach you, teach you, teach you

I'll teach you the electric slide

You can't see it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

You gotta feel it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

Ooh, it's shakin'

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie)

Jiggle-a-mesa-cara she's a pumpin' like a matic

She's movin' like electric

She sure got the boogie

You gotta know it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie!)

Now you can't hold it

(It's electric

Boogie woogie, woogie!)

But you know it's there,

Here, there and everywhere

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

Ola ola eh, ola eh (don dela don deloh!)

If he's not talking about a vibrator I don't know what he's talking about. Are we still going to play this at every cookout, wedding, graduation and prom. Yes.
