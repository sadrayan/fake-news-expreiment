HRC National Dinner
Hillary Rodham Clinton has served as secretary of state, senator from New York, first lady of the United States, first lady of Arkansas, a practicing lawyer and law professor, activist, and volunteer. Clinton ran for president in 2016, championing her belief that Americans are stronger together and making LGBTQ equality a pillar of her campaign with the most robust and ambitious LGBTQ plan any candidate for president has ever laid out. In July 2016, she became the first woman to earn a major party’s nomination for president, and went on to earn nearly 66 million votes — nearly 3 million more than Donald Trump. In her concession speech on November 9, 2016, she called on supporters to “never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it.” Inspired by the widespread activism after the election, Clinton founded Onward Together, an organization that works to advance progressive values by encouraging people to organize, get involved, and run for office.
