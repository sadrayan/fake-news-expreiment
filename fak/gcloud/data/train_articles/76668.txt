Dr. Fahey is the Director of the ESRL Chemical Sciences Division. He joined NOAA in Boulder in 1979 after receiving advanced degrees in physics from the University of Wisconsin and the University of Missouri. As a Research Physicist in CSD and the former Aeronomy Laboratory, his principal research interests have been measurements of trace gases and aerosols in the troposphere and lower stratosphere using instruments on board research aircraft with an emphasis on stratospheric ozone depletion and the roles of black carbon, biological aerosol, and water vapor in the climate system. He is also interested in scientific assessments and the communication of scientific results to stakeholders, decision-makers, and the public. He is currently a Co-Chair of the Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. He is a coauthor of recent assessments of stratospheric ozone depletion, aviation and climate change and the role of black carbon in the climate system. He is also an author of the 2017 Climate Science Special Report of the US National Climate Assessment.

Dr. Fahey has received the U. S. Department of Commerce Silver and Bronze Medals for Meritorious Federal Service, the American Meteorological Society Henry G. Houghton Award, and is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union.
