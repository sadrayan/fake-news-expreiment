Standing room only at 1st Democratic mayoral debate
BUFFALO, N.Y. -- It was standing room only Thursday night for the first debate between the three Democratic candidates for Buffalo mayor.

"I think I did, I really did get the message out that there has to be transparency in city government," said candidate Betty Jean Grant (D). "That I'm the only candidate that has not accepted money from Carl Paladino nor LP Ciminelli; two of the biggest developers in the city of Buffalo. I'm not engaged in pay-to-play politics and I never would. In fact they have not contributed to my campaign gives me the freedom to be independent of any political strings attached to me. I could go into office with a level of transparency that has never been seen before."

"I understood that this was going to be a free-for-all," said candidate Mark Schroeder (D). "I understood that the mayor's groupies, all employees of city hall, were going to be here. I don't listen to cat-calls, I don't listen to it. They're all citizens too. And I think a lot of employees of city hall are going to vote for me because they know we're competent, they know we have a plan. And they also know I've been comptroller and seen the mismanagement first hand."

"This city is better and stronger than it was before I took office," said mayor Byron Brown (D). "I talked about the fiscal crisis that I came into, how we were able to solve that fiscal crisis, strengthen the city's finances, build our economy, create jobs for our residents and move Buffalo into the future."

The Democratic primary is September 12th.
