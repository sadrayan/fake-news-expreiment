Legislative Action on the Governor’s Tax Recommendations

Communications Services Tax - The lion’s share ($470.9 million) of the Governor’s tax cuts come from a 3.6 percentage point reduction in the state portion of the CST, a tax levied on cell phones, cable and satellite television and non-residential landline phone service. The state rate on phone and cable television would fall from 6.65 percent to 3.05 percent. The rate on satellite television would fall from 10.8 percent to 7.2 percent. Consumers will save $43 annually for every $100 per month they spend on communications services. Since part of the state CST is shared with local governments, the budget provides $44.8 million in GR to hold local governments harmless from the CST cut. Florida TaxWatch has been recommending a reduction in the CST for several years, finding that it would be the most justifiable way to give broad based tax relief to Floridians. Florida’s total state and local CST rate can reach as high as 16.29 percent, one of the highest rates in the nation. Florida’s CST rate is also more than twice the highest state and local general sales tax rate in the state. SB 110 has been filed to provide a 2 percent reduction and the sponsor said she would be amending it to mirror the Governor’s 3.6 percent reduction. There is no House companion yet, although it was discussed in Finance and Tax. Florida TaxWatch was on hand to share our research on this issue and provided additional information requested by the Chair this week.

Sales Tax Exemption for Manufacturing Machinery and Equipment - The 2013 Legislature passed a three year exemption, set to expire April 30, 2017. SB 544, HB 613 and HB 4035 would make the exemption permanent. This is a long-time recommendation of Florida TaxWatch. This will not cost the state any money this year, but recurring savings are expected to be $142.5 million annually. Under SB 544 and HB 613, the exemption for cement mixer drums, enacted last year, would still expire on April 30, 2017.

Corporate Income Tax Reduction - HB 49 and SB 138 would increase the standard corporate income tax exemption from $50,000 to $75,000, as was recommended by Governor Scott. This has been a priority for the Governor and the exemption was increased from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011 and to $50,000 in 2013. His proposal to increase it to $75,000 last year did not pass. This higher exemption would eliminate corporate income taxes for 2,189 out of 9,934 taxpayers (22.0 percent), and save $18.7 million annually. Since it will apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, the FY 2015-16 impact will be only $7.6 million. SB 138 has already passed two committees and is now in its last committee of reference – Appropriations.

Sales Tax Holiday – The Governor is recommending another of the popular “back to school” sales tax holidays. The 3-day sales tax exemption for clothing priced at $100 or less, school supplies at $15 or less, and the first $750 of the price of a computer would save consumers $41.1 million. No legislation mirror this has been filed yet (although there certainly will be), but HB 101 would create a permanent 3-day holiday on the same items.

Sales Tax Exemption for College Textbooks - The Governor also wants to exempt college textbooks from the state and local sales tax. The exemption would apply to textbooks for both public and private institutions. College students would save an estimated $41.4 million per year, or $60 to $75 per student annually. The state would lose $33.9 million annually, local governments would lose $7.5 million annually. Legislation has yet to be filed.

Other Florida TaxWatch Tax Priorities

Commercial Leases - A tax cut that was not included in the Governor’s proposal, but which appears to have legislative support, is a reduction in the sales tax on commercial leases. HB 101, SB 140, and HB 245 all would reduce the tax. The first two would reduce the tax rate from 6 percent to 5 percent. HB 245 would create an increasing exemption. The first $10,000 of lease payments would be exemption in FY 2105-16. And the exemption would increase by $10,000 annually, until it reached $90,000 in FY 2023-24. While discussed, these bill have not been voted on yet. Florida TaxWatch strongly supports the reduction/elimination of this tax which is unique to Florida.

Collection of Sales Taxes on Remote Sales: Florida TaxWatch has been researching this issue and recommending solutions for more than 10 years. Many bills have been filed to help address this over the years. This year SB 310 would bring Florida fully into the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, which provides an opportunity for Florida to begin collecting money from a compact of sellers that voluntarily collect the tax. HB 101 would have expanded nexus over remote retailers, requiring more to collect tax on sales to Floridians. These bills have not yet been heard.

Sales Taxes

HB 249 and SB 398 -- on the Agriculture Committee agenda for next week -- would create and expand several agricultural sales tax exemptions:

Adds irrigation equipment and repair to the existing exemption for the sales or lease of farm equipment;

Exempts the sales price of up to $20,000 for a trailer weighing 12,000 pounds or less;

Exempts stakes used by a farmer to support plants during agricultural production; and

Expands the term “livestock” to include aquaculture species raised for commercial purposes.

HB 259 and SB 384 would create a one-day Small Business Saturday Sales Tax Holiday (November 28, 2015) during which no sales tax would be collected on any retail sale by a small business. A small business would be a business that remitted less than $200,000 in sales taxes to the state during the previous year. SB 384 is on the Senate Commerce and Tourism agenda next week.

HB 693 and SB 712 would exempts the sale or lease of all aircraft from the sales tax. Currently the exemption is provided only for aircraft over 15,000 pounds that is used by a common carrier.

HB 355 and SB 506 would change the method for calculating the amount of sales tax due on all purchases. Instead of using the current bracket system, the sales price would be multiplied by the tax rate and rounded down to the nearest cent. These bills have not been heard and its significant price tag - $101 million - will make it difficult to advance.

HB 303 and SB 624 would impose a 25 cent surcharge on tickets to professional sporting events to fund high school sports programs.

SB 198 would allow, the governing authority in each county to levy a discretionary sales surtax of 0.5 percent or 1 percent for the purpose of funding capital restoration of natural water bodies, including tributaries, canals, stormwater systems, and channels. Funds may be used for dredging operations if related to ecologically beneficial muck removal.

HB 89 and SB 188 would exempt the sale of an original work of art that is signed and sold by the artist if the work is not numbered and the sales price equals or exceeds $1,000.

Property Taxes

SB 260 and HB 489 would allow a taxpayer to include multiple items of substantially similar tangible personal property on a single Value Adjustment Board (VAB) petition and to pay a single petition filing fee. HB 489 passed the House Finance & Tax Committee this week. SB 260 passed Community Affairs last week and is on the Senate Finance and Tax agenda for next week.

HB 173 would increase the property tax exemption for widows, blind persons, and totally and permanently disabled persons from $500 to $5,000.

HJR 229 and SJR 588 propose an amendment to the state Constitution to allow the Legislature, by general law, to exempt from taxation property owned by a municipality that is not used for municipal or public purposes.

HB 695 would make several changes to the VAB process including: taxpayers must sign the petition; interest on assessment and refunds would change from 12 percent to the prime rate; and a VAB that received more than 10,000 objections would be review by the Department of Revenue.

SB 780 would allow the governing body of a municipality to levy a law enforcement services special assessment to fund all or a portion of its costs of providing law enforcement services if property taxes millage are reduced by a like amount.

HJR 299 proposes an amendment to the state Constitution to authorize the living spouse of a deceased veteran, who upon death was aged 65 or older, partially or permanently disabled as a result of combat, and honorably discharged, to keep the discount on ad valorem taxes currently afforded the veteran. The exemption is based on the percentage of the veteran's disability. The exemption would be transferrable to another residence if the spouse remains unmarried and uses it as the primary residence.

HB 367 and SB 406 would prohibiting a bidder from placing multiple bids during the sale of certain tax certificates by a tax collector

HJR 375 and SJR 652 propose an amendment to the state Constitution that would revise the current homestead tax exemption that may be granted by counties or municipalities for low-income, elderly people that have lived in their home for at least 25 years. The current exemption is 100 percent of the assessed value of a homestead with a just value less than $250,000. The amendment would lock in the just value of the home to its value when the exemption is originally applied for, meaning the taxpayer would not lose the exemption due to rising value.

SJR 400 proposes an amendment to the state Constitution that would exempt the assessed value of a renewable energy source device or component from the tangible personal property tax and allow the Legislature, by general law, to prohibit consideration of the installation of such device in determining the assessed value for real property taxes.

HB 417 would add a new right to the Taxpayers Bill of Rights that reads: “The right to value definitions based on actual assessment practices, applicable provisions of the State Constitution, and the laws of this state, applied consistently in both assessment development by the property appraiser and assessment review by the value adjustment board and the courts of this state.”

Other Filed Tax Bills

Tax Swaps – Two bills have been filed that would be a significant change to the state’s tax system by replacing some taxes with others. Both would also provide a large tax cut. HB 317 replace the corporate income tax, the sales tax on commercial leases and on manufacturing machinery and equipment with a 1 percent increase in the state sales tax. This would result in a net $141 tax reduction. HB 319 would replace most school property tax (Required local effort and non-voted discretionary and capital outlay levies) with a 2.75 percent increase in the state sales tax. This would result in a net $279 million tax cut.

Community Contribution Tax Credit Program - HB 311 and SB 302 would delay the expiration of the program for 9 years, until June 30, 2025. Under this program, businesses that have made contributions to eligible projects may receive tax credits, equal to 50 percent of the contribution, which can be taken against sales and use taxes, corporate income taxes, and insurance premium taxes. Total credits are limited to $21.9 annually. SB 302 cleared Community Affairs last week and is on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development agenda for next week.

New Small Business Tax Credit – SB 128 and HB 517 would create a new corporate income tax credit for new small business. If qualified, the business would receive a $1,500 credit for each employee, up to a maximum total credit of $21,000.

Florida Student Internship Tax Credit – HB 427 would provide a corporate income tax credit for hiring a student as an intern within the student's field of study if the business has been in existence for at least 3 years. The credit is limited to two students per business and the student must be employed as an intern for no more than 180 days. The credit is equal to 50 percent of the student’s salary, with a limit of $3,600 per student.

Aviation Fuel – HB 595 and SB 722 would reduce the tax on aviation fuel from 6.9 cents per gallon to 5.4 cents per gallon.
