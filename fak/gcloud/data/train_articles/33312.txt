Trump directed Cohen to seek restraining order against Stormy Daniels
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump was personally involved in an effort to prevent adult film actress Stormy Daniels from publicly discussing an alleged sexual encounter with him, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN.

The President told his then-personal attorney Michael Cohen in a February phone call to seek a restraining order against Daniels over concerns that she was contemplating a media interview, the source said.

"Don't worry, I'll pay for everything," Trump told Cohen, according to the source. The conversation happened months after Daniels had signed a hush agreement to stay quiet about the alleged affair.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Trump's involvement.

The source said the President's son, Eric Trump, became involved and that a California-based Trump Organization lawyer, Jill Martin, was directed to sign the arbitration document. Martin sought Eric Trump's advice when the media eventually posed questions to her about her involvement, the source added. Martin told the media that she worked on the arbitration in her "individual capacity."
