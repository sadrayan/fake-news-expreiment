Herman Cain On Trump’s ‘Pizzagate’: If You’re Born With A Silver Spoon, You Eat Pizza With Utensils
If there’s one thing even the casual observer knows about Herman Cain, it’s that he takes pizza very seriously– it’s the reason he found so much success as CEO of Godfather’s Pizza. So when Cain appeared on ABC News, he couldn’t escape questions about that other controversy of the week: Donald Trump using a fork to eat pizza. “If you’re born with a silver spoon in your mouth,” Cain joked, “maybe you believe you’re supposed to eat pizza with a knife and a fork.”

The pizza conversation came into play after his hosts asked him to taste test one of D.C.’s most popular pizza places, We the Pizza. “You know I’m going to give you the honest feedback,” Cain warned. “I can’t sugarcoat it.” Ultimately, he determined that the pizza’s crust had “the right amount of chewiness,” but that it was a little light on the toppings. “Put some meat on that pizza!”

Then the conversation veered back to politics, sort of: what did Herman Cain, the premier pizza expert in the 2012 field, think of Donald Trump using utensils to eat pizza? Cain went negative: “If you’re born with a silver spoon in your mouth, maybe you believe you’re supposed to eat pizza with a knife and a fork!” Cain also noted that, as someone born sans silver spoon, “I had to learn to eat with my hands.”
