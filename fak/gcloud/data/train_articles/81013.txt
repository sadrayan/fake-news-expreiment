Federal grant to Pacur's predecessor hinged on 11 new jobs
In return for getting a $75,000 federal grant in 1979, the predecessor company to Pacur, the firm now owned by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson, had to agree to create 11 jobs.

The agreement to build a rail between Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies Inc. and the city of Oshkosh was reached in March 1979. That was several months before Johnson said he joined Pacur.

The $75,000 grant, called an Urban Development Action Grant, came from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Records reviewed by the Journal Sentinel include an agreement that said "within six months . . . the developer will use its best efforts to create or cause to be created 11 permanent new jobs, three of which will be for persons who, at the time of their employment, are of low and moderate income."

WISS changed its focus and name to Pacur in late August 1979, five months after the grant approval.

It's not entirely clear when Johnson joined Pacur. In recent interviews, he has said July or perhaps August of 1979. Johnson said he worked as Pacur's accountant and co-founder and that he knew nothing of the federal grant.

City records indicate, however, that work on the rail spur was continuing as late as Nov. 1 of that year. A change order for the project was put in on that date.

Both WISS and Pacur were led by Pat Curler, Johnson's brother-in-law and his initial boss at Pacur.

Johnson now owns the company.

Asked to provide details on what jobs were created as a condition of the grant, the Johnson campaign said Johnson "had no role in the agreement and therefore we do not have details or documents to provide you in regards to WISS' compliance with that grant."

The Journal Sentinel's Dan Bice reported last month that Pacur had changed its website to move up Pacur's first day of operation from 1977 to 1979.
