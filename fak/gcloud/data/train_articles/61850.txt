Fact Check: Is Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz of San Juan Facing Charges of Over $3 Million in Fraud?
The website YourNewsWire—which readers of TWS Fact Check might be familiar with—published an article claiming that “San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and her party are facing fraud charges relating to the embezzlement of over $3 million in federal funds.”

The blog post then goes on a long diatribe ridiculing the Mayor’s anti-Trump rhetoric, suggesting that it was hypocritical of Cruz to “blame Trump” for Puerto Rico's slow recovery when she was allegedly guilty of embezzlement.

According to a DOJ press release from July 5 of this year, it was the mayor of the municipality of Sabana Grande, Miguel G. Ortiz-Vélez, who had “been indicted and arrested for his participation in a conspiracy to steal federal funds involving fraudulently obtained contracts from the PR Department of Education.”

YourNewsWire even cited the AP’s report that it was the “the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande” not the mayor of San Juan. (Perhaps Gob Bluth assisted in the geographical mistake.) The article was shared over 20,000 times on Facebook before being flagged as false.

Fox News has reported that “the administration of the mayor of San Juan . . . is being investigated by the FBI on corruption charges, according a local news outlet.” But this is an entirely separate and unconfirmed report than the allegations in YourNewsWire.

The incorrect claim also appeared on several YouTube videos and gained traction on social media.
