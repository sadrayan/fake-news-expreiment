Red fungus inside bananas

There are a variety of plant diseases that can cause the inside of bananas to take on a red discolouration. This discolouration has led to false claims of bananas containing blood.

Nigrospora is a fungal disease that causes the centre of the banana to turn dark red. Nigrospora can infect the fruit in tropical climates where bananas are grown.

Mokillo, moko, and blood disease bacterium are bacterial diseases that can also cause red discoloration in bananas.

While unappealing to eat, these diseases affecting bananas are not a threat to human health, however when in doubt, throw it out or compost them.
