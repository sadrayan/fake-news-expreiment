The International Criminal Court says it has enough evidence to put Ivory Coast's ex-President Gbagbo on trial for war crimes.

He faces charges of murder, rape, attempted murder and persecution.

Some 3,000 people were killed as the country descended into civil war after Mr Gbagbo refused to accept defeat in the November 2010 election.

The 69-year-old, who is the first former head of state to have appeared at the ICC, insists he is innocent.

He says he is the victim of a plot by former colonial power France to oust him.

Judges at the pre-trial chamber decided that the prosecution did have enough evidence to put Mr Gbagbo on trial but no date was set.

He was Ivory Coast's president from 2000 until April 2011, when he was arrested by forces loyal to President Alassane Ouattara, backed by French troops.

Mr Gbagbo is the first former head of state to be detained by the ICC, although Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and Liberia's Charles Taylor were tried by special courts in The Hague.
