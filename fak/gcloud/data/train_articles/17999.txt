U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican

WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) announced today that he will soon introduce legislation to ensure that veterans injured in the line of duty during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom have a legal right to the full enlistment bonus promised to them by the Department of Defense.

The measure would correct a surprising loophole in federal law that allows the Department to withhold full payment of enlistment bonuses when service members are found physically unfit for duty due to injuries sustained in combat.

The Department often offers bonuses to encourage enlistment or reenlistment, up to $40,000 and $90,000 respectively. Typically, up to half of the bonus is paid upon a soldier’s commitment to serve, with the remainder transferred in periodic payments over the next several years. Current law does not compel the Department to complete payments to soldiers unable to continue their duties due to combat injuries.

“Our young men and women serve with incredible courage and bravery. Their enlistment represents a commitment to serve and protect their country,” Sessions said. “In return, the United States makes a commitment to them, and the government must fulfill its end of the bargain.”

The nonpayment issue was raised by the Dole-Shalala Commission, an independent working group formed by President Bush to investigate the quality of health care for soldiers returning from combat overseas. While the Department responded to the commission’s concerns by changing its policies, it is currently not under any requirement to make full payment of bonuses to injured veterans.

“It is unthinkable that the Department of Defense would fail to provide the financial compensation promised to those willing to serve, particularly when those same soldiers have suffered serious injuries in combat,” said Sessions. “This legislation underscores the principle that the Department of Defense must make good on promises made to new recruits.”

Sessions’ legislation is retroactive to September 11, 2001, providing relief to all affected service members who have participated in the War on Terrorism.

A similar measure, H.R. 3793, was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in October. Sessions’ legislation, which has not yet received a designation number, is expected to be referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services for consideration.
