Energy Resources for State, Local, and Tribal Governments
Investing in energy strategies that lower emissions can be an effective way for state, local and tribal governments to achieve multiple goals: improving air quality and public health, strengthen their energy systems, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money. EPAâ€™s State and Local Energy and Environment Program offers free tools, data and technical expertise about energy strategies, including energy efficiency, renewable energy and other emerging technologies, to help state, local and tribal governments achieve their environmental, energy and economic objectives. While many of these resources were developed for state and local governments, tribes may also find them useful.
