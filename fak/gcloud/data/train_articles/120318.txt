Les œuvres d’art contemporaines de Laurence Jenkell
A contemporary material that gave birth to the first candies " Wrappings Colors", and " Transparent Wrappings " allowing to " jenkelliser " any object. The " mystic " of the object-candy become pop icon with plexiglas. A concept of multiplicity and of seriality, transformed by a strength of the intrusive color, the opaque colors tinged into the mass, or airbrush painted. A candy " wrapping " in Plexiglas, unique piece by definition. Never the same twist, never the same drape. The beauty in the simplicity.
