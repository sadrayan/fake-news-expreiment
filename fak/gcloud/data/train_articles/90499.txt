When Jeb Bush speaks, people cringe
While the latest gaffe certainly isn't a bigger story than, say, the scandalous inability of the state to hold a clean, well-run election, the story does call into question the judgment of the man who wants a second term as governor in a state with sizable minority and gay-and-lesbian populations. Bush's record on social issues isn't exactly stellar: His nominee to head the state's troubled child welfare agency signed onto a treatise calling for more corporal punishment of children and the consignment of women to the home. And the glaring disconnect between his words and the warm and fuzzy image he portrays in public is simply impossible to ignore.

Bush likes to project the image of compassionate conservative in public. His reelection campaign commercials portray him as just "Jeb" -- canoodling with schoolteachers and handing out $160-a-month prescription-drug subsidies to the elderly poor.

But the man who wept in public and pleaded for privacy in the case of his drug-troubled daughter (she was recently caught with crack cocaine at a rehabilitation center) just can't seem to stop making inappropriate, off-color remarks in private. For a man who has made "accountability" a cornerstone of his governorship, Bush's inability to restrain his tongue -- and his refusal to brook criticism for it -- just seems troubling.
