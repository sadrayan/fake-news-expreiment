<>.<>.<> Los Angeles, Alta California <>.<>.<> December 20, 2003 San Bernardino, California Cops Execute Mexican Man in Custody

After an intensive search of the area where the shooting took place, San Bernardino police found and arrested Cerna and took him to the San Bernardino Sheriff's Station. According to a Sheriff's spokesperson, Ricardo Alfonso Cerna, took out a gun from his left pocket while in the interrogation room and then he shot himself in the head. What's wrong with this picture?

The largely Mexican and Mexican-American community in San Bernardino are not buying the version put forth by the S.B. Sheriffs. Community activists are saying that the San Bernardino County Sheriff's are increasingly acting as police, judges and executioners when dealing with Mexicans. Ricardo Alfonso Cerna did not speak English but only Spanish, according to some witnesses.

The Assistant District Attorney, Michael Risley, said, "There are no grounds for us to investigate what happened inside the department as a criminal investigation." He added, "I don't see any criminal laws broken."
