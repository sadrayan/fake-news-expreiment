Plano-based City House working with QuikTrips as designated Safe Place
The nonprofit City House has been named an official Safe Place as part of a national program for young people in need of immediate help and safety.

Plano-based City House is working with QuikTrip locations in Collin and Denton counties, which have the yellow Safe Place signs posted prominently at their stores.

Youths needing help can go to a QuikTrip 24 hours a day, seven days a week and request help. QuikTrip employees will immediately contact City House, which always has someone on call and available to help. The organization can help youths who are runaways or homeless, who are abused or kicked out of the house, or who are in any unsafe situation.

Youth can also text the word “SAFE” and their current location (address, city, state) to 69866 for immediate help nationwide. They will be provided with the closest Safe Place location.

The Safe Place designation is not to be confused with the Safe Haven or Baby Moses law, which allows people to drop off an unwanted baby who is less than 60 days old.

Youths stopping for help at QuikTrip locations in Dallas County will be connected with Jonathan’s Place in Garland. In Tarrant County, QuikTrip locations will connect youth with ACH Child and Family Services in Fort Worth.
