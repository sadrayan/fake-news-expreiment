Trump Says California Can Learn From Finland on Fires. Is He Right?
Mr. Trump added that when Finland does have forest fires, they are “a very small problem.”

But as with his earlier comments about forest management in California, experts said the president’s remarks were misleading.

The Finns don’t rake.

Raking for leaves and needles is not a normal feature of Finnish fire prevention, according to Rami Ruuska, a forest fires expert at the Finnish Interior Ministry. Instead, Finns focus on removing dead trees from the forest floor — where possible.

“Of course, we have a big country and we can’t do it everywhere,” Mr. Ruuska said.

President Sauli Niinisto of Finland said, in an interview published Sunday in a Finnish newspaper, that in a brief conversation in Paris on Nov. 11, he had explained the virtues of Finnish forest management to Mr. Trump. But he didn’t recall mentioning raking.

The secret to the Finns’ forest management system lies instead in its early warning system, aerial surveillance system and network of forest roads, said Professor Henrik Lindberg, a forest fires researcher at the Häme University of Applied Sciences, a college in southern Finland.

At times of high incendiary risk, the Finnish authorities are highly effective at delivering warnings across most forms of media, Mr. Lindberg said.
