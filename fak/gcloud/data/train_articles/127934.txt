what exactly is AN "Anti-Contact, Non-Offending" Pedophile?

Have you ever heard of the following words used in the same sentence: anti-contact pedophile? How about a non-offending pedophile?

For more information about these terms watch Dr. Elizabeth Letourneau's TedMed talk at the bottom of this page.

Because society often conflates ‘pedophile’ and ‘sex offender,' many people believe ALL pedophiles have sexually abused children. This creates a reinforced belief system that when confronted, is hard to conceive; i.e. that someone who is a pedophile hasn’t sexually abused a child nor has any desire to do so. While statistics vary, research indicates a large majority of sex offenders with child victims are not actually pedophiles (Seto, 2009).

Many men and women seeking services at our project share feeling like this is an unchosen, unwanted condition that began in adolescence. Some pedophiles also report significant trauma and arrested development at the age of which they find themselves attracted.

For more information about men and women who have pedophilia and who have NO desire to EVER harm a child, listen to our podcast, The Prevention Podcast.™

In Seto’s article The Puzzle of Male Chronophilia (2016) he asserts, “A sexual interest in sexually mature adolescents, though socially sanctioned in modern Western societies if under the legal age of consent, is neither uncommon nor atypical."

Our goal is to ensure that individuals with an attraction to minors do not act on these attractions, but instead learn healthy tools to remain safe in our communities. Therefore, we provide preventive-interventions to all MAPs.
