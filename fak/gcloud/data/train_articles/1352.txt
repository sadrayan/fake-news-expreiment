Romney says he favors ‘self-deportation'
Mitt Romney has a message for undocumented immigrants: Deport thyself.

During Monday night’s GOP presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., Romney was asked how he would address illegal immigration, and said he favored what he called “self-deportation.”

“The answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home because they can’t find work here because they don't have legal documentation to allow them to work here,” Romney said. “We’re not going to round them up.”

Romney was responding to moderator Adam Smith of The Tampa Bay Times, who asked how the former Massachusetts governor could be in favor of illegal immigrants returning home and applying for citizenship while at the same time saying he does not want the U.S. government to have to hunt down illegal immigrants and deport them.
