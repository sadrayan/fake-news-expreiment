About Us

I Support Forgiveness was founded to serve as a consumer watchdog, enabling regular people to make informed decisions about important purchases.

Our panel of independent experts evaluate every product based on a number of factors, including effectiveness, value, and safety. I Support Forgiveness receives no monetary or other consideration from these companies, and the opinions expressed here reflect only our experiences and those of our experts.

To that end, we accept no outside advertising, and every product we review is purchased anonymously. This ensures that each product is a representative sample, and prevents companies from affecting the outcome of our decision.

Our goal is simple: to help you make the best decision possible when purchasing online. To date, we have helped thousands of consumers make smart buying decisions, and we look forward to helping millions more to do the same.
