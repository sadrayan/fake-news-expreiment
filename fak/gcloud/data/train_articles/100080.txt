Bill Shorten. A Fair Go For Australia.
Bill Shorten and Labor.

A Fair Go For Australia.

What motivates me?

People.

Labor represents people, middle and working class people - people who otherwise would not have their voices properly heard.

People who aspire for a good education for their children, a secure job, decent health care and dignity in retirement

A Shorten Labor Government will stand up for middle and working class families across Australia.
