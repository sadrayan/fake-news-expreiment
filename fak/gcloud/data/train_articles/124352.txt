Does anybody recall that documentary from a few years back, perhaps even 5 or 7 years, that was about these little kid pageants? I remember these two southern gay guys (they had southern accents) who ran some kind of a camp as like consultants to the parents or something. I just can't remember where I saw it. It was fucking creepy and well worth watching.
