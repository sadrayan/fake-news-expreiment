Rick Barber > ISSUES > Tax Reform
Todayâ€™s tax code is oppressive and unreasonable, with tens of thousands of pages, endless loopholes, and nearly 80 billion dollars a year in compliance costs alone. We need to start over, and do so in a way that encourages entrepreneurship and fiscal responsibility.

I fully support and will co-sponsor the FairTax bill. The FairTax replaces all income and corporate embedded taxes with a consumption tax. Under this system, workers receive their entire paycheck, and taxes paid correlate directly with spending. This bill has mechanisms to account for displaced accounting jobs and low income families, and will increase revenue while stimulating the economy.

I categorically oppose the European- style Value Added Tax or the VAT. This is a hidden tax that increases the costs of goods and services at every level of production.
