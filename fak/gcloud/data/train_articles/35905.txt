SEED
College tuition doesn't always fit into every budget, and finances sometimes keep good students from going to college. That's why the SEED (Student Excellence Equals Degree) Scholarship program was started. If you attend a Delaware high school, keep your grades up and stay out of trouble, you can go to Delaware Tech tuition-free.*

If you thought college wasn't in your future, think again. This changes everything!

*Course fees and books are not covered by the SEED Scholarship.
