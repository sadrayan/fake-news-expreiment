CVG honored for 3rd straight year in 2013 World Airport Awards - Cincinnati News, FOX19-WXIX TV
The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) is getting some positive recognition for the third year in a row.

CVG was named the 'Best Regional Airport in North America' for the third straight year at the World Airport Awards.

SkyTrax, a London-based, independent air transport research organization, conducted the 'World Airport Survey'. More than 12 million passengers were surveyed over a period of nine months, covering more than 385 airports across the glob.

SkyTrax officials say awards were based on 39 different factors, including check-in, arrivals, transfers and gate departures.

"Receiving this recognition three straight years provides us with a proven track record of easy access, outstanding customer service, on-time performance and top-notch product and service offerings," said Candace McGraw, CVG's CEO. "This would not be possible without a dedicated and committed workforce and tremendous support from our airline and business partners. The CVG community always goes the extra mile for its customers."

On Thursday, CVG was honored in Geneva, Switzerland as part of the 2013 World Airport Awards.

In May 2012, the airport unveiled a $36 million renovation of its Concourse A.
