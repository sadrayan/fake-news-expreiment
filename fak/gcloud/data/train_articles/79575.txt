Expectation Graduation - Reach Out to Dropouts Walk

Reach Out to Dropouts is a door-to-door outreach that began in a dinner conversation between former Mayor Bill White, his wife, Andrea and the former Superintendent of Houston ISD, Dr. Abe Saavedra. Each year, when a student fails to show up to class at the beginning of the school year volunteers go door-to-door knocking at the homes of these students. The volunteers offer the encouragement and resources that these students lack to complete their high school education. This award-winning program has been followed by other cities across the country. Over the first six years of the event, the walk has brought back over 8,800 students thanks to the help of over 15,600 volunteers. The 2010 walk included nine Texas big cities, 13 small cities and 18 Houston-area school districts.
