Milwaukee Streetcar
The cityâ€™s plan to move the streetcar forward, approved by the Common Council on February 10, 2015, identifies all of the necessary resources needed to build the initial route plus the lakefront line: Capital Costs/Construction

COSTS AMOUNT Phase 1 Route: Tracks/Stops/Systems $98.9 m Lakefront Line: Tracks/Stops/Systems $29.2 m TOTAL COSTS $128.1 m SOURCE AMOUNT Federal: ICE Funding $54.9 m Federal: TIGER VII Grant $14.2 m Local: Cathedral Square TID $9.7 m Local: Amend Erie St. TID 56 to 19 years $18.3 m Local: East Michigan TID @ 19 years $31.0 m TOTAL SOURCE OF FUNDS $128.1 m Note: The Federal TIGER grant approved for the Lakefront Line in October 2015 provided an additional $14.2 million, which leverages previously approved city funding as a match for the federal grant at a 50-50 local / federal share. The additional funds secured through TIGER also support operational efficiencies and improvements to the Operations and Maintenance Facility. Operations A federal CMAQ grant has already been secured which pays for 80% of the first 18 months of operating costs with the possibility of an extension for an additional 18 months. The introductory fare of $1 per ride plus sponsorships/advertising during years 1-3 will cover the local 20% match to the CMAQ grant. Year 4 and beyond will be funded through a combination of fare box revenue, advertising, corporate sponsorships, federal funding opportunities, operating agreements with partners and parking fund, if needed.
