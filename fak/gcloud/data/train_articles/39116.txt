FEMA Extends 100 Percent Funding for Emergency Response to Hurricanes
ST. CROIX, Virgin Islands – The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has extended for 60 days the period in which it will cover 100 percent of eligible costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures undertaken by the U.S. Virgin Islands in response to hurricanes Maria and Irma.

The deadline to receive 100 percent federal reimbursement for eligible Public Assistance work is now May 5 for Hurricane Irma and May 14 for Hurricane Maria.

The extension comes after certain areas of the USVI sustained damage of sufficient magnitude that special cost-sharing arrangements are warranted.

To date, FEMA’s Public Assistance Program has approved more than $447 million for USVI response and recovery.
