HOW TO READ THIS TABLE: Candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives typically get the majority of their campaign dollars from donors within their home state. + Read more

Senate candidates show a variety of patterns, depending on the size of the state and the wealth of its economic base. Candidates in states like New York, California and Texas may get most of their money from their constituents, while those in the most sparsely populated states may get nearly all their money from out of state.

As a general rule, incumbents get more out-of-state money than challengers, a reflection of their status as members of Congress and the wider circles in which they travel. Challengers and newcomers are rarely well known outside their state, so their ability to raise funds beyond their district is more limited.

"No State Data" means that there was no state listed on contribution report.

METHODOLOGY: The numbers on this page are calculated from contributions of more than $200 from individuals, as reported to the Federal Election Commission. PAC dollars are not included.

In District Contributions vs. Out of District Contributions

Candidate In District Out of District No District Data Kathy Manning (D) $34,660 (1.1%) $2,393,542 (78.7%) $612,950 (20.2%) Ted Budd (R) $19,850 (1.6%) $926,407 (75.5%) $281,340 (22.9%) Tom Bailey (L) $0 $0 $10 (100.0%)

HOW TO READ THIS TABLE: The amount of money a candidate receives from his or her own district can vary wildly. + Read more

For example, whether or not a contributor is from inside a candidate's district can shift with redistricting. Also, some candidates representing districts near, but not including, major sources of campaign money (like San Francisco, New York and Washington, D.C.), may receive much of their support from outside their own district.

We used street address information provided by the campaigns to determine whether a contribution came from inside or outside of a candidate's district at the time the money was given. In some cases, a zip code corresponds perfectly to a single district, and when this was the case we calculated these contributions as coming from within the district even if no street address was provided.

"No District" means that there was no street address information listed on contribution report. This money is shown, but not included in percent calculations.

METHODOLOGY: The numbers on this page are calculated from contributions of more than $200 from individuals, as reported to the Federal Election Commission. PAC dollars are not included.

Top Metro Areas

Kathy Manning (D)

Metro Area Total GREENSBORO--WINSTON-SALEM--HIGH POINT $907,137 NEW YORK $401,092 RALEIGH-DURHAM-CHAPEL HILL $259,228 WASHINGTON, DC-MD-VA-WV $170,267 BOSTON, MA-NH $138,316

Ted Budd (R)

Metro Area Total GREENSBORO--WINSTON-SALEM--HIGH POINT $453,153 CHARLOTTE-GASTONIA-ROCK HILL, NC-SC $150,350 RALEIGH-DURHAM-CHAPEL HILL $45,910 WASHINGTON, DC-MD-VA-WV $37,075 WEST PALM BEACH-BOCA RATON $23,650

HOW TO READ METRO AREA TABLES: The search for campaign cash makes "dialing for dollars" one of the most time-intensive parts of any political campaign. Where do all those well-heeled donors live? For most candidates, the richest source of large individual contributions will be the most populous metro areas within their state or district. Many incumbents also draw significant sums from the nation's capital. Senators and other high-profile incumbents may draw from the Big Three sources of campaign cash nationally: New York City, Washington, DC and Los Angeles.

METHODOLOGY: The numbers on this page are calculated from contributions of more than $200 from individuals, as reported to the Federal Election Commission. PAC dollars are not included.

NOTE: All the numbers on this page are for the 2017-2018 House election cycle and based on Federal Election Commission data available electronically on February 01, 2019. ("Help! The numbers don't add up...")

WHY DON'T THE NUMBERS ADD UP? Sometimes it's hard to make apple-to-apple comparisons across some of the pages in a candidate's profile. Here's why: Summary numbers - specifically "Total Raised and Spent" and "PAC/Individual Split" - are based on summary reports filed by the candidates with the Federal Election Commission. All other numbers in these profiles ("Quality of Disclosure," "Geography" and "Special Interests") are derived from detailed FEC reports that itemize all contributions of $200 or more. There is also a time lag in posting the information. While summary numbers are reported almost immediately by the FEC -- and listed quickly on OpenSecrets -- processing and analyzing the detailed records takes much longer. For that reason, summary numbers are usually higher (and more current) than the numbers based on detailed records. HOW CURRENT ARE THESE FIGURES? The figures in these profiles are taken from databases uploaded by the FEC to the internet on the first day of every month. Those databases are only as current as the FEC has been able to compile by that date (see the note above about lag times for data entry). The Center updates figures for "Total Raised and Spent" and for "PAC/Individual Split" a few days after the first of the month. The remaining figures - based on detailed contribution data - is updated by the Center after the 20th of every month. This gives us time to analyze the contributions and categorize them by industry and interest group.
