Sweden Bans Christmas Lights In Public To Avoid Angering Muslim Refugees? – MILO NEWS
The annual Swedish tradition of adorning street poles with Christmas lights has been discontinued

Here’s the official explanation from Sweden’s national transport coordinator Eilin Isaksson:

Poles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there.

For decades, the tradition was never problematic. Christmas lights never posed a security risk because, after all: they’re just Christmas lights!

So what changed? The weight of these holiday lights? The durability of street poles? Or maybe it was the massive influx of Muslim migrants that dramatically altered the demographic landscape of Sweden over the past two years…

Indeed, it seems the only real “security” concern is offending Muslim migrants—the same ones responsible for destroying local businesses.

Christmas in schools. What was formerly known as “Christmas Break” was also changed to “Winter Break.”

Back in Sweden, there’s been a rise in swimming pool segregation, where men and women are not allowed to use venues at the same time in order to please Muslim sentiments.

Progressivism? Cultural enrichment? More like capitulation to an invading army.
