Well then. We cannot say that we saw this one coming. The Tracking Board is reporting that a sequel to the Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy comedic witch flick from 1993, Hocus Pocus, is officially on its way. Read on for the first details.

This new Hocus Pocus will focus (see what I did there?) "on a witch hunter who teams up with a magical housewife to stop a power-hungry evil witch.”

The original cast is not likely to be coming back. Allison Shearmur Productions has signed to produce Hocus Pocus 2: Rise of the Elderwitch. Tendo Nagenda and Jessica Virtue are executive producing at Disney.

The aim for the two protagonist female leads is in the vein of Tina Fey and Melissa McCarthy. While the original film dealt with three witch-sisters coming back on Halloween night, this story seems to focus on drawing different people together to fight a common evil. »
