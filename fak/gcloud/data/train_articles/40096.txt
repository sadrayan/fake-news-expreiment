Hillary's Tax Fairness = Make Those Earning $41,500 Pay More
While Clinton Campaigns On "Tax Fairness," She Won't Mention How She Pledged In The Senate Not To Raise Taxes On The Middle Class, And Then Repeatedly Voted To Do So

TOP TAKEAWAYS

Despite the fact that Clinton has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class, during her career in the Senate she repeatedly voted to raise taxes on middle class Americans.

In the midst of the great recession in 2008, then-Senator Clinton voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500.

The same year, Clinton voted twice for a Democrat budget in favor of raising taxes on Americans earning below $250,000.

During her time in the Senate, Clinton voted three times to raise the capital gains tax on middle class Americans.

Today, Clinton Will Deliver A Speech Focusing On "Tax Fairness" While Campaigning In Cleveland, Ohio. "Hillary Clinton will campaign at a Cleveland high school on Wednesday to speak about 'tax fairness and investing in Ohio.' The Democratic presidential candidate is scheduled to speak at 1:15 p.m. at John Marshall High School, 3952 W. 140th St." (Randy Ludlow, "Clinton To Speak On Tax Fairness In Cleveland," The Columbus [Ohio] Dispatch , 8/13/2016)

On The Campaign Trail, Clinton Has Promised That She's "Not Raising Taxes On The Middle Class, Period." CBS'S SCOTT PELLEY: "What's your tax plan? Who gets a tax increase? Who gets a tax cut?" CLINTON: "Well first, I am not raising taxes on the middle class, period. I'm going after incomes $5 million or more that I think have too many opportunities to game the system and escape paying the taxes that they should. I'm going after corporations that are 'gaming' the system. I want to have a sensible corporate tax policy." PELLEY: "Senator Sanders said that he would raise taxes on any family that made $250,000 and above. Is that your level, $250,000?" CLINTON: "Well I said I will not raise taxes on anybody $250 or below. But, here's the problem with Senator Sander's plan-- his numbers don't add up. There is no way for him to fulfill the promises he is making without raising taxes on the middle class." (CBS Evening News, 2/18/16)

BUT CLINTON CAN'T ERASE HER VOTING RECORD FROM THE SENATE, WHERE SHE REPEATEDLY VOTED TO RAISE TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS

During The 2008 Presidential Campaign, Much Like Her Current Rhetoric, Clinton Pledged Not To Raise Taxes On The Middle Class

While Campaigning In 2007, Clinton Said She Would Provide "Real Tax Relief For Middle-Class Families." CLINTON: "But I'm going to go further than that: I will provide tax relief for the middle class, because you heard me say that, given the increase in energy prices since 2000, on average $2,000, that is far more than any middle-class family got out of these Bush tax cuts. We're not going to be fooled. We're going to get back to real tax relief for middle-class families. I'll extend the middle-class tax cuts, give generous tax breaks to help families afford health care, offer up to $1,000 in matching tax cuts to help families save for retirement. I'll expand the earned income tax credit, increase tax credits for child care, and provide a new $3,500 tax credit to help middle-class families send their children to college." (Sen. Hillary Clinton, Remarks On Economic Challenges, Knoxville, TN, 11/19/07)

In An April 2008 Debate, Clinton Said "I Am Absolutely Committed To Not Raising A Single Tax On Middle-Class Americans, People Making Less Than $250,000 A Year." CLINTON: "I am absolutely committed to not raising a single tax on middle- class Americans, people making less than $250,000 a year. In fact, I have a very specific plan of $100 billion in tax cuts that would go to help people afford health care, security retirement plans, you know, make it possible for people to get long-term care insurance and care for their parents and grandparents who they are trying to support, making college affordable and so much else." (Sen. Hillary Clinton, Remarks At The ABC Democrat Debate, Philadelphia, PA, 4/16/08)

But In The Midst Of The Great Recession, Then-Senator Clinton Voted To Raise Taxes On Workers Earning As Little As $41,500

Clinton Voted In Favor Of A Budget Resolution To Raise Taxes In 2008, Which Would Have Impacted Individuals Earning As Little As $41,500 And Couples Making $83,000. (S. Con. Res. 70, Vote #85: Concurrent Resolution Agreed To 51-45: R 2- 44; D 48-1; I 1-0, 3/14/08, Clinton Voted Yea)

The Budget Resolution Raised Income Taxes For Individuals In The 25 Percent Tax Bracket, Which At The Time Featured Individuals With A Taxable Income Of $41,500 And Married Couples Making $83,000. "What Obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire. In particular, the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre-2001 level of 28 percentâ€¦ So to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket, an individual would need to earn at least $41,500 in total income, while a married couple would need a combined income of at least $83,000." (Joe Miller, "The $32,000 Question," FactCheck,org, 7/8/08)

In 2007, Clinton Also Voted Twice In Favor Of Raising Taxes On Americans Earning Below $250,000

Clinton Twice Voted In Favor Of The FY 2008 Democrat Budget Which Raised Taxes For Americans In The Two Highest Income Brackets. (S. Con. Res. 21, CQ Vote #172: Adopted 52-40: R 2- 40; D 48-0; I 2-0, 5/17/07, Clinton Voted Yea; S. Con. Res. 21, CQ Vote #114: Adopted: 52-47: R 2-47; D 48-0; I 2-0, 3/23/07, Clinton Voted Yea)

In 2008, Earners In The Second Highest Tax Bracket, With A Marginal Rate Of 33 Percent, Earned Between $164,550 And $357,700. (Individual Income Tax Parameters, Tax Policy Center, Accessed 11/25/15)

In 2006, Clinton Voted Three Times To Raise The Capital Gains Tax On Middle-Class Americans

Clinton Voted In Favor Of Raising Capital Gains Tax Rates On The Middle-Class At Least 3 Times. (H.R. 4297, CQ Vote #8: Motion Rejected 44-53: R 1-52; D 42-1; I 1-0, 2/2/06, Clinton Voted Yea; H.R. 4297, CQ Vote #17: Motion Rejected 47-53: R 3-52; D 43-1; I 1-0, 2/14/06, Clinton Voted Yea; H.R. 4297, CQ Vote #18: Motion Rejected 45-55: R 1-54; D 43-1; I 1-0, 2/14/06, Clinton Voted Yea)
