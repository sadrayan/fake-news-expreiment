A hippopotamus has swallowed a dwarf in a circus accident in northern Thailand.



"A dwarf nicknamed Od, died when he bounced sideways from a trampoline and was

swallowed by a yawning hippopotamus, which was waiting to appear in the next

act, " the Pattaya Mail reported.



"Vets on the scene said Hilda the Hippo had a gag reflex that automatically

caused her to swallow."



The vets said it was the the first time the hefty vegetarian had ever eaten a

circus performer. He keeper commented that although Hilda had a slight weight

problem, she was on a strict diet which did not include dwarves.



"Unfortunately, the 1000-plus spectators continued to applaud wildly until

commonsense dictated there had been a tragic mistake.



"Police said the trampoline had be sent for forensic analysis on pretense that

it might be faulty. The Police commented that there is no evidence to support a

suicide by the circus performer despite his past history of alcoholism."



The vets have admistered a laxative to the Hippopotamus in order to speed the

recovery of the circus performer's remains.
