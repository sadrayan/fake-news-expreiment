Resolute Support
Freedom's Sentinel

By August 2017 US policymakers were close to a new military strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia, but options still ranged from withdrawal to an increased reliance on private security contractors. The US had about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan helping Afghan forces fight the Taliban, while also targeting militants aligned with the al-Qaida and Islamic State terror groups. Plans to send perhaps an additional 4,000 troops to boost US efforts there had been delayed while the White House and military planners reviewed various options.

One possibility that caught Donald Trumpï¿½s attention was a proposal by a Trump insider to decrease US reliance on its military forces and instead turn to private contractors. Erik Prince, the founder of private security firm Blackwater, proposed replacing US troops with about 5,000 contractors who would be backed by a 90-plane private air force. Prince said his plan would get the job done for less than $10 billion a year.

Prince, a former Navy SEAL, hails from a wealthy western Michigan family. His father, Edgar Prince, founded Prince Automotive, an auto supply firm. Upon his death, his family sold the company to Johnson Controls for $1.35 billion in 1997. Erik Prince used his inheritance to form Blackwater, a training facility for special operation soldiers and police in North Carolina, in 1997. Prince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016. Prince, the brother of US Education Secretary Besty DeVos, met with a high-ranking Russian official on the Sechelles days before Trump was inaugurated, in an effort to establish a back-channel of communication to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) ended on December 31, 2014 and transitioned to Operation Freedomï¿½s Sentinel (OFS) on January 1, 2015. OFS is a contingency operation in accordance with Title 10 USC 101(a)(13). Afghanistan is the OFS Designated Operational Area. The deteriorating security situation resulted in a surge in U.S. troop strength from 30,000 in early 2009 to approximately 100,000 from 2010 to 2011. The surge reversed Taliban momentum and enabled a gradual reduction of U.S. forces to 16,100 by December 31, 2014, when the NATO-led combat mission ended and OFS began.

U.S. forces carry out two complementary missions under the military operation known as OFS: counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda, its affiliates, and ISIL-K in Afghanistan; and support for NATOï¿½s Resolute Support capacity-building effort, which seeks to build the capacity of the MoD and MoI and to strengthen the ANDSF. OFS began on January 1, 2015, when the United States ended 13 years of combat operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom and transitioned to a NATO-led train, advise, and assist role, while continuing U.S. counterterrorism operations. At that point, the Afghan government assumed full responsibility for the security of Afghanistan with limited U.S. or coalition support on the battlefield.

On October 15, 2015 President Barack Obama announced at the White House that he will keep US troops in Afghanistan through 2016 and a lesser number into 2017 to sustain coalition efforts to train and strengthen Afghan forces. As part of a four-step plan that he said would best ensure lasting progress in Afghanistan, Obama said he would maintain the current posture of 9,800 troops in Afghanistan through most of 2016. Rather than reduce troop levels to a normal embassy presence in Kabul by the end of 2016, Obama said the United States will maintain 5,500 troops and a small number of bases, including at Bagram and Jalalabad in the east and Kandahar in the south.

Obama said 24 March 2015 the 9,800 American troops stationed in Afghanistan will remain there until the end of the year, despite earlier plans to cut them by half. US military presence in Afghanistan had been expected to be cut to 5,500 troops by the middle of 2015, and be brought down to an embassy-level presence by the end of 2016.

The president said that the timeline would be reworked and that the date for a final troop drawdown in early 2017 remains the same. The US administration will ask Congress for funding to allow the Afghan National Security Force to maintain its 352,000 troop level through at least fiscal year 2017.

US Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said 24 March 2015 that Afghans are making ï¿½real progress," but would not be able to reach their full capacity by the end of 2016 if US troops withdraw. ï¿½These are the same capabilities Iraqi forces were missing when the United States precipitously withdrew at the end of 2011," the Senators noted. ï¿½We must not repeat this mistake. But that is exactly what will happen if President Obama insists on withdrawing from Afghanistan whether the job is done or not."

Insurgent attacks continued across Afghanistan by the end of 2016 with the Taliban remaining the greatest threat to the Afghan government. With a strength estimated by U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) to number 25,000 to 35,000 full or part-time fighters, the Taliban launched a series of attacks on 6 provincial capitals in October 2016, following its stated campaign strategy of capturing at least 1 provincial capital in 2016.

Aided by U.S. airstrikes, however, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF or Afghan security forces) repelled the attacks and maintained control over all provincial capitals and population centers. The extent of Afghan government territorial control or influence decreased 6 percent since August 2016. At the end of the quarter, the government maintained control or influence in 233 (57 percent) of the 407 districts in Afghanistan, while the Taliban controlled or influenced 41 districts (10 percent), with the remainder considered ï¿½contested."

Although meetings to restart the peace process were held between Taliban and Afghan representatives in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar during the quarter, no further developments in the process occurred. The relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan remained tense this quarter, with sporadic cross-border artillery attacks occurring along their shared border. However, the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission (Resolute Support) facilitated more frequent dialogue between senior Afghan military officers and their Pakistani counterparts this quarter in an effort to improve border relationships.

Donald Trump was advised to turn to private military contractors and hire a mercenary army to "fix" Afghanistan, where it has been at war since 2001. The proposal was offered by Steve Bannon, President Donald Trumpï¿½s chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, his senior adviser and son-in-law. Local media reports say that Erik D. Prince, a founder of the private military company Blackwater Worldwide, and Stephen A. Feinberg, a billionaire financier who owns the giant military contractor DynCorp International, were quick to jump on the idea and each see a role for themselves in this future.

Blackwater, founded by Prince, is a private military company that gained notoriety in Iraq following the US invasion in 2003. During the Iraq War, Blackwater was involved in numerous troubling incidents. The most infamous was the Nisour Square massacre, when contractors opened fire on a crowd of civilians in Baghdad, killing 17; it led to court cases that put four of the contractors in prison.
