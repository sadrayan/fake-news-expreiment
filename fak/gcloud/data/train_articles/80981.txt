Sheriff blasts short security staffing at courthouse
Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. is complaining of lax security at the courthouse and Safety Building, in a letter to County Executive Chris Abele the sheriff released Tuesday.

He called the single-person staffing "a shocking lapse of security."

Clarke said he saw one security guard on duty screening visitors at the MacArthur Square entrance to the Safety Building earlier this month and called the situation "a recipe for disaster."

The Safety Building houses courtrooms and offices for the district attorney and sheriff.

Weapons screening requires two or three people, Clarke said.

A spokesman for Abele said on the day in question, one of two security guards assigned to that entrance was late for work. In such instances, the officer in charge of the security detail should have temporarily filled in or that entrance should have been closed, said Jeff Bentoff, Abele's deputy chief of staff.

"The county's current policy requires at least two guards at any station or that station will be closed," Bentoff said. He didn't say how long the entrance security station was short staffed.

Security is too important "to intentionally misinform and unnecessarily scare the public," Bentoff said.

Courthouse security this year has been run by a combination of county officers, as well as private security guards who work for G4S Wackenhut. Abele sought to fully privatize security at the courthouse and several other county buildings as part of the 2012 county budget, but the County Board killed that plan.
