Rep. Pocan Calls Out Rep. Duffy for Saying Madison is a Communist Community that does not Believe in Democracy, Demands Apology
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) called out Rep. Sean Duffy (WI-07) for dismissing Madison, WI, as a “communist” community that does not believe in democracy or freedom during a disturbing exchange with Tucker Carlson on FOX News criticizing the recount in Wisconsin.

“I represent more than 700,000 people in Wisconsin’s 2nd Congressional District. Madison, the heart of Dane County, is one of the leading economic drivers in our state and the county is responsible for 73% of the new jobs created in Wisconsin in the last decade. His insinuation that my constituents are somehow un-American for exercising their political views is extremely alarming. At a time when our country stands divided, Congressman Duffy’s ‘Trumpizing’ of Wisconsin is the wrong direction for our state.

“The Wisconsin delegation has a reputation for cooperation and respect. For Rep. Duffy to try and drive divisions among Wisconsinites is unconscionable. On behalf of my constituents, I demand an apology from Rep. Duffy and hope the Wisconsin delegation will condemn his comments as they are far from the Wisconsin values we hold dear.”
