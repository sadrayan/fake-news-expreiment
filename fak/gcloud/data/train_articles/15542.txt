Email, Dorie Turner Nolt, press secretary, U.S. Department of Education, Nov. 2, 2015 (received by PolitiFact Texas by email Dec. 1, 2015)

I’m attaching a letter from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights to Township High School District 211 in Palatine, Illinois, about a Title IX investigation stemming from a complaint alleging that the district discriminated against a transgender high school student by denying her access to the girls’ locker rooms. If you need it for your reporting, here is a statement from Catherine Lhamon on the investigation:

Statement from Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon on civil rights investigation at Township High School District 211:

“All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities – this is a basic civil right. Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls’ locker room. The district can provide access to this student while also respecting all students’ privacy. We encourage the district to comply with the law and resolve this case.”

Thanks!

Dorie
