Adrienne Vittadini
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Adrienne Vittadini (born 1945, in Gyor, Hungary) is an American fashion designer. When she was 12, her family fled Gyor during the 1956 Hungarian revolution. In 1979, she started what would become a multimillion-dollar fashion business as a hobby. The brand name Adrienne Vittadini is synonymous with designs that have a "Euro-American" point of view. She uses vibrant colors and prints and she is known for her clothing, handbags, swimsuits, shoes, eyewear, and perfumes. Her company was purchased by Retail Brand Alliance in 2001.

She now lives seasonally in Sarasota, Florida, where the Coty Award-winning fashion designer went into the home fashion and house design business [1].
