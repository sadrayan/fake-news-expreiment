A super political action committee allied with Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk’s re-election campaign is going on the air with TV and radio ads critical of Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth’s stance on national security.

The Independent Voice for Illinois Super PAC is headed by former Kirk chief of staff Eric Elk, and it reported more than $1.3 million on hand to start the month after raising $845,000 in the first half of this year, federal election records showed.

The ads backing Kirk and criticizing Duckworth, a two-term congresswoman from Hoffman Estates, are airing in the Peoria, Champaign and Rockford markets. A spot check showed the super PAC spending about $27,000 alone to air 115 half-minute TV ads on WCIA Ch. 3 in Champaign.

The ads are critical of a statement Duckworth made last year about Syrian refugees that are in dispute by the two campaigns. The Kirk camp argues Duckworth indicated she wants 200,000 Syrian refugees to enter the United States — 20 times the number authorized by President Barack Obama. Duckworth’s campaign has said the candidate supports resettling 200,000 refugees overall in the United States, not just from Syria.

The ads also are critical of her support for the Obama-led nuclear deal with Iran and plans to close the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba used to hold foreign terrorism suspects.

“Tammy Duckworth is wrong on national security,” a female narrator says in the one-minute radio ad.

“Unlike Duckworth, Mark Kirk opposed the Iranian nuclear deal. Kirk is fighting to stop Syrians from coming to America until they can be safely screened and Kirk is opposed to closing Gitmo. The stakes are high. The choice is clear. Sen. Kirk is the strong leader we can trust to keep America safe,” the narrator says.

Among the top donors to the super PAC are several supporters of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, including prominent hedge fund leaders Ken Griffin, of Chicago, and Paul Singer, of New York. Griffin has donated $350,000 to the super PAC and Singer has donated $250,000.

Other donors include frequent GOP contributor Craig Duchossois, of Elmhurst, and real estate magnate Sam Zell, who each gave $50,000. Zell led a heavily leveraged buyout of then-Chicago Tribune parent company Tribune Co. in 2007. Tribune Co. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2008.

Also donating to the PAC was Sam Fox, of St. Louis, founder of the Harbour Group. Fox, a former ambassador to Belgium under President George W. Bush, contributed $25,000.

In Bush’s 2004 re-election, Fox, prior to his ambassadorship, contributed $50,000 to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a political group that claimed Democrat John Kerry inflated his military record in Vietnam and led to the term “swift-boating” a candidate. Ironically, Kirk has been forced to apologize for inflating his own service record as a Naval reservist.

From the notebook

*Durbin for gov?: The roughest part of U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin’s time at the Democratic National Convention had to be the daily questions about whether he’ll challenge Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2018.

At the final Illinois delegation breakfast, the state’s senior senator again pointed to the November election while deflecting those questions, saying he'll "talk it over with my wife and make a decision and, you know, make an announcement," eventually.
