Living in El Paso, TX
Profile written by local expert: Alexis Garcia

It's easy to write El Paso, Texas, off as another southern cow town. Sure, you'll find an overwhelming number of steakhouses here, and you're bound to come across someone sporting a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. But gone are the days when old El Paso was known as the "Six Shooter Capital" â€“ a place known for its outlaws and vices.

Today, El Paso attracts a wide variety of residents with its array of recreational and cultural offerings. Festivals like the Hueco Rock Rodeo and the KLAQ International Balloonfest bring the community together, and outdoorsy residents are quick to join their peers in marathons and bike races. Meanwhile, El Paso's rich Mexican heritage is on display in its local restaurants and the sombrero-shaped Abraham Chavez Theatre.

El Paso gets a bad rap for its proximity to Juarez, Mexico, but the metro area is safer than you might think, and its economy is thriving. Job opportunities can be found in a number of fields, from government to health care.
