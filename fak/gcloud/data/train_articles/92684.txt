Connie Mack competing with Charlie Rangel for most missed votes
Remember the beating Jim Davis took from Charlie Crist for missing votes in Washington in 2006? We wonder if it's only a matter of time before Democrats and/or Bill Nelson start using the same attack on U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, who has missed a slew of votes while running for U.S. Senate. Only yesterday he missed three votes as he raised $50,000 in Jacksonville.

The folks at the Democratic Super PAC American Bridge 21st Century has done some numbers crunching to put Mack's missed votes into context.

Over the first half of the year the Fort Myers Republican missed more than 31 percent of the House votes taken this year. That gives him the seventh worst record in the House.

But most of the other chronic vote-missers have some extenuating circumstances. Five of them - Bob Filner of California, Ron Paul of Texas, Dennis Cardoza of California, and Jerry Lewis of California, are retiring, and one, 82-year-old Louise Slaughter of New York, broke her leg.

Exclude those representatives, and Mack's record is worse than every member of congress except Democrat Charlie Rangel of New York.

Of course, Mack has his own extenuating circumstances, running for U.S. Senate and all although he missed several votes campaigning with Mitt Romney). So how about other House members running for senate this year? Mack is among eight members running for senate, and he has by far the worst record in casting votes. The next worst is Todd Akin of Missouri, who has missed 18 percent of votes. Denny Rehberg of Montana has missed just .22 percent of votes.

"It's clear that Connie Mack is more focused on shilling for Mitt Romney and hanging out in California than fulfilling the duty his constituents elected him to do," said American Bridge's Matt Thornton. "If Connie Mack is so interested in not doing his job, perhaps retirement is a better option than promotion."
