Lees Summit man burns house down after setting Nike shoes on fire in protest of Colin Kaepernick ad
A Missouri man has been arrested after he reportedly accidentally burned his home down by attempting to burn a pair of Nike sneakers in protest of their latest Colin Kaepernick Ad.

According to authorities, the 32-year old male resident of Lees Summit placed a pair of Nike sneakers in his garage and soaked them in kerosene before lighting them on fire. The fire ended up spreading to the the garage walls and ceiling before spreading to his actual home.

The man later told the authorities he was protesting against Nike, which recently made an ad featuring controversial NFL star Colin Kaepernick and reading: “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything… Just do it”.

However, the authorities involved in the case did not take kindly to the man’s protest, charging him with arson and also endangering the lives of his neighbors. “This could have easily caused a number of surrounding properties to catch fire,” said one investigator.

The man also faces civil action with a large lawsuit likely from the landlord of the property. “The home is worth several hundred thousand dollars, and for the landlord’s insurance claim to be approved he will have to file suit against the tenant.”
