OCS Search
IMPORTANT MESSAGE

The Miami-Dade Clerk of Courts greatly expanded Internet Public Viewing on June 9th, 2015 in accordance with the provisions of Florida Supreme Court Administrative Order SC AO . This Administrative Order sets standards for viewing of electronic court records whereby use of Advanced Searches requires the submission of a notarized Registered Access Request form to ensure identity.

You will need to submit the Registered Access Request form. Follow the instructions to avoid delays in processing. You will receive an email once your form has been processed, confirming that your access to the Advanced Searches has been enabled.

If you have submitted the Registered Access Request form, but have not yet received your confirmation email, you may use the Standard Search. The forms are being processed in the order in which they are received, and it may take up to business days to receive the confirmation emails, dependent on the number of forms received.

AOSC 15-18 does not restrict viewing of County Recorder Official Records. You may use the Advanced Search in the Official Records application without having to submit the above mentioned form.
