Erick Erickson Loves Calling Wendy Davis ‘Abortion Barbie’
Red State editor-in-chief Erick Erickson has been trying to make “Abortion Barbie” happen as a nickname for Texas State Senator Wendy Davis for months. He first tested out the sexist sobriquet back in August, when criticising Davis’s response to a question about claims equating legal abortions to the crimes of convicted killer doctor Kermit Gosnell. But just this week, Fox News host Greta Van Susteren took Erickson to task on her blog, calling him “boorish” and “disrespectful to women” for the way he talks about Davis. “I don’t care how much you disagree or agree with Texas’ Wendy Davis, you have to agree that this guy, Erick Erickson, is a real jerk and is really lousy at being a spokesperson for his views,” she wrote. Erickson lived up to Van Susteren’s assessment when he responded via his own blog Monday, facetiously thanking her for shining a light on his crusade against Davis and that brilliant nickname. “I have helped define Wendy Davis by a moniker that sticks, describes, and makes her the butt of jokes, while drawing out the shrill hysterics of her supporters,” he wrote following a graphic description of an abortion aimed at painting Davis as a sadistic baby killer.
