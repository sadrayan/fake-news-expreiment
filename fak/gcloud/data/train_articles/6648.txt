Statistic Donald Trump referenced during Norfolk stop in question
NORFOLK

During his campaign stop Saturday in Norfolk, Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump claimed "over 300,000 veterans died" while waiting for care from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Not exactly, according to the fact checkers over at The Washington Post.

The post reported on the claim back in September, when another GOP candidate -- Carly Fiorina -- made a similar claim during the second Republican debate. It awarded Fiona two out of four Pinocchios for saying "307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care."

According to the Post, the statistic stems from a report by the VA's Office of Inspector General that was widely reported on by various media outlets.

The Post explained there were about 867,000 VA records in a “pending” status as of Sept. 30, 2014, and that many of them had been inactive for more than five years. “Pending” meant a veteran had applied for enrollment, but the VA needed more information before it could determine if he or she was eligible for benefits. Of the pending records, 307,173 were for people who were reported as deceased by the Social Security Administration.

Why doesn't that mean 307,000 people died waiting for health care? Many of those people died long before the VA began its health care enrollment process in 1998.

In one example noted by the paper, a veteran had a blank enrollment status that changed to “pending” in November 2014. The person, however, died in 1988.

The VA has disputed claims like Trump's and Fiorina’s, according to The Post.

The paper quoted Janet P. Murphy, the Veterans Health Administration Operations and Management’s acting deputy undersecretary for health as taking issue with such comments. She said they wrongly “link these pending records with access-to-care issues for fully enrolled veterans that have chosen to use, and who are receiving, VA health care. They are separate issues."
