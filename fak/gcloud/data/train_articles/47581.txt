[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

It’s important to make this clear from the start: They weren’t her feet.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York whose outspokenness and progressive views have made her a target of conservatives, lashed out at the right-wing news site The Daily Caller after it posted an article on Monday showing a photo that had been falsely described as a nude selfie of the congresswoman with an emphasis on her feet.

It was fake foot news.

Confused yet? Here’s what happened. A photo that was apparently taken by a woman in a bathtub, showing her from the shins down, had been making the rounds on social media. A reflection of more of the woman’s body can be seen in the faucet. This led people to describe the photo as a nude selfie.

By the time The Daily Caller had posted its article, the picture’s true origins had been uncovered, thanks in part to the sleuth work of a foot fetishist, an online photo gallery of celebrity women’s feet and a woman who traded sexts with former Representative Anthony D. Weiner.
