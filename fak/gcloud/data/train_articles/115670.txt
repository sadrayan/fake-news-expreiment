Crow Rides On An Eagle

This is the moment a cheeky crow got tired of flying himself – and decided to hitch a ride on the back of an EAGLE. The birds, which had both been hunting for food on the pleins in Kyeonggi-do, South Korea, normally fight each other for scraps – but on this occassion, the pair had obviously decided to call a truce. Photographer Hyeongchol Kim had gone to the site – where humans often leave scraps of food for the birds – in a bid to capture the birds eating on camera.
