I'm so glad you got that email. We also sent a press release a while back which can be also found in the same place on our website. Here is the direct link: https://www.collierfortexas.com/2017/10/12/icymi-texas-lawmakers-find-24-billion/

In it you will find sources of some of the numbers Mike has used. both from the Statesman.
