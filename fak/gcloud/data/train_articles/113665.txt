Trophy Hunter Eaten Alive By Lions After He Murdered 3 Baboon Families
Ingwelala Private Nature Reserve in South Africa was shaken with the screams of a man who was attacked and killed by Pride of Lion in private game reserve near the Kruger National Park. Before the lions were dispersed with the help of gun-shots, they had eaten most of the body barring the head that was untouched.

Police initially thought that the victim was a tractor driver who worked in this private reserve. Bu later on when the driver appeared alive the suspicion began to grow. A hunting rifle was recovered near the remains of the dead that almost confirmed it to be a poacher who had sneaked into the private reserve.

The man was killed viciously and the incidence had been very disturbing and terrifying. Nevertheless, sympathy does not stand with the victim who had been hunting in the private reserve. The man had killed 3 Baboon families and spread the bodies around to attract and distract the lions to make them easier to hunt. And when someone like him transgresses the limits and enters the domain of lions with intention of harming them, the king of the jungle never forgets its animal instincts for survival. The encounter then is a fair game, lions with their power and a poacher with his gun met his chosen fate.

There are only 30000 lions left on the planet including 20000 in African Wild life areas. Large numbers of them are kept in captivity for entertainment. It is essential for the mankind to co-exist with them and protect them to survive so that future generations donâ€™t just see them on papers like we look at dinosaurs.
