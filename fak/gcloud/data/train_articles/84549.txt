TxDOT: Some paved roads could return to gravel in oil patch
As legislative negotiators worked Thursday to break a deadlock on road funding, Texas Department of Transportation officials painted a bleak — and notably timely — picture of roads in the state’s booming oil patch areas.

TxDOT executive John Barton, saying he was “embarrassed” as the agency’s chief engineer to do so, announced that 12 short, farm-to-market road segments are in such rotten shape that they’re not worth repairing. TxDOT, in what might be a first in the agency’s 96-year history, plans to convert 83 miles of paved roads into gravel roads. Their speed limits would then be reduced from a typical 55 mph to 30 mph, Barton said.
