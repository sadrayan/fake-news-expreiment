Army already considering changes to new tattoo policy
If there's something Daniel Gonzalez knows, it's tattoos.

Daniel Gonzalez - Tattoo Artist: "I've owned my business for more than 15 years."

He's also pretty familiar with the area his shop is in -

Daniel Gonzalez: "I've been in this area my whole tattoo career."

- Which is just down the street from Fort Bliss. But since new army regulations went into effect at the end of March, business has taken a hit.

Daniel Gonzalez: "I used to have about 70% military, now I'm probably down to about 50% because of that."

The Army now prohibits soldiers from having tattoos on their head, face, neck, wrists, hands and fingers. They also can't have more than four visible tattoos below the elbow or below the knee, and those tattoos must be smaller than the person's hand.

Captain Joshua Jacquez – US Army: "Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away 1 in every 5 applicants that come through our door."

The current tattoo policy has only been in effect for about five months, but Captain Joshua Jacquez says the army is already looking at altering it.

Captain Joshua Jacquez: "When it comes down, we probably will be one of the first to be notified in order to get more applicants in."

Although nothing is set in stone yet, those looking to enlist might have an easier time in the near future.

Captain Joshua Jacquez: “I definitely think it'll increase applicants' chances to join.

Gonzalez agrees, and believes the current policy won't stick around much longer.

Daniel Gonzalez: "Once we go to war, if we go to war, I think they're going to reinstate a lot of people that they released because of it, and they're going to recruit whoever they can."

There's no set timetable as to when these new regulations could come out.
