A great nation deserves the truth: Making Republicans own Rush's racism on Spanish-language radio
The GOP leader, Rush Limbaugh, has led the vicious, racist attack on Sonia Sotomayor. As we know, Republicans on Capitol Hill never stand up to Rush (or if they do, within hours, they beg forgiveness.) Presente.org, in conjunction with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, is running some Spanish language ads targeting GOP House members in Florida. You know the Republicans never expect to be held accountable. You can help denunciarush here.
