Border Wall System - Frequently Asked Questions
Yes, landowners will continue to have access to their land on the south side of the wall. CBP is coordinating with landowners to ensure their concerns and considerations for continued access are addressed in the final design, including the size of motorized gates that will be installed. U. S. Border Patrol may, at its discretion, enter into a pre-arranged, written agreement with landowners to determine on a case-by-case basis when and how long each gate will remain open. Separate written agreements for gate openings and closings can be made for special circumstances (e.g. dove hunting season).

It is always CBP’s preference to acquire property through a voluntary, negotiated sale. The Government will attempt to negotiate an offer to sell using survey data and value estimates gleaned from the surveying process. The Government will attempt to negotiate an offer to sell before moving forward with exercising eminent domain. However, if the Government and landowner are unable to reach a negotiated sale or if the Government is unable to obtain clean title, the Government will need to file an eminent domain action. In such instances, the matter is referred to the local United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) to file a Declaration of Taking. USAO attorneys will meet with landowners in an effort to negotiate a voluntary offer to sell prior to filing a Declaration of Taking.
