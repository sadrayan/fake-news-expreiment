Experiment on Putting an Egg in Vinegar
Soaking an egg in vinegar produces what is known as a “naked egg,” which is an egg without a shell. The vinegar dissolves the shell but leaves the membrane that holds the egg intact. This experiment provides a fascinating way to observe chemical reactions and the anatomy of an egg. You will see the membrane that acts as an additional defense for the egg. You can also watch the eggshell, comprised mostly of calcium carbonate, turn into aqueous calcium, water and carbon dioxide through the chemical reaction with vinegar, which is an acid.

Main Experiment

Step 1

Place an egg inside a large glass container, such as a beaker or jar. If you want to make more than one naked egg, make sure the eggs do not touch inside the container.

Step 2

Pour enough vinegar into the jar to cover the egg completely. The egg might float to the top, but the vinegar should still cover most of the egg.

Step 3

Observe what happens to the egg. You will notice tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide around the eggshell. The carbon dioxide is released during the chemical reaction taking place between the eggshell and the vinegar.

Step 4

Set your jar aside and wait 12 to 24 hours for the eggshell to dissolve. You might notice a white froth at the top of the vinegar.
