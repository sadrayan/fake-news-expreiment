Run For Something
What kind of candidate are we looking for? Run for Something works exclusively with progressive millennials who are running for local office for the first or second time.

Progressive

We help people who are pro-choice, pro-universal health care, pro-LGBTQ equality, pro-criminal justice reform; pro-working families and organized labor, pro-voting rights, pro-campaign finance reform, who focus on inequality, raising incomes, and creating jobs; who acknowledge that climate change is real, man-made, and our responsibility to fight; and who will fight to reduce gun violence in their community. We are NOT the purity police. A progressive in Louisiana is different than a progressive in California.

Diverse

Our candidates will be at least half women, as well as men of color. More broadly, we’ll look for diversity of experience. We certainly need more LGBTQ Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and people with disabilities to run for office, and we also need more scientists, more teachers, more engineers, and more non-lawyers to run for office.

Connected

We’ll look for candidates who have roots in their communities. This is literally a measurable quality: How many Linkedin, Facebook, and Twitter connections does a person have? How many contacts in their phone that live in their district still? How can we measure their possible influence in their district? We don’t want to convince someone to move home to run — we want someone who calls a place home to step up and run.

That “X” factor

2016 taught us that who the candidate is matters. How well they communicate online and in person, how comfortable they are in their skin, and how “authentic” they can be are all important factors.

We’re willing to invest in good talent wherever it is.
