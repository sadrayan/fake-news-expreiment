Medical Marijuana
This November, Floridians will be voting on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would permit medical marijuana. Charlie will be voting for the amendment. He believes that it is an issue of compassion, of trusting doctors, and of trusting the people of Florida.

Charlie also supports the proposals under consideration in the legislature to legalize “Charlotte’s Web,” to help those suffering from epilepsy.
