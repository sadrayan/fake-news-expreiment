Loud-Mouth Liberal Ashley Judd Wants To Live In Middle East Where Women Have ‘More Rights,’ Gets Unexpected Surprise!
To nobody’s surprise, liberal attack dog, Ashley Judd, continues to spew her ridiculous Anti-American nonsense.

So, instead of pursuing her acting career, Ashley has become a full time activist.

On January 21, Ms. Judd decided to attend the Women’s March in Washington, DC. However her last tweet perfectly explains why liberals in Hollywood need to be careful what they say and do:

Start packing your bags. Get your giant vagina costume all stuffed into a carry-on, or better yet, wear it on your flight to Iraq. Let’s see how fast you’re on a flight back to America. No chance you ladies survive a day in another country. You’ll be back to the USA faster than the next Women’s March can hire another terrorist or murderer. You’ll be back to America faster than Madonna can hand out sexual favors for Clinton votes -what’s she owe, like 50 million favors? Any woman who leaves America because of a numeric ranking is absurd, but I will fully support you leaving the country and making room for more intelligent women to take over.

Seriously, please, get out. Make room for people with logically working brains filled to the brim with common sense and lacking stupidity



Did you think that was Judd’s only Tweet? Here’s her reply!

You tell us. You know everything. Read the darn Constitution for once and stop reminding everyone that you’ve gone full stupid. You know Twitter users DRILLED her for this.

Please go live in the middle east Ashley…





Then we will never have to listen to your garbage Hollywood mouth again!
