While it is accurate to say Austin’s $3.5 Billion budget is larger than that of the National Park Service it is difficult to make a direct comparison. The City of Austin has over 13,000 employees spread across more than 40 departments – including our own Water and Electric utilities – that provide daily direct service to more than 900,000 residents. The scope and mission of the City is simply too varied to make an apples to apples comparison.
