The guidelines, measures, education and quality improvement activities and related data specifications developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Emergency Quality Network are intended to facilitate quality improvement activities by physicians. The materials are intended to provide information and assist physicians in enhancing quality of care. The materials do not establish a standard of medical care, and have not been tested for all potential applications and therefore should not be used as a substitute for clinical or medical judgment. Materials are subject to review and may be revised or rescinded at any time by ACEP. The materials may not be altered without prior written approval from ACEP. The materials, while copyrighted, can be reproduced and distributed, without modification, for noncommercial purposes (e.g., use by health care providers in connection with their practices).

Neither ACEP nor its members shall be responsible for any use of the materials or measures.
