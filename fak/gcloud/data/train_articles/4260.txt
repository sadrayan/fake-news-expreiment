Congressman Steve Daines : Press Releases : DAINES STATEMENT ON HHS SECRETARY SEBELIUS RESIGNATION
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representative Steve Daines released the following statement in response to reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who has been responsible for overseeing the failed rollout of President Obama’s health care law, will resign from the Obama administration:

“There is no question that the Obamacare rollout has been nothing short of a disaster. From broken websites and massive security risks, to perpetual delays and tens of thousands of cancelation notices, Obamacare has been one broken promise after another. I don’t envy the job that Secretary Sebelius was handed, but as the head of the agency charged with the implementation of Obamacare, she is responsible for its failures. Montanans know that in the private sector, failures like this would never have been tolerated—people would have been fired. That’s why last year, I joined more than thirty members of Congress in calling for Secretary Sebelius to be held accountable for Obamacare’s disastrous rollout and resign. After leading one of our nation’s greatest failures in management, Secretary Sebelius’s resignation has been a long time coming—but it’s too little, too late. While Secretary Sebelius’ resignation is a good start, it’s not enough—we need to repeal Obamacare before further harm comes to Montana families, and replace it with Montana-driven reforms that put the patient and their doctor—not government bureaucrats—in charge of health care decisions.”
