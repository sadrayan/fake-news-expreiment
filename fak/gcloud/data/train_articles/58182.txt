Hereâ€™s what crime rates by county actually look like
The question remains, though, what does the U.S. crime rate look like across the country on a county-size scale?

Counties across the South, the Pacific Northwest, California, New Mexico and the lower Mississippi River area show the highest rates of crime adjusted for population in 2014.

The overall crime rate includes reported incidents of violent and property crime, specifically murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft and arson.

To show crimes for counties with large and small populations, the rate is displayed as crime incidents per 1,000 people. Although the rate makes the view fairer, it is still subject to distortions, such as a one-time incident in a county with a small population.

Also, big cities have crimes involving people who travel in for work or entertainment, so a rate based on residential population is skewed.
