SEN. MCCAIN: PAY AT THE PUMP



Sen. McCain's Energy Legislation Would Hit Florida Consumers

"What is not widely understood is that [Sen. McCain] is currently sponsoring legislation that, in the name of fighting global warming, would dramatically raise the tax on all carbon-based fuels, including gasoline, home heating oil, coal, and to a lesser extent, natural gas." (Roy Cordato, "McCain's Costly Tax On Energy," National Review, http://article.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/10/08)



McCain-Lieberman Energy Legislation Would Hike Taxes On Consumers:



McCain-Lieberman Would Dramatically Raise Taxes On All Carbon-Based Fuels, Like Gas For Your Car And Home Heating Oil. "What is not widely understood is that [Sen. McCain] is currently sponsoring legislation that, in the name of fighting global warming, would dramatically raise the tax on all carbon-based fuels, including gasoline, home heating oil, coal, and to a lesser extent, natural gas." (Roy Cordato, "McCain's Costly Tax On Energy," National Review, http://article.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/10/08)



McCain-Lieberman Would Lead To Higher Gas Prices, Anywhere From 26 Cents To 50 Cents To 68 Cents Per Gallon:



American Council For Capital Formation Study: McCain-Lieberman Could Hike Gasoline Prices By 50 Cents Per Gallon. "A study by an economic research institute, the American Council for Capital Formation, underscored these findings, estimating that under S. 139: ... By 2020, gasoline prices would increase 30 to 50 cents per gallon." (H. Sterling Burnett, "Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions," National Center For Policy Analysis, 11/18/04)



The EPA Estimated Sen. McCain's Plan Would Hike Gas Prices By 68 Cents Per Gallon. "The EPA has estimated what the McCain energy tax would mean to consumers. Since the bill's provisions are phased in, the full cost of the tax would not be felt for a number of years. But in a letter to Senator McCain dated July 2007, the EPA estimated that the tax will be about $.26 cents in current dollars per gallon of gasoline by 2030 and $.68 cents per gallon by 2050." (Roy Cordato, "McCain's Costly Tax On Energy," National Review, http://article.nationalreview.com/, Posted 1/10/08)

Florida Gasoline Consumers Could Face $250/Year In Higher Costs:

- 8.7 billion gallons x 50 cents = $4.35 billion in higher gas costs



- $4.35 billion รท 17,789,864 Floridians (2005 est.) = approx. $244.52 in higher gas costs per person (U.S. Census Website, www.census.gov, Accessed 1/27/08)
