UPDATE: AMBER WEBSITE NOW WORKING – Obama plays POLITICS with LOST CHILDREN, shuts down Amber Alert website
This is unbelievable. The Obama administration has shut down the Amber Alert website because of the government shutdown and it now renders this message when you attempt to access it:

I’m sure you care about your lost child but Obama doesn’t – at least not while he’s trying to ‘win’ the government shutdown. I understand from twitter that Amber alerts are state level programs with a federal website. Not real sure how all that works but it just seems unfathomable that this website wouldn’t qualify under ‘essential’, especially when most of the government is still operating.

No, this is just Obama putting politics ahead of you finding your lost child. Despicable.

UPDATE: Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move website works just fine. Seriously. (h/t: @kesgardner)

UPDATE: Looks like the administration had a change of heart due to the bad publicity this has gotten. It’s now back online:

I double checked it myself and it indeed works. Chalk another one up for new media.
