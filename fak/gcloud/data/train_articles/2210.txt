Sen. Jason Carter: We have not tackled any real education issues this legislative session
A frustrated State Sen. Jason Carter, D-Atlanta, took to the Senate well to protest the indifference of the Legislature to the serious education problems facing Georgia, including school funding. Twenty-four days into the legislative session, Carter complained that the first education bill being considered by the Senate was one requiring schools dedicate a week to students learning and reciting the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. While saying he would support “Freedom Week,” Carter said, “We also have to face our problems.” Take a look at his speech.
