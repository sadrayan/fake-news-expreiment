Aetna to Pull Back From Public Health Care Exchanges
WASHINGTON — In a blow to President Obama’s health care law, Aetna, one of the nation’s major insurers, said Monday that it would sharply reduce its participation in the law’s public marketplaces next year.

Aetna said it would no longer offer individual insurance products on the exchanges in about two-thirds of the 778 counties where it now provides such coverage. The company will maintain a presence on exchanges in Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia, it said.

In recent months, the large insurers UnitedHealth and Humana also said that they intended to pull back from the online exchanges, and other insurers are struggling to break even in marketplaces where low prices appear to be the top priority for low-income consumers.

The exchanges are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act: the only place where consumers can obtain subsidies to buy health insurance, which most Americans are required to have under the 2010 law. About 11 million consumers have coverage through the marketplaces, and about 85 percent of them receive subsidies in the form of tax credits.
