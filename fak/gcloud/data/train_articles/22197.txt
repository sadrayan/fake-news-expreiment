**BREAKING UPDATE** Target ALREADY Installing Urinals In Women’s Bathrooms- Customer Claims With THIS Proof!
UNBELIEVABLE! After receiving major backlash over their transgender bathroom policy, Target is now installing URINALS in the women’s bathrooms! This will solidify the resolve of most people who planned to boycott the retail store, as it is a physical manifestation of their “tolerance.”

If it’s 100 percent true that is.

If this is true, it’s quite disturbing and clearly showcases Target is totally dedicated to their stance on this controversial issue, no matter how uncomfortable it makes their customers.

How sick and sad is our current culture that this stuff is becoming acceptable and celebrated? People don’t realize that freedom and liberty are only for a morally upright people.

When perversion starts to become accepted in society, when bad is called good and good is called bad, freedom’s days are numbered.
