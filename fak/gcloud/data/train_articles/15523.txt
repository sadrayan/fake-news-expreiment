We’re trying to check this Mike Martinez statement about Steve Adler: "He's never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall.”

Could you tell us how Martinez reached this conclusion?

Thanks.

Hi Gardner,

Mike meant something specific when he made this statement. While Mike Martinez has been on the Austin City Council for nearly eight years and has a near-perfect attendance record, Steve Adler has not, to our knowledge, ever taken an active role in our local government by appearing before Council on an item.
