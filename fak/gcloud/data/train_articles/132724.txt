Target Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Earnings
“Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,” said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. “At our meeting with the financial community this morning, we will provide detail on the meaningful investments we’re making in our business and financial model which will position Target for long-term, sustainable growth in this new era in retail. We will accelerate our investments in a smart network of physical and digital assets as well as our exclusive and differentiated assortment, including the launch of more than 12 new brands, representing more than $10 billion of our sales, over the next two years. In addition, we will invest in lower gross margins to ensure we are clearly and competitively priced every day. While the transition to this new model will present headwinds to our sales and profit performance in the short term, we are confident that these changes will best-position Target for continued success over the long term.”

Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) today announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results. The Company reported GAAP earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.46 in fourth quarter and $4.58 for full-year 2016, compared with $2.31 and $5.25 in 2015, respectively. Fourth quarter Adjusted EPS were $1.45, down 4.6 percent from $1.52 in 2015. Full-year Adjusted EPS of $5.01 was 6.7 percent higher

Fiscal 2017 Guidance

Target’s 2017 guidance reflects the impact of the Company’s transition to a new financial model, which will be covered in the Company’s meeting with the financial community later today.

In first quarter 2017, Target expects a low-to-mid single digit decline in comparable sales, and both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $1.00.

For full-year 2017, Target expects a low-single digit decline in comparable sales, and both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS of $3.80 to $4.20.

First quarter and full-year 2017 GAAP EPS from continuing operations may include the impact of certain discrete items, which will be excluded in calculating Adjusted EPS. In the past, these items have included losses on the early retirement of debt, data breach expenses, restructuring costs, and certain other items that are discretely managed. The Company is not currently aware of any such discrete items.

Segment Results

Fourth quarter 2016 sales decreased 4.3 percent to $20.7 billion from $21.6 billion last year, reflecting a 1.5 percent decline in comparable sales combined with the removal of pharmacy and clinic sales from this year’s results. Comparable digital channel sales grew 34 percent and contributed 1.8 percentage points of comparable sales growth. Segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT), which is Target’s measure of segment profit, were $1,344 million in fourth quarter 2016, a decrease of 13.5 percent from $1,554 million in 2015.

Fourth quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were 9.5 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, compared with 9.8 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, in 2015. Fourth quarter gross margin rate was 26.9 percent, compared with 27.9 percent in 2015, reflecting markdown pressure from promotional and clearance activity and costs associated with the mix shift between the Company’s store and digital channels, partially offset by the benefit of the sale of the Company’s pharmacy and clinic businesses, a favorable merchandise mix, and cost of goods savings. Fourth quarter SG&A expense rate was 17.5 percent in 2016, compared with 18.1 percent in 2015, reflecting the benefit of the sale of the Company’s pharmacy and clinic businesses and continued expense discipline across the organization.

Interest Expense and Taxes from Continuing Operations

The Company’s fourth quarter 2016 net interest expense was $140 million, compared with $152 million last year. Fourth quarter 2016 effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 32.0 percent, compared with 29.6 percent last year. Last year’s tax rate reflected the impact of the gain on the December 2015 sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses.

Shareholder Returns

The Company returned $902 million to shareholders in fourth quarter 2016, including:

Dividends of $337 million, compared with $345 million in fourth quarter 2015.

Share repurchases totaling $565 million, including:

o Open market transactions that retired 3.2 million shares of common stock at an average price of $66.52, for a total investment of $211 million.

o An accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement that retired 4.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $76.77, for a total investment of $355 million.

As expected, during the fourth quarter the Company completed its previous share repurchase program, which was approved in 2012 and extended to $10 billion in 2015. Upon completion of the prior program, the Company began repurchasing shares under its current $5 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in September 2016. Under the current program, the Company invested $264 million in the fourth quarter, leaving approximately $4.7 billion remaining under the current program at the end of the quarter.

For the trailing twelve months through fourth quarter 2016, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.0 percent, compared with 16.0 percent for the twelve months through fourth quarter 2015. Last year’s ROIC rate reflected the benefit of the gain on the December 2015 sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses. Excluding that benefit, ROIC for the twelve months through fourth quarter 2015 was 13.9 percent. See the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this release for additional information about the Company’s ROIC calculation.
