Officials: Extend Boca Raton Medical Marijuana Ban
Boca Raton officials have recommended that the city continue to ban medical marijuana dispensaries.

The South Florida Sun Sentinel reports that the city's planning and zoning board voted 6-1 on Tuesday to recommend that Boca Raton extend its 12-month ban on medical-marijuana-related activities until October 2016. Officials cited a lack of city-zoning rules regarding the dispensaries as being a primary reason for the decision.

Last October, Boca's City Council unanimously passed Palm Beach County's first municipal moratorium on medical marijuana centers. The vote came shortly before Florida's medical marijuana amendment was defeated.

Specific marijuana dispensary organizations are authorized to operate in Florida under the Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014.

Boca Raton's moratorium halts cultivation, processing, distributing or selling marijuana or "related activities." It is due to expire Oct. 28.
