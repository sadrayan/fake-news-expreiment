Rick Scott's campaign announces three more election lawsuits
(CNN) Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott is filing three lawsuits against county election officials as a recount has gotten underway in the Senate contest between himself and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.

In the first complaint, the Scott campaign alleges Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes counted a certain number of ballots after the Saturday noon deadline. The campaign announced it is filing two other lawsuits against Snipes and Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Buchner, requesting voting tabulation equipment be impounded after the machine recount is completed. The lawsuits also request both supervisors be required to preserve all ballots and records connected with the 2018 election.

Snipes' attorney, Eugene Pettis, gave a response.

"Dr. Snipes has taken multiple measures to make sure that the election machines and ballots are in safe keeping. She is committed to fulfilling all of her responsibilities under the law to make sure that the integrity of this election is maintained and that every legally cast vote will be counted and submitted to the state in a timely fashion," Pettis said.

The initial count in the race had Scott ahead by a small enough margin to trigger a recount according state law.
