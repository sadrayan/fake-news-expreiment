License to Dump sheds light on the practice of potentially radioactive out-of-state fracking waste getting dumped in New York despite Governor Andrew Cuomoâ€™s ongoing implementation of a ban on high-volume hydraulic fracturing (fracking).

To date, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection reports that at least 460,000 tons of solid fracking waste and 23,000 barrels of liquid waste have been dumped in five New York landfills. Comparatively, the DEC says the state does not accept this type of waste.

In addition to outlining key concerns, License to Dump includes a roadmap for Governor Cuomo and his administration to follow in order to fulfill their promise to protect New Yorkers from the dangers of fracking.

UPDATE: 608,646 tons of fracking waste; 2017 addendum.
