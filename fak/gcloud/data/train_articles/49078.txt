Gov. Rick Scott mostly fulfills promise to create 700,000 jobs in 7 years

Floridians following Rick Scott since his first campaign probably weren't surprised when the two-term Republican governor talked about jobs during his announcement to run for the U.S. Senate. Scott described the years before his election in 2010, claiming that "this state had lost over 800,000 jobs in four years. We still had this beautiful weather, but we increased regulations, we increased taxes on people in this state. But we stopped it." Today, he said, "we've now, you, business people, job creators, have added 1.5 million jobs, almost." Scott made job creation a cornerstone of his two campaigns for governor and promised in 2010 to create 700,000 jobs in seven years through seven steps. Those job gains, Scott said, would be on top of nearly 1 million jobs economists predicted would be added to the state no matter who was elected governor. With the seven-year benchmark behind us, we wondered how his promise ended up on our Scott-O-Meter. In total, Florida added 1.49 million nonfarm jobs between the end of December 2010 and February 2018, the last month for which there is data, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That number, which is seasonally adjusted, includes roughly 11,000 additional government jobs. So at this point, Scott remains 200,000 jobs short of his goal. Technically, Scott's seven-year cutoff for this promise ended in January 2018, with a total of 1.47 million added jobs. That means he fulfilled 86 percent of his promised jobs. That said, experts said it's possible the state could make that up by the time he leaves office. "It's going to be close," said Rollins College economics professor William Seyfried. "At the current trend, it's going to come up a little short." Earlier in Scott's tenure, Florida was adding jobs at a quicker pace as the economy was recovering, Seyfried said. Now that the economy is in healthier shape, it's more difficult to add jobs at such high a rate. These new jobs haven't been the highest-paying. Three industries that tend to offer lower wages accounted for 755,400 jobs: education and health services; trade, transportation and utilities (not including retail); and leisure and hospitality. That's more than half of all the total jobs added. In contrast, the three industries with the highest weekly wages (manufacturing, financial activities and professional and business) accounted for roughly 480,000 jobs. And what about Scott's role in all this? While Scott has been a cheerleader for jobs, experts credit the bulk of the recovery to factors outside of his purview, including stimulus money and federal reserve policies. "The performance of the economy and the labor market is like an omelette," said Sean Snaith, University of Central Florida economist and director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "There's a lot of ingredients that has led to what's transpired." Scott promised to create 700,000 jobs on top of the 1 million jobs that would already be created in seven years, but he finished 200,000 jobs short of that total. That said, his original promise is mostly fulfilled. That's our definition of Promise Kept.

2016 marks another year of job growth, but Scott’s promise still has ways to go

Gov. Rick Scott bragged about his passion project in his penultimate State of the State address: jobs. "Florida's businesses have created over 1.26 million private-sector jobs since I was elected, including more than 237,000 new jobs last year alone," Scott said. Jobs have always been important to Scott, who pledged to create 700,000 jobs (on top of what the state would have created anyway) in seven years. It's been more than a year since we last looked at this promise from his 2010 campaign. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1,262,600 nonfarm jobs were created in Florida between the end of December 2010 and December 2016, the last month for which there is data. (Scott's total excludes roughly 500 government jobs.) While the numbers of private-sector jobs have increased since 2010, one expert noted that the effects of the recession are still being felt. Chris McCarty, the director of the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research, said that the state has yet to regain the construction jobs that were lost in the recession. McCarty said these jobs are important to note because they are high-paying. Prior to the recession (2006), there were about 668,700 construction jobs and in November 2016 there were only 461,800. In any case, there's more work to do before Scott hits the jobs total that he promised. This promise stays In the Works.

Scott claims more private sector jobs, but net growth still below 1 million

700,000 jobs promise plods along, despite numbers debate

7 steps, 7 years, still a lot more jobs to go

Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011 with a simple plan he promised would invigorate the state's economy.

Over seven years, through seven steps, Florida would add 700,000 jobs. Shorter: 7-7-7. Not only that, the state would see improvements in its gross domestic product, personal income and tax collections, all achieved through putting government on a diet and giving taxpayers a break. Three years into Scott's tenure, Florida is recovering in ways that surprise economists. The unemployment rate is down dramatically, below the national average, and the state has churned out hundreds of thousands of new jobs. But are Florida's gains enough for Scott to keep his biggest campaign promise? PolitiFact Florida, the fact-checking website of the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald, is monitoring 57 campaign promises Scott made in 2010, including his pledge to create 700,000 jobs. Each promise is assessed and rated on the Scott-O-Meter as Promise Kept, Compromise, In the Works, Stalled or Promise Broken. The jobs numbers, if you were to jot them onto a napkin, look good. Florida has added 406,000 jobs since January 2011, and the biggest monthly boost is the most recent. In October, the state added 44,600 jobs, according to preliminary federal data. Better yet, jobs are coming faster in 2013 than in 2012 and 2011. Beyond the numbers, however, lie two critical questions: 1.) What did Scott actually promise voters in 2010? 2.) Is Scott's 7-7-7 plan the reason those 406,000 jobs came to Florida? Scott's campaign promise When Scott debuted his 7-7-7 economic plan in July 2010, nonpartisan economists at the Legislature's Office of Economic and Demographic Research had just released their estimates for Florida's long-term jobs outlook. They concluded Florida would add 1.05 million jobs between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2018, and it didn't matter who lived in the Governor's Mansion — Scott, Democrat Alex Sink or someone else. To account for the news, Scott clarified his promise. His 700,000 jobs would come in addition to the ones state economists forecasted. Put simpler: 7-7-7 became 7-7-1.7 million. That promise is a lot harder to keep. It requires the state to produce more than 20,000 jobs on average per month, every month, for seven years. To date, Florida is averaging 12,000 jobs a month. "Florida is going to come nowhere near exceeding normal job growth by 700,000 in seven years, no matter how you define it or time it," said David Denslow, a retired University of Florida economist. Scott's influence on jobs The math on Scott's 7-7-7 plan actually adds up to 661,914 jobs. The campaign rounded up. The plan outlines seven steps to reach the goal: Implement accountability budgeting, reduce government spending, enact regulatory reform, focus on job growth and retention, invest in the university system, reduce property taxes, and eliminate Florida's business income tax. Scott promised an economy better off because of his policies, but many of his ideas from the campaign did not survive, said Rollins College economics professor William Seyfried. Scott saw success in some areas, such as privatizing inmate health care, shaving the state's workforce and making state workers contribute to their pensions. Other, bigger ideas were rejected by the Legislature outright or only adopted in part. Take his biggest tax proposals: eliminating the corporate income tax and drastically reducing school property taxes (while sparing schools from cuts through other savings). Scott made headway in relieving many firms of paying the business tax, but the Legislature rejected his push to go further (PolitiFact Florida rates that promise Stalled). And talk of cutting school tax money has turned into calls for boosting school funding (Promise Broken). And when Scott suspended proposed regulations until his office could review them — part of his regulatory-reduction effort to generate 240,000 jobs — the Florida Supreme Court said the executive order overstepped his authority. Scott was forced to change course. "Regulatory relief and tax reform tend to have a gradual effect over time rather than a significant impact right away," Seyfried said. The issue with the 7-7-7 plan, Denslow and other economists say, is it assumes power and influence a governor does not have. Florida's governor is even weaker than most because, his line-item veto power aside, the Legislature carries more economic authority, Denslow said. Still, the state once seen as a laggard in the national recovery is now seen as a leader, and Scott is perceived as making the state as business friendly as possible, said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo. The state has done well in attracting international tourism and housing investments from Brazil, Great Britain and Canada, he said. "He's been very active in recruiting businesses and encouraging economic development at the local level," he said. Whether Scott gets credit for the job growth is an age-old debate. Executives at all levels of government often take credit for the good times and deflect blame for the bad. In Scott's case, economists say it's too hard to parse out and too soon to tell what jobs are here directly as a result of his stewardship. Even the architect of the 7-7-7 plan, Donna Arduin, told the Times in 2010, "You're never going to know which jobs were created because of which event." Part of national trend The biggest gust behind Florida's economy is the national business cycle, said Mekael Teshome, a PNC Financial Services Group economist who studies the Florida market. If the economy is improving here, it means conditions have improved nationwide. For decades, the state's success was built on growth, the continuous influx of new residents and housing construction. When people have more expendable income, more people visit Florida. When the economy improves around the country, retirees feel better about moving to Florida. And when housing picks up regionally, it lifts the rest of the state. "What we're seeing in Florida has more to do with the macro trends than particular policies," Teshome said. "In terms of what proportion of that recovery was due to government versus the normal business cycle, I don't think anyone's really got that number." The types of industries in a state also are important. Florida's boom and bust was fueled by housing. Meanwhile, Texas performed relatively well during the recession thanks to its agriculture and energy sectors. "You could say Gov. Rick Perry is great, and maybe he is and maybe he isn't, but a lot of its success is due to the type of industry they have," Seyfried said. "Florida's economic performance in recent years was driven by the bursting of the housing bubble." Where Scott stands So where does this leave Scott's promise to create 700,000 jobs? The state has added jobs, a good sign after years of recession-driven losses. But Scott needs more job growth than ever to have a chance of fulfilling the promise he made during the campaign. Economists doubt he will reach his original goal — and that's putting aside an argument about how much his policies affect job growth. For Scott to deliver, Florida needs to create 26,000 jobs a month, every month, for 50 straight months. That happened only five times in Scott's first 34 months in office. The odds are stacked against him, but jobs are coming and Scott is trying. Still, we rate this promise In the Works. Gov. Rick Scott promised during the 2010 campaign to create 700,000 jobs in the state over seven years in addition to the 1 million jobs economists said would be added naturally. To meet Scott's goal, Florida needs to create more than 20,000 jobs a month on average.

July numbers improve, but much progress needed

July's jobs numbers brought pleasing news to Gov. Rick Scott, who is watching the state's economic data like a hawk. The state gained a net 27,600 jobs from June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Scott put an even more positive spin on the news: It was a record month during his tenure for private-sector job growth, at 34,500 jobs. "We are more than halfway to our goal of creating 700,000 jobs in seven years," Scott said in a Aug. 16 statement. We have a few quibbles with Scott's statement. One, he is counting private-sector jobs. By our count, which factors in government job losses, that moves the net jobs total since Scott took office to 336,700 -- so it's actually less than halfway to 700,000. That's better than the last time we visited the jobs data, but the state is not creating jobs at a fast enough pace for Scott to really be powering toward the jobs goal he articulated on the campaign. That goal, of course, was that his 7-7-7 plan would create 700,000 jobs on top of what state economists predicted the economy would churn out anyway as it recovered from a painful recession. At the time, they predicted the state would add 1 million jobs by 2017 regardless of changes in policy. That's why we rated Scott's assertion back in May that "we are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years” as Mostly False . The unemployment rate is not particularly relevant to this promise, but we thought we'd note it remained unchanged at 7.1 percent. Even more, economists have told us it takes several years to assess what influence, if any, a governor or president has over job creation or losses. This promise remains Stalled on out Scott-O-Meter.

Gov. Rick Scott’s job-creation goal gets unexpected boost, but...

Gov. Rick Scott's second year in office turned out not to be as underwhelming for job creation as once thought. Federal labor economists estimated Florida generated 54,900 net jobs in 2012. Scott, of course, promised to deliver 700,000 new jobs in seven years to the Sunshine State (on top of normal growth), so the modest gains were a setback to his campaign goal. But each March, economists revise their original estimates using Census Bureau data instead of business surveys. This year's revision, which relies on unemployment insurance reports from employers and changes in population estimates, added more than 84,000 jobs to Scott's jobs tally. Cool down, conspiracy theorists. Scott did not cook the books to add thousands more jobs to his tally. These numbers come from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, so states don't have individual control. Plus, most states had their jobs estimates revised up. Only four states and Washington, D.C., generated fewer jobs than originally estimated. The way we typically get monthly employment numbers -- by surveying a sample of employers -- is helpful but often imprecise. It's like trying to figure out the jobs picture through a foggy window, experts say. "The picture becomes clearer once we get this benchmarking process,” said Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist and director of UCF's Institute of Economic Competitiveness. "We can't really get a real-time read on the economy.” Snaith added: "The real measuring stick will probably be nine years from when he took office.” In heralding the news, Scott highlighted the state's unemployment rate of 7.8. percent -- its lowest in five years and below the national average -- and the creation of more than 280,000 private sector jobs since he took over. Scott likes to tout private-sector job creation under his watch, which ignores the number of government employees who lost their jobs at the same time. Through 25 months in office, Scott's new net jobs total is 254,600 jobs. So why, with progress on job creation, are we rating this Stalled? To reporters on the campaign trail and during a debate, Scott clarified his jobs plan would build on top of forecasts from state economists, who predicted the state would add 1 million jobs by 2017 regardless of policy changes. To meet Scott's promise, the state needs to add 20,238 jobs a month, every month for seven years. As you can tell from our chart, that has happened a few times, including in January 2012, which after benchmarking went from a loss of 35,400 jobs to an increase of 23,300 jobs. Under Scott's watch, Florida is creating an average of 10,184 jobs a month. It's not bad -- it's certainly better than before the revisions. Still, it's half the monthly average Florida needs to crank out in order for Scott to fulfill his promise of creating 1.7 million new jobs by 2018. The Tampa Bay Times noted one other important point in its March 18, 2013 story about the rosier jobs numbers: The percentage of the working-age population in the labor force fell during the recession and has not yet recovered. Even though Florida"s 16+ civilian population increased by 218,000 in 2012, the labor force grew by just 96,000, the Times noted. This promise remains Stalled.

Florida sees positive October growth, but it still falls short of benchmark

Gov. Rick Scott's promise to create 700,000 jobs in seven years got a boost in October, with the state adding 14,700 jobs.



That puts the total number of jobs created since Scott took office in January 2011 at 154,000.



The job growth is part of a larger story about Florida's improving economy after a less-than-ideal summer.



Scott celebrated the state's declining unemployment rate, which hit its lowest point in almost four years in October. At 8.5 percent, the rate is still higher than the national unemployment rate.



In a news release, he counted off several signs of growth, including increases in job postings, an uptick in consumer confidence and a trade surplus. He delighted in the creation of 12,100 private sector jobs and ignored the fact that government jobs got a 2,600-position boost.



"We are creating an environment that fosters job creation, economic development and provides a skilled workforce," he said in the release. "My number one goal is to create jobs for Florida families and get this state back to work. There is still more work that needs to be done, but I'm confident we're on the right path."



As Scott pointed out, much work remains for the state to add 700,000 jobs through 2017. As a candidate, Scott pledged those jobs would come on top of normal growth, bringing the true desired total to 1.7 million jobs.



State economists expected Florida to generate 1 million jobs through 2017 through normal growth. Scott said his seven-step plan would create 700,000 jobs on top of what they projected.



"Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs, and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be," Scott said during a debate sponsored by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association.



To do that, Scott needed to create an average of 20,238 jobs a month since his January 2011 start-date. He netted job gains of 14,700 in October, but it falls short of that benchmark.



In office, Scott has backed down from his campaign remarks, saying Florida would grow by only 700,000 without accounting for normal growth. Scott's press team has been critical of our stories about Scott's campaign promise, even publishing a "fact check” of our previous promise update.



His team pointed to the positive direction of job growth since August and said Scott's focus on job creation is as relentless as ever.



We don't deny Scott is laser-focused on employment.



Still, he is far short of his specific goal to create 700,000 jobs on top of normal growth. That does not mean the overall jobs picture is dimming for Florida under Scott; in fact, the state's economy shows many signs of perking up over recent months.



But Florida's recent job-creation pace is not yet strong enough for Scott to be on track to meet his stated campaign goal. This promise remains Stalled.

Still a long way from 700,000 jobs

It's been a few months since we've looked at Gov. Rick Scott's centerpiece promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years. While the most recent statistics show job creation moving in a positive direction, the pace is so sluggish that it still looks like it will be difficult for Scott to keep his word. Scott promised during his campaign for governor to create 700,000 jobs in seven years as part of his signature plan to jumpstart Florida's economy. The extra jobs were to be in addition to those jobs economists predicted would be created no matter who was elected governor. That would raise the bar to 1.7 million total jobs, or a little more than 20,000 jobs added per month, each month, for seven years. PolitiFact Florida is tracking Scott's jobs promise and 56 others on our Scott-O-Meter, which ranks promises as Promise Kept, Promise Broken, Stalled or Compromise. How's Scott done toward creating all those jobs? Through Scott's first 20 months, Florida has added a total of 130,800 jobs, or about 6,540 jobs per month. If you exclude Scott's first month in office, the number dips to about 108,000 jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. August brought particularly good news. The state added more than 23,000 jobs -- the second highest month of job growth Scott has seen since taking office. The August figures, which are the most recent ones that are available, are preliminary and subject to revision. "This increase in new jobs is proving that the decisions we're making here in Florida are pointing our state in the right direction,” Scott said in a statement. Still, for Scott, there's a long way to go. For Scott to keep his word, Florida would need to add 26,000 jobs a month, every month, through 2017. The state has only done that once since Scott took office, in April 2011. One note: Scott has since back-tracked on the condition that he would create jobs in addition to what economists predicted. We're holding him to his original promise at PolitiFact Florida, though even by his much easier target he is off schedule. To just get to 700,000 jobs, Florida would still need to create about 9,500 jobs a month through 2017 instead of the 6,540 jobs a month the state is now generating. In January 2012, we first rated Scott's centerpiece promise as Stalled. There's nothing in the most recent numbers to change our opinion. This promise remains Stalled.

Math starting to work against Rick Scott on his centerpiece jobs promise

Florida adds 10,100 jobs in February

Florida's jobs outlook improved in February after a dismal January report. But Gov. Rick Scott still has a long way to go of fulfilling his central campaign promise: creating 700,000 jobs in seven years. Florida has added 90,400 jobs in Scott's first 14 months in office, with 10,100 jobs coming in February 2012, according to the federal government's most recent estimate. February's numbers helped offset a big backstep for Scott's promise in January, when the state lost 35,400 jobs (revised from its preliminary estimate of 38,600 lost jobs). Florida is one of 28 states with significant over-the-year job gains, though its count of 72,300 added jobs trails more populous states by a long shot. Florida's population is poised to surpass New York's, but the Empire State added almost twice as many jobs from February 2011 to February 2012. Scott isn't taking that lying down. He went on Fox News to announce that he's recruiting New York's top companies to Florida, pointing to a letter he wrote to 100 chief executives boasting of Florida's low corporate tax burden and sunny weather. It's too early to tell if any CEOs will take up the former healthcare CEO on his offer. He could use their help. Scott needs another 1,609,600 jobs to meet his original promise (700,000 jobs on top of projected seven-year growth of 1 million), and 609,600 jobs to meet his revised promise (700,000 regardless of the economy's performance). Economic optimists might point to the state's unemployment rate of 9.4 percent, which remains above the national average but fell to its lowest point in three years in February. Our task here is to focus on jobs. This promise remains Stalled. • • • Lagging behind job creation promise During the 2010 campaign, Gov. Rick Scott promised to "create over 700,000 jobs for the state of Florida." Those new jobs would be on top of the jobs state economists predicted would be created naturally, Scott said -- representing a total of 1.7 million jobs in seven years, according to economists' projections. Here's how Scott stands as of February 2012. Sources: Tampa Bay Times, "Florida unemployments falls to 9.4 percent," March 30, 2012 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Regional and State Employment and Unemployment Summary, published March 30, 2012 The Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog, "Scott pens letter to New York CEOs: Do you like paying taxes?"

Latest job numbers reveal set-backs on job creation

Yes, Florida's unemployment rate dropped to 9.6 percent in January — its lowest point since March 2009. But the news isn't so great for Gov. Rick Scott, who made creating 700,000 jobs in seven years his bold, catchy campaign promise. Even though the state's unemployment rate is down, actual job numbers are down, too — 38,600 jobs lost in January, economists reported Tuesday. The good-news, bad-news numbers are largely because the two statistics measure different things. For Scott, the bottom line is this: The state created 77,100 jobs from January 2011 through January 2012. The number's even lower — 54,200 jobs — if you exclude the month Scott was sworn into office. Either measure is far short of the deal Scott made with voters who elected him in 2010, when he said he would create 700,000 jobs in seven years. PolitiFact Florida continues to rate his centerpiece promise Stalled. Scott, who celebrated a rosy December jobs report with a press conference, did not take questions from reporters Tuesday. His office issued a statement that focused on the unemployment drop, but not the job creation numbers:



"Florida's unemployment rate has now dropped for 11 of the last 13 months and this is the second consecutive month the unemployment rate has been below 10 percent," Scott said in the statement. "It's great to see Florida's economy is trending in the right direction and our unemployment rate is the lowest in three years."



During the campaign, Scott created a seven-step plan that he said would lead to the creation of 700,000 jobs in seven years. When asked by reporters, Scott said those jobs would be in addition to the jobs economists predicted would be created naturally — by either population growth or growth in the overall economy.



But Scott flip-flopped months into office, announcing in October that he would rely "on actual job growth each month," not on "what an economist in Tallahassee predicts" the state may gain or lose.



Now even that modified promise is looking shaky.



Originally, employment data measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics helped Scott claim that he added 130,000 jobs in 2011 — often illustrated by posters depicting skyrocketing job growth for the private sector as government jobs trended negative.



That outlook is worse now that economists crunched the data again.



The 2011 net jobs created was really 115,700, according to revised data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In January 2012, the state lost 38,600 nonfarm jobs -- the largest drop in the country.



We should note that January 2012 numbers are preliminary. Previous job losses identified in January 2010 and January 2011 were later reported as months with job gains.



Every year, economists revisit the monthly jobs data, which is initially based on a survey of employers, said Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist. They compare the survey results with tax forms, and big fixes are necessary sometimes.



"It's just the nature of the beast," Snaith said.



Still, since Scott took office, the state has added 77,100 jobs, or merely 54,200 depending on when you start counting. That's miles short of the pace he needs to keep his original promise, but it's also now shy of even the revised promise he made in October.



Either way, this promise remains Stalled.

Rick Scott promised to "create over 700,000 jobs for the state of Florida." Those new jobs would be on top of the jobs state economists predicted would be created naturally, Scott said -- representing a total of 1.7 million jobs in seven years, according to economists' projections.
