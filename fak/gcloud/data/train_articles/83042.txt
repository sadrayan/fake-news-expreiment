Ted Nugent: President Obama a ‘Chimpanzee’ and ‘Subhuman Mongrel,’ Hillary Has ‘Spare Scrotums’
Self-professed fecal draft-dodger Ted Nugent, who is not racist because he profits from black music, was interviewed by Guns.com at the almost-aptly-named SHOT Show 2014 about a variety of topics, and had a few more choice words for President Obama, whom Nugent once said (from a distance) should “suck on my machine gun.” Toward the end of the interview, Nugent referred to the President as a “subhuman mongrel” and a “chimpanzee,” while also asserting that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has “spare scrotums.”

During the 2012 presidential campaign, Republican nominee Mitt Romney sought, and received, an endorsement from from Nugent. Nugent was also a Republican Congressman’s guest at the 2013 State of the Union Address.
