What is a Niqab? (with pictures)
The niqab is a combination of head covering and scarf, or a one piece scarf that covers everything but the eyes. It usually flows down to the mid-back to cover a woman’s hair, and may flow down to the mid-chest in the front. This head covering can be worn with a burqa, or with other clothing as part of modest dress for Muslim women. It is most often worn in the Arabic countries in the Persian Gulf, some parts of Southeast Asia, Northern African Islamic countries, and in India.

Many Muslim women feel that wearing the niqab is Hijab. Hijab is clothing worn per instruction in the Qu’ran that bids women to cover their beauties. The covering may be obligatory dress in some countries, and other women wear it out of choice. Efforts in some countries, like Turkey, to ban the niqab have been met with protests. In fact, Turkey tends not to enforce this law because some women feel protected by wearing it.

There are two kinds of niqab. In some styles, both the forehead and eyes show and the scarf is attached with seams or elastic. The other type is more closely associated with the burqa style. Only the eyes show, and even the eyebrows may be obscured.
