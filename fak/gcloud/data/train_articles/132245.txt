Chuck Schumer says he's not armed (updated)
Jay Townsend made an interesting claim toward the end of last night’s debate against Sen. Chuck Schumer: he has a concealed weapons permit.

“I am also curious about one thing: I did read and I am understanding, for the record, that Senator Schumer is licensed to carry a concealed hand gun,” Townsend said. “That is another example of misstatement by my opponent,” Schumer immediately replied. “It is absolutely not true.” There was a momentary pause, broken by NY1’s Bobby Cuza, one of the debate panelists. “….you’re not carrying a gun,” he asked Schumer, to laughs. “Nor am I licensed!” The senator re-iterated.

After the debate, Republicans said Schumer had “lied” and offered proof. They haven’t sent it along.

Brian Fallon, a Schumer aide, insisted that except for winning an NRA marksmanship award at age 14, the senator does not own a gun or have a license to carry one. He sent along the below letter from the NYPD as proof.
