Benefits By Year Of Birth

Full retirement age is the age at which a person may first become entitled to full or unreduced retirement benefits.

No matter what your full retirement age (also called "normal retirement age") is, you may start receiving benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70.

If You Retire Early

You can retire at any time between age 62 and full retirement age. However, if you start benefits early, your benefits are reduced a fraction of a percent for each month before your full retirement age.

The chart below lists age 62 reduction amounts and includes examples based on an estimated monthly benefit of $1000 at full retirement age. Select your year of birth to find out how much your benefit will be reduced if you retire between age 62 and full retirement age.

If your birthday is on January 1st, we figure your benefit as if your birthday was in the previous year.

If you were born on the 1st of the month, we figure your benefit (and your full retirement age) as if your birthday was in the previous month. If you were born on January 1st, we figure your benefit (and your full retirement age) as if your birthday was in December of the previous year. You must be at least 62 for the entire month to receive benefits. Percentages are approximate due to rounding. The maximum benefit for the spouse is 50 percent of the benefit the worker would receive at full retirement age. The percent reduction for the spouse should be applied after the automatic 50 percent reduction. Percentages are approximate due to rounding.

Pros And Cons

There are advantages and disadvantages to taking your benefit before your full retirement age. The advantage is that you collect benefits for a longer period of time. The disadvantage is your benefit is reduced. Each person's situation is different. It is important to remember:

if you delay your benefits until after full retirement age, you may be eligible for delayed retirement credits that would increase your monthly benefit;

that there are other things to consider when making the correct decision about your retirement benefits; and

to contact Social Security before you decide when to retire.
