The vendor debts are owed solely by the Dewhurst for Texas political committee, not David personally.

The state and federal committees have acquired title to Barfieldâ€™s house as part of efforts to recover monies he stole from the committees. Efforts will continue to sell the house to obtain funds to repay monies stolen by Barfield from the committees.
