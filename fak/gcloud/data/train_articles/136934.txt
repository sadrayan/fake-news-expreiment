Tomi Lahren incites the wrath of the Beyhive after going after Beyoncé
Recently, Beyoncé presented Sports Illustrated’s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award to Colin Kaepernick, and in presenting the award, Beyoncé had some words of praise for the former quarterback.

“Thank you Colin Kaepernick. Thank you for your selfless heart, and your conviction. Thank you for your personal sacrifice. Colin took action with no fear of consequence or repercussion only hope to change the world for the better. To change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color,” Beyoncé said.

“We’re still waiting for the world to catch up. It’s been said that racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America. So, let’s be very clear. Colin has always been very respectful of the individuals who selflessly serve and protect our country and our communities and our families. His message is solely focused on social injustice for historically disenfranchised people. Let’s not get that mistaken,” she added.

But Tomi Lahren wasn’t going to stand for that, apparently.

She took to Twitter to post about the award and Beyoncé’s message, writing, “Police-hating Beyoncé presents police and America-hating Kappy with a ‘legacy’ award. This is how far we’ve fallen. Wow.”

Of course, the Beyhive was quick to come for Lahren for going after Queen Bey, dragging Lahren not only for the incorrect assertion that Beyoncé hates the police but for daring to put the superstar’s name in her mouth in the first place.

Check out some of the best Twitter reactions (and Tomi’s response) below.
