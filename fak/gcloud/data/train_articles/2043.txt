By any measure, Texas tops nation in job creation
After we posted a list last week of the leading states for job creation, a member of our Texas on the Potomac Facebook Fan Page community pointed out that our list was just a count of the total number of new jobs. Because Texas was such a large state with a massive economy, he posited that the “raw job�? count would naturally favor Texas. He asked us whether Texas would fare as well if we factored in the size of the state’s job force.

Because he’s an economist, we took his point seriously.

So here’s a new list, sliced and diced by your blogger-in-chief to take the state’s size into account. And guess what? Texas still leads — though Louisiana and Rhode Island are pretty close behind. This is the list of the percentage increase in jobs for each of the 15 states (plus the District of Columbia) that gained jobs from July 2009 to July 2010.

MOST JOBS CREATED Texas +1.5 percent Louisiana +1.3 percent Rhode Island +1.3 percent District of Columbia +1.1 percent Idaho +1.1 percent North Dakota +1.0 percent Arizona +0.9 percent Mississippi +0.7 percent Illinois +0.3 percent Florida +0.2 percent New Mexico +0.2 percent Iowa +0.1 percent Massachusetts +0.1 percent California +0.0 percent Tennessee +0.0 percent Washington +0.0 percent
