BREAKING: Supreme Court Issues Its First Bench Warrant Ever
The US Supreme Court is trying to rule on a case involving the Treasury Department’s mishandling of funds during the Obama administration, but two justices say they can’t rule without the in-person testimony of the man in charge at the time, Donald M. Allard. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch decided to do something the Supreme Court has never done before: issued a warrant for someone’s arrest to appear before the bench.

Allard has already been found in contempt of court for failing to answer subpoenas to the 26th District Court in DC and the 17th District Court of Appeals after that. Now he has the entirety of US law enforcement looking to place him front-and-center before the most powerful panel in the world.

Allard’s attorney continues to claim that his client is “unavailable” and has himself been charged with obstructing a federal investigation for not revealing Allard’s location. Allard, a close friend and college activist friend of Barack Obama, is needed to answer one simple question: Was he ordered by the chief executive to transfer funds from the trust fund to the general fund without the approval of Congress.

Allard isn’t expected to appear. He is instead expected to go on the FBI’s 10 most wanted list and spend the rest of his life on the run. We’ll keep you updated on this developing story.
