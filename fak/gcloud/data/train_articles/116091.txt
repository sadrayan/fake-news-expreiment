Thousands march in downtown Chicago in support of Palestinians
Thousands of protesters were marching through downtown Chicago on Sunday in support of Palestinians as Israeli forces continue a ground invasion in the Gaza Strip.

Protesters were carrying Palestinian flags and signs reading “Save Gaza's children” and chanting “Free, free Palestine.”

Salam Khatib, 19, of Valparaiso, Ind., participated in the march with seven of her family members.

"We just hope people will expand their knowledge of what's going on in Palestine," she said. "It just doesn't make sense to me."

Protesters made their way west along Upper Wacker Drive, turned south on State Street and then continued west along Madison Street before stopping outside a bank between Canal and Clinton streets, where speakers addressed the marchers.

Mohamad Nasir, vice chair of the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago, spoke to the crowd outside the bank on Madison.

“We stand here. We feel your pain, your suffering and we mourn your dead as our own,” Nasir said of Gaza residents. “It’s time to hold our government accountable for how they spend our money and who they support. … We want to free Gaza from the siege.”
