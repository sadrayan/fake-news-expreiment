Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)



WHAT DOES THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT DO?



It establishes a process for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian governing entity and formally extends the federal policy of self-governance and self-determination to Native Hawaiians.



IF THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT PASSES, IS A NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT INSTANTLY CREATED?



No. There will be a lengthy process for reorganization, including the creation of a commission, establishment of a roll of qualified Native Hawaiian constituents, creation of a Native Hawaiian Interim Governing Council, creation of organic governing documents, election of officers, which will result in the establishment of the Native Hawaiian governing entity.



WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE REORGANIZATION OF THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNING ENTITY?



An individual who is deemed a "qualified Native Hawaiian constituent" as defined in the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act may participate in the reorganization process. To meet this definition, an individual must:

Establish a lineal descent to the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of Hawaii (no blood quantum is required)
