New Radio Ad Responds Dem Ad Blaming Thom Tillis for Trayvon Martin Shooting
The conservative group American Commitment is responding to a recent radio ad from the Democratic Senate Majority PAC that attempts to tie North Carolina Speaker of the House Thom Tillis to the death of Florda teen Trayvon Martin.

American Commitment announced Tuesday it has launched its own radio ad taking Tillis opponents to task for race-baiting in the closing days of the tight U.S. Senate election between Tillis and incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC).

“Have you heard this race-hustling Kay Hagan ad paid for by Harry Reid’s super PAC? Probably not. Because they’re not running it on this station,” the radio voiceover says in the ad.

The ad then plays part of Senate Majority PAC ad dealing with Martin, which claims “Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of stand your ground laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.”

“Desperate to hold on to power, Obama, Reid, and Hagan are shamelessly race-baiting, and it’s only going to get worse this weekend,” the American Commitment voice over adds, going on to praise Tillis as “bold, strong, unafraid.”

“As senator, Thom Tillis will undo the Obama agenda. Don’t let the race hustlers win, vote Thom Tillis on Tuesday,” the voiceover says.

According to American Commitment the ad is running across the state.
