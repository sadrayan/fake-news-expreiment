World ig­nor­ing ‘un­prece­dented’ hunger cri­sis

The world is in the grip of an as­ton­ish­ing and acute cri­sis: more than 20 mil­lion peo­ple in South Su­dan, So­ma­lia, north­ern Nige­ria and Ye­men face star­va­tion in the next six months, ac­cord­ing to the UN. Nearly 1.4 mil­lion chil­dren are at “im­mi­nent risk” of death. The scale of the hunger epi­demic was de­scribed last month by US-based re­searchers as “un­prece­dented in re­cent decades”.

The crises are in large part man­made, stoked by ru­inous con­flicts, col­laps­ing gov­er­nance and in­ter­na­tional in­dif­fer­ence. Only in one coun­try, So­ma­lia, which is re­cov­er­ing from years of war, is drought the main cause of the cur­rent food short­ages.

“The sit­u­a­tion is dire,” warned the UN sec­re­tary gen­eral, An­tónio Guter­res, last week, in a des­per­ate ap­peal for funds. “We need $4.4bn by the end of March to avert a catas­tro­phe.” At a time when the US Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has al­ready threat­ened fund­ing cuts to the UN, the prospects for global re­lief look dim.

Last Mon­day, the South Su­danese gov­ern­ment, along with the UN, for­mally de­clared famine in parts of the fledg­ling na­tion racked by war. Ac­cord­ing to the UN’s clas­si­fi­ca­tion, a famine takes place along cer­tain grim cri­te­ria, in­clud­ing when 20% of the pop­u­la­tion in a given area faces “ex­treme food short­ages”.

Re­searchers fear that ar­eas of north-eastern Nige­ria al­ready en­dured famine-level con­di­tions last year. The re­gion has been racked by the Is­lamist in­sur­gency of Boko Haram. But de­spite the Nige­rian mil­i­tary’s re­cent gains, some 5.1 mil­lion peo­ple face se­vere food short­ages. Close to half a mil­lion chil­dren un­der the age of five could suf­fer from acute mal­nu­tri­tion this year, and up to 20% could die un­less more aid reaches them, ac­cord­ing to the UN.

In So­ma­lia, failed rains last year, along with a poor fore­cast for the spring, may put as much as half the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion at risk of acute food in­se­cu­rity.

In Ye­men, the toll of grind­ing civil war, com­pli­cated by months of aerial bom­bard­ment by a Saudi-led (and US-backed) coali­tion, has cre­ated a shock­ing hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis. Around half a mil­lion chil­dren are “dan­ger­ously mal­nour­ished” and at risk of death. Ac­cord­ing to a UN study re­leased last month, some 7.3 mil­lion Ye­me­nis re­quired “emer­gency food as­sis­tance” and around 17.1 mil­lion Ye­me­nis were “strug­gling to feed them­selves”. That is well over twothirds of the pop­u­la­tion.

In South Su­dan, aid agen­cies have been warn­ing for months about the risk of wide­spread famine in ar­eas rav­aged by ri­val fac­tions. Fields have gone fal­low and the pop­u­la­tion’s ac­cess to food has dried up. “Crop pro­duc­tion has been se­verely cur­tailed by the con­flict, even in pre­vi­ously sta­ble and fer­tile ar­eas,” re­ports the BBC.

Now 100,000 peo­ple are fac­ing star­va­tion, and around a mil­lion peo­ple are on the brink of famine. Nearly 275,000 chil­dren are at risk of starv­ing to death un­less the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity in­ter­venes in a rapid and mean­ing­ful way, the UN warned.

The UN’s vast fund­ing short­fall is the ob­vi­ous prob­lem. Emer­gency donor con­fer­ences, such as one held last Fri­day in Oslo to ad­dress the cri­sis in north-eastern Nige­ria, are at­tempt­ing to make up the gap. But the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity has dropped the ball in other ways. In the case of South Su­dan, for ex­am­ple, the se­cu­rity coun­cil failed to pass a puni­tive arms em­bargo on the coun­try that could have pos­si­bly stemmed the vi­o­lence and the wan­ton abuses of its war­ring fac­tions.

As far as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump goes, there are still fig­ures within his White House who are deeply suspicious of the UN and hos­tile to fund­ing aid projects over­seas. Hence an­other bit­ter irony of 2017: So­ma­lia and Ye­men, where mil­lions of peo­ple face acute food short­ages, have been char­ac­terised by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion as na­tions that ex­port ter­ror and sub­jected to a po­ten­tial im­mi­gra­tion ban. When you can’t even ex­pect em­pa­thy, how can you ex­pect real help?
