Bernie Sanders stays on the attack in California's capital
Bernie Sanders reprised some of his tougher criticisms of Hillary Clinton during a rally in Sacramento on Monday night, blasting her vote for the war in Iraq and her ties to Wall Street.

The crowd of 15,000, which gathered on a soccer field under a clear night sky, booed even the mention of Clinton's name at one point in the speech.

California's primary is June 7, but even a victory here could leave Sanders short of the delegates he needs to prevent Clinton from winning the Democratic nomination.

Nonetheless, he told supporters he still has a shot at an upset victory.

"With your help, we're going to win the biggest prize of all, the California primary," he said.

Sanders also said he supported a state ballot measure that would limit the cost of prescription drugs when state health agencies are footing the bill.

Although the crowd booed Clinton, several people said they would still vote for her if she was the nominee.

"I don't want Trump to win," said Heather Rodgers, 25. "I don't want any possibility of Trump to win."
