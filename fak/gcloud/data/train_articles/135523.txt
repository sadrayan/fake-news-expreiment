Texas Man Uses Massive Inflatable Dam to Save House
Editor's note: This post was originally published on June 12, 2016.

One man in Rosharon, Texas used a product he found online to protect his family's home and property during flooding in 2016.

KHOU reports Randy Wagner felt devastated when local officials ordered residents to evacuate their homes. In a desperate attempt to protect his home from the flood waters, Wagner drove all the way to Louisiana to pick up a product he found online, an Aqua Dam.

With the help of a couple of friends, Wagner installed the Aqua Dam's 400 feet of materials and waited for the water to come. As the water built up around his home, the dam held it all back. Now, while thousands of his neighbors will need to make repairs, rebuild and replace all their belongings, Wagner has saved everything.

You can learn more about the story in this video.

The Aqua Dam contains plastic and fabric. Here's how it works: 400 feet of fabric and plastic fill with water to create a 30-inch water barrier. The assembly did take some time, and many of Wagner's neighbors weren't impressed at first. "I was the crazy guy," Wagner told KHOU. Everybody was kinda going by, laughing at me. But today they are really impressed with this AquaDam."

The product cost him $8,300, but it potentially saved him $150,000 in repairs. To learn more about the Aqua Dam, check out this site.
