Racist Democratic Party Logo : NoiseCollector : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive
For some reason all traces of this image have been purged from the internet. I found it once while doing research into the hypocrasy of the democratic party. When I searched again to download the image for a video that I was working on, it was nowhere to be found. There was not even much mention of it all, which I thought was odd....



I was able to contact someone at the Birmingham Historical Society and they were kind enough to send me these 2 scans from their archive. The official emblem of the Alabama Democratic party was a white rooster with the slogan "White Supremacy, For the Right" up until 1966.



The Democratic party was originally made up of segregationists and former Confederates and Klan members like Senator Byrd. Before running for President, George Wallace, the Democratic governer of Alabama at the time, gave us this famous quote:



"In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."
