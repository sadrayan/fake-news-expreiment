Portland parking tickets will increase to $39 in January
The cost of being forgetful is about to go up for Portland motorists and other drivers visiting the city.

Starting Jan. 2, tickets for failing to feed the parking meter and parking in a truck loading zone will go up $5 to $39, the Portland Bureau of Transportation announced today.

Parking without current vehicle registration tags will also go up $5, but will jump to $65. And if the tags are more than three months expired, there's a new $140 fine for that as of 2012, the bureau announced.

The increase comes as Portland's Bureau of Transportation, which shares revenue from parking tickets with the state via Multnomah County Circuit Court, struggles to deal with a budget problem caused by lower-than-projected revenue and increased spending on long-term projects such as the Sellwood Bridge replacement, the eastside streetcar and MAX to Milwaukie. Portland collects 40 percent of all parking ticket revenue, while the court passes the rest to the state. Last year that meant about $5 million for the Portland Bureau of Transportation.

Parking tickets cost Portlanders only $24 in 2009. Portland officials say parking tickets cost an average of $40.11 in Cincinnati, Denver, Long Beach, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, Seattle and Tacoma .

Parking meter rates, currently set at $1.60 an hour, can only be increased by a vote of the Portland City Council.



Clarification: This article reflects a clarification published Dec. 23. An earlier version of this post said the court system keeps 60 percent of the revenue. It passes 60 percent of the revenue to the state.
