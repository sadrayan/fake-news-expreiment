Rep. Frank:

Good afternoon. I write with urgency on behalf of the fact-checking PolitiFact Texas project where we're gauging the accuracy of a Saturday claim, at an Austin rally, by Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O'Rourke. O'Rourke said that in Texas, "you can be too gay to adopt" a foster child "who needs a loving home."

To our inquiry, Chris Evans of O'Rourke's campaign later told us that O'Rourke was referring to the law set in place in 2017 by House Bill 3859, which you authored, we see.

Our questions for you:

Did O'Rourke make an accurate claim?

Why or why not?

Anything left out?

Any other recommended experts?

For all our fact-checks, we rely on attributable on-the-record information. We hope to complete this fact-check by 2 p.m. Wednesday. I would be happy to hear from you by email or by phone. I am at ...

I also am pasting below information from the response sent to us by Evans.

Thanks,

PASTE:

HB 3859 made it legal in Texas to deny an adoption to someone because of their sexual orientation. Under the law, foster care agencies in Texas are free to exclude same-sex couples from adoptions or discriminate against prospective parents based on their sexual orientation.

HB 3859 was signed into law by Governor Abbott on June 15, 2017. This at a time when there are around 30,000 kids in Texas's foster care system.

From the Texas Tribune:

"Faith-based adoption agencies in Texas would be able to reject prospective parents on religious grounds under a bill the state House approved Tuesday"

From CNN:

"They would have liked to adopt domestically, but state-funded agencies in Texas, where they live, are free to exclude same-sex couples."

“Representative O’Rourke’s characterization of Texas prohibiting adoption of foster children by same sex couples is completely false. Texas law welcomes same sex couples to provide foster or adoptive homes. I am disappointed that Rep. O’Rourke is so unfamiliar with his own state’s CPS system that he is not aware of the great work that many in the LGBT community are already doing in Texas.

If he is referring to legislation that I carried in the 85th session to protect the ability of faith-based organizations to continue to serve children in our state, then he sorely misunderstands what the legislation actually does.

I introduced House Bill 3859 to ensure that Texas will continue to have a diverse range of foster care providers. Many children in the system rely on organizations and foster families that are trained and verified by faith-based groups. These groups have been threatened by legal action for simply following their religious beliefs. We see this happening now in Philadelphia, where the city ceased all foster-care placements through Catholic Social Services due to the Church’s teaching on marriage.

Nothing in HB 3859 would stop a same sex couple from adopting or serving as foster parents in Texas. In fact, a there is a specific provision of the law that requires the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services ensure child welfare services providers are available to offer services that a faith-based provider declines to provide.

There are existing providers today who place children in same sex households or who assist foster children in accessing services (such as contraception) that, for religious reasons, a faith organization might decline to provide.

Thus, this law ensures that providers of every stripe are free to serve children without fear of having to shut down due to legal actions.

We need all-hands on-deck to help provide safe and loving homes to children, especially children who are legally free to be adopted. I applaud anyone willing to do this work and serve children.”

James
