Czech president wants international action against terrorism
PRAGUE (AP) â€” Czech President Milos Zeman has called for a concerted international military effort against terrorism and the Islamic State group.

Zeman says it should led by the U.N. Security Council. He says, "You don't negotiate with terrorists, you fight terrorists."

Zeman made the remarks Tuesday at an international conference in Prague on measures to be taken to stop the rising hatred of Jews and honor the victims of the Holocaust.

The Czech president says such military action would prevent what he called a "super Holocaust," in which hundreds of millions would die.

The Czech leader said Islamic State is a major threat that reminds him of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.
