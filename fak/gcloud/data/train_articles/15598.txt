In cases of rape and incest, Greg Abbott believes the first thing we should do is provide compassion and support for victims. That’s what he has done as Attorney General. He created new units to put sexual assault offenders behind bars and has gone after the criminals who commit these heinous crimes.

As Governor, Greg Abbott will promote a culture of life that supports the life and health of both mothers and children, and he believes that HB2 does more than ever before to achieve that goal. Under HB2, which Greg Abbott supports, a woman has five months to make a very difficult decision – including in cases of rape and incest.

Regarding your question about Matt Mackowiak, he’s never been paid or employed by the campaign. Moreover, I’d refer you directly to him, as he has sent a statement to other news outlets about this.

Best,

Amelia Chasse
