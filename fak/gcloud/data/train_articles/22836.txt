Reliance on property taxes varies not only among states, but within states as well. For example, in Georgia, where the median property tax bill is relatively low, median property tax paid ranges from $427 in Webster County (near the Alabama border) to $2,661 in Fulton County (a suburb of Atlanta). This is typical among states – higher median payments tend to be concentrated in urban areas. This is partly due to the prevalence of above average home prices in urban cities. Property taxes are assessed as a percentage of home values, so it follows that higher property taxes are paid where housing prices are higher than average.
