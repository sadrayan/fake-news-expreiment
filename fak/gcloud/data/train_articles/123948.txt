Aretha Franklin Throws Legendary Shade At Patti Labelle During White House Visit
Soul queens Aretha Franklin and Patti Labelle stood in the same room last week, as both were invited to perform for an audience at the White House for the latest In Performance At the White House, celebrating Women of Soul.

Yes, these reigning divas may have been in the same room, but that does not mean they had to acknowledge each other’s presence. In the clip below, watch Aretha Franklin enter the room to a standing ovation and throw the most legendary shade of all, snatching her hand away from the outward reach of Miss Patti Labelle.

This makes anything Beyonce has ever done to Kelly look like child’s play. Truly epic.

According to Madame Noire, they eventually embraced:

While Aretha shut down the concert with an amazing performance, Patti sang along to Franklin’s song “I Never Loved A Man” and afterward Aretha greeted Patti with a big hug (perhaps the Lord spoke to her while she sang).

Snatched!
