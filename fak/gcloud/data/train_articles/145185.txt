Parent of Pueblo steel mill sold to Russian firm
Portland-based Oregon Steel Mills Inc., owner of Rocky Mountain Steel Mills in Pueblo, announced Monday it has agreed to be acquired by Russian steelmaker Evraz Group SA.

The deal was valued at $2.3 billion.

Rocky Mountain Steel employs roughly 1,000 workers.

The mill announced last week that it is considering building a new rail mill, which would be the first in the nation capable of making rails up to 480 feet long.

Representatives of Rocky Mountain Steel declined comment Monday.

“The acquisition is something we are concerned about in that it could affect our members, our community and our contract,” said Randy Padilla, president of United Steel Workers of America, Local 2102 in Pueblo. “But we think everything is going to work out all right.”

Oregon Steel will maintain its Portland headquarters and no significant staff changes are expected, president and chief executive Jim Declusin said in a statement.

The acquisition “will provide us … additional financial resources, needed to compete in new and growing markets,” he said.

Evraz Group made the bid of $63.25 a share in cash for Oregon Steel to gain a foothold in the U.S. and create the world’s largest producer of rail tracks and wheels, the companies said in a joint statement.

Oregon Steel’s stock closed at $63.77 Monday, up $4.81.
