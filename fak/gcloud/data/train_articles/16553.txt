Emails, Adam Shaivitz, public information officer, Government & Strategic Communications Division, Texas Department of Motor Vehicles, Jan. 3-10, 2018

The following information is from Bryan Wilson, the director of the Auto Burglary and Theft Prevention Authority (ABTPA):

Issue #1 – Vehicles Stolen Each Year

All law enforcement agencies provide data to the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). DPS compiles that information in the Crime in Texas Annual Report. ABTPA has summarized the following tables from the DPS reports:

Issue #2 – Keys Left in Vehicles Contribute to Vehicle Theft

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) websites repeatedly report that nearly half of vehicle theft is due to factors such as leaving keys in the vehicle. NHTSA’s Vehicle Theft Prevention: What Consumers Should Know publication includes a statement that “40-50% of vehicle theft is due to driver error, which includes leaving vehicle doors unlocked and leaving keys in the ignition or on the seats.” (See Attached PDF.)

The Maryland Vehicle Theft Prevention Council has also reported that 50% of stolen vehicles in the United States “had the keys inside the vehicle.” (See Attached PDF.)

In October 2016, The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) published a report which analyzed the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) vehicle theft data to better understand cases in which the vehicle’s key was used to steal the vehicle. NICB’s data only covers insured vehicles, which would not be equal to the total number of vehicles reported stolen in a state. According to the report, Texas has the second highest number of vehicle thefts with keys—behind only California—with 11,003 thefts with keys reported. 11,000 vehicles would make up a high percentage of the total number of insured stolen vehicles. (See Attached PDF.)

Beyond this, ABTPA regularly collects data from local grant recipients that generally support statements about the frequency of keys left in the vehicle as a contributor to vehicle theft. For example, more than two thirds of Task Force Commanders reported that victim assisted crimes such as keys left in or near the car were major contributors to motor vehicle crimes in the ABTPA 2016 year-end report.

Got it.

Correct me if I misread, but it appears that you haven’t provided data showing that nearly half of stolen Texas cars each year were left with the keys in the vehicle.

Dividing the 11,003 such insured vehicles tallied in the cited 2016 study by the 200,503 Texas vehicles stolen in the study’s 2013-15 time period suggests a lower keys-in-vehicle incidence of 5.5 percent though the study doesn’t appear to offer an alternate figure limited to stolen insured vehicles.

If the authority has no Texas-specific break-out, how did it arrive at the “nearly half” formulation about Texas for “each year?”

Any other recommended authorities who could speak to the basis of this claim? Perhaps there’s another yet-to-be specified entity or agency that has such numbers.

Thanks again,

The consumer protection information about the number of thefts with keys in the vehicle is based on NHTSA materials as well as what local jurisdictions indicate. Here’s a recent example from the city of Kyle:

You may wish to speak with some of the major law enforcement agencies across the state as they are the ones handling the investigations.

Thanks,

How did the authority reach its precise conclusion?

Bryan Wilson (ABTPA director) is out again today, but he did provide me with this additional detail via email:

People who leave their keys in their car that ends up stolen face one of two serious consequences: loss of insurance coverage through damage waivers and/or criminal investigation for insurance fraud. Therefore people are not always forthcoming about the status and location of their keys. There has not been a system wide science-based empirical study to measure the sometimes surreptitious activity of leaving keys in the car or doors unlocked.

The percent that we provide is based on: 1) the federal government information; 2) a review of other entities’ information indicating that they report about half of the vehicles stolen have keys left in or near the car; and our local Taskforce commanders indicating that keys left in cars and doors unlocked are major contributing factors in motor vehicle crimes.

We have limited unofficial non-scientific information where individual Taskforces set out to measure the rate locally and found half or over half involved keys left in the car. Studies like this are limited in duration and scientific method.

We recognize that the sentence “Almost half of all vehicles stolen had the keys left inside” that was on the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles (TxDMV) website may have caused some confusion as to whether this referred to the entire state. The website has been updated. The Auto Burglary and Theft Prevention Authority (ABTPA) based this statement on the previous information provided to you as well as direct information from auto theft task force commanders in various jurisdictions. ABTPA’s goal is to combat vehicle theft and burglary through enforcement, prevention, public information and education initiatives in collaboration with a statewide network of law enforcement groups, prosecutors, the insurance industry, tax assessor-collectors and concerned citizens. Sharing consumer protection tips such as reminding Texans to lock their doors, not leave their keys in their vehicles and not leave valuables in view in their cars is an important part of ABTPA’s efforts. ABTPA will continue working with its industry partners to provide the most up-to-date and accurate information to help protect Texas consumers.

I don’t know of a specific report, but our statistics in Austin for each month are usually between 50% and 60%. We just ran them for December and it was 51% here in Austin.

OK.

I need to emphasize that we seek only information extant at the time the claim was made. It looks to me like some fresh research might be occurring. It wouldn’t be fair to judge the accuracy of a claim based on information not available when the claim was made.

ABTPA was already reviewing grantees’ 2017 data. More than half of the grantees stated that a major factor in vehicle burglary and theft cases is people leaving their vehicles unsecured and leaving keys in the interior, although they don’t all report percentages. In addition to Amarillo and Austin , here are a couple of others that reported percentages:

City of Paris states that 80% to 90% of stolen vehicles are due to keys inside or available

Potter County states that 90% of vehicles are stolen with keys

254 counties; more information forthcoming?

No. The reporting is limited to the 24 jurisdictions that receive grant funding through ABTPA.

Jan. 10, 2018

ABTPA provided this additional information regarding the percentage of thefts with keys left in the vehicle:

Victoria PD tracks their reports to extract this information. They reported 69% last quarter. They have it going back for quite some time and believe without running years’ worth of reporting it is almost always over 50%.
