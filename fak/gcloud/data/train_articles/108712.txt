UPDATE: #Charlottesville Driver Who Struck Crowd In Custody—Stay Tuned
Neither Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas or Virginia Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran have provided a name for the suspect who plowed into antifa and other leftist protesters in Charlottesville as they marched against the “Unite The Right” rally. The original report on a suspect has been retracted.

Using internet sleuthing GotNews examined evidence suggesting 16-year-old Joel Vangeheluwe had driven the car in the fatal crash. Vangeheluwe vehemently denied on Facebook he was not the driver.

Because police have not identified the suspect, GotNews has retracted the article. GotNews regrets the error and apologizes to Joel Vangeheluwe and his family.
