PFLUGERVILLE, Texas – During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Adam Sandler took a moment to praise Pflugerville, Texas residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:

“We were just leaving the city limits of Pflugerville, Texas when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that I’m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, ‘Sure, what the hell.’ So we drove to the finest dining spot in Pflugerville – some place called Mama Jacks – and get a burger. Great freakin’ burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

I’m telling you, these people in Pflugerville are the real deal. I’m gonna move there after I retire, ” Sandler said with a laugh.

Sandler added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Pflugerville. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”
