'LOVE TRUMPS HATE': Leftists Attack Trump Supporter Whose Daughter Was Killed In Shooting
On Thursday, one day after the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, intolerant and hateful leftists attacked a man whose daughter was murdered in the shooting because he is a Trump supporter.

The attack happened on Twitter when journalist Alexandra Seltzer, who writes for the Palm Beach Post, tweeted out a photo of Andrew Pollack holding up a photo of his daughter on his phone while he was wearing a "Trump 2020" t-shirt.

Here is Andrew Pollack yesterday showing a photo of his daughter Meadow. At that time he was searching for her. Today he said “she’s gone.” #stonemanshooting pic.twitter.com/MJcuCNttt8 — Alexandra Seltzer (@alexseltzer) February 15, 2018

It only took a few minutes for the peaceful, tolerant, loving leftists to come out of the woodwork and attack this man because of his political views, despite being in the midst of heartbreaking tragedy.
