June 28, 2011 - Age, Religious Gap In New York Gay Marriage Approval, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Voters Back Cuomo Plan To Get Tough On Texters



Word format



New York State voters support 54 - 40 percent a law allowing same-sex couples to marry, with voters under 35 supporting the measure 70 - 26 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Voters 35 to 64 years old also support the measure, while voters over 65 oppose it 57 - 37 percent. Support remained consistent before and after passage of the bill.





White Catholics split 48 - 48 percent on same-sex marriage. Jews support it 67 - 30 percent, while white Protestants oppose the measure 54 - 40 percent, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. Voters who say they have no religion support the measure 78 - 17 percent.





Voters split 47 - 46 percent on whether a same-sex marriage bill will pressure religious groups to perform such marriages. There will be pressure, white Protestants say 52 - 39 percent. White Catholics split 50 - 48 percent and Jews say no pressure 55 - 38 percent.





Opposition from religious leaders to same-sex marriage does not affect their attitudes on the issue, 70 percent of New York State voters say. Because of this opposition, 17 percent of white Protestants, 21 percent of white Catholics and 17 percent of Jews are less likely to support same-sex marriage.





"Throughout the down-to-the-wire drama and the narrow margin in the State Senate, voter support for same-sex marriage has been consistent," said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.





"On gay marriage, many of the people in the pews split with their bishops.





"Opponents had worried that churches might be pressured to perform same-sex marriages and a substantial number of voters think that's still a valid problem."





New York State voters support 62 - 29 percent rent regulation controlling the amount a landlord can charge a tenant. Support is 73 - 20 percent among Democrats, 48 - 42 percent among Republicans and 59 - 31 percent among independent voters.





Support ranges from 51 - 37 percent among upstate voters to 63 - 25 percent among suburban voters to 73 - 23 percent among New York City voters. Ban on Texting While Driving





Voters also support 94 - 5 percent Gov. Andrew Cuomo's proposal to ban texting or typing while driving. Support tops 90 percent among all groups, even young voters.





The appropriate penalty for someone caught texting while driving is a $100 reckless driving ticket and points on the driver's license, voters say 79 - 19 percent, again with no serious dissent.





Voters reject more severe penalties:

51 - 46 percent against suspending a texter's driver's license;

59 - 39 percent against police confiscating the smart phone, or other offending device.

"Gov. Andrew Cuomo's proposed ban on texting-while-driving is one of those apple-pie- and-motherhood things. And New Yorkers love their apple pie," Carroll said.





"When the Quinnipiac University poll first asked about banning cell phones while driving, New York State voters supported the ban 87 - 10 percent on March 29, 2001. A few months later, New York became the first state in the nation to ban the use of hand-held cell phones while driving."





New York State should have an independent commission to draw legislative district lines, 42 percent of voters say, while 34 percent want a commission that has some input from the State Legislature and 14 percent favor the current system where the State Legislature draws the lines.





"Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch got a lot of politicians to promise they'd reform how legislative district lines are drawn, but it didn't get done," Carroll said. "Actually, there's no pressure to make the fix until next year. New Yorkers still want some reform 5 -1.





"Wait until next year - or a special session."





From June 20 - 26, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,317 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.7 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones.
