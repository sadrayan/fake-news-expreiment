Data and Facts

Of the approx. 30,000 known diseases, over 7,000 number among the "rare diseases". According to the definition used in Europe, a disease is "rare" if less than 2,000 people suffer from it. Taken together, these diseases certainly do not represent a rare phenomenon. In Germany alone, several million people are affected. The illnesses are frequently severe and require expensive treatment and care. They are a heavy burden on the patients and their families and often lead to early death during childhood or adolescence. Rare diseases are a heterogenous group of very different disease forms. They are most frequently caused by genetic errors. Rare diseases manifest themselves in nearly all organs and often have a systemic character, i.e. they affect multiple organs at the same time. Due to the low number of patients who suffer from an individual rare disease, a number of fundamental structural problems exist. Significant deficits in diagnostics and therapy sometimes exist in the patient care. Diseases often affect multiple organ systems, making necessary interdisciplinary therapies that only a few specialised centres can provide. An effective causal therapy is not available in many cases and can only be developed once the actual causes of the disease have been explained. This is the case for only a few rare diseases. The main problem remains that the rarer the disease, the more difficult it is to perform systematic research. The interlinking of basic research with clinical research is therefore particularly essential for rare diseases.
