Video Shows Angry Driver Mows Down Protesters Blocking Highway | The …
At some point, most Americans will crack.

The protests, the demonstrations, the riots. It all becomes too much.

Blocking the road, chanting “F**k the Police!” and “Shut This Sh*t Down!” It’s offensive, vulgar and accomplishes nothing.

You can see protesters in this undated and unknown video (posted by the Facebook group “ Trump Supporters ”) blocking a highway. It looks like a protest in Brazil. It’s unknown what they’re protesting, but one can take a good guess. You can see what looks like a black flag waving.

At some point, one frustrated driver approaches the crowd, who descends on the car, seeming to try to push it away.

The driver then backs up for a second and floors it … running over several protesters in the process. At least one of them lies motionless on the highway.

We may learn more about this video soon but one thing is for sure.

Things are getting out of control.
