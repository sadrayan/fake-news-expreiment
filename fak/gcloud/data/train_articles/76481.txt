JAY Z and Justin Timberlake Dedicate "Forever Young" to Trayvon Martin at Concert
The "Suit & Tie" duo saved the last song of their concert for the tribute, with JAY Z and Timberlake performing a rendition of "Forever Young" in honor of the late teen.

"This is for Trayvon, so light up your cell phones New York!," JAY Z yelled, with Timberlake adding, "One more time for Trayvon New York!"

In addition to their tribute, the pair brought along a couple of surprise performers, with Alicia Keys popping up during JAY Z's performance of "Empire State of Mind," and Timbaland hitting the stage for Timberlake's "SexyBack."
