Calling Christie's bluff on women's health care: Editorial
A group of female legislators is again asking Gov. Chris Christie to restore $7.5 million for women’s health that he cut from the state budget. Perfect timing. If the governor vetoes this funding — for the fifth time — what will his argument be now?

We can’t afford it?

Please. Nobody can forget the millions more he just decided to blow on the special election — just three weeks before his general election — to fill the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg’s seat.

Christie doesn’t want to share the same ballot as Democratic favorite Cory Booker, the Newark mayor who could increase his party’s turnout, because Christie wants to win by an even bigger margin to enhance his image for the 2016 presidential campaign. So he’s spending $12 million for utterly selfish reasons.

The $7.5 million, on the other hand, is a smaller amount that’s crucial to tens of thousands of uninsured women who need birth control, life-saving pap smears and breast cancer screenings, or other basic medical services.

Christie’s cuts also mean New Jersey loses generous federal matching funds, compounding the damage.

But this was always about ideology, not economics. The money goes to clinics that also perform abortions, though it can’t be used for abortions. So Christie is pandering to conservatives at the expense of women’s health.

As a result, family planning clinics saw at least 33,000 fewer patients last year than in 2009 — a 24 percent drop. The number of clinical breast exams fell more than 30 percent. Six clinics closed, and others had to cut back on hours or increase waiting periods. Fewer regular checkups mean higher health care costs in the future.

Yesterday, Democratic bills that would restore this cut and the federal matching funds were approved by an Assembly committee. If the governor is planning yet another veto, can he still look New Jersey’s women in the face and claim we can’t afford it?
