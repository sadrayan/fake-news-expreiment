New York City [ edit ]

The New York City Transit Police and the New York City Housing Authority Police were merged into the NYPD in 1995, the Brooklyn Police Department and the Long Island City Police Department in 1898 and the Town of Morrisania Police Department in 1879.

Each of the five counties of New York City — New York (Manhattan), Bronx, Richmond (Staten Island), Kings (Brooklyn) and Queens — had a county sheriff's office. In 1942 they were merged to form the New York City Sheriff's Office. In 1939, the corrections part of the each county sheriff's office separated and became the consolidated New York City Department of Correction.
