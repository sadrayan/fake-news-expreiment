Moscow Microwaves
At least the main outlines of what might be called the Case of the Moscow Microwaves have finally emerged. For at least fifteen years the United States Embassy in Moscow has been systematically Irradiated by microwaves generated in equipment installed nearby by Soviet intelligence agencies. The objectives of this bombardment presumably were to eavesdrop on conversations in the embassy and to attempt jamming electronic monitoring equipment installed in and on the embassy. The United States State Department knew about this irradiation and protested from time to time, but the facts were kept secret from both the American public and most of the people In the embassy complex.

What has changed now is that the facts have become public, apparently in large part because one or more American physicians assigned to Moscow insisted that their duty to their patients required precedence over the State Department's security rules. The immediate question in need of answer involves what injury to the health of Americans assigned to Moscow resulted from this long‐term systematic bombardment. But, apparently still motivated by its slogan of “detente at any cost,” the State Department seems to hope the whole issue will go away and people will stop asking embarrassing questions.

However, the American Embassy in Moscow American territory to which this country's strict laws governing occupational safety and health apply. The mere fact of past secrecy has opened the State Department to suits from present and forms embassy employees who may have evidence that their health was injured by the microwaves, Even in the absence of damage claims, Secretary of State Kissinger and his colleagues will he well advised to demand that Moscow cease microwave bombardment completely. The alternative might he either total evacuation from Moscow of the American Embassy staff or the institution of retaliatory microwave bombardment of Soviet diplomatic installations in this country.
