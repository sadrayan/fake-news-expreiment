WIC Program Was Originally Started by The Black Panther Party
Back in the 1960’s, The Black Panther Party was a controversial group, as they remain today. People seem to forget the good deeds the Panther Party was able to accomplish despite all odds against them. The Women, Infant and Children program, (WIC), was a direct result of The Panther Parties charity.

As Forest Parks of Urban Intellectuals reported:

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a federal assistance program of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for healthcare and nutrition of low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and infants and children under the age of five. Their mission is to be a partner with other services that are key to childhood and family well-being.

That’s the definition of the program that basically tries to provide instant assistance to help children stay nourished.

The program is incredibly important and still runs today, it was started somewhere in the late 60s to early 70s. A meme has been circulating stating that this was started by the Black Panther Party, however some places are contesting this. BUT there is some evidence to substantiate this claim.

The NWICA (https://www.nwica.org/overview-and-history) gives an overview of it’s history but the Panther’s involvement is missing. However a list published by Stanford clearly states that it was one of the “Black Panther Party Community Programs

1966 – 1982”. The list can be found here: http://web.stanford.edu/group/blackpanthers/programs.shtml
