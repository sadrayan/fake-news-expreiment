About InsideClimate News
InsideClimate News is an independent, not-for-profit, non-partisan news organization that covers clean energy, carbon energy, nuclear energy and environmental scienceâ€”plus the territory in between where law, policy and public opinion are shaped.

We are staffed by professional journalists, many of whom bring decades of experience from leading media organizations in the nation, including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, ProPublica, Los Angeles Times, Bloomberg News and Frontline. We have earned national recognition for our work and many of the most prestigious awards in journalism, including the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.

Founded in 2007, InsideClimate News is incorporated in the state of New York and is a 501 C3 tax exempt organization operating with IRS approval as a public charity. It is governed by a Board of Directors and guided by best practices in non-profit management.
