Perry is a Coward
After enjoying a record 10 years as governor, Rick Perry travels from one campaign stop to the next, spinning the yarn that everything’s A-Okay in Texas.

Don’t believe him. Rick Perry is a savvy, 25-year career politician. He sticks to friendly audiences full of handpicked supporters, because he can’t peddle his hype to a group of real, struggling Texas families. He’d rather hide out in his $10,000-a-month, taxpayer-funded rental mansion than defend his miserable record.

What he brags about most is balancing the Texas budget. He always fails to mention, however, his letter to President Obama accepting his $16 billion share of Washington D.C. stimulus money to fill the gaping hole in his last budget.i If Perry hadn’t begged for stimulus money, Texas might be in as bad a shape as California.

And since he took the stimulus money and ran, we have watched government-related jobs shoot upii, while private sector job losses have left us stuck in an even deeper ditchiii. Perry won’t tell you that the Texas unemployment rate has even growniv more than the nation’s as a whole.

Now, with his new, record-setting, $21 billion budget hole, Perry’s really outdone himselfv. And he won’t have President Obama’s stimulus money to come to his rescue this time around.
