AS 43.55



Description



Alaska levies an annual tax on oil and gas produced in the state. The tax is based on the net value of oil and gas, which is the value at the point of production multiplied by the taxable volume, less all lease expenditures allowed under AS 43.55.165. Lease expenditures include certain qualified capital and operating expenditures.



House Bill 111, passed in 2017 during the second special session of the 30th Alaska Legislature, is the most recent amendment to the Oil and Gas Production tax statutes under Alaska Statute 43.55. Most provisions of HB 111 take effect on Jan. 1, 2018, with some retroactivity to July 1, 2017.



Rate



The current tax rate oil and gas production is 35% of the production tax value, however, certain categories of oil and gas production are subject to either tax limitations or floors.



Production subject to tax limitations:



The levy of tax on gas production from the Cook Inlet Sedimentary Basin may not exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the average rate of tax that imposed on each lease or property during the 12-month period beginning April 1, 2005, through March 31, 2006, times the taxable volumes produced during the year.





For Cook Inlet leases or properties that commenced gas production after March 31, 2006, the levy of tax may not exceed the amount derived by multiplying the annual gas volumes produced by 17.7 cents per million cubic feet (mcf).





The production tax levied on oil produced in the Cook Inlet Sedimentary Basin may not exceed $1.00 per barrel.





The production tax levied on oil or gas produced from leases and properties in the state outside the Cook Inlet Sedimentary Basin and that do not include lands north of 68 degrees north latitude, may not exceed 4% of the gross value of the oil or gas at the point of production.





For gas produced from leases or properties north of 68 degrees north latitude, that is used in-state, the levy of tax may not exceed the amount derived by multiplying the annual gas volumes produced by 17.7 cents per mcf.



Production subject to tax floor:



The tax levied on oil and gas produced from leases and properties that include land north of 68 degrees north latitude, other than gas used in state, may not be less than 4%, or 3% or 2% or 1% or zero of the gross value at the point of production of the oil or gas, based on the average price per barrel of North Slope crude on the U.S. West Coast during the year.

Returns



Taxpayers are required to report all values, volumes, transportation costs, expenditures, and credits used to calculate their estimated monthly installment payments in the monthly report. The monthly reports are due the last day of the month following the month of activity.



Annually, on March 31, taxpayers submit an annual tax return that also “trues up” any tax liabilities or overpayments made throughout the year.



Exemptions



The tax on oil and gas is levied on all production except for state and federal royalty production. Oil and gas used on a lease or property for drilling, production or repressuring is not taxed.



Credits



The following credits are available for use against the liability of this specific tax: Alternative Credit for Exploration, Carried-Forward Annual Loss, Cook Inlet Jack-Up Rig, Education, Exploration Incentive, Exploration Incentive (Assignable), Film Production, New Area Development, Qualified Capital Expenditure, Small Producer, Transitional Investment Expenditure, and Well Lease Expenditure tax credits. Some of these credits may also be redeemed by the State of Alaska for cash. For specific information concerning these credits, see the Oil and Gas Production Credits section below.



Disposition of Revenue



All revenue derived from the oil and gas production tax is deposited in the General Fund, except that payments received as a consequence of an assessment or litigation are deposited in the Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund (CBRF).



History



1955 – The Territorial Legislature enacts an oil and gas production tax of 1% of production value.



1967 – A 1% disaster production tax is enacted to provide relief after the Fairbanks flood.



1968 – The Alaska Legislature increases oil and gas production tax from 1% to 3% of production value.



1970 – The Legislature repeals the disaster oil and gas production tax. The Legislature changes the oil production tax to a graduated tax with rates of 3% on the first 300 barrels per day per well, 5% on the next 700 barrels per day per well, 6% on the next 1,500 barrels per day per well and 8% on production exceeding 2,500 barrels per day per well.



1972 – The Legislature establishes a minimum oil production tax based on “cents per barrel” equivalent to percent of value tax on oil with wellhead value of $2.65 per barrel.



1973 – The Legislature revises the “stair step” rate schedule to lower production levels. The Legislature indexes the cents per barrel minimum to the wholesale price index for crude oil published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.



1977 – The Legislature raises the nominal gas production tax rate to 10%. The Legislature raises the nominal oil production tax rate to 12.25% and adopts the oil and gas economic limit factors.



1981 – As part of legislation that repeals the separate accounting oil and gas corporation income tax, the nominal tax rate on oil produced prior to 1981 is raised to 15%, and fields coming into production after 1981 are taxed at 12.25% for five years after which the rate increases to 15%. The oil economic limit factor is now subject to a rounding rule so that if the calculated factor is greater than or equal to 0.7 during the first 10 years of production, the factor is set to 1.0.



1989 – The Legislature changes the economic limit factor for oil production taxes to include a field size factor in the formula, fixes the production at the economic limit (not rebuttable) at 300 barrels per well per day, and drops the rounding rule. The Legislature fixes production at the economic limit for gas production at 3,000 mcf per well per day.



2002 – The Legislature authorizes credits of up to 50% for contributions of not more than $100,000 to the Alaska Veterans’ Memorial Endowment Fund, and 75% of the next $100,000 in contributions to the endowment fund. The tax credit expires July 1, 2003.



2003 – To encourage drilling for oil and gas within the state, AS 43.55.025 provides a new tax credit for exploration costs. The minimum credit is 20% for qualified expenditures, and the maximum is 40%.



2005 – Prudhoe Bay area oil fields are aggregated for purposes of calculating the economic limit factor, effective Feb. 1, 2005.



– To expand the tax credit for exploration enacted the previous year, the deadline is extended until July 1, 2010, for qualifying work south of the Brooks Range (for instance, non-North Slope). New rules also change the 3-mile and 25-mile rules for the Cook Inlet, allowing closer distances between potential exploration targets and existing wells and production units.



– The Legislature extends and amends the requirements applicable to the credit that may be claimed for certain oil and gas exploration expenses incurred in Cook Inlet against oil and gas production taxes. This legislation also amends the credit against those taxes for certain exploration expenditures from leases or properties in the state. The legislation is signed into law July 21, 2005, with an immediate effective date.



2006 – In August 2006, legislation is passed during a special session that makes sweeping revisions to the oil and gas production tax. The Petroleum Production Tax (PPT) establishes new tax rates on oil and gas production; repeals the economic limit factor; and provides numerous credits for certain qualifying expenditures and taxpayers.



2007 – The Legislature amends the PPT legislation in a special session that ends in November 2007. Like the PPT legislation enacted in 2006, the Alaska’s Clear and Equitable Share (ACES) tax is levied on the production tax value of oil and gas produced in the state. The base tax rate under ACES is 25% (it was 22.5% under PPT), and the progressive surcharge tax rate under ACES is 0.4% for every dollar the production tax value per barrel exceeds $30 (it was 0.25% on production tax values exceeding $40 per barrel under PPT). For production tax values greater than $92.50 per barrel, the progressivity rate changes to 0.1% for every additional dollar of production tax value.



2008 – The Legislature amends the Education Credit provisions to include cash contributions accepted for secondary-level vocational courses and programs by a school district in Alaska and by a state-operated vocational technical education and training school.



– The Alternative Credit for Exploration is increased from 20% to 30% for certain projects, and an Oil and Gas Tax Credit Fund is established for the cash purchases of tax credit certificates.



2010 – The Legislature amends the alternative tax credit provisions to add tax credits for drilling exploration wells using a jack-up rig in the Cook Inlet. The first three unaffiliated persons drilling wells that penetrate and evaluate prospects in the pre-Tertiary zone are entitled to credits of 100%, 90% or 80%, respectively, of the first $25 million of exploration expenditures. Other changes include a new 40% tax credit for well lease expenditures incurred south of 68 degrees north latitude, the elimination of the splitting of tax credits for lease expenditures incurred in the state south of 68 degrees north latitude after June 30, 2010, and the elimination of the future investment requirement for the purchase of transferable tax credit certificates by the state.



– The Legislature amends the Education Credit by increasing the maximum credit allowed from $150,000 to $5 million effective Jan. 1, 2011. In addition, the Legislature expands contributions eligible for the credit to include contributions made for construction and maintenance of facilities by state-operated vocational education schools and two- or four-year colleges. The increase in the credit from $150,000 to $5 million expires Dec. 31, 2013. The maximum credit allowed is to revert to $150,000 on Jan. 1, 2014. That date was extended in 2011 (see below).



2011 – The Legislature enacts legislation extending the date that the $5 million annual Education Credit limit expires from Jan. 1, 2014, to Jan. 1, 2021. It is then scheduled to return to $150,000. In addition, the Legislature expands contributions eligible for the credit to include contributions made after June 30, 2011, to annual intercollegiate sports tournaments, Alaska Native cultural or heritage programs for public school staff and students, and a facility in the state that qualifies as a coastal ecosystem learning center under the Coastal American Partnership.



2012 – The Legislature enacts legislation that establishes a Corporate Income Tax Credit for a liquefied natural gas storage facility to be paid out of the Oil and Gas Credit Fund. Also, it established a limitation on tax for oil and gas produced from leases or properties outside the Cook Inlet Sedimentary Basin that do not include land north of 68 degrees north latitude. The tax limitation is set to expire in 2022. Further, Exploration Tax Credits are established for drilling of exploration wells and seismic exploration expenditures in specific areas. These are referred to as the Middle Earth Basin Credits.



2013 – On May 21, 2013, Senate Bill 21 was signed into law. Major provisions of the law:



The production tax rate is amended to 35% of the annual Production Tax Value (PTV) in AS 43.55.011(e), and the progressivity index under AS 43.55.011(g) is eliminated, effective Jan. 1, 2014.





The law establishes AS 43.55.160(f), which defines production subject to the Gross Value Reduction (GVR). The GVR is 20% of the Gross Value at the Point of Production (GVPP) for production that qualifies.





The law establishes AS 43.55.160(g), which is an additional 10% reduction in GVPP for lease or properties qualifying under AS 43.55.160(f), for all leases having a greater than 12.5% royalty.





The law eliminates credits for qualified capital expenditures incurred after Dec. 31, 2013, for expenditures incurred on the North Slope. Credits for qualified capital expenditures incurred south of 68 degrees north latitude remain.





The law changes the timing of applicability of credits so that 100% of credits based on expenditures incurred north of 68 degrees north latitude after Jan. 1, 2013, are available for immediate use.





Carried-Forward Annual Loss Credits incurred north of 68 degrees north latitude increase to 45% of excess lease expenditures beginning Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 31, 2015, and decrease to 35% of excess lease expenditures beginning Jan. 1, 2016. The credit for annual losses incurred south of 68 degrees north latitude remains at 25%.





The law establishes new non-transferable tax credits based on oil production for lease or properties north of 68 degrees north latitude beginning Jan. 1, 2014. AS 43.55.024(i) establishes a $5 per barrel credit for oil that qualifies for the GVR under AS 43.55.160(f). The credit ranges from $8 to $0 based on the average GVPP per barrel each month.





The sunset date for the Alternative Tax Credit for Oil and Gas Exploration is extended from July 1, 2016, to Jan. 1, 2022, in AS 43.55.025(b) for exploration wells drilled outside the Cook Inlet Sedimentary Basin and south of 68 degrees north latitude. The extension does not apply to the Basin Credits for exploration wells in AS 43.55.025(m) or the Basin Credits for seismic exploration in AS 43.55.025(n).





The sunset of the tax limitation under AS 43.55.011(p) on production from leases or properties outside the Cook Inlet Sedimentary Basin that does not include land that is north of 68 degrees north latitude is extended from 2022 to 2027.





The interest on delinquent tax liabilities is amended from 11 percent to 3 percentage points above the rate charged member banks in the 12th Federal Reserve District, and interest is no longer compounded quarterly.



2014 – The Legislature passes SB 138, which is the enabling legislation to allow the State of Alaska to participate as an equity owner in the Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas (AKLNG) project. The main objective of the AKLNG is to commercialize North Slope natural gas reserves from the Prudhoe Bay and Point Thomson fields. SB 138 establishes a framework by which the state could receive its royalty gas in kind (RIK) and production tax as gas (TAG) in lieu of receiving royalty and tax payments from the producers supplying the gas to the project.



The determination to receive the gas molecules in lieu of cash is subject to a best interest finding. The intent is that the state will receive an amount of gas that is commensurate with its equity ownership in AKLNG infrastructure. AKLNG infrastructure includes a gas treatment plant (GTP) located on the North Slope, an 800-mile natural gas pipeline and a natural gas liquefaction facility located in Nikiski. As an equity owner, and a recipient of the RIK and TAG, the State of Alaska will bear the burden of marketing and monetizing its portion of the gas.



The legislation includes several changes to the oil and gas production tax statutes, which take effect on and after Jan. 1, 2022. A summary of the significant changes are:



The production tax for gas produced on and after Jan. 1, 2022, is equal to 13% of the gross value at the point of production of the taxable gas.





The production tax on oil produced on and after Jan. 1, 2022, is 35% of the annual production tax value of the taxable oil. The production tax value of the oil taxable under AS 43.55.011(e)(3) includes the producer’s lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 for the calendar year incurred to explore for, develop, or produce oil and gas deposits in the state that includes land north of 68 degrees north latitude as adjusted under AS 43.55.170.





The minimum tax will only be applicable to oil produced on and after Jan. 1, 2022, from leases or properties that include land north of 68 degrees north latitude.





For gas produced on and after Jan. 1, 2022, a producer may make an election to pay the production tax as gas (TAG) for gas produced from oil and gas leases modified under AS 38.05.180(hh) in lieu of the tax otherwise levied for the gas by AS 43.55.011(e).



2016 – HB 247 passes in the 29th Legislature’s fourth special session, and becomes effective Jan. 1, 2017. Major provisions of HB 247:



After Dec. 31, 2016, interest on delinquent production tax is 7% plus the federal rate, compounded quarterly; after three years, the delinquent tax does not bear interest.





The Department of Revenue will publish a report of the tax credit certificates purchased each year, including the aggregate amount purchased from each person the prior year. The report will be issued annually by April 30.





The Cook Inlet gas and Gas Used In State tax ceilings are extended indefinitely.





There is a $1 per barrel tax on Cook Inlet oil.





The Cook Inlet credits for Qualified Capital Expenditures, Carried-Forward Annual Loss and Well Lease Expenditures sunset Dec. 31, 2017.





The credit for exploration wells drilled in the Frontier Basin sunsets in 2017.





The amount of cash purchases of credit certificates is limited, and the law provides for the relinquishment of credit over certain amounts.





Cash purchases of credit certificates are prioritized based on local-hire provisions, and, again, the law provides for the relinquishment of credit over certain amounts.





A cash repurchase may be withheld if the taxpayer has other obligation(s) to the State of Alaska for its oil and gas business.





The number of years that the GVR may be claimed is limited.



2017 – The Legislature passes HB 111, which makes the following amendments and changes to the Oil and Gas Production tax statutes under AS 43.55:



Amends the interest rate charged on delinquent taxes levied under AS 43.55. Delinquent oil and gas production taxes, on and after Jan. 1, 2018, bear interest at a rate of 5.25 percentage points above the annual rate charged member banks by the 12th Federal Reserve District as of the first day of the quarter, compounded quarterly as of the last day of that quarter.





Enables the use of a purchased credit certificate under AS 43.55.023, regardless of when earned, to satisfy a tax, interest, penalty, fee or other charge levied under AS 43.5.3011(e) for a prior year that has not been subject to an administrative proceeding or litigation.





Establishes July 1, 2017, as the cutoff for lease expenditures eligible for earning a transferable tax credit certificate.





Exploration production tax credits earned under AS 43.55.025, for expenditures incurred for work performed on or after July 1, 2016, can be applied against corporate income tax levied by AS 43.20.





A production tax credit certificate that is transferred, sold or conveyed under AS 43.55.025 may not be applied against the tax levied by AS 43.20.



However, a production tax credit or portion of a production tax credit or production tax certificate or portion of a production tax certificate allowed under AS 43.55.025 may be applied to satisfy a tax, interest, penalty, fee or other charge levied by AS 43.55.011(e) for a prior year that has not been subject to an administrative proceeding or litigation, or to satisfy a tax in a later calendar year.





However, a production tax credit or portion of a production tax credit or production tax certificate or portion of a production tax certificate allowed under AS 43.55.025 may be applied to satisfy a tax, interest, penalty, fee or other charge levied by AS 43.55.011(e) for a prior year that has not been subject to an administrative proceeding or litigation, or to satisfy a tax in a later calendar year. The Oil and Gas Tax Credit Fund established under AS 43.55.028 may not be used to purchase a tax credit certificate for a credit earned under AS 43.55 for activity occurring on or after July 1, 2017.





Any adjusted lease expenditures under AS 43.55.165 and AS 43.55.170 incurred to explore for, develop, or produce oil or gas from a lease or property outside the Cook Inlet Sedimentary Basin that would otherwise be deductible by a producer in a calendar year but whose deduction would cause an annual production tax value to be less than zero may be used to establish a carried-forward annual loss.





The producer’s lease expenditure for the year may include the carried-forward annual loss from a prior year.



During a calendar year in which the taxpayer is subject to the minimum tax, the maximum amount of a carried-forward annual loss that the taxpayer may include in lease expenditures is the amount that will result in a production tax value, which when multiplied by the statutory tax rate (35%), would equal the minimum tax.





During a calendar year in which the taxpayer is subject to the minimum tax, the maximum amount of a carried-forward annual loss that the taxpayer may include in lease expenditures is the amount that will result in a production tax value, which when multiplied by the statutory tax rate (35%), would equal the minimum tax. Carried-forward annual losses decrease by one-tenth of the value of the preceding year each year beginning Jan. 1 of the 11th year after the lease expenditure is carried forward if the lease or property did not commence regular production of oil or gas before or during the year the lease expenditure was incurred.





Carried-forward annual losses decrease by one-tenth of the value of the preceding year each year beginning Jan. 1 of the eighth year after the lease expenditure is carried forward if the lease or property commenced regular production of oil or gas before or during the year the lease expenditure was incurred.

The monthly reports are due the last day of the month following the month of activity.Annually, on March 31, taxpayers submit an annual tax return that also “trues up” any tax liabilities or overpayments made throughout the year.The tax on oil and gas is levied on all production except for state and federal royalty production. Oil and gas used on a lease or property for drilling, production or repressuring is not taxed.The following credits are available for use against the liability of this specific tax: Alternative Credit for Exploration, Carried-Forward Annual Loss, Cook Inlet Jack-Up Rig, Education, Exploration Incentive, Exploration Incentive (Assignable), Film Production, New Area Development, Qualified Capital Expenditure, Small Producer, Transitional Investment Expenditure, and Well Lease Expenditure tax credits. Some of these credits may also be redeemed by the State of Alaska for cash. For specific information concerning these credits, see the Oil and Gas Production Credits section below.All revenue derived from the oil and gas production tax is deposited in the General Fund, except that payments received as a consequence of an assessment or litigation are deposited in the Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund (CBRF).The Territorial Legislature enacts an oil and gas production tax of 1% of production value.A 1% disaster production tax is enacted to provide relief after the Fairbanks flood.The Alaska Legislature increases oil and gas production tax from 1% to 3% of production value.The Legislature repeals the disaster oil and gas production tax.

The oil economic limit factor is now subject to a rounding rule so that if the calculated factor is greater than or equal to 0.7 during the first 10 years of production, the factor is set to 1.0.The Legislature changes the economic limit factor for oil production taxes to include a field size factor in the formula, fixes the production at the economic limit (not rebuttable) at 300 barrels per well per day, and drops the rounding rule. The Legislature fixes production at the economic limit for gas production at 3,000 mcf per well per day.The Legislature authorizes credits of up to 50% for contributions of not more than $100,000 to the Alaska Veterans’ Memorial Endowment Fund, and 75% of the next $100,000 in contributions to the endowment fund. The tax credit expires July 1, 2003.To encourage drilling for oil and gas within the state, AS 43.55.025 provides a new tax credit for exploration costs. The minimum credit is 20% for qualified expenditures, and the maximum is 40%.Prudhoe Bay area oil fields are aggregated for purposes of calculating the economic limit factor, effective Feb. 1, 2005.To expand the tax credit for exploration enacted the previous year, the deadline is extended until July 1, 2010, for qualifying work south of the Brooks Range (for instance, non-North Slope). New rules also change the 3-mile and 25-mile rules for the Cook Inlet, allowing closer distances between potential exploration targets and existing wells and production units.The Legislature extends and amends the requirements applicable to the credit that may be claimed for certain oil and gas exploration expenses incurred in Cook Inlet against oil and gas production taxes.

In addition, the Legislature expands contributions eligible for the credit to include contributions made for construction and maintenance of facilities by state-operated vocational education schools and two- or four-year colleges. The increase in the credit from $150,000 to $5 million expires Dec. 31, 2013. The maximum credit allowed is to revert to $150,000 on Jan. 1, 2014. That date was extended in 2011 (see below).The Legislature enacts legislation extending the date that the $5 million annual Education Credit limit expires from Jan. 1, 2014, to Jan. 1, 2021. It is then scheduled to return to $150,000. In addition, the Legislature expands contributions eligible for the credit to include contributions made after June 30, 2011, to annual intercollegiate sports tournaments, Alaska Native cultural or heritage programs for public school staff and students, and a facility in the state that qualifies as a coastal ecosystem learning center under the Coastal American Partnership.The Legislature enacts legislation that establishes a Corporate Income Tax Credit for a liquefied natural gas storage facility to be paid out of the Oil and Gas Credit Fund.

Oil and Gas Production Tax Credits

Alternative Credit for Exploration – AS 43.55.025 – Taxpayers that incur qualified exploration expenditures are eligible for this credit, which is 30% (20% for work performed prior to July 1, 2008) or 40%, depending on the qualifications of the exploration project. Taxpayers must obtain pre-approval from and submit certain data to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources as part of the application process for exploration well projects. Credit applications under AS 43.55.025 are audited prior to issuance of the credit certificates. Certificates must be eventually issued, but the credit may also be applied to tax prior to the issuance of a certificate. The credit is set to expire for the North Slope and Cook Inlet areas on July 1, 2016. This credit has been available since 2003 – pre-dating the oil and gas tax law revisions of 2006 and 2007. The scope of this credit is more specific than that provided for under AS 43.55.023.







Carried-Forward Annual Loss – AS 43.55.023(b) – Taxpayers that incur lease expenditures that are not deductible in calculating production tax values generate a "loss carry-forward" and they may apply for a tax credit. The credit rate is 25% for non-North Slope losses and North Slope losses prior to Jan. 1, 2014. The carried-forward annual loss for North Slope is 45% in 2014-2015 and 35% for 2016 forward. These credits are transferable.







Cook Inlet Jack-Up Rig Credit – AS 43.55.025(a) (5) was passed by the Alaska Legislature in 2010 to incentivize investment in a jack-up rig for use in Cook Inlet. The credit is available to the first three unaffiliated persons who drill an offshore exploration well for oil or gas in Cook Inlet. Credit under this program will be granted for the lesser of 100% of exploration expenditures or $25 million to the first person who drills a qualifying well under the program. Credit for the lesser of 90% of exploration expenditures or $22.5 million is available to the second person, and credit for the lesser of 80% of exploration expenditures or $20 million is available to the third person who drills a qualifying well under the program.



Credit under this program may be granted in the form of a cash reimbursement from the state or it may be applied against tax liabilities. If the drilling under this program results in sustained production of oil or gas, 50% of the amount of the credit received shall be repaid to the state over a 10-year period.







Education – AS 43.20.014, 43.55.019, 43.56.018, 43.65.018, 43.75.018, 43.77.045 – Taxpayers are allowed a non-transferrable, non-refundable credit for cash contributions to Alaska universities and accredited nonprofit Alaska two- or four-year colleges for facilities, direct instruction, research and educational support purposes.



The tax credit can also be taken for donations to a school district or state-operated vocational technical education and training school for vocational education courses, programs and facilities. Donations for Alaska Native cultural or heritage programs for public school staff and students, and a facility in the state that qualifies as a coastal ecosystem learning center under the Coastal American Partnership also qualify. Contributions to the Alaska Higher Education Investment Fund established in 2012 qualify.



The credit is 50% of the first $100,000, 100% of the contribution over $100,000 and up to $300,000, and 50% of the remaining amount over $300,000. The total allowable credit per year for all affiliated taxpayers may not exceed $5 million.



Qualifying Education Tax Credits include cash contributions by taxpayers to a public or private nonprofit elementary or secondary school in the state, a nonprofit regional training center recognized by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, or an apprenticeship program in the state that is registered with the U.S. Department of Labor under 29 U.S.C. 50-50b for direct instruction, research and educational support purposes.



In addition, tax credits for certain taxpayers are available for cash contributions accepted for a facility by a public or private nonprofit elementary or secondary school in the state, funding for a scholarship awarded by a nonprofit organization to a dual-credit student for certain educational expenses, for a residential school in the state approved by the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development, or certain qualified childhood early learning and development programs.



Tax credits are also available for cash contributions by certain taxpayers for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs by a nonprofit agency or school district for school staff and for students in grades kindergarten through 12 in the state and for the operation of a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing educational opportunities that foster public service leadership for future generations of residents of the state.







Exploration Incentive – AS 38.05.180(i) – Lessees of state land drilling an exploratory well or conducting certain seismic exploration on that land are eligible for this credit. The credit is 50% of the cost of the exploration expenditures and may not exceed 50% of the production tax or state royalty against which it is applied. This credit is administered by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, but may be applied to oil and gas production tax.







Exploration Incentive (Assignable) – AS 41.09.010 – This is a distinct incentive program administered by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. The credit is available to be claimed against royalty obligations, corporate income tax and production tax. Taxpayers may take a credit up to 50% on state land (or 25% on non-state lands) of eligible oil and gas exploration expenditures. An approved incentive credit under this statute may not exceed $5 million per project and is limited to $30 million per taxpayer.







Film Production Credit – AS 43.98.030, AS 21.09.210, AS 21.66.110, AS 43.20, AS 43.55, AS 43.56, AS 43.65, AS 43.75 and AS 43.77 – The Film Production Tax Credit, effective July 1, 2013, is a transferable credit for expenditures on eligible film production activities in Alaska. The Alaska Legislature repealed the credit effective July 1, 2015, and the Department of Revenue stopped accepting new projects on that date. The film credits have six-year expiration dates to be used against Alaska tax liabilities; therefore, the Department of Revenue could see credits being taken until 2023 since credits were still being awarded in 2016.







Frontier Basin Credits – AS 43.55.025(a)(6) and (7) were effective Jan. 1, 2013, to provide tax credits for exploration wells and seismic projects performed after June 30, 2012, and before July 1, 2016, in certain “Frontier Basins” described in AS 43.55.025(p). These sections added credits of 80% of qualifying exploration expenditures up to $25 million for the first two wells in any single basin and 75% of qualifying seismic exploration expenditures up to $7.5 million for the first seismic project in each basin. Many requirements must be met with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources to qualify for the credits, including pre-qualifications. The credit itself may be applied against a producer’s tax liability in the year in which it was incurred and also before the certificate is issued. The credit certificate may be transferred, applied to tax liability, or cashed out with the state under AS 43.55.028 by the original applicant.







New Area Development – AS 43.55.024(a) – Taxpayers that produce in areas outside the Cook Inlet and south of 68 degrees north latitude are eligible for a tax credit of not more than $6 million per year. This credit sunsets the later of 2016 or the ninth calendar year after first year of production. The credit is not certificated and is not transferable.







Per Barrel Credits – AS 43.55.024(i) and (j) – Under AS 43.55.024(i), a $5 per barrel credit is allowed for each barrel of taxable oil produced on the North Slope that qualifies for the Gross Value Reduction (GVR) under AS 43.55.160(f) and (g). Under AS 43.55.024(j), a sliding scale credit of $1 to $8 per barrel is based on the gross value of oil, when prices are below $150 per barrel, that does not qualify for the Gross Value Reduction (GVR) under AS 43.55.160(f) and (g). These credits may be applied against a tax levied by AS 43.55.011(e). The credits are NOT transferable and are NOT available to be issued as a certificate. An unused tax credit or portion of a tax credit under this section may not be carried forward for use in a later calendar year. The credit may not be used to reduce a tax liability for any calendar year below zero.







Qualified Capital Expenditures – AS 43.55.023(a) – Taxpayers that incur qualified capital expenditures for non-North Slope activity may apply for a 20% credit. This credit, when certificated, is transferable. Taxpayers may also apply the 20% credit to their annual oil and gas production tax filings without certification.



In 2010, the Alaska Legislature passed AS 43.55.023(l), which allows credit of 40% of qualified well lease expenditures incurred south of 68 degrees north latitude for oil or gas operations. These credits can be applied against production tax liabilities, transferred to another company, or purchased by the state.







Small Producer – AS 43.55.024(c) – Taxpayers with Alaska oil and gas production less than 100,000 BTU equivalent barrels a day are eligible for a Small Producer Credit. When average oil and gas production is no more than 50,000 barrels per day, the credit is $12 million per year. When production exceeds 50,000 barrels per day, but is less than 100,000 barrels per day, the credit is allocated based on production volumes. This credit sunsets the later of 2016 or the ninth calendar year after the first year of production. The credit is not certificated and is not transferable.







Transitional Investment Expenditure – AS 43.55.023(i) – The TIE Credit is generated by qualified capital expenditures made during the period April 1, 2001, through March 31, 2006. The credit is 20% of those qualified capital expenditures, not to exceed one-tenth of qualified capital expenditures incurred after March 31, 2006, and before Jan. 1, 2008. Producers and explorers without commercial production in Alaska before Jan. 1, 2008, are eligible for this credit. The TIE Credit is not transferable and is available until 2013.
