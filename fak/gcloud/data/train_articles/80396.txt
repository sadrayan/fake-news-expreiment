INTELLIGENCE

At Intelligencia, we're all about intelligence (it is, after all, almost our name). We are apostles for the technology we love and think will have a huge impact on the world. We are also differential to the ones we believe don't deliver what they promise (Blockchain, anyone?). Unfortunately, it is sometimes hard to tell between the two. Being based in Macau, we get a unique perspective on the Chinese market and we keep our eyes and ears open for the next app or technological breakthrough that will soon be revolutionizing the world, especially the CX world. Feel free to check out our Intelligence section, as we keep it updated with the latest technological developments that, we believe, will affect our industries.
