Gang Initiation Email a Hoax
Dalton Police need to dispell a rumor about an email hoax.

They call the number of people calling concerned about an email hoax overwhelming.

The email states a supposed gang initiation that quote " involves the abduction of a white female from a parking lot, her rape and death."

Officer Chris McDonald says the email is false...there is no such initiation.

McDonald: "It's a lot of time spent trying to put down these rumors of what's going to happen and you know it really hurts the investigators and us from doing our jobs effectively."

McDonald says if such a situation were to ever take place, the police would notify the public immediately.
