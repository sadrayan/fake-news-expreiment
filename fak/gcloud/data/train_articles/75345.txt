Dalton Police Blog: DPD's Re-Certification Recognized at City Council Meeting
The Dalton Police Department's recent re-certification by the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police was recognized at Monday night's meeting of the Dalton Mayor and Council.

The Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police (GACP)is comprised of more than 1,000 executive officers from law enforcement agencies across the state. The association promotes cooperative relationships between Georgia's police agencies, and evaluates the professional standards of agencies to offer training and education for administrators. The Dalton Police Department was among the first law enforcement agencies in Georgia to be certified by the GACP in 1999, and the department recently completed its re-certification process. Certification is an exhaustive process in which agencies first complete a comprehensive self-analysis of department policy and procedures, and then have assessors from across the state perform another study of the department's standards and practices. Departments are re-certified every three years. This was Dalton's second re-certification (originally departments were re-certified every five years). Out of more than 700 law enforcement agencies in Georgia, there are currently only 93 law enforcement agencies certified by the GACP.

Frank Rotondo, the Executive Director of the GACP, presented a plaque to Dalton Police Chief Jason Parker at Monday night's meeting. Mr. Rotondo also presented a special award to Sergeant Chris Cooke who oversaw the department's re-certification effort, recognizing him as one of only "three or four top, top quality people who do assessments in this state."
