Is there anything hotter than a girl in a baseball cap?
Watching her at the mall she don't know me at all

Hope no employee over hears

Think I'm in love with you Red, Yellow, White & Blue

Seems I've been watching her for years,



It brings a smile to my face as she hops with style and grace

Way beyond 9 to 5, she's keeping hope alive - Cafe 405

I'd always keep her warm in that silly uniform

Tell her every day that she's the best

Just wanna be with her, I'd never chat on her

Wit someone at Panda Express



And nothing else makes me tick like when she's on that Pogo Stick

I wish I wasn't afraid, she's making lemonade

One day our love will arrive, so glad to be alive



I'm always flattered when my hot dog's gettin' battered

She's gettin' better at it every day

Shopping mall renegade, she's makin' lemonade
