Why The Times Did Not Publish the Stephen Miller Audio
Many of our readers have raised questions and concerns about our decision not to use audio of an interview with Stephen Miller, President Trump’s senior policy adviser, on “The Daily” on Tuesday.

The audio came from a recording of an interview Mr. Miller had given to two of our reporters, Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, on the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy at the border.

Here is the statement The Times put out explaining the background of that decision.

The Times conducted an extended White House interview with Stephen Miller for a weekend story about the Trump administration’s border policy. Miller was quoted, on the record, in that story.
