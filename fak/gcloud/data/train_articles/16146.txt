Hello again.

I wanted to make sure you all knew that that adjusting for human population differences, using U.S. Census Bureau estimates, led us to finding that Oklahoma led the 14 states with 10 such animal deaths for every 10,000 residents with Texas ranking No. 8 at nearly 2 such deaths per 10,000 residents--higher than the rates for Nevada, Virginia, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Colorado and lower than the rates for Oklahoma, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, West Virginia and Nebraska.

Any further thoughts or research tips as we evaluate the Texas-specific claim?

Thanks,

That’s an interesting per capita statistic, but HSUS wasn’t highlighting the number of animals killed per capita. Our letter highlighted the fact that Texas ranks number one in total numbers of animals killed by these cyanide bombs and we stand by our numbers, re-attached.

Best,

Carol
