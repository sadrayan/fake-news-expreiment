Liberal U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, says he’ll “probably” run for Senate in 2016, which would set up an ideologically tinged primary clash against the more centrist U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter.

Grayson appeared this morning on an online Democracy Now! program. Asked around the 46:00 mark if he’s planning to run for the seat Republican Sen. Marco Rubio is giving up to run for president, Grayson replied: “I’m giving it a lot of attention. The answer is probably yes but I haven’t made up my mind yet once and for all. I hope to do that soon.”

Outspoken liberal Grayson would offer Democratic primary voters a contrast to Murphy, who’s been elected twice to a slightly Republican-leaning House seat and has crossed the aisle to vote with Republicans to delay portions of Obamacare, loosen some Dodd-Frank regulations on Wall Street and build the Keystone pipeline.

Murphy launched a Senate campaign last month and has quickly garnered strong Democratic establishment support, including PAC contributions from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and from Montana Sen. Jon Tester, the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Murphy has also snagged endorsements from four members of Florida’s U.S. House delegation — Reps. Lois Frankel, Alcee Hastings, Ted Deutch and Frederica Wilson.
