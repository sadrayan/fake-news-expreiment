There are many differences because Dan Patrick's legislation was more narrow. Dan's bill was focused on the provision that was not found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

He said at the time he’d gone to AZ to see how the law was being carried out. It looks to me like it’s nearly identical to the show-your-papers provision there. Make sense?

Castro didn't say that dan filed the same show me your papers language as was in sb1070. Right?

Castro took it much further and said "Patrick filed Arizona-style SB 1070 show-me-your-papers legislation in Texas." Dans bill was very different from SB 1070. Castro has an element of truth to what he says but he is ignoring the important fact that there were several other provisions of SB 1070 in order to give a false impression.
