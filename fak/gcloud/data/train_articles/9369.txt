Miami-Dade Republicans pick convention delegates
@PatriciaMazzei

A strip of Northwest 60th Avenue in Miami Lakes on Saturday marked the Republican Party’s dividing line over Donald Trump’s presidential candidacy.

On the west side, set off by yellow police tape a few feet from a parked police patrol car, stood several dozen dedicated Trump volunteers, clad in colorful T-shirts, waving American flags at supportive cars that honked as they went by. “God-followers for Trump!” one woman yelled.

On the east side, inside the cramped anteroom of a cigar factory belonging to the future speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, nattily dressed GOP loyalists waited their turn to make a case for whey they should be delegates to the party’s presidential nominating convention.

There was little overlap. By the end of the day, when party leaders chose 15 delegates from Miami-Dade County's congressional districts, few seemed overt fans of Trump, the candidate who won the Florida Republican primary in a rout.

His backers did apply for some of the coveted positions, three for each of the five congressional districts. But they feared they’d mostly be shut out of the selection. So they staged a preemptive protest, a reminder to the GOP establishment that the front-runner wouldn’t be so easy to brush off.

“The establishment is there, subverting the will of the people so they can maintain their power and control,” said the woman who organized the demonstration, the fatefully named Dolly T. Rump. (Yes, that is her real name, she said before even being asked, whipping out her driver’s license and joking that no one choosing a fake name would go with “Rump.”)
