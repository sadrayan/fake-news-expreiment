Rubio's PAC helping Ayotte with TV ad
Sen. Marco Rubio's Reclaim America PAC is throwing "six-figure" support to Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who has come under fire in New Hampshire for her vote against gun background checks.

This ad begins tomorrow, according to a person familiar with it, and is a "six-figure buy." Last week, the PAC sent out an email soliciting money for what would become the ad. "Outside groups are now pouring special interest money into New Hampshire to attack Senator Ayotte for supporting the rights of law-abiding gun owners," it read. "We must not let these shameless attacks on Senator Ayotte go unchallenged."
