LEAH VUKMIR, A STATE SENATOR, IS MAKING HER FIRST RUN AT STATEWIDE OFFICE. LOOK WHAT -- >> LOCALLY HAVE DONE IN WISCONSIN. >> AND NOW, LIVE FROM THE MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL, HERE IS TONIGHT’S MODERATOR, WISN 12 NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST, AND UPFRONT HOST, MIKE GOUSH [APPLAUSE] MIKE: GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, AND WELCOME TO TONIGHT’S DEBATE. WE’RE LIVE AT ECKSTEIN HALL, THE LUBAR CENTER, AT MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL, WHERE I WORK AS A FELLOW IN LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY. TONIGHT, WE HAVE THE CANDIDATES FOR U.S. SENATE, INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT TAMMY BALDWIN. AND REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER LEAH VUKMIR. THIS IS THE THIRD AND FINAL DEBATE BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES. OUR FORMAT TONIGHT IS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. WE’LL BE HAVING A CONVERSATION. I’LL BE ASKING THE CANDIDATES ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO WISCONSIN VOTERS. I’LL ASK THEM TO RESPOND DIRECTLY AND CONCISELY TO THE QUESTIONS, AND IF THEY CHOOSE, THEY MAY SPEAK DIRECTLY TO EACH OTHER. BUT, I’LL BE MANAGING THE TIME, AND WILL MOVE THE CONVERSATION ALONG TO MAKE SURE WE CAN COVER A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS. AT THE END OF THE HOUR, EACH CANDIDATE WILL GIVE A MINUTE-LONG CLOSING STATEMENT. AND SO WE’LL BEGIN, WITH THE FIRST QUESTION GOING TO THE INCUMBENT, SENATOR BALDWIN SENATOR, THE TO HAVE YOU WITH US. MR. BLAIR, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. AT A RALLY IN MISSISSIPPI, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID I AM NOT ON THE TICKET BUT I AM ON THE TICKET. THIS IS A REFERENDUM ON RONALD TRUMP. IS IT A REFERENDUM? IS IT A REFERENDUM ON PRESIDENT TRUMP? TAMMY BALDWIN: WHAT IS ON THE BALLOT IS CONCERNS OF WISCONSIN CITIZENS. AS I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THIS CAMPAIGN AS WELL AS MY SERVICE OVER THE LAST 60 YEARS, WISCONSIN VOTERS HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED THIS PAST TWO YEARS. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT REALLY IS ON THE BALLOT, HEALTH CARE, WHETHER WE WILL COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, TAX PLANS THAT GAVE 83% OF THE BENEFITS TO THE TOP 1% AND MASSIVE CORPORATIONS RATHER THAN MIDDLE-CLASS ARE WORKING FAMILIES. THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN. AS THE CAMPAIGN COMES TO BE FINAL DAYS, THEY ARE INVOLVED IN THESE NOW VOTING FOR CANDIDATES WHO HAVE THEIR BACK AND ARE FIGHTING FOR THEM AND STANDING UP TO CANDIDATES WHO ARE IN THE POCKETS OF SPECIAL INTEREST. >> IT IS NOT ABOUT TRUMP. IT IS ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT US INTIMATELY. HEALTH CARE IS PERSONAL. GETTING AHEAD IN THE ECONOMY IS PERSONAL. >> IS A REFERENDUM ON PRESIDENT TRUMP? LEAH VUKMIR: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. WHAT WE HAVE DONE MIRRORS WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE. WHEN I THINK ABOUT REGULATORY REFORM AND TAX RELIEF AND HOW THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING WITH GDP GROWTH NOBODY PREDICTED AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SIMILARLY BY USING THE PRINCIPLES OF LIMITED GOVERNMENT AND MAKING SURE WE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE’S HARD EARNED DOLLARS ARE THERE DOLLARS AND NOT THE GOVERNMENT’S AS A SENATOR BULTMAN BELIEVES. IT IS IMPORTANT -- SENATOR BALDWIN BELIEVES. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR LEADERS WHO FOLLOW THROUGH ON PROMISES, JUST LIKE WE HAVE OVERSEEN AN ECONOMIC MIRACLE IN THE STATE. THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. PEOPLE WANT INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL FOLLOW THROUGH, DO WHAT THEY SAY. I REPRESENT THE MIDDLE-CLASS. I AM A MIDDLE-CLASS MOM WHO NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET INTO POLITICS. NOT THE SPECIAL INTEREST THAT SENATOR BALDWIN HAS RECEIVED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM. PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING THEY CAN RELATE TO. SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS THEIR DAY-TO-DAY CHALLENGES. THAT IS WHAT THE ELECTION IS ABOUT. MIKE GOUSHA: ARE YOU PERSONALLY PLEASED THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL BE COMING NEXT WEEK TO CAMPAIGN ON YOUR BEHALF? LEAH VUKMIR: VERY HAPPY. ANOTHER PROMISE HE FOLLOWED HER ON. HE CALLED ME THE DAY AFTER I WON THE PRIMARY. HE IS FOLLOWING THROUGH AND PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED. MIKE GOUSHA: THE FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IS COMING. I ASSUME YOU FEEL HE IS VALUABLE TO YOU HERE. TAMMY BALDWIN: I FEEL HE IS VALUABLE BECAUSE HE ENGAGES PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS. I WORKED WITH THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO BRING HEALTH CARE THAT PEOPLE COULD AFFORD. HE KNOWS I HAVE THOUGHT TO SAVE THE -- THOUGHT TO SAVE THE PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND MY AMENDMENT TO LET YOUNG PEOPLE STAY ON THEIR PARENTS HEALTH INSURANCE UNTIL THE AGE OF 26. MY OPPONENT WOULD BE THE DECIDING VOTE TO THROUGHOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND TOTS -- TOSS TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OFF OF INSURANCE. PRESIDENT TRUMP’S VISIT, WE SHOULD BE PROUD WHEN A PRESIDENT COMES TO VISIT. WHEN HE WAS IN KENOSHA LAST YEAR, HE CAME TO SIGN A BY AMERICA HIGHER AMERICA EXECUTIVE ORDER. HE ENDORSED MY MEASURE TO ALLOW AND REQUIRE THAT OUR DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE BE MADE WITH AMERICAN STEEL AND IRON AND AMERICAN WORKERS. IN A DAY OR TWO, HE IS GOING TO SIGN A BILL, WATER INFRASTRUCTU BILL, WITH MY BY AMERICA PROVISIONS. MIKE GOUSHA: WE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND. YOU RAISE HEALTH CARE. LET’S GET INTO THIS. YOU HAVE PROFOUND DIFFERENCES ON HOW YOU VIEW HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IN THE COUNTRY. SENATOR VIC MAYOR, I WILL HAVE YOU JUST THAT -- VUKMIR, I WILL HAVE YOU ADDRESS THAT. DEMOCRATS SAY THAT IF OBAMACARE IS REPEALED, PEOPLE WILL LOSE COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. SENATOR MCCONNELL SAYS WE MIGHT TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT REPEALING EARLY NEXT YEAR. WOULD YOU BE PROUD TO CAST THE DECIDING VOTE IF THEY CAME TO THAT?" LEAH VUKMIR: OBAMACARE NEEDS TO GO. HERE IS THE LIVE FROM THIS CAMPAIGN. SENATOR BALDWIN SAYS 2.4 MILLION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. I WOULD FALL IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK BEFORE I LET PEOPLE GO WITHOUT COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. SHE KNOWS THAT FEDERAL LAW SAYS IF YOU ARE ON MEDICARE OR MEDICAID YOU ARE COVERED. IF OBAMACARE WENT AWAY, PEOPLE WOULD BE COVERED. MIKE GOUSHA: NOT ALL PEOPLE. LEAH VUKMIR: YOU’RE RIGHT. PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT ON EMPLOYER-BASED, WE TOOK CARE OF PEOPLE WITH A HEALTH INSURANCE RISK SHARING PULL. WE HAVE DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB ECONOMICALLY IN WISCONSIN AND WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED OR DO NOT HAVE AN EMPLOYER-BASED INSURANCE. THAT MEANS WE HAVE A SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO COVER. I AM COMMITTED TO COVERING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THE REMAINING 3.4 MILLION PEOPLE THAT SENATOR BALDWIN IS GOING TO THROW OFF THEIR EMPLOYER-BASED INSURANCE. OUR PROPOSAL FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL SAYS IF YOU ARE ON MEDICARE, MEDICAID, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, TRI-CARE, OR EMPLOYER INSURANCE, IT WOULD BE DISMANTLED OVER FOUR YEARS. I HAVE SAID THIS FOR THREE DEBATES. I AM WAITING FOR THE MEDIA TO SAY, LOOK AT THIS. SENATOR BALDWIN. IT IS AMAZING TO ME THAT NOBODY IS LOOKING AT HER OWN BILL. I DO NOT THINK SENATOR BALDWIN HAS LOOKED AT HER OWN BILL. SECTION 105-107 SAYS HE WILL DISMANTLE ALL OF THE PROGRAMS. TALK ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK. TALK ABOUT CREATING CHAOS. THAT IS WHAT HER PLAN WILL DO. NOBODY IN THE MEDIA IS TALKING ABOUT IT. MIKE GOUSHA: I WILL COME BACK TO THIS. ANOTHER QUESTION. SENATOR BALDWIN, RESPOND. SHE SAYS YOUR PLAN THAT YOU HAVE ENDORSED MEDICARE FOR ALL, SINGLE-PAYER GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTH CARE, WOULD THROW THE SYSTEM INTO CHAOS. WHY IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO REPLACE WHAT WE HAVE NOW WITH SOMETHING THAT IS A NEW ENTERPRISE? TAMMY BALDWIN I SUPPORT SEVERAL MEASURES: BECAUSE WE ARE AT A TIME WHERE GOOD IDEAS SHOULD BE DEBATED. WE SHOULD HAVE OPTIONS. WE HAD A VERY IMPORTANT VOTE IN THE U.S. SENATE LAST SUMMER. IT WENT DOWN BY ONE VOTE WHEN JOHN MCCAIN FAMOUSLY GAVE THE THUMBS DOWN TO REPEALING THE CARE ACT AND LEAVING SO MANY WITHOUT PROTECTIONS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. AT THAT MOMENT, I BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO WORK TOGETHER. I HAVE TO ALWAYS HOPE IT WILL BE AT THE TIME WE STOP PLAYING POLITICS WITH HEALTH CARE AND GET SERIOUS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD. LEAH VUKMIR’S IDEA THAT SHE WOULD BE THE DECIDING VOTE IS TO MOVE ACT WORDS TO THE BAD OLD DAYS. -- BACKWARDS TO THE BAD OLD DAYS. ANY STUDY OF THE COST OF MOVING FORWARD, MOVING TOWARD INNOVATIONS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT , SAY THEY COST MORE, UP TO $2 TRILLION MORE THAN MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION. I WANT TO SAY, PRIOR -- PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS CAN HAVE COVERAGE AND MANY PEOPLE WERE LEFT IN THE LURCH. LEAH VUKMIR TALKS ABOUT HER RECORD AS A NURSE. I AM MORE WORRIED ABOUT HER RECORD AS A POLITICIAN. SHE HAS VOTED WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES TIME OVER TIME. SCOTT WALKER -- LEAH VUKMIR: I NEED TO RESPOND TO THAT. MIKE GOUSHA: GO AHEAD. LEAH VUKMIR: I AM GLAD SENATOR BALDWIN BROUGHT UP HOW IT WILL BE PAID FOR. HOW WILL YOU PAY FOR THIS? $32 TRILLION. WE ARE ALREADY DEALING WITH A DEBT PROBLEM. $32 TRILLION. SHE HAS NO PLANS TO PAY FOR IT. IT IS NOT JUST A CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK THAT HAS THAT FIGURE, BUT THE URBAN INSTITUTE HAS SAID THE SAME THING. A CANDIDATE IN ENGLAND CAN HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. SENATOR BALDWIN WOULD DENY PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE INSURANCE. PEOPLE WILL BE WAITING IN LINE. PEOPLE WAITING IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. PEOPLE WAIT TWO MONTHS IN ENGLAND AFTER THE ONSET OF A DIAGNOSIS TO THE BEGINNING OF TREATMENT. I CANNOT IMAGINE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. AND WAITING TWO MONTHS. LET’S TALK ABOUT ORAL CHEMO. THE VERY THING I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HAPPENING HAS OCCURRED. THE HARVARD UNC STUDY SAID THE STATES WHO HAVE PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION TO WHAT HAPPENED IN WISCONSIN, INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RECEIVING ORAL CHEMO ARE FINDING THE COST HAS GONE UP. SENATOR BALDWIN WANTS TO SAY I AM SOMEBODY WHO IS ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT INSURERS. I WAS SKEPTICAL OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THAT IS WHY I WAS CONCERNED. MY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN PROVEN. IT IS COSTING THE INDIVIDUALS ONE MONEY AND MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO HAVE ACCESS. MIKE GOUSHA: HOW YOU PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT COST $32 TRILLION? TAMMY BALDWIN: IF IT IS GOING TO COST MORE TO GO BACKWARDS, THERE IS NEVER A DEBATE ON THAT. THE COST HAVE BEEN BORN IN BANKRUPTCY COURTS. I REMEMBER HEARING, PRIOR TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THE NAME SUSAN. HER HUSBAND GOT CANCER. SHE LOOKED AT THE FINE PRINT ON THE INSURANCE AND A COVERED OR $2000 OF CHEMO -- $13,000 OF CHEMO. THAT IS JUST THE FIRST-ROUND. THEY NEXT OTHER CREDIT CARDS. THEY TAKE A HOME EQUITY LOAN. HER HUSBAND DIED AND THEY WENT BANKRUPT. THAT WAS THE STORY OF HOW WE PAID FOR IT IN THE YEARS BEFORE WE HAD PROTECTIONS THAT PROTECTED PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. LEAH VUKMIR: PEOPLE WILL STILL BE COVERED-- MIKE GOUSHA: LET HER FINISH. TAMMY BALDWI THE HIGH RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM COVERED 1% OF WISCONSINITES WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. THERE WAS A LIFETIME CAP WITH A SIX-MONTH WAIT AND IT WAS OUT OF REACH FOR MOST. LEAH VUKMIR SEEMS TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH BOTTOM LINE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAN HER CONSTITUENTS IN WISCONSIN. MIKE GOUSHA: THE QUESTION IS HOW WE PAY FOR IT? TAMMY BALDWIN: THE TRANSITION BETWEEN THE PATCHWORK QUILT WE HAVE NOW AND MEDICARE FOR ALL WOULD BE GRADUAL. PART OF THAT IS, WHAT IS ON THE TABLE FOR DEBATE. THIS PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE SIGNING A MEDICARE FOR ALL ACT INTO LAW ANYTIME IN HIS TERM. WE HAVE TIME TO DEBATE THIS. MY OPPONENT WANTS TO GO BACK TO THE OLD DAYS AND NOT MOVE FORWARD. WE SHOULD ALL HAVE AN ASPIRATION THAT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. I SUPPORT A PROPOSAL TO BUY INTO MEDICARE AT 55. I SUPPORT HAVING CARE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BUY INTO IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE MARKETPLACE. WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT INNOVATIVE IDEAS TO BUILD US IN THIS DIRECTION. MY OPPONENT WANTS TO GO BACK. MIKE GOUSHA: I WANT TO ASK QUESTION. LEAH VUKMIR: NO. I WANT TO RESPOND. MIKE GOUSHA: I NEED TO ASK A QUESTION. THE GOVERNOR SAID WE WILL GUARANTEE COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND PASS LEGISLATION. THE ASSEMBLY PASSED LEGISLATION BUT THE SENATE DID NOT. THIS WEEK, THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, WHEN HE WAS ASKED IF THEY HAD THE VOTES TO PASS LEGISLATION TO COVER PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS HE SAID, I AM NOT SURE. LEAH VUKMIR: THAT’S WHY YOU NEED TO ELECT NAME. MIKE GOUSHA: HE CHANGED HIS MIND. IF I’M A PERSON WITH A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION AND I HEAR THAT KIND OF WAVERING. SHOULDN’T I BE A BRAND SOLD ABOUT WHAT COULD COME DOWN THE ROAD? LEAH VUKMIR: I SAID IT BEFORE. IF OBAMACARE GOES AWAY TODAY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND THEM PUT YOUR INSURANCE IS STILL COVERED FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WILL COVER THE REST. SENATOR BALDWIN TALKS ABOUT GOING BACKWARDS. GOING BACKWARDS IS TELLING SENIORS YOU NO LONGER HAVE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. I CANNOT BELIEVE SENATOR BALDWIN WANTS TO LITERALLY THROW GRANDMA OFF OF A CLIFF. THAT IS WHAT SHE IS DOING. IT WOULD CREATE CHAOS OF EPIC PROPORTION. SHE DOES NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND HER OWN BILL. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BRING THE POWER BACK TO THE STATES. WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING BEFORE OBAMACARE CAME IN. MIKE GOUSH THERE WERE FEWER PEOPLE COVERED AND THEY PAID MORE IN THE RISK POOL. LEAH VUKMIR: I THINK THERE WILL BE FEWER PEOPLE AND THE RISK POOL BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS TURNING BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE GOING BAK TO WORK. WE ARE COMMITTED TO TAKING CARE OF THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY COVERED.- I WANT TO KNOW WHY NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE 3.4 MILLION PEOPLE WHO WILL BE THROWN OFF OF INSURANCE. EVERYONE KEEPS FIXATING ON THE LIGHT SENATOR BALDWIN AND OTHERS ARE PERPETUATING. WHAT ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL NO LONGER HAVE INSURANCE? WEEK. A WOMAN WITH A VERY RARE LUNG DISEASE IS FRIGHTENED OVER THE FACT THAT SHE MAY NOT HAVE THE DOCTOR OR SPECIALIST WHO CAN CURE HER DISEASE. THAT DOES NOT MATTER TO SENATOR BALDWIN. MIKE GOUSHA: WE WERE WRAPPING THIS UP. 15 SECONDS. TAMMY BALDWIN: LEAH VUKMIR SUPPORTS A LOSS THAT WOULD CUT PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND SUPPORTS REPEALING THE ACA. MIKE GOUSHA: IT’S IN YOUR BILL -- LEAH VUKMIR: IT’S IN YOUR BILL. MIKE GOUSHA: PLEASE. TAMMY BALDWIN: SHIPPABLE -- SHE SUPPORTS THE PRESIDENT’S AND THE MINISTRATIONS ATTEMPT TO UNRAVEL THE PROTECTIONS WE HAVE. MIKE GOUSHA: EIGHT YEARS AGO WE SAT IN AN U.S. SENATE DEBATE AND ONE OF THE THINGS TALKED ABOUT WAS THE FEDERAL DEFICIT. WE HEAR THE FEDERAL DEFICIT IS $779 BILLION FOR THE LAST YEAR. NATIONAL DEBT IS NEARLY $22 TRILLION. WHY AREN’T REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TALKING ABOUT THIS AS AN ISSUE? WHY IS THIS NOT A PRIORITY? WHY IS IT NOT A DISCUSSION WE’RE HAVING? LEAH VUKMIR: IT IS A PRIORITY TO MAIM. I GOT INTO POLITICS OUT OF CIRCUMSTANCE, NOT AMBITION. I AM A MIDDLE-CLASS MOM. I KNOW WHAT FAMILIES GO THROUGH. THEY SIT AROUND THE TABLE AND LIVE WITHIN THEIR MEANS. THEY EXPECT PEOPLE IN MADISON AND WASHINGTON TO DO THE SAME. WE HAVE BEN BALANCING OUR BUDGETS BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DOING IT IN WASHINGTON. THAT IS WHY WE NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO GO DO HEAVY LIFTING. GREATER THAN $20 TRILLION DEBT IS ABSOLUTELY UNSUSTAINABLE I MAY CANNOT CONTINUE TO PASS IT ON TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET. THAT IS THE SIMPLEST THING TO DO. WE NEED TO RESTORE MORE POWER BACK TO THE STATE THROUGH THE PRINCIPLE OF FEDERALISM. THERE IS A DUPLICATION OF SERVICES AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL. LET’S BRING THE MONEY BACK TO THE STATES AND RESTORE SPENDING CAPS. THE LAST BUDGET SENATOR BALDWIN VOTED FOR WAS A $1.3 TRILLION BUDGET WITH $138 BILLION OF SPENDING CAPS AND BLEW THROUGH THAT. THAT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE. SENATOR BALDWIN HAS A SPENDING PROBLEM. THE GOVERNMENT HAS A SPENDING PROBLEM. SHE IS WILLING TO CONTINUE TO THE END. I WILL NOT. MIKE GOUSHA: WHY IS IT NOT A TOP OF MY TOPIC FOR YOU? TAMMY BALDWIN: I HAVE BROUGHT IT UP IN EVERY SPEECH I HAVE GIVEN THIS WEEK. THERE IS A 17% INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT. THE ANALYSIS IS THAT IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY DO TO THE TAX BILL THAT PASSED LAST YEAR THAT WICKMAYER SUPPORTS. THAT BILL GAVE AN 83% BREAK TO THE TOP 1% AND MULTINATIONAL AND MAJOR POWERFUL CORPORATIONS ON THE CORPORATE SIDE. THAT 83% WAS HELPING WORKING PEOPLE AND MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES , I WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR IT. EXXON MOBIL IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE TAX MEASURE IS GOING TO GET A BIGGER TAX BREAK THAN EVERY WISCONSIN FAMILY AND INDIVIDUAL COMBINES. THE PROPONENTS ARE TALKING ABO GOING AFTER EARNED BENEFITS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. WE NEED TO TAKE A BALANCED APPROACH TO GO DOWN ON THE DEFICIT. SOME HAS TO BE ON THE SPENDING SIDE. SOME HAS TO BE GETTING RID OF LAVISH LOOPHOLES FOR THE POWERFUL. I WORKED FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND HARD-WORKING PEOPLE, NOT FOR THE ALEX OF THE WORLD, CORPORATIONS THAT LOBBIED FOR A TAX BREAK. THAT IS WHERE WANT TO WORK FOR AS WE LOWER THE DEFICIT WITHOUT HARMING PEOPLE. MIKE GOUSHA: SENATOR MCCONNELL SAID WE MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. DO YOU AGREE? WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM’S? LEAH VUKMIR: THAT IS YOUR VERSION OF WHAT HE SAID. MIKE GOUSHA: DID HE NOT SAY THAT? LEAH VUKMIR: THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE DOES NOT SUPPORT SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM. I AM STANDING WITH THE PRESIDENT. SENATOR BALDWIN -- MIKE GOUSHA: IT WOULD REDUCE THE DEFICIT AND THE DEAD. IF WE DO NOT LOOK AT THE TAX CUT OR ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? LEAH VUKMIR: I STARTED TO LAY IT OUT FOR YOU. WE HAVE TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT. THEN RESTORE THE SPENDING CAPS. THEN WE NEED TO RESTORE FEDERALISM. THAT IS WITH THE FOUNDING FATHERS AND PIGEONS FOR THE COUNTRY. THERE IS SO MUCH POWER GIVEN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE DUPLICATIONS BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. RETURN THE RESOURCES BACK TO THE STATES. LET US BE MORE EFFICIENT AT THE STATE LEVEL. SENATOR BALDWIN SAYS SHE REPRESENTS THE MIDDLE CLASS. YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE MIDDLE CLASS. YOU SPEND MORE TIME WITH PEOPLE IN THE HAMPTONS AND CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE COLLECTED $3 MILLION FROM THE TAXPAYERS. YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE PEOPLE BACK HOME. YOU MOCKED THE TAX CUTS. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE STATE TALKING TO PEOPLE. THAT 1500-2000 DOLLARS IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE. YOU MAKE IT AN EITHER/OR. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE DEFICIT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS CUT SPENDING. THAT IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO. MIKE GOUSHA: A CHANCE TO RESPOND. TAMMY BALDWIN: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMY AND THE INCREASING DEFICIT. THE ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR ALL PEOPLE. THE MACRO ECONOMY LOOKS GOOD. TALK TO A DAIRY FARMER IN WISCONSIN AND KNOW WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE. TALK TO A MANUFACTURING WORKER WHO HAS NOT SEEN A RAISE IN THE YEARS DESPITE THE FACT THEIR EMPLOYERS GOT A HUGE CORPORATE TAX BREAK. WE NEED TO MAKE THE ECONOMY WORK FOR WORKING PEOPLE, MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE. IT WAS THE RESPONSIBLE TO VOTE FOR A TAX BILL THAT DOES THE OPPOSITE. OUR TAX CODE SHOULD REWARD HARD WORK. IT SHOULD RESPECT THE DIGNITY OF HARD WORK AND NOT GIVE SO MUCH OF THE BENEFITS TO THE TOP, THE ONE CORPORATION LIKE EXXON MOBIL , MAKE SMART IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE TAX BREAK THAN ALL OF US IN THE ROOM AND THE REST OF THE STATE COMBINED. MIKE GOUSHA: JUST FOR THE RECORD, BASED ON WHAT I AM HEARING, YOU SAY SOCIAL SECURITY -- IF IT WERE BEING LOOKED AT ON THE ROAD, I DO NOT HEAR ANYONE SAYING THEY WOULD FAVOR RAISING THE AGE OF ELIGIBILITY OR CHANGING THE CAP ON INCOME. DO YOU AGREE WITH ANY OF THOSE THINGS? TAMMY BALDWIN: THE LAST TIME WE MADE MAJOR CHANGES WAS WHEN REAGAN PUT TOGETHER A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION AND GAVE CONGRESS AN UP OR DOWN VOTE. WE COULD DO IT THAT WAY. AT A TIME WHEN PENSIONS ARE IN JEOPARDY AND PEOPLE’S RETIREMENT SAVINGS HAS BEEN SPENT SENDING KIDS TO COLLEGE AND MEDICAL EXPENSES, THAT IS THE LAST TIME TO WEAKEN SOMETHING THAT WISCONSIN -- LOOK UP -- WISCONSIN HELPS RIGHT. LEAH VUKMI PEOPLE WHO ARE NEAR RETIREMENT NEED TO KNOW WE ARE COMMITTED IN FOLLOWING THROUGH. WE NEED A NATIONAL DISCUSSION. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. WHEN I TRAVEL TO COLLEGES, THEY DO NOT TRUST WHAT IS GOING TO BE THERE FOR THEM. WE NEED TO HAVE THAT NATIONAL DISCUSSION. LET’S TALK ABOUT THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE IN WISCONSIN. PENSIONS, WE HAVE A FULLY FUNDED PENSION. IT IS ONE OF THE ONLY STATES AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF RESPONSIBLE GOVERNING BY PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES. WE HAD A 9.2% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN 2011. NOW IT IS LESS THAN 3%, 2.7%. BELOW 3% FOR EIGHT MONTHS. THEY $.6 BILLION BUDGET DEFICIT. NOW WE HAV A SURPLUS. THIS IS THE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP YOU NEED IN WASHINGTON, PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT WORKS AND WILL FOLLOW THROUGH. MIKE GOUSHA: WE’RE GOING TO MOVE ON. TAMMY BALDWIN: WHEN I LISTEN TO EMPLOYERS ACROSS THE STATE OF WISCONSIN, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THERE IS A SKILL GAP. WE KNOW WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK. THE MACRO ECONOMY, THE NUMBERS ARE GOOD AND THE PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING AT THE GRASSROOTS, WHETHER IT IS MANUFACTURING OR ELSEWHERE. I THINK WE NEED TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY IS LIKE APPRENTICES -- APPRENTICESHIPS. MY ACT WOULD DO THAT SO THAT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALL EARN WILL THEY LEARN. AND NOT NECESSARILY GO INTO DEBT AS THEY BUILD SKILL. WE NEED TO DO THIS QUICKLY AND FOCUS ON PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK BUT HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. LEAH VUKMIR: WE HAVE DONE THAT IN WISCONSIN. IT IS IMPORTANT WE HAVE A PRESSURE PROGRAMS. ABOUT WHAT YOU HEAR FROM YOUNGER PEOPLE. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEAR IS ABOUT STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND NEEDING HELP. WHAT IS THE PROPER ROLE OF THE U.S. SENATOR IN ADDRESSING STUDENT AT? LEAH VUKMIR: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING LOANS. IT HAS BEEN ABOMINABLE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE STUDENTS. WE NEED TO GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY. MIKE GOUSHA: WOULD YOU FAVOR REFINANCING THE WAY BUSINESSES DO OUR INDIVIDUALS? LEAH VUKMIR: WE NEED TO GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF LOANS AND CONTINUE TO GROW THE ECONOMY SO OUR KIDS HAVE JOBS WHEN THEY ARE GRADUATING, JOBS THAT ARE GOOD AND WELL-PAYING JOBS. RIGHT NOW, WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS AWFUL. IT IS INCENTIVIZING UNIVERSITIES TO INCREASE THEIR TUITIONS. WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO TAKING CARE OF OUR COLLEGE KIDS. WE HAVE FROZEN TUITION FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. IT IS IMPORTANT -- THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE WE ARE SO DIFFERENT, SENATOR BALDWIN BELIEVES THAT GOVERNMENT HAS A SOLUTION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE IN THE BUSINESS OF LOANS. TAMMY BALDWIN: IT IS A VITAL ISSUE. YOUNGER CHILDREN WHO SEE OLDER SIBLINGS GO DEEP INTO DEBT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ARE RETHINKING WHETHER THEY SHOULD EVEN DO WHAT SOCIETY HAS TOLD HIM TO DO. I DO NOT THINK THE PROBLEM WITH STUDENT DEBT IS THE GOVERNMENT. I THINK IT IS WALL STREET. THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN KEEPING A LAW THAT SAYS STUDENTS CANNOT RENEGOTIATE LOWER INTEREST RATES. YOU CAN REFINANCE A CAR. YOU CAN REFINANCE A HOME. BUT STUDENTS -- OR GRADUATES CANNOT DO THAT. WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO STAND UP TO THE INTERESTS, BIG BANKS. WE HAVE TO FIGHT ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS, SENIORS, PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. WE CANNOT HAVE LEADERS WHO ARE BEHOLDEN TO SPECIAL INTERESTS. LEAH VUKMIR: I NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS SPECIAL INTEREST NOTION. IT IS THE ONLY THING I HEAR COMING OUT OF SENATOR BALDWIN. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU STAND FOR. ALL SHE DOES IS ATTACK ME. SENATOR BALDWIN, YOU HAVE RECEIVED $26 MILLION IN SPECIAL INTEREST MONEY AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE ACA. YOU HAVE RECEIVED $750,000 FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF ABORTIONS. 17 OF YOUR FORMER AIDES HAVE GONE ON TO BECOME LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON, TUESDAY AND HAVE ENCOURAGED YOU TO SIGN ON TO 127 OF THEIR BILLS CHECK OUT THE FACTS. TO SAY THAT I AS A MOM WHO GOT INTO POLITICS BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT EDUCATION, THAT I AM IN THE BACK POCKET OF SPECIAL INTEREST, IT IS LAUGHABLE. WHILE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS, I HAVE TO GET A WORD IN. I BELONG TO A ORGANIZATION THAT BELIEVES THE GOVERNMENT CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE IS BEST TO MAKE DECISIONS. OUR FOUNDING FATHERS THOUGHT THAT. SENATOR BALDWIN, LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOU DID NOT SEND BACK THE MONEY YOU RECEIVED FROM SOME OF THE GROUPS THAT SPONSOR ALEC. JUST SAYING. TAMMY BALDWIN: I AM PROUD TO SAY MY AVERAGE ON MY CONTRIBUTION IS $19. SOME OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MY CAMPAIGN ARE PEOPLE LIKE TYRA AND JENNY AND OTHERS HAVE TOLD ME THEIR STORIES ABOUT FEARING FOR A LOVED ONE WHO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. THIS IS AN IRONIC STATEMENT AFTER WE HAVE SEEN OVER $14 MILLION OF SUPER PACK SECRET OF SPENDING LAUNCHED AGAINST ME BEFORE I EVEN HAD AN OPPONENT. NOBODY HAD ANNOUNCED IN THE SPRING OF 2017 THAT THEY WERE THINKING OVER GOING TO RUN FOR SENATE. MOST VIEWERS WHO WATCH TELEVISION HAVE SEEN THE ATTACK ADS AND THAT THEY ARE FUNDED BY POWERFUL SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS , TO THE EXTENT WE CAN SEE WHO THEY ARE FUNDED BY. MIKE GOUSHA: LET HER FINISH. TAMMY BALDWIN: RICHARD , THE NAMES GO ON THOSE FOLKS HAVE AN AGENDA AND THEY WANT A SENATOR WHO IS GOING TO DO THEIR BIDDING. OTHERWISE, WHY WOULD THEY SPEND $14 MILLION ATTACKING ME? I WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR WISCONSIN AND I WILL STAN UP TO THOSE AT EVERY TURN. LEAH VUKMIR: THERE WERE NO PROMISES MADE -- MIKE GOUSHA: WE ARE MOVING ON TO ANOTHER TOPIC. >> DO YOU NEED A NURSE? [LAUGHTER] MIKE GOUSHA: NICE MOMENT OF LEVITY. LEAH VUKMIR: I’M HERE FOR YOU. MIKE GOUSHA: IMMIGRATION. THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THE U.S. IS REACHING A MOMENT OF CRISIS BECAUSE OF THE RECORD NUMBER OF MIGRANTS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY. SENATOR BILL KREHER, IS IT A CRISIS? LEAH VUKMI I AM THE DAUGHTER OF GREEK IMMIGRANTS. MY CHILDHOOD WAS SPENT WATCHING MY AUNTS AND UNCLES COME TO THE COUNTRY. MY DAD CAME HERE FROM THE -- GREECE AND WENT THROUGH PROCESS TO BECOME A CITIZEN. WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER IS CHAOS. IT IS CHAOS THAT SENATOR BALDWIN IS HAPPY TO GO ALONG WITH. ANYONE CAN COME IN. WE HAVE HEARD IT IS CLOSE TO 4000 PEOPLE COMING IN OR CLOSE TO THE BORDER. THEY KNOW THOSE THREE WORDS. I WANT ASYLUM. SENATOR BALDWIN HAS NOT BEEN WILLING TO WORK ON CHANGING THE RULES. WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THOSE WORDS, EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO GET ACROSS THE BORDER GETS ACROSS THE BORDER. UNFORTUNATELY, OUR BORDER SECURITY IS OVERWHELMED. THEY ARE TRYING TO PROCESS PEOPLE AS BEST AS THEY CAN. THEY LET THEM GO. IT IS A CATCH AND RELEASE PROGRAM. MIKE GOUSHA: SO WE ARE IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS. LEAH VUKMI I DO. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO CAN STAND WITH THE PRESIDENT TO SEAL THE BORDER. SENATOR BALDWIN WANTS OPEN BORDERS. TAMMY BALDWIN: THAT’S NONSENSE. LEAH IS LYING. MIKE GOUSHA: PLEASE. TAMMY BALDWIN: WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE U.S. SENATE, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WORKED TOGETHER TO CRAFT A BIPARTISAN CONFERENCE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL. IT DOES WITH BORDER SECURITY AND HAD 20,000 NEW BORDER AGENTS ASSIGNED TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER. IT DEALT WITH A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR DREAMERS AND OTHERS AND IT DEALT WITH SOME THINGS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IN WISCONSIN WHERE AGRICULTURAL BE SAYS DO NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF MOST OF OUR FARMERS. WE ARE THE DAIRY STATE. COWS NEED TO BE MELT EVERY DAY AND MOST AGRICULTURAL VISA PROGRAMS ARE FOR PLANTING AND HARVEST SEASONS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND NEEDS FIXING. I VOTED FOR THAT BILL AND IT PASSED WITH 68 VOTES IN THE U.S. SENATE. THE HOUSTON NOT BRING IT UP . MY OPPONENT WANTS MORE OF A POLITICAL ISSUE TO RUN ON, RATHER THAN SOLUTIONS. OTHER THAN SAYING THAT SHE WILL BUILD A WALL AND DO NOTHING ALSO AND TELL THE WALL IS BUILT, I HAVE HEARD NOTHING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. MIKE GOUSHA: I WANT U.S. EACH OF YOU A BASIC QUESTION. WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN NOW? LEAH VUKMIR: I BELIEVE IN BUILDING THE WALL. ONCE WE HAVE THE WALL AND COMMITMENT, THEN WE CAN LOOK AT TAKING CARE OF THE DACA CHILDREN. NOBODY WANTS THEM TO NOT HAVE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. WE HAVE TO HAVE COMMITMENT FIRST. PEOPLE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR POROUS WALLS. IT IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, IT IS GAINED MEMBERS -- GANG MEMBERS AND HUMAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS. IT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK. I AM A NURSE. SENATOR BALDWIN PREFERS CHAOS. MIKE GOUSHA: WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED? LEAH VUKMIR: WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE COMMITMENT TO BUILD THE WALL. THEN THE INDIVIDUALS NEED TO GO THROUGH PROCESS, A PATHWAY. IT IS NOT A WAVE OF A WAND. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT JUST HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL IT HAS TO OFFER WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AS SO MANY OTHERS HAVE AND ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH IN ORDER TO BECOME A LEGAL CITIZEN. SENATOR BALDWIN WANTS TO BEAR THAT OUT. MIKE GOUSHA: WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO OR DO WE DO ANYTHING WITH PEOPLE IN THE STATE ILLEGALLY? TAMMY BALDWIN: THE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL I DESCRIBED HOW TO ANSWER. I WOULD TELL YOU THAT, LIKE MANY THINGS IN POLITICS, IT WAS A COMPROMISE. THEY WERE PROVISIONS I DO NOT LIKE AND PROVISIONS I THOUGHT WERE GOOD. THAT IS HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. YOU CANNOT DIG IN YOUR HEELS AND SAY WE’RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS UNTIL HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES TO DO ONE THING. I WANT TO ADD, BECAUSE OF MY OPPONENTS REFERENCE TO DRUG TRAFFICKING, WE DO HAVE AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC. THERE IS A DRUG OF THE SECOND -- EPIDEMIC. THERE IS A DRUG CALLED FENTANYL WHICH IS 100 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN HEROIN. A LOT OF THAT IS COMING THROUGH A DIFFERENT PORT OF ENTRY. IT IS COMING THROUGH OUR INTERNATIONAL MAIL FACILITIES BECAUSE MANUFACTURERS IN CHINA ARE MAILING IT. THAT IS WHY I WAS PROUD TO WORK ACROSS PARTY AISLES TO RAISE ENFORCEMENT AT THE PORT OF ENTRY IN THE U.S. AND HOPEFULLY, THE PRESIDENT WILL SIGN THE RESPONSE ACT OF 2018 LEGISLATION INTO LAW THIS WEEK. MIKE GOUSHA: I WOULD LIKE TO TALK FOREIGN POLICY. PLEASE KEEP THE ANSWERS AS TIGHT AS POSSIBLE. WE HAD THE DEATH OF THE JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY. HE WROTE FOR THE WASHINGTON POST AND WAS A RESIDENT OF THE U.S., NOT A CITIZEN BUT A RESIDENT. THIS EVENING, THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT SAID HE DIED DURING A FIGHT INSIDE THE CONSULATE IN A SYMBOL. TURKISH SOURCES SAY OTHERWISE. THEY SAY HE WAS MURDERED AND DISMEMBERED. AS MEMBERS OF THE SENATE, WHAT IS THE PROPER RESPONSE? SHOULD THERE BE SERIOUS SANCTIONS AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA? SENATOR BALDWIN. TAMMY BALDWIN: ABSOLUTELY. MIKE GOUSHA: AND WHAT DOES SERIOUS MAIN? -- MEAN? TAMMY BALDWIN: SERIOUS WOULD BE PARALLEL TO TWO OF THE MEASURES I VOTED ON EARLIER THIS YEAR TO STOP OUR ARMS SALES, ESPECIALLY AIRCRAFT THAT ARE GOING ON IF WE DO NOT STOP THEM. MIKE GOUSHA: THE $110 BILLION -- TAMMY BALDWIN: WHAT WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE DEATH IS HORRIFYING. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE CRACKING DOWN ON SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN A PROXY WAR IN YEMEN. WHAT WAS NOT REPORTED ON MUCH WAS THE SAUDI ARABIANS BOMBING A SCHOOL BUS AND KILLING 40 CHILDREN. THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO STEP UP AGAINST. IT IS NOT JUST THIS. WE SHOULD RAMP UP FROM THERE AND CANCEL THE MUNITION DEALS THAT ARE OUT THERE. LEAH VUKMIR: IT IS BARBARIC AND HORRIBLE TO THINK THAT ANYONE WOULD DO WHAT WAS DONE THERE. THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE SURE HE HAS ALL THE INFORMATION BEFORE HE MAKES A DECISION ON SANCTIONS. IF WE KNOW WHO HAS DONE EXACTLY WHAT HAS BEEN ALLEGED, THEN WE MUST HAVE SANCTIONS. LEAH VUKMIR: ARMS DEALS -- MIKE GOUSHA: ARMS DEALS THAT ARE PENDING? LEAH VUKMIR: I TRUST THE PRESIDENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION HE HAS. THAT IS A COMPLEX REGION OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO BALANCE OUR CONCERNS FOR HUMANITARIAN NEEDS ALONG WITH CREATING PEACE AND STABILITY IN A REGION THAT IS DIFFICULT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT TIME TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED, TO TALK TO HIS ADVISER AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD. THE PRESIDENT’S POSITION HAS EVOLVED THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. TAMMY BALDWIN: HE SAID HE WOULD WAIT FOR THE SAUDI ARABIAN INVESTIGATION TO CONCLUDE. NOW HE IS LISTENING TO INTELLIGENCE ADVISERS AND MILITARY ADVISERS AND HAS CONCLUDED -- IT IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT SAUDI ARABIA’S WORD FOR WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. MIKE GOUSHA: MOVING TO AFGHANISTAN. AMERICAN TROOPS HAVE BEEN IN AFGHANISTAN FOR 17 YEARS. THIS PAST WEEK, WE SAW AN ATTACK WERE A U.S. COMMANDER NARROWLY ESCAPES A POLICE CHIEF. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN? SENATOR VITTER CLAIRE -- VUKMIR. MIKE GOUSHA: THAT -- LEAH VUKMI THAT WAS NOT AN OP -- OPTIONAL WAR. THE THOUSAND AMERICANS WERE KILLED ON OUR SOIL BY A PLOT HAND -- PLANNED BY EVIL FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN. I HAVE A SON IN THE MILITARY. THIS ISSUE IS VERY CENTRAL TO HOW I LOOK AT THE WORLD. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHERE THOSE THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY ARE. IF THERE ARE SAFE HAVENS OR PLACES WHERE TERRORISTS ARE TRAINING AND PLOTTING, IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST TO MAKE SURE WE MAINTAIN A PRESENCE. THAT APPLIES AFGHANISTAN OR ANYWHERE ELSE. WE HAVE TO ROOT OUT THE STATE HALFPENCE -- SAFE HAVENS. THESE PEOPLE ARE EXTREME. THEY WANT TO TAKE DOWN THE IDEALS OF THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL MOVING FORWARD THAT ONCE WE KNOW -- SYRIA IS ANOTHER AREA. ONCE WE KNOW WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THE STATE HAVENS, WE NEED TO ALLOW REGIONAL POWERS TO COME IN AND STABILIZE. NOT AN OPTIONAL WAR. MIKE GOUSHA: HOW LONG DO WE KEEP TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN? TAMMY BALDWIN: I WAS SERVING IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DURING 9/11. I VOTED TO AUTHORIZE USE OF FORCE IN AFGHANISTAN. I VOTED FOR A CLEAR MISSION. THAT WAS A NARROW MISSION TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO WERE THE ARCHITECTS OF THE 9/11 ATTACK AND ANYONE WHO OFFER THEM SAFE HAVEN. THIS IS NOT YOUR TWO OF THE WAR. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR 18. I CANNOT IMAGINE ANYTHING WE WILL BE DOING DIFFERENTLY IN YOUR 18 THAT JUSTIFIES KEEPING OUR TROOPS THERE. I BELIEVE OUR TROOPS TO COME HOME. AFGHANS MUST TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN FUTURE. LEAH VUKMIR: EVEN IF THEY ARE STILL TRAINING PEOPLE THERE? I HAVE A SON IN THE MILITARY, MAYBE BECAUSE YOU DON’T HAVE A CHILD YOU DON’T LOOK AT IT THE WAY I DO. MIKE GOUSHA: LET HER FINISH HER POINT. TAMMY BALDWIN: I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THOSE WHO SERVER NATION. -- SERVE OUR NATION. I HAVE RESPECT FOR THE NEED TO HAVE A CLEAR MISSION AND TO STICK TO THAT. OUR TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN TO COME HOME. MIKE GOUSH A QUESTION ABOUT NATO. PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT NATO AND HAS HINTED THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE TABLE. SHOULD THE U.S. SENATE HAVE TO APPROVE A U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM NATO? SHOULD BE A TWO THIRDS VOTE? TAMMY BALDWIN: ABSOLUTELY. IN LIGHT OF THE TIME WHEN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN DISREGARDED BY THE PRESIDENT, IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE MESSAGE THIS SENDS TO PRESIDENT CLINTON --PUTIN WATCHING THE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. GET OUT OF THE PARIS ACCORD, IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL, WALK AWAY FROM OTHER INTERNATIONA ALLIANCES, OR CONDEMN THEM VERBALLY. WE KEEP OUR WORD. PART OF THE REASON WHY THE U.S. HAS WORLD INFLUENCE IS BECAUSE OF THAT. THE ONLY TIME ARTICLE FIVE OF THE NATO AGREEMENT HAS BEEN INVOKED WAS BY THE U.S. AFTER 9/11. OUR INTERNATIONAL ALLIES CAME TO OUR SIDE. WE MUST RESPECT THAT. I DO NOT THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING OF THAT SORT UNILATERALLY. LEAH VUKMIR: I AM PLEASED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS STEPPED UP AND SAID WE HAVE TO DO OUR FAIR SHARE. THIS IS PART OF THE PATTERN WHICH IS REFRESHING. THIS PRESIDENT IS STANDING UP TO FOREIGN LEADERS, NOT BOWING TO THEM LITERALLY OR FIGURATIVELY SENATOR BALDWIN TALKS ABOUT THESE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ARE YOU YOU HAVE VOTED AGAINST DOZENS OF THE TRADE AGREEMENTS. YOU ARE ALL OVER THE MAP WHEN IT COMES TO TARIFFS. YOU CRITICIZED THE ORIGINAL DEALS WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. AS OUR PRESIDENT NEGOTIATED THEM, YOU CRITICIZED HIM. YOUR WEBSITE SAYS YOU WERE PART OF NAFTA RENEGOTIATIONS. YOU ARE ALL OVER THE MAP. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU STAND. MIKE GOUSHA: I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE. LEAH VUKMIR: YOU VOTED AGAINST THESE DEALS-- MIKE GOUSHA: WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF TIME. YOU THINK THE SENATE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO WEIGH IN ON WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO GET OUT OF NATO? LEAH VUKMIR: THINGS ARE WORKING OUT FINE AND I’M GLAD THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING UP ON OUR BEHALF. MIKE GOUSHA: A CHANCE TO RESPOND. TAMMY BALDWIN: TWO LEAH VUKMIR’S COMMENT, I HAVE BEEN A LONG CRITIC OF NAFTA. IT HAS NOT DONE WELL BY OUR MANUFACTURING ECONOMY. WE HAVE LOST TOO MANY JOBS. I AGREED WITH THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE SAID WE SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED. WHEN I CLAIM INVOLVEMENT, IT IS FREQUENTLY OCCASION WITH SONNY PERD ON BEHALF OF DAIRY FARMERS AND COMMUNICATION WITH A U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT ISSUES WITH CANADA AND DAIRY AND FREQUENT DISCUSSIONS WITH SECRETARY ROSS ABOUT AMERICA AND THE PERMANENT SECTIONS. -- PROCUREMENT SECTIONS. THE NEW DEAL BEING PROPOSED IS AN IMPROVEMENT THAT I HAVE NOT FINISHED STUDYING IT AND DO NOT BELIEVE SOME ENVISIONS WILL BE ENFORCEABLE. LEAH VUKMIR: OUR FARMERS NEED ACCESS TO MORE MARKETS. YOU ARE ALL OVER THE MAP. WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS SOUNDING LIKE CHICKEN LITTLE AND SAYING THE SKY IS FALLING. YOU ARE GIVING CHINA THE SENSE THAT WE ARE MAKING A DEAL AND THAT WILL HURT FARMERS. CHINA’S CRUMBLING. THEIR GDP IS LOWERING AND IT HAS SHOWN THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IS WORKING. MIKE GOUSHA: MOVING ON TO ANOTHER TOPIC. THIS HAS BEEN FRONT AND CENTER. SENATOR VITTER CLAIRE, YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF HOW THE OFFICE HANDLED THE OPIOID CRISIS AT THE V.A. THE PRESCRIPTION OF VETERANS. YOU HAVE RUN A COUPLE OF ADS ON THIS TOPIC. ONE OF THEM SAYS THAT YOU HAVE SPENT YOUR LIFE HELPING PATIENTS AND SENATOR BALDWIN SPENT HERS PAYING POLITICS. -- PLAYING POLITICS. I WANT TO BE SURE I AM INTERPRETING THAT CORRECTLY. ARE YOU SAYING THAT SENATOR BALDWIN WERE SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF VETERANS? LEAH VUKMIR: MY WORD IS MY WORD BUT SENATOR BALDWIN TURNED THAT INTO A POLITICAL SITUATION. SHE HAD INFORMATION AND SAT ON IT. THERE WAS A VETERAN WHO WAS TRYING SO HARD TO GET THE WORD OUT AND SENATOR BALDWIN HIRED HILLARY CLINTON’S ATTORNEY AND OFFERED HUSH MONEY, TAX-- TAMMY BALDWIN: THOSE ARE LIES. LEAH VUKMIR: READ THE COMPLAINTS. TAMMY BALDWIN:-- LEAH VUKMIR: FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE. THE REPORT WILL TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY. YOU ARE THE ONE PLAYING POLITICS. YOU SENT A LETTER TO EVERY REGISTERED VOTER TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT TOMA. MIKE GOUSHA: GIVE HER A CHANCE TO RESPOND. TAMMY BALDWIN: FIRST OF ALL, ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE SHE UTTERED HIS NOT TRUTHFUL. I BELIEVE LEAH VUKMIR SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF IT USING THE DEATH OF A MARINE VETERAN FOR HER OWN POLITICAL GAIN. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS TO ME. WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE TOMA V.A. AND FOUND OUT IT WAS HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE V.A. SYSTEM, I WORKED WITH THE FAMILY OF ONE O THE VICTIMS TO HELP WRITE STRONG LEGISLATION IN HIS NAME AS A MEMORIAL TO HIS LEGACY, TO TOTALLY TRANSFORM THE OPIOID PRESCRIBING IN THE V.A. WHEN THAT LEGISLATION PASSED AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW AND HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED, IT IS WORKING. AT THOMAS, 47% FEWER VETERANS ARE BEING PRESCRIBED CHRONIC OPIOIDS. 74% FEWER ARE BEING PRESCRIBED THE DANGEROUS INTERACTIVE BENZODIAZEPINES. IT IS WORKING. I TRY TO FIX PROBLEMS. WE SHOULD NOT BE PLAYING POLITICS WITH OUR VETERANS WHO HAVE EARNED AND DESERVE TO THE CARE THEY GET. MIKE GOUSHA: ONE MORE QUESTION. SENATOR BALDWIN, YOU HAVE CONCEDED IN INTERVIEWS THAT MISTAKES IN COMMUNICATION WERE MADE. MISTAKES AND HOW QUICKLY YOUR OFFICE RESPONDED TO THE CONCERNS. WHY IS THAT NOT A VALID ISSUE IN THE RACE? WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BE ASHAMED OF RAISING THE ISSUE? TAMMY BALDWIN: I OWNED UP AND SAID THERE WERE MISTAKES INTO MEDICATION -- MEDICATION. LEAH VUKMIR: AFTER EIGHT MONTHS. TAMMY BALDWIN: THAT IS NOT TRUE. I ADDRESSED THEM. I PROVE MYSELF EVERY DAY BY FIGHTING FOR VETERANS AND HAVING LEGISLATIVE AND OTHER RESPONSES TO THE PROBLEMS. VETERANS IN WISCONSIN KNOW I FIGHT FOR THEM. MIKE GOUSHA: I CAN ONLY GIVE OUT 45 SECONDS. THE MARINE WHO DIED, HIS FAMILY WAS IN AN AD AND HIS DAD SAID EVERY TIME YEARS THEM ATTACKING SENATOR BALDWIN HE WANTS TO SAY STOP. YOU SAY YOU ARE A MILITARY MOM, HE IS A MILITARY DAD. WHY NOT LISTEN TO HIM? LEAH VUKMIR: THEY OUGHT TO BE COMMENDED FOR FORGIVING SENATOR BALDWIN FOR DROPPING THE BALL. IT WAS MORE THAN JUST JASON. THERE WERE SO MANY VETERANS AFFECTED. THERE WERE DRUGS LEACHING INTO THE COMMUNITY AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE A SERIOUS OPIOID ADDICTION PROBLEM. TO THINK YOU HAD SUCH CARELESS DISREGARD AND COULD NOT BE ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR VETERANS. HOW CAN WE EXPECT YOU TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE REST OF THE RESIDENCE? IT IS WRONG. SHE DROPPED THE BALL. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER TO ADMIT IT RIGHT AWAY AND MOVE ON. NOW YOU HAVE MADE A POLITICAL BY DOING ALL THE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE. SHAME ON YOU. MIKE GOUSHA: 15 SECONDS. TAMMY BALDWIN: I GOT RESULTS BY WORKING WITH A FAMILY WHO DECIDED BRAVELY TO TURN A TRAGEDY AND TO HELP FOR OTHERS. THAT IS WHAT IT IS DOING. WORKING WITH THE DAV, VFW. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS. THAT IS NOT PLAYING POLITICS. MIKE GOUSHA: LET ME WRAP THIS PART OF OUR EVENING UP. WE FLIPPED A COIN TO DETERMINE THE ORDER. WE BEGIN WITH LEAH VUKMIR. GET READY. LEAH VUKMI THE CONTRAST COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR AND IT BOILS DOWN TO TRUST. HE’LL WILL YOU TRUST ON HEALTH CARE? THE CAREER POLITICIAN WHO HAS SPENT HER LIFE WALKING THE HALLS OF GOVERNMENT? OR THE NURSE WHO HAS SPENT HER LIFE WALKING THE HALLS OF HOSPITALS? TWO WILL YOU TRUST ON IMMIGRATION REFORM? THE SENATOR WHO SUPPORTS OPEN BORDERS AND SANCTUARY CITIES? OR THE DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS WHO BELIEVES WE ARE NATIONS LAWS THAT MUST BE UPHELD. SENATOR BALDWIN BELIEVES AND HAS SUPPORTED 413 DIFFERENT TAX INCREASES. THE MOM WITH A CAUSE WHO HAS OVERSEEN $8 BILLION OF TAX RELIEF TO THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN. HILL WILL YOU TRUST FOR VETERANS? SENATOR BALDWIN OR MYSELF, WHO HAS ALWAYS HAD THEIR BACKS? I SPENT MY LIFE CARING FOR MY PATIENTS IN NEED AND FAMILIES. I HAVE TAKEN AND MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HER LIVES. I WANT TO TAKE THE SAME PASSION TO WASHINGTON. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE ON NOVEMBER 6. MIKE GOUSHA: THANK YOU. TAMMY BALDWIN: I WANT TO THANK YOU MIKE AND OUR VIEWERS TONIGHT. I WANT TO THANK LEO FOR AGREEING TO DEBATE. THESE THREE DEBATES HAVE SHOWN THIS START AND CLEAR CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWO OF US. NO SHARPER DISTINCTION THEN THE TAX LEGISLATION THAT LEAH VUKMIR HAS SUPPORTED THAT GIVES 83% OF BENEFITS TO THE TOP RICHEST 1% AND BIG CORPORATIONS. IF IT HAD BEEN THE OTHER WAY AROUND, I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED IT. THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE TAX BILL ARE LOOKING AT CUTTING EARNED BENEFITS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE IN ORDER TO COVER THE $2 TRILLION COST. I AM UNAFRAID TO STAND UP TO WALL STREET, MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. I WANT TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR WISCONSINITES. I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY. IT IS AN HONOR AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. MIKE GOUSHA: THANK YOU. AGAIN, THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AT THE LAW SCHOOL FOR THEIR ATTENDANCE AND EVERYONE AT HOME FOR WATCHING. THIS DEBATE HAS BEEN A PRODUCTION OF WISN 12 NEWS AND THE MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL. THE ELECTION IS TUESDAY NOVEMBER SIXTH. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET OUT AND VOTE HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT AND GO BR EWERS. [APPLAUS
