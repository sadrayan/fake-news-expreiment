Taking receipts
Receipts are anything of value (money, goods, services or property) received by a political committee. Authorized committees take in all receipts for a candidateâ€™s campaign. Receipts include both contributions and other forms of support.

Once the treasurer (or authorized agent) receives a receipt, he or she must deposit it within 10 days. Contributions not deposited within 10 days must be returned to their donors.
