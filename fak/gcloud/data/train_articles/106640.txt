I've been so busy the better part of the decade, in uniform for the ZOG, then working all the time, then dedicating all my time to studying and fighting the Jews, I havent had any time for my passions. It is so terrible to live in a time of war, and this is the worst war our people have ever faced.

I envy our ancestors, and if we defeat the Jewish tyrants, our progeny.
