Trumpâ€™s brain, a national problem
This is not a diagnosis. It is an attempt to educate the nation about what we strongly believe to be true, so that the public can demand an objective evaluation of Trump's mental capacity. A capacity exam doesn't decide who can or cannot be President; it ensures that whoever is President is capable of carrying out the vital functions the people elected him to carry out.
