BREAKING: Black Woman Who Won Georgia Primary Arrested For Election Fraud
Democrats are jumping for joy after a black woman won a Democrat primary for the right to run for Governor. Michelle Agabobo Willford surprised everyone with a victory over incumbent Darren Laderhorn , who says he’ll back her “for the good of Georgia.”

Willford is running on a platform that would make abortion free and legal up to the ninth month, repeal of the 2nd Amendment, legalization of marijuana and cocaine and an increase in public assistance funding of nearly 4000 percent. Her spokesman, Art Tubolls, said:

“Michelle stands for the downtrodden people of Georgia who have suffered while entitled wh…people walk around eating fancy foods and driving nice cars. It’s time for those who are persecuted more than anyone to be fed and clothed and brought into the fold so they too can vote in the next election and be truly free.”

Tubolls was, of course, referring to those in poverty when he mentioned those persecuted. He managed to keep the race-baiting to a minimum. Willford says she’ll be the perfect candidate. Her boys are both grown and in prison and two of her three exes (they never legally married) are on her campaign team while the other watches over his boys. In prison.

Willford says that makes her a real candidate for a “ Real Georgia .” Economists estimate her plan will thrust the state into a budget crisis and cause an influx of poor and unemployable people from neighboring states.

Not of that will be a concern now, since it was discovered that she paid people by the tens of thousands to go out and vote with her promises of free welfare. The State Attorney General is looking into what kind of charges he can file and how it will affect the general election.
