According to our policy folks, it's a pretty straightforward mathematical calculation, if one assumes the children are not criminals. If the children are 20% of total apprehensions, and criminals are 20% of total crossings, then 20% of the 80% that's non-UAC represents the 25% we're targeting with public safety resources.

Only A Small Percentage Of Border Total Patrol Apprehensions Involve UACs

* 9.2 Percent Of Nationwide Border Patrol Apprehensions In FY 2013 Involved UACs. (United States Border Patrol, Sector Profile - Fiscal Year 2013)

* 9.35 Percent Of Southwest Border Apprehensions In FY 2013 Involved UACs. (United States Border Patrol, Sector Profile - Fiscal Year 2013)

* 13.95 Percent Of Rio Grande Valley Apprehensions In FY 2013 Involved UACs. (United States Border Patrol, Sector Profile - Fiscal Year 2013)

* NOTE: No Border Patrol Report Addressing FY 2014 For All Apprehensions Has Been Released, But Gov. Perry's Office Has Been Told That The Number Is In The Range Of 18-20% In FY 2014 So Far. When Asked To Confirm, They Refer Journalists Directly To The Border Patrol.

According To Former Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ronald Coburn, 20 Percent Of Those Crossing The Border Are Criminals

"One In Five, Is Bringing With Him Or Her Their Violent Criminal Tendencies And Records From Their Own Countries". "One in ten of every adult male crosser[s] in this day and age more than likely already has a violent criminal record here in the United States, has been removed, and is returning. Another one in ten, making it one in five, is bringing with him or her their violent criminal tendencies and records from their own countries of which we don't know yet." (Fox News Channel, "Justice With Judge Jeanine," 7/19/2014)

It's worth noting that Border Patrol released this report which has been misreported on: http://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/SWB%20Family%20and%20UAC%20Apps.pdf

The key difference between the numbers cited there, and the ones we use, are that the linked report only accounts for other-than-Mexican apprehensions, which are about half of all apprehensions in Texas.

And there's this:

25 Percent Of All Border Apprehensions Involve Criminals

In FY 2013, Border Patrol Apprehended 420,789 Total Undocumented Aliens. (United States Border Patrol, Sector Profile - Fiscal Year 2013)

In FY 2013, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Removed 106,695 Criminals Aliens Apprehended At The Border. “ICE removed 106,695 criminals apprehended at the border while attempting to unlawfully enter the U.S.” (U.S. Immigrations And Customs Enforcement, ERO Annual Report, FY 2013 ICE Immigration Removals)

Math: 106,695/420,789 = 25.4%

And, according to this

A criminal alien is this "Refers to persons removed who have a prior criminal conviction.

Subject: Border Patrol figures for f13 and this fiscal year

Andrew:

The figures I fielded today from a spokesman for the Border Patrol cover fiscal 2013 and this fiscal year. It looks like both years, about 4 percent of people apprehended in the US-Mexico border region had prior criminal convictions.

In f14, the spokesman told me by phone, 18,422 of 422,146 individuals apprehended in the border region had prior convictions. His email presenting fiscal 2013 figures is below.

This 4 percent calculation contrasts with the 25 percent figure declared by Dewhurst.

Quick question: By "prior conviction" -- are you including foreign or just domestic?

So then I would say that, in response to a broad statement by LTGOV Dewhurst, you asked a narrow question and received an appropriately narrow answer. When LTGOV Dewhurst referred to criminal backgrounds for those apprehended while entering the U.S. illegally, he was not only making reference to "re-crossers" who had been convicted in U.S. courts, but also to individuals whose past criminal activity occurred in their country of origin or in the U.S. prior to their deportation-for-cause instead of a trial. In essence, when tasked with confirming the various species on Noah's Ark, you asked how many zebras were listed on the manifest. The story is bigger than your chosen statistic.
