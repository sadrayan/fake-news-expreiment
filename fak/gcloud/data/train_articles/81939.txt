Marco Rubio says human activity isn't causing climate change
Rubio, who was swept into the Senate in 2010 on a wave of support from tea-party Republicans in Florida, just completed a swing through New Hampshire, the first state that will hold a presidential primary in the 2016 race for the White House. Although he has been a rising star in the GOP, his popularity among conservatives slipped last year after conservative commentators battered him for his role in the Senate's passage of immigration reform legislation last year. (The Republican-controlled House has refused to take up the bill.)
