ASK TOM WHY. Dear Tom, Who coined the word "smog"? Robert...

It's a word with an interesting derivation and, sad to say, a word that poor air quality requires us to use more often than we would prefer to.

London, England, physician Harold Des Veaux coined the word smog in 1905 to describe natural fog contaminated by smoke: smoke + fog yielded smog.

By the early 1900s, the Industrial Revolution in England had been in progress for more than a century and London's naturally moist and foggy air had also grown smoky and sooty from industrial pollution and widespread burning of coal. Since then, the meaning of smog has gradually shifted and today it is a term popularly applied to visible, problematical, largely urban air pollution with or without fog as a constituent.
