The Hon. Patrick Murphy, Florida
Congressman Patrick Murphy represented Florida’s 18th district, covering the Treasure Coast and northern Palm Beach County, from 2013 until 2017.

A CPA and businessman who grew frustrated with the dysfunction in Washington, Murphy took on and defeated Tea Party firebrand Allen West in 2012 in one of the closest and most expensive U.S. House races in history. Two years later, he was re-elected by a 20-point margin.

Murphy’s key accomplishments in office include helping secure nearly $2 billion in Everglades restoration funding, introducing the SAVE Act to eliminate billions in wasteful government spending, and passing legislation to reform the national flood insurance market. One of the first millennials elected to Congress, Murphy formed the bipartisan United Solutions Caucus, bringing members of both parties together to explore ways to get the nation’s fiscal house in order. He was named 2014’s Champion of the Everglades by Audubon Florida for his strong environmental advocacy.

In the House, Murphy served on the Financial Services Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he authored several key national security provisions included in the 2017 intel authorization. Known as a problem-solver able to work across the aisle, Murphy had one of the most independent voting records among all members during his two terms.

After leaving office in 2017, Murphy was named chair of the Future Forum Foundation, a nonprofit group working to address economic issues facing millennials. He was selected to be one of six Visiting Fellows at the prestigious Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service for the fall 2017 semester, and in 2018 became a Senior Fellow at Florida International University’s Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs.

Murphy, 35, resides in Jupiter in Palm Beach County.
