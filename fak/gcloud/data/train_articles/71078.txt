Ballot Access News
New York bills to make it easier for candidates to withdraw from the general election failed to pass the legislature, before the legislature adjourned. S5462 had passed the Senate but did not receive a vote in the Assembly.

The bill would have helped individuals who accept minor party nominations before the major party primaries, and then those same individuals lose their major party primary. Typically such candidates then no longer wish to run in the general election, but they have a very difficult time removing their names (as minor party nominees) from the November ballot. Generally they can only withdraw by accepting the nomination of some party to run for a partisan judicial office.
