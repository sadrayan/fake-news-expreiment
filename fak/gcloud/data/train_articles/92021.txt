The phone number from which the “spoof call” is placed appears to be the number for the NJDOC’s Central Office. When the phone call is answered, the caller says, “Your grandson has been arrested and is requesting that you send bail money.” This is a scam. Technology is available that allows scammers to disguise their actual phone number and make it appear that the call is emanating from an entirely different phone number. Sadly, these kinds of scams are prevalent during the holiday season. Please do not allow yourself to be scammed by these “spoof calls.” Thank you, and happy holidays from the NJDOC. *** Note ***

Statement on Inmate Healthcare

The New Jersey Department of Corrections is committed to providing the best possible healthcare for the men and women committed to its facilities. If you have information or concerns about the health and welfare of an inmate, please call the institution immediately to share your information and/or concerns. We urge you to communicate any information you have about possible suicide or past suicide attempts. You can speak with the facility’s medical staff, or you can contact the shift commander of the facility. Volunteers Sought

The New Jersey Department of Corrections has volunteer opportunities available in multiple areas, including such areas as education, chaplaincy and social services. For more information, go to the Non Profit, Grants, and Volunteer Information page, which will take you to the Web site’s volunteer’s page. “Dedicated to the honor and memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty” Those 18 words grace the New Jersey Department of Corrections’ memorial to its fallen officers, a polished black granite wall, standing four feet high, that was dedicated on the grounds of our Central Office on May 17, 2007. The U.S. Department of Justice provided the department with a grant to fund the memorial. The significance of this memorial cannot be overstated. It is our fervent hope that by recognizing our fallen heroes in this manner, perhaps all of us can gain some measure of appreciation of the impact these brave individuals had on the communities they were sworn to protect as well as the lives of those who knew and loved them.
