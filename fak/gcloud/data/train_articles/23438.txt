Mike DeWine Is Not On Our Side

DeWine wants to take away Ohioans’ health care, sides with the rich and powerful over the middle class, and is standing in the way of a better future for Ohio children.

Now, Mike DeWine wants to be the next governor of Ohio. See for yourself — Mike DeWine is not on our side.
