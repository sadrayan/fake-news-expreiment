The Ford Focus Active Becomes A Casualty Of U.S-China Trade War
Ford sent shock waves through the auto industry back in April when it announced plans to drop virtually all of its passenger cars in the U.S., save for the venerable Mustang. The company instead wants to concentrate its efforts on selling more popular – and profitable – trucks and SUVs. And while the compact Ford Focus was among the models being cancelled, the nameplate itself was not going away entirely. Ford intended to replace it next year with a new small crossover SUV-like wagon imported from China to be called the Focus Active.

Cut to the Labor Day weekend and it’s being reported that Ford is abandoning its plans to bring the Focus Active to these shores. The recently enacted 25% tariffs on $50 billion in goods imported from China – with additional duties threatened – would significantly eat into the vehicle's profits.

General Motors is likewise hinting that the China-built Envision compact crossover SUV could likewise be stripped from Buick's lineup unless the company is granted an exemption to the tariffs.

According to Automotive News, the Focus Active was not planned to be a high-volume ride, with the company predicting fewer than 50,000 annual sales. By contrast, the current Focus sedan and hatchback combo accounted for around 84,000 units delivered just through the end of July. Other than the company is committed to going all in on trucks and truck-flavored models moving forward, one has to assume that a cheaper-to-build Chinese Focus Active would account for a bigger bottom-line despite the lower volume.

While the Focus Active will continue to be built in China and sold elsewhere in the world, unless the situation takes a 180-degree turn sometime soon, this officially marks the demise of the Focus nameplate in the U.S.
