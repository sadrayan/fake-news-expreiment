Good morning. I write because we’re checking Donald Trump’s claim that Ted Cruz “has had double passports.”

Was there a period, any time, when the senator had two passports? My Toronto-born dad, a U.S. citizen, does.

Trump also said some states are looking into Cruz’s eligibility per the “natural-born” citizenship hurdle. Does this claim reflect any state or state party reviews that you’re aware of?

I hope to report out our story today.

Thanks.
