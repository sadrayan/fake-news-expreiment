a reply to: Grambler Yes, we can all fall for things that aren't true, I agree.That said, there's a big difference between bad reporting or opinion pieces and straight up "fake news." Every outlet has examples of bad reporting, particularly with the volume of articles based on anonymous sources recently (especially a single anonymous source) but sites like 100percentfedup, Your News Wire, Conservative Tribune, etc are not media outlets.They don't have reporters, they don't have sources, they don't have access to information or editors or standards or anything else. At best, they're functioning as a news blog that simply takes somebody else's reporting and adds their take to it.More often, they're doing things like this where they cite a random claim from a random anonymous person on Twitter. In the worst cases, some of them actually fabricate entirely, deliberately fraudulent stories, hoping to sucker enough people that they can rake in a few grand in advertising dollars.These sorts of sites do absolutely nothing good for anyone. Any facts that manage to end up on their pages are derived from reporting by some other outlet and most of what they post is garbage.Personally, I think it's up to us as a community to call it out when we see it to keep up standards.We have enough on our collective plates sorting out facts from misinfo from actual media outlets, particularly with this insane news cycle, it's just completely unnecessary to deal with this bull# from fake news sites.Just my opinion.
