Florida Republicans divided as House passes Violence Against Women Act
The U.S. House today passed an updated version of the Violence Against Women Act, handing a victory to Democrats and President Obama.

All Florida Democrats voted yes. Florida Repubilcans were divided.

Voting yes: Vern Buchanan, Ander Crenshaw, Mario Diaz-Balart, Rich Nugent, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dan Webster, C.W. Bill Young.

Voting no: Gus Bilirakis, Ron DeSantis, John Mica, Jeff Miller, Bill Posey, Trey Radel, Tom Rooney, Dennis Ross, Steve Southerland, Ted Yoho.

Roll call here.

The legislation previously cleared the Senate, with Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson voting yes and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio voting no.

Against it but for it: Rubio said he had concerns about how the legislation affected state spending decisions (concerns Nelson's office said were not brought to his attention). But Rubio today issued a news release applauding a section of the bill dealing with human trafficking. “While I remain concerned about other aspects of the overall legislation the TVPRA was amended to, it should not overshadow this important victory for human trafficking victims and their families, as well as the law enforcement, non-profit and charitable organizations devoted to fighting this modern day slavery,” Rubio said in a statement.
