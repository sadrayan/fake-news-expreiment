These Are the Least-Effective Members of Congress
According to a July Gallup poll, public approval of Congress has fallen to near-record lows. On average, 34% of the population approves of a given Congress. The current 114th Congress has a 17% approval rating.

Americans have reason to be concerned. According to GovTrack.us, the last two Congresses have enacted fewer laws than any other Congress since 1947. And the 114th Congress may just surpass them all in terms of doing nothing.

House Speaker John Boehner has argued that “We ought to be judged on how many laws we repeal"—not by the laws they pass. Even by that metric, Boehner’s Congress is still underperforming as a law must be passed to repeal another one.

While Congress has been inefficient across the board, some members have been exceptionally unexceptional. Using data from GovTrack, InsideGov created an Effectiveness Score to determine the least-effective members of Congress.

The effectiveness score is the percentage of bills sponsored by each congressperson over their time in office that went on to pass committee. The score does not factor in the percentage of bills that turned into law because such a small number of proposed bills and resolutions actually become laws.

While it’s true that some congresspeople intentionally make an effort to stymie fast-tracked legislation, the members on this list are sponsoring their own legislation and not getting it passed through committee.

This list only includes members of Congress who have served at least one full term and does not include bills introduced in the 114th Congress, since they still have time to get passed.

These are the 35 least-effective members of Congress. See if your representatives make the list:
