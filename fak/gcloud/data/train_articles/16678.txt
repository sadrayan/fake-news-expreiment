Subject: Texas reporter, inquiry for fact-check

Good morning. On behalf of the PolitiFact Texas fact-checking project, I seek the latest available data for babies born, by state. Is there any information available providing more detail or more recent counts than what's in Table 10 of this report? Https:/www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_01.pdf

We also would welcome information and analysis covering more years. For instance, how long has Texas accounted for 1 in 10 US-born babies? When did this change?

As ever, we seek on-the-record attributable assistance.

Thanks,

W. Gardner Selby
