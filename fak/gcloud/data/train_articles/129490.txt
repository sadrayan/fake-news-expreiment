Kroger is helping to promote healthy eating by offering a piece of free fruit to kids when they are shopping with a parent!

According to their press release, the new Free Fruit for Kids promotion will be taking place in every Kroger in the Triangle. There will be a basket stocked with fresh fruit such as bananas, apples and clementines at each store. At times, there may be other fruits available as well.

The offer is available for kids under the age of 12 who are shopping with a parent or guardian. They can select their own piece of fruit from the basket.

“At Kroger we understand the importance of encouraging kids to eat healthy foods,” said Anne Jenkins, spokesperson for Kroger’s Mid-Atlantic Division. “Through our Free Fresh Fruit for Kids promotion, we hope children will become excited to eat more fruit and, in turn, develop positive attitudes toward other healthy foods that contribute to their overall wellness.”

I love this idea! It is so much better than giving kids cookies. What do you think?
