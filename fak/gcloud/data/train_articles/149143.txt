In the flashback scene, when Sheriff Hiram Stoker is trying to get Linus to sign the confession, he asks Linus at one point if he knew where the stick used to kill the Ellerby girls was. If the murder weapon had not been recovered at this point, Sheriff Stoker would have had no way of knowing a stick of wood was the murder weapon. Only the killer could have known this. The kind of head injuries the Ellerby girls likely sustained could have been caused by any blunt object. See more
