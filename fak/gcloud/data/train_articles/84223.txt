You Can Stop Sharing That Meme: ESPN Confirms There Was Never A ‘Runner-Up’ For Caitlyn Jenner's Arthur Ashe Award

Since Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover debuted on Monday, the Internet -- and the world at large -- has been buzzing. That same day, ESPN also announced that Jenner would receive the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2015 ESPYs. But almost as soon as that announcement was made, some eyebrow-raising misinformation began making the rounds on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Specifically, this image of U.S. army vet Noah Galloway, along with the assertion that Jenner was essentially standing in the way of the brave soldier's shot at the award:

In a statement to MTV News on Wednesday (June 3), an ESPN spokesperson confirmed there is "no such thing as a runner up for the three major awards," referring to the Arthur Ashe Courage award, the Pat Tillman Award for Service and the Jimmy V Perseverance Award.

"The Arthur Ashe Courage Award is meant to honor individuals whose contributions transcend sports through courageous action," ESPN posted later today, "At all times, there are many worthy candidates. This year, we are proud to honor Caitlyn Jenner embracing her identity and doing so in a public way to help move forward a constructive dialogue about progress and acceptance."

While the exact origin of the image is uncertain, Snopes.com suggests it might have originated from this tweet by Boston-area sports columnist and radio personality Gerry Callahan:

MTV News has reached out to Callahan for comment as well and will follow up on this story.
