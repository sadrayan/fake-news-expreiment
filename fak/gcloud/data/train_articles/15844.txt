· Austin Technology Council, Technology Economic Impact Report – Press Release, 5/2013 – “The Austin Technology Council (ATC) today released the results of its Technology Economic Impact Report which reveals not only the incredible impact the technology industry has made on Austin's economy, but also the growing talent gap. The Impact Report finds technology is generating billions of dollars annually and driving more than a quarter of Austin's local economy. With nearly 80 percent of all technology companies in Austin expecting to hire this year, and more than 10,000 new tech jobs anticipated before 2017, Austin will be strengthening the local talent pipeline to meet these demands.”

· Austin Technology Council, Economic Study, 5/2013 – “While a respectable 9% of total employment is in technology (more than 100,000 jobs), more than one-third of all jobs in the Austin economy are supported by the technology sector, including direct hiring and spinoff hiring activity. The sector accounts for a whopping 21% of Central Texas’ gross regional product (GRP) and contributes $21B in direct value to the local economy.”
