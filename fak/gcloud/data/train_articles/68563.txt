The Zika virus may no longer just be something that affects people living in parts of Central and South America or the unlucky American traveler who becomes infected in those places. Now the CDC is preparing for an increase in cases in this country.

According to Ars Technica, CDC Director Tom Frieden said that the agency expects clusters of the virus to pop up on the U.S. mainland in the next several months. The mosquitoes that spread the virus are the same ones that spread viruses like dengue and chikungunya, which often result in small outbreaks in humid places like Texas and Florida. The same thing could occur with Zika (the virus can also be spread as an STI).
