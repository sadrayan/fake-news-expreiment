Email, Manny Garcia, executive director, Texas Democratic Party, Aug. 25, 2016

2:24 p.m.

Please attribute the following to Texas Democratic Party Deputy Executive Director Manny Garcia:

“Texas’ diverse new majority has a number of ideological perspectives, conservative,

liberal, and moderate. In fact, a recent University of Texas Texas Politics

Project poll asks Texans where they consider themselves on the ideological

scale, 39% said in the middle.

“Texas Democrats are glad to welcome all Texans to our big tent party.

“Now, if "conservative" is code for "Republican" then Sean Hannity simply doesn’t know Texas.

Texas' diverse new majority consists of many communities that historically

support the Democratic Party. It only takes a simple look at Dallas, Houston,

Austin, the Rio Grande Valley, El Paso, and San Antonio to see that Democrats

in local partisan and nonpartisan offices are delivering solutions for Texas

families every single day.”
