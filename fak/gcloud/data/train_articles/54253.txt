Enhancing the Transparency of Resource Extraction Revenue Payments
Today, as required by Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act,[1] the Commission re-proposes rules that would create a new disclosure regime for payments made to a government by oil, natural gas, and mining companies for the purpose of the commercial development of a country’s natural resources.[2] This type of disclosure is consistent with an emerging global consensus to combat government corruption through greater transparency and accountability.[3] Today’s re-proposed rules are consistent with those global efforts.[4]

The Congressional mandate under Section 1504 has proven to be among the more controversial rules that the Commission has been required to undertake under the Dodd-Frank Act. When the Commission originally proposed rules under Section 1504 back in December 2010, it received over 149,000 comment letters from corporations, industry and professional associations, government officials (both foreign and domestic), non-governmental organizations, academics and other interested parties, with over 150 individual letters and the rest form letters.[5] These comment letters represented a wide variety of viewpoints from both those supportive of the rulemaking and those opposed.[6] Reflecting the difficult nature of this rulemaking, after the Commission adopted final resource extraction disclosure rules in August 2012, these rules were challenged in court and ultimately, in July 2013, vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.[7]

As a result of the rules being vacated, the Congressional mandate under Section 1504 remained unresolved.[8] Subsequently, on September 2, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts ordered the Commission to meet its obligation under Section 1504 and to file an expedited schedule for promulgating final resource extraction rules.[9] In doing so, the Court noted that despite the Commission’s originally adopted rules having been vacated, the Commission’s “duty to promulgate a final extraction payments disclosure rule remains unfulfilled more than four years past Congress’s deadline.”[10] In response to the Court’s direction, on October 2, 2015, the Commission filed a proposed schedule to complete the required rulemaking, including re-proposing the resource extraction rules before the end of the year.[11] Today’s proposed rulemaking thus represents an important step forward in both responding to the Court’s direction and in faithfully completing the Congressional mandate.

It’s noteworthy that during the period following the Commission’s original adoption of the resource extraction rules, global efforts to increase the transparency for resource extraction payments have continued to advance. For example, since the Commission first adopted its resource extraction rules in 2012, other jurisdictions have move forward in their efforts to increase the transparency of resource extraction payments, including the following:

In June and October of 2013, the European Union (EU) Parliament and Council adopted two directives—the EU Accounting Directive and the EU Transparency Directive, respectively (the “EU Directives”). These EU Directives require oil, gas, mining, and logging companies to disclose payments they make to governments on a per government and per project basis.[12] In 2014, the United Kingdom became the first of the EU member states to implement the EU Accounting Directive, which has since been implemented by 11 other EU member states;[13]

In December 2013, Norway adopted rules requiring resource extraction companies to disclose payments to governments on a project level;[14] and

In December 2014, the Canadian government adopted a federal resource extraction disclosure regime similar to the Commission’s originally adopted resource extraction rules, known as the Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act (“ESTMA”).[15]

Furthermore, following the Commission’s original 2012 adoption of the resource extraction rules, global companies in the extractive industry began to provide, on a voluntary basis, more comprehensive disclosures of their resource extraction payments to governments.[16] For example, at least two large resource extraction companies already provide payment disclosure on a project basis,[17] and at least one other major resource extraction company voluntarily provides such disclosure on a per country and/or legal entity basis.[18] Other global companies are also beginning to open their books to permit a window into their resource extraction payments to foreign governments.[19]

Indeed, driven in part by the recent global developments in resource extraction disclosure legislation, industry representatives, human rights and environmental advocacy groups, and other government agencies have written the SEC to press for new resource extraction disclosure rules.[20]

That brings us to today.

Today’s re-proposed rules strive to faithfully implement the Congressional intent to increase transparency and accountability in the resource extraction sector. In doing so, the Commission has endeavored to comprehensively consider all viewpoints; and it has carefully considered what is occurring internationally.[21]

In the end, the rules being re-proposed today fulfill the Commission’s Congressional mandate, meet the conditions of the District Court’s order, and are consistent with the emerging global consensus to fight corruption through enhanced disclosure of resource extraction payments to governments.

Conclusion

In closing, I will support today’s re-proposing release on resource extraction disclosure. In my view, today’s rules reflect a deliberate, careful, and well-reasoned approach.

I would like to thank the staff from the Division of Corporation Finance, the Division of Economic Research and Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel for their work on this rulemaking. I appreciate your dedication and the important work that you do to protect investors.

Thank you.
