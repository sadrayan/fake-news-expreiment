U.S. Vetoes U.N. Resolution Condemning Move on Jerusalem
In his speech this month announcing plans to move the embassy from Tel Aviv, President Trump called the decision, which had been a key campaign promise, “the right thing to do.” Critics said that in seeking to reward his political base at home, the president potentially sacrificed stability in the Middle East.

Since the announcement, violence in the region has escalated. There have been at least 27 rocket attacks from Gaza and clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian demonstrators, along with calls by some for a new Palestinian uprising, Nickolay E. Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, told the Security Council.

Israel seized eastern Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and has declared the entire city to be its eternal and undivided capital. Disagreement over the city’s status has been a central impediment to peace in the region ever since.

Already there are signs that Mr. Trump’s decision has eroded the ability of the United States to act as an impartial arbiter in the peace process.

The Palestinian Authority’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, who had planned to meet Vice President Mike Pence on a visit to Jerusalem this week, canceled that meeting in protest. On Monday afternoon, Mr. Pence postponed his trip until January.

Riyad H. Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council that the Trump administration’s decision on Jerusalem reflected its “glaring bias” toward Israel and had “undermined its role in any future peace process.”

Israel praised the United States for standing with it. In a video statement posted on Twitter moments after the vote, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, compared Ms. Haley to the Maccabees, Jewish fighters whose capture of Jerusalem in the second century B.C. is commemorated during Hanukkah.
