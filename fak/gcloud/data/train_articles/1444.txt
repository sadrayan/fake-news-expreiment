Governor Goes Easy On Vetoes In Signing Budget
TALLAHASSEE â€” Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed a modest $107 million in programs and projects Wednesday from Florida's $50.4 billion budget, suspending three years of spending conflicts with legislators just as he launches his re-election campaign.

Siding with environmentalists, he also killed legislative efforts to spend $100 million from a land-buying program on unrelated items.

Bush said he used a light touch with his veto pen because legislators finally have learned their lesson after seeing him strike out a record $915 million in hometown projects since 1999.

"After three years of quite a bit of conflict ... the Legislature has listened rather well this year, and the amount of money to be vetoed is significantly less," Bush said. "This is all about policy and principle."

But Democrats said politics played heavily into Bush's approach. With the Republican governor campaigning statewide, he is loath to antagonize local communities or legislators by slashing pet projects, they said.

"It's a political budget for a political year," said Ryan Banfill, spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party. "He wants to have his legislative friends standing by him when he goes around Florida saying what great things he's done."

Several Democratic legislators said they don't expect Bush to treat them so gently again.

"He's aware of how most legislators are still angry at him for previous years' vetoes," said Sen. Steven Geller, D-Hallandale Beach. "Next year, if he's elected, he'll go back to his old ways."

Bush killed the Legislature's bid to transfer $100 million from the Florida Forever land-buying program and scatter it elsewhere in the budget.

Bush had been lobbied hard by environmentalists to block what they condemned as a "raid" on efforts to preserve sensitive lands.
