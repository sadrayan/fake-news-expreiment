Congressman Phil Gingrey, M.D.
Rep. Phil Gingrey today expressed his opposition to President Obama’s request for congressional authorization to use military force in the ongoing conflict in Syria:

“The use of chemical weapons is a reprehensible atrocity and should be universally condemned,” said Rep. Gingrey. “However, after receiving a classified intelligence briefing, meeting with top foreign policy advisors, and considering the hundreds of appeals I’ve received from concerned constituents, I’ve concluded that U.S. action in Syria would be imprudent. With so many unanswered questions, we simply cannot risk getting mired down in the Syrian civil war – especially when our security interests aren’t being directly threatened.”
