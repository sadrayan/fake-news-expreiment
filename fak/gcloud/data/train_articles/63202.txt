WEBVTT WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT HE NEEDS TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM CHANCES ARE, YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF HER. FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING IN THE. SHE IS TALKING ABOUT WHO SHE IS ON WHY SHE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AFTER HER CAMPAIGN REBOOTED IN THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF HER PRESIDENCY AND SHE IS BACK. GREAT TO SEE YOU. >> NICE TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR HAVING ME >> IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS OF YOUR CAMPAIGN, YOU'RE CRITICIZED FOR MORE OR LESS BEING IN A BUBBLE, KIND OF A PROTECTIVE SHELL. WHAT WAS THE INITIAL ROLE OF THE FIRST COUPLE OF MILES. >> WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO TRY TO HAVE AS MANY CONVERSATIONS AS I POSSIBLY COULD WITH OBVIOUSLY VOTERS BUT PEOPLE WHO HAD ISSUES ON THEIR MINDS, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH, PEOPLE WHO HAD STUDENT LOAN. I SPENT THE FIRST TWO MONTHS DOING THAT. IT WAS MY PLAN. IT WAS NOT A REBOOT. IT WAS WHAT I DID WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE BACK IN NEW YORK IN 1999 BECAUSE I HAD NOT BEEN IN POLITICS SINCE I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE. I HAD FOLLOWED CLOSELY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION. I WANTED THA EFFECTIVE TALKING TO PEOPLE. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I HAD A PRESS OF ALE WITH A NEW HAMPSHIRE PRESS AND NATIONAL PRESS AND WE WILL DO A LOT OF THAT GOING FORWARD. I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO BE GROUNDED IN THE DAY TODAY EXPERIENCES OF THE PEOPLE I AM ASKING TO VOTE FOR ME. >> THE MEDIA SAID THIS IS A MECHANISM TO AVOID ANSWERING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. YOU WERE CRITICIZED FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, THE ASSERTION THAT YOU USE YOUR IMPLEMENT AND SPEAKING FEES ON BEHALF OF FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. >> I HAVE NO PROBLEM A ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS. WE ARE PROUD OF THE WORK OF THE FOUNDATION WHAT MY HUSBAND INVENTED WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SAVING LIVES AROUND THE WORLD FROM HIV-AIDS AND HELPING YOUNG KIDS IN AMERICA GET MORE FIT AND INCREASING PRODUCTION ON SMALL FARMS IN AFRICA AND SO MUCH MORE. IT MERITS THE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHO HAS BEEN COMING FORWARD TO DONATE AS THEY DO TO ANY PHILANTHROPY. I THINK PART OF THE INTERESTING BEST TO THIS IS MOST FOUNDATIONS , CHARITIES DO NOT PUBLISH ALL OF THEIR CONTRIBUTORS. THE CLINTON FOUNDATION DOES. IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE GREAT THINGS THE FOUNDATION DOES, THEY TAKE DONATIONS FROM EVERYWHERE. THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT THE WORK OF THE FOUNDATION THAT IN ANY WAY WAS USED TO INFLUENCE ANY DECISION I MADE AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT. I MADE THOSE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT OUR POLICIES WERE AS I WAS FULFILLING THEM ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AND WHAT WAS IN THE INTEREST AND SECURITY AND ACCORDANCE WITH THE VALUES OF OUR COUNTRY. >> WOULD YOU AGREE THERE IS AN APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT? URANIUM ONE IS AN EXAMPLE THAT WAS SOLD TO RUSH AND REQUIRED YOUR APPROVAL. YOUR APPROVAL AS WELL. IT WAS A HALF-MILLION DOLLAR SPEAKING FEE FOR YOUR HUSBAND BIT >> I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ENOUGH TIM TO DEBUNK ALL OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS. THERE WERE NINE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHO HAD TO SIGN OFF ON THAT DEAL AND I WAS NOT PERSONALLY INVOLVED BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THE SECRETARY OF STATE DID. WE CAN HAVE A WHOLE SHOW DEBUNKING THESE REALLY WHILE THE USE BECAUSE THE ALLEGATION COMES FORWARD AND YOU ARE IN THE PRESS AND YOU HAVE TO ASK WHAT IS GEOGHAN IT'S YOUR JOB TO SAY WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE BUT, IF YOU TAKE FROM POINT B AND CONNECTED TO POINT Z, MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON AND IN FACT THERE ISN'T. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS WHO ARE SUPPORTERS BUT THEY PAUSE WHEN THEY HEAR THESE CRITICISMS? EISAI JUDGE ME ON MY WHOLE RECORD. WHAT PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TALKED TO ME ABOUT IS THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND THERE STUDENT LOANS AND ABOUT HOW THEY CAN START AND GROW A NEW BUSINESS, ABOUT THE KIND OF CONCERNS THEY HAVE ABOUT TERRORISM AND THE LIKE. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT. I THINK WHAT VOTERS KNOW AND WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN WILL SHOW IS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO ASK AND ANSWER FOR THEMSELVES IS WHO CAN FIGHT FOR ME AND MY FAMILY, OUR COUNTRY, TO IS ON THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE FOOTING. I WANT TO STAND UP THERE AND SAY IN THIS CAMPAIGN -- I AM PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY. I AM PROUD OF ALL OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND GRATEFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEFENDED IT AND SERVED IN THE MILITARY AS I AM GRATEFUL FOR EVERYONE WHO IS MADE A CONTRIBUTION AND SO MUCH TO GIVE US THE COUNTRY WE LOVE. BUT EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE. LET'S ASK OURSELVES WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES WE FACE TODAY AND HOW WILL WE MEET THEM? THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE IN I TRUST THE VOTERS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE TO MAKE THAT DECISION. WHEN ALL THE DUST SETTLES AND THE REAL CONCERNS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE HEARD, THEY WILL SEE I AM SOMEBODY WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY -- PEOPLE HAVE SAID A LOT ABOUT ME AND THEM CALLED ME NAMES BUT THEY HAVE NEVER CALLED ME ACHE THERE. I WILL FIGHT TO -- BUT THEY'VE NEVER CALLED ME QUITTER. ONE TOPICAL ISSUE IS THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP DEAL. ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AND THE WHITE HOUSE CAME OUT SURPRISED THIS WEEK THAT YOU DID NOT HAVE THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT THEY FELT YOU WOULD FOR THIS DEAL WHICH HAS BEEN DERAILED IN CONGRESS >> WHAT I HAVE SAID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING -- MY GOAL FOR T IS -- FOR THIS IS TO PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS AND CREATE MORE JOBS THAT ARE MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS AND TO BE ALIGNED WITH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I HAVE SAID THAT FROM THE BEGINNING BUT I HAVE ALSO SAID IT'S GOT TO BE THE RIGHT DEAL. WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE, I VOTED FOR TRADE DEALS I THOUGHT WERE GOOD FOR AMERICA. THE WHOLE QUESTION ABOUT NOT THAT ABOUT PUTTING ON A FAST TRACK IS SOMETHING FOR THE CONGRESS TO DECIDE. I WILL JUDGE THE AGREEMENT BUT WHEN IT WAS STOPPED IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE OF DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION ON FRIDAY, I SAID LET'S TAKE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS WHO ARE NOT GO TRADE BUT SAY THEY WANT A BETT DEAL. I THINK THE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS HAVE GOOD IDEAS HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER AND SEE IF THEY CAN USE THAT LEVERAGE TO BRING THAT ABOUT IT I WILL STILL JUDGE THE DEAL WHETHER IT IS GOOD FOR AMERICA. >> SO YOU THINK IT NEEDS SOME WORK. >> I DO BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED ARE ONES THAT HAVE TO BE ANSWERED. EVEN IN MY BOOK THAT CAME OUT LAST SUMMER, I SAID I AM WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THEVESTER STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT ISSUE. IF A COMPANY THINK [INDISCERNIBLE] I DON'T LIKE THAT AND I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT. I AM WORRIED ABOUT THAT. IT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED AND MAKE PEOPLE BESIDE THE CORPORATIONS, MAY BE AN ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCACY GROUPS OR HEALTH GROUPS OR LOCAL GROUPS TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE. I THINK THERE ARE SOME CHANGES THAT COULD MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE AND I HOPE THEY TRY TO DO THAT. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE HACKING SCANDAL OF FEDERAL WORKERS. DO YOU CONSIDER THAT -- THE PRESIDENT STOPPED FINGERS. FROM WHAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT, IS IT A CASE OF CYBER WARFARE? >> I CONSIDER IT A CYBER ATTACK. OUR PRIVATE SECTOR HAS BEEN ATTACKED LIKE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SON AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY FOREIGN INTERESTS. THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO SUCK UP INFORMATION FOR COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE OR FRANKLY THERE ARE THINGS LIKE THE ATTACK ON THE OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CASES. I AM TALKING ABOUT IT AND I WILL RAISE IT IN THE CAMPAIGN. YOU ARE IN THE MARINES, RIGHT? >> YES. WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED ON EVERY KIND OF DEFENSE. WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT, IN THE HANDS OF EITHER STATES THAT WISH US ILL OR GROUPS BE THEY TERRORIST GROUPS OR HACKER GROUPS OUT FOR MONEY AND PERSONAL GAIN, OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS AT RISK. THIS INFORMATION TAKEN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN BE USED TO HARASS, MAYBE IMPRISON PEOPLE WHO OUR OFFICIALS TALK TO TO GET INFORMATION IF THEIR NAMES ARE PART OF THE BROAD DATA COLLECTED FOR TOP-SECRET CLEARANCE. IT'S A SERIOUS THREAT. >> WHAT KIND OF APPROACH DOES THE SECRETARY OF STATE NEED TO TAKE QUESTION MARK HE IS ON THE FRONT LINES TO NAVIGATE THE DIPLOMACY. >> YOU ARE 100% RIGHT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS ATTACKED AT LEAST EVERY DAY WHILE I WAS THERE. MANY OF THOSE WERE REPELLED BY THE SECURITY PROTECTIONS THAT WERE IN THE SYSTEM. WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS. THE PRESIDENT HAS PERSONAL E-MA WAS GONE AFTER ON THE WHITE HOUSE SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO GIVE THIS THE HIGHEST PURITY. WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT GOVERNMENT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT'S IN BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO PROTECT THEIR BUSINESSES. SOME OF THESE ATTACKS -- WE KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR DEFENSE CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN TARGETED TO PULL OUT THE PLANS FOR THE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY THAT THEY ARE BUILDING FOR THE AMERICAN MILITARY. WE KNOW THERE IS REVERSE ENGINEERING BEING DONE. WE KNOW COMPANIES THAT ARE BACKED BY GOVERNMENTS EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARE TRYING TO SEIZE ADVANTAGE BY GETTING COMPETITIVE INFORMATION FROM EYES. >> WE ARE JUST ABOUT OUT OF TIME BUT YOU HAD TO RE-LAUNCH LAST WEEK AND YOU SAID THIS IS PART OF YOUR PLAN. WHAT CAN A VOTER PLAN ON SEEING DIFFERENTLY? >> I WANTED TO SPEND THE FIRST 30-60 DAYS REALLY FILLING UP MY MIND WITH THE STORIES AND FACES OF PEOPLE. ANOTHER -- I WILL REMEMBER HER STORY. THEN I WANTED TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL LAUNCH. WE HAD A SOFT LAUNCH ON THE INTERNET, A WONDERFUL DIGITAL LAUNCH BUT I WANTED TO GO TO A SYMBOLIC PLACE WHICH I CHOSE BEFORE FREEDOM'S PARK ON ROOSEVELT ISLAND IN HONOR OF THE INCREDIBLE SPEECH OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TO LAY OUT MY AGENDA. FOR THE SUMMER, I WILL ROLL OUT SPECIFIC POLICIES. I WILL TELL YOU HOW I WANT TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE AND HELP PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF DEBT GET OUT FROM UNDER AND UP AS A BURDEN ON THEIR FUTURE AND ALL THE OTHER POLICIES. I WILL DO MORE EVENTS LIKE I JUST DID AT THE ORCHARD TO GET SOME ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY GOING BUT TO GIVE MORE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO SEE ME. I WILL DO TOWN HALLS AND POLICY SPEECHES -- IT WILL BE THE FULL COURT PRESS AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING HERE IN THE SUMMERTIME.
