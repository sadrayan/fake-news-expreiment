Press Release
Regarding this morning's statements by the President of the United States of America regarding various issues of the bilateral relationship, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico states the following:

1. As the Mexican government has always stated, our country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on US territory along the Mexican border. This statement is not part of a Mexican negotiating strategy, but rather a principle of national sovereignty and dignity.

2. With regard to the violence generated in Mexico by the illicit drugs, arms and money trafficking between our countries, the Mexican Government reiterates that it is a shared problem that will only end if its root causes are addressed: high demand for drugs in the United States and supply from Mexico (and other countries). Transnational criminal organizations have killed thousands of Mexicans, including members of the Armed Forces and police officers, and thousands of Americans. Only on the basis of the principles of shared responsibility, teamwork and mutual trust will we be able to overcome this challenge.

3. Mexico's position at the renegotiation table of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will continue to be serious and constructive, always putting our national interests first, and seeking a beneficial result whereby the three North American countries win.

4. Mexico will not negotiate NAFTA, nor any other aspect of the bilateral relationship, through social media or any other news platform.

The Mexican government takes this opportunity to express its full solidarity with the people and government of the United States as a result of the damages caused by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and expresses that it has offered to provide help and cooperation to the US government in order to deal with the impact of this natural disaster â€”as good neighbors should always do in trying times.
