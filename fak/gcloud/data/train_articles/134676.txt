Paula White Ministries
"This was my 3rd conference and to me, it gets better each year. I want to thank everyone for all of their hard work to make it great for us. Pastor Paula has so much strength and courage. The church makes you feel welcome not only at the conference but all of the time. I love being around other believers. Word from Pastor Paula was LIVE. That is true because we don't know what tomorrow could bring."
