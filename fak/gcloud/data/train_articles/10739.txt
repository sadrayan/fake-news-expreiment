Mr. Roth, 67 years old, is chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, a real-estate investment trust that's one of the country's largest owners of retail and office space. He declined to comment.

Set on 1.2 acres, the shingled, 3,000-square-foot home on New York's Long Island was put on the market by U.S. Marshals in September as part of the effort to repay the victims of Mr. Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The home garnered four bids, fetching more than its $8.75 million asking price. The sale closed last Friday. The property has 182 feet of ocean frontage, four bedrooms, three baths, a deck and a pool.

The Madoffs purchased the land, minus some waterfront acreage, for $250,000 in the early 1980s. They later built the home and then added about 0.1 acre of waterfront for $20,000. Two other Madoff properties seized by federal authorities remain on the market: a duplex penthouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side, listed at $9.9 million, and a Palm Beach mansion, for $8.5 million.

The listing agents were Joan Hegner and Raymond Hegner of Corcoran Group. Ed Petrie of Sotheby's International Realty's East Hampton brokerage represented Mr. Roth.

After Spending $50 Million, Estate Owner Seeks Leasers

Real-estate investor Jeff Greene made a fortune betting against subprime mortgages, but the housing market cratered before he could sell an investment property in Beverly Hills, Calif. Now, he's put the 25-acre estate up for lease for $250,000 a month.

Mr. Greene, 54 years old, bought the unfinished property out of receivership for $35 million in 2006 and has spent nearly three years and $15 million finishing it. The 43,000-square-foot main house has 11 bedrooms, 14 baths and a 6,000-square-foot ballroom. Six acres of vineyards produce 400 cases of wine annually.

In 2007, Mr. Greene held a wedding on the property with boxer Mike Tyson as his best man, but says the home is too lavish for him and his wife to occupy full-time. They spend most of their time at a Miami condominium. "I felt this was a $100 million propertyâ€”if the market hadn't collapsed," Mr. Greene said in an interview. Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula of Coldwell Banker Previews International share the listing.

Former Pillsbury Mansion

A family compound outside Minneapolis that belonged to the baked-goods Pillsbury family, last offered for $53.5 million, is being auctioned.

On 13 acres in Wayzata, Minn., the estate has seven buildings, including a 1918 brick traditional house of about 40,000 square feet with nine bedrooms, 16 bathrooms and nine fireplaces. The estate, on a peninsula, has a dock and about 1,700 feet of Lake Minnetonka frontage. The property was the longtime home of Eleanor Pillsbury, who died there at age 104. The current owners, James and Joann Jundt, bought the property in the early 1990s and spent three years restoring it according to original plans. The property can be split into as many as five parcels. Sheldon Good & Company is handling the sealed bid auction. The deadline for bids is Dec. 9.
