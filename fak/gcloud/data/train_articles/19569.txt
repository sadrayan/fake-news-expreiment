Manchin Applauds New Trump Energy Policy, and Help for Coal Miners • Joe Manchin for Senate
CHARLESTON, WV —Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin announced that he supports the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed Affordable Clean Energy plan that will replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. Manchin’s consistent support for West Virginia’s coal miners is one of the many reasons that coal miners across West Virginia have endorsed Manchin for re-election. See video of the UMWA endorsement here.

U.S. Senator Joe Manchin issued the following statement:

“I have spoken out against the Clean Power Plan since day one, and I am pleased that we are closer to ending this failed policy that hurt West Virginia. I’m proud that the U.S. Senate and the House passed my resolution to roll back President Obama’s dangerous regulation. I am hopeful that this new approach from the Trump Administration will help stabilize energy jobs.

“It’s an honor to have the United Mine Workers and coal miners across our state stand with me in this campaign. This is a perfect example of how President Trump and I can work together on something that’s good for West Virginia. Our next win will be securing coal miner pensions.”

Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers, released the following statement:

“There is no Senator who fights harder for coal miners every day in Washington than Joe Manchin. The new EPA plan is a big improvement over the last one, and that is due in large part to the work the UMWA and Sen. Manchin have done over the last three years to protect coal miners’ jobs. We appreciate his tremendous work on behalf of active and retired coal miners, their families and their communities.”
