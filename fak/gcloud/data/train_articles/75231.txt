ACC schools lead nation in athletic directors' guaranteed pay
Atlantic Coast Conference schools lead the nation in athletic director compensation, and no conference has more ADs making north of $1 million guaranteed annually. Those are among the results of a survey released this week by AthleticDirectorU.com, in conjunction with USA Today and the law firm Spencer Fane.

The database charts the most recent pay, not including bonuses, for 114 of the Football Bowl Subdivision’s 129 athletic directors — some private schools and service academies declined to provide information.

While the ACC trails its Power Five peers, especially the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten, in per-school revenue sharing, it leads the AD compensation survey for one primary reason.

At $2,760,842, Louisville’s Tom Jurich was the FBS’ highest-paid athletic director and among four in the ACC making more than $1 million. Each of the four is in his 60s and has been on the job at least nine years, reflecting experience and accomplishment, plus a graying of the guard — six of the league’s 15 ADs are 60 or older, and Commissioner John Swofford is 68.

The survey, which showed overall FBS pay increasing 31.9 percent in the last five years, calculated the ACC average at $1,079,455 but did not include Notre Dame’s Jack Swarbrick. I did, which bumps the average to $1,089,010.

Regardless, the ACC leads the SEC ($892,902 and all 14 schools reporting), Big Ten ($870,536, all schools included), Big 12 ($838,794, Baylor excluded) and Pacific 12 ($695,292, Stanford and Southern California excluded).

Four of the seven Power Five schools for which data was unavailable hail from the ACC: Boston College, Pittsburgh, Miami and Syracuse. Moreover, BC’s Martin Jarmond and Pitt’s Heather Lyke are recent hires.

But while that group, on average, might make less than conference peers, the ACC’s true average may be even higher than reported. As authors Robert Lattinville and Roger Denny of Spencer Fane noted in their methodology, Jurich is contracted with not only the university but also its foundation, and his salary may be far more than shown.

Jurich may also be Division I's most inundated athletic director, from Louisville's NCAA mess, its foundation scandal and a new arena lease deal that will cost his department an extra $2 million-plus a year.

Other ACC observations from the survey:

# Among the 11 league ADs in the survey, Virginia’s Craig Littlepage ($562,000) had the lowest guaranteed pay by more than $100,000 — North Carolina’s Bubba Cunningham was next at $682,268. But unlike most ADs, who have various bonuses tied to measurable team and department accomplishments, Littlepage is eligible for a bonus “not to exceed $175,000,” based on an assessment by university president Teresa Sullivan.

# Wake Forest and Georgia Tech, which reported Power Five-low 2015-16 revenue of $62.0 million and $62.4 million, respectively, to the U.S. Department of Education, pay their athletic directors well. Wake’s Ron Wellman, the dean of the league’s ADs at 69 and with 25 years on the job, made $1,106,115. Georgia Tech’s Todd Stansbury earns $912,000.

# The average age of ACC athletic directors, 57, is in line with the Power Five norm of 56.

# The ACC’s four million-dollar ADs match the SEC. The Big Ten and Big 12 have three, the Pac-12 one.

# Clemson’s Dan Radakovich, named the 2017 Athletic Director of the Year by the Sports Business Journal, is seventh among the 11 ACC ADs in the database at $875,000. That said, 875 large goes a long way in Pickens County, S.C.

Naturally, average pay in the Power Five conferences ($876,925) towered over that in the Group of Five ($320,385). Old Dominion’s Wood Selig was well above the G5 average at $422,913, which ranked second in Conference USA.

Here are charts listing AD pay for the ACC and Conference USA. I included the ages for the ACC athletic directors.
