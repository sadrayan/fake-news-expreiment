Although Fox News The FB Page is deliberately styled to visually mimic the official Fox News Facebook page, the two entities are not affiliated. Fox News The FB Page appears to be the social media presence of website TDTAlliance.com, which primarily exists to satirize actual Fox News reporting and has published fake stories about Carly Fiorina, Bernie Sanders, and President Obama.
