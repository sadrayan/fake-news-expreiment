Propane Tank Exchange Program
Blue Rhino Propane Cylinder Exchange

Do you need more propane for your grill, turkey fryer or mosquito eliminator? Then take your empty cylinder to a Wal-Mart store and exchange it for a full cylinder. You'll get a clean, rust-free cylinder that has an overfill protection device (OPD) and has been precisely filled in the Blue Rhino production facilities. And if you have an obsolete cylinder that can't be refilled because it doesn't have an OPD, we can still exchange it for you.

You simply leave your empty cylinder at the propane display outside a Wal-Mart store. Then go tell the cashier that you want to make an exchange. After paying the cashier, go back to the display and an Associate will give you a full cylinder.

Prices are:

$15.74

to exchange an obsolete cylinder or an OPD-equipped cylinder for a full OPD-equipped cylinder. Your obsolete cylinder will be re-cycled.

$41.92

to purchase a full OPD-equipped cylinder. You don't have to leave a cylinder with us.



About Overfill Protection Devices and Obsolete Cylinders

All Blue Rhino cylinders are manufactured with overfill protection devices (OPD) to comply with the 2002 consumer safety code of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). These cylinders have a specially calibrated float that stops incoming propane before an unsafe fill level is reached. OPD-equipped cylinders all have triangular handwheels that are stamped OPD (see image A).

Cylinders that have round or star-shaped handwheels are obsolete and cannot be refilled because they do not meet the 2002 NFPA code (see image B). When you exchange one of these cylinders, it will be recycled or safely discarded.

Note: Sorry, but this propane cylinder exchange program is not available at all Wal-Mart stores. Use this link to find the addresses and phone numbers of your nearest stores.
