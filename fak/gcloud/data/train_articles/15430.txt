Hi Gardner,

Eligibility for SNAP is based on household size, the countable amount of gross and net income for all mandatory household members, and allowed deductions. There are several factors used when determining a household’s SNAP eligibility. Most households must pass both the gross income test of 165 percent Federal Poverty Limits (FPL) and the net income test of 100 percent FPL for their household size to receive SNAP benefits.

· Income for all individuals who purchase and prepare their meals together must be included when determining SNAP eligibility.

· The gross income test uses all countable earned and unearned income.

· The net income test provides for certain deductions such as shelter, utilities, earned income deduction, child care, medical expenses, child support paid, and a standard deduction based on household size.

· The total amount provided as a shelter deduction is limited to 50 percent of the adjusted income (after allowing deductions for certain expenses).

The monthly SNAP income limits for a household of:

Household Size Gross Test Net Test 1 $1,287 $990 2 $1,736 $1,335 3 $2,184 $1,680

A three person household with one person working 40 hours per week at $7.25/hour will pass the gross income test ($7.25*40=$290/week and $290*4.33=$1255.70/month). The household would also have to meet the net income test as described above.

The monthly SNAP benefit varies depending on net income. For example, a family of 3 with a net income of $1680 could receive $7 in monthly SNAP benefits. A family of 3 with a net income of $591 could receive $333 in monthly SNAP benefits.

I hope this helps. Thanks.

The chart I gave you below is accurate. The chart on the website link you provided needs to be updated and we are working on that.
