Koch Brothers want to help out Marco Rubio
The Koch Brothers are looking to get involved in Florida’s Senate race to help Marco Rubio, a top Koch official told reporters at a gathering Saturday in Colorado Springs.

Effectively, they already are, with a dark money group tied to the billionaires funding an ad against Democrat Patrick Murphy. But a more direct role could be a boost for Rubio and Republicans trying to hold the Senate.

The Kochs are focusing on Senate races rather than Donald Trump. Their network has already spent $21 million on five Senate race, the Wall Street Journal reports: Nevada, Indiana, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio.

Now comes Florida.

Rubio is favored by the Kochs and a top political advisor, Marc Short, headlines in February by joining Rubio’s presidential campaign.
