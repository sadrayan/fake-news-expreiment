Vin Diesel
Mark Sinclair[1] (born July 18, 1967), better known by his stage name Vin Diesel, is an American actor, producer, director and screenwriter. After featuring in the epic film Saving Private Ryan (1998), he rose to international fame with his role as Dominic Toretto in The Fast and the Furious franchise.

Diesel begun his career in 1990, but initially struggled to gain roles until he wrote and produced the short film Multi-Facial (1995), which attracted the attention of director Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to feature, which helped kickstart his career. He subsequently voiced the title character in The Iron Giant (1999), and gained a reputation as an action star after starring in The Fast and the Furious, The Chronicles of Riddick, and in the XXX series.

Later in his career, Diesel also gained notoriety for lending his voice to the character of Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and for the animated film Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). He also founded the production company One Race Films, which has produced a number of his star vehicles. Away from action films, Diesel has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as in the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised.

He is attached to portray the comic book character Bloodshot in its film adaptation, and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.

Early life

Diesel was born Mark Sinclair in Alameda County, California, with his fraternal twin brother, Paul.[2][3] His mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair) Vincent, is an astrologer.[4][5] Diesel has stated that he is "of ambiguous ethnicity".[6] His mother's background includes English, German, and Scottish.[7] He has never met his biological father, and has stated that "all I know from my mother is that I have connections to many different cultures".[8] Diesel has self-identified as "definitely a person of color",[9] and has stated that his parents' relationship would have been illegal in parts of the United States due to anti-miscegenation laws.[10] He was raised in New York City by his Caucasian mother and African-American stepfather, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager.[3][9][11]

Diesel made his stage debut at age seven when he appeared in the children's play Dinosaur Door, written by Barbara Garson. The play was produced at Theater for the New City in New York's Greenwich Village. His involvement in the play came about when he, his brother and some friends had broken into the Theater for the New City space on Jane Street with the intent to vandalize it. They were confronted by the theater's artistic director, Crystal Field, who offered them roles in the upcoming show instead of calling the police.[12][13][14] Diesel remained involved with the theater throughout adolescence, going on to attend NYC's Hunter College, where studies in creative writing led him to begin screenwriting. He has identified himself as a "multi-faceted" actor[15] as a result of early difficulties finding roles due to his mixed heritage.[15][16]

Diesel's first film role was a brief uncredited appearance in the drama film Awakenings (1990). In 1994, he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short drama film Multi-Facial, a semi-autobiographical film which follows a struggling multiracial actor stuck in the audition process. The film was selected for screening at the 1995 Cannes Festival. In 1997, Diesel made his first feature-length film, Strays, an urban drama in which he played a gang leader whose love for a woman inspires him to try to change his ways. Written, directed, and produced by Diesel, the film was selected for competition at the 1997 Sundance Festival, leading to an MTV deal to turn it into a series. Director Steven Spielberg took notice of Diesel after seeing him in Multi-Facial[17] and cast him in a small role as a soldier in his 1998 Oscar-winning war film Saving Private Ryan.

In 1999, he provided the voice of the title character in the animated film The Iron Giant.[18]

2000s

In 2000, Diesel had a supporting role in the drama thriller Boiler Room where he appeared alongside Giovanni Ribisi and Ben Affleck. He got his breakthrough leading role as the anti-hero Riddick in the science-fiction film Pitch Black later that year. Diesel attained action hero stardom with two box office hits: the street racing action film The Fast and the Furious (2001), and the action thriller XXX (2002). In 2004, Diesel reprised his role as Riddick in The Chronicles of Riddick, which was a box office failure considering the large budget.[19] He also voiced the character in two spin-off video games and the anime film The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury. In a change from his previous action hero roles, in 2005, he played a lighthearted role in the comedy film The Pacifier, which was a box office success.[20]

In 2006, he chose a dramatic role playing real-life mobster Jack DiNorscio in Find Me Guilty. Although he received critical acclaim for his performance,[21] the film did poorly at the box office grossing only $2 million against a budget of $13 million.[22] Later that year, Diesel made a cameo appearance in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, reprising his role from The Fast and the Furious.

In 2007, Diesel was set to produce and star as Agent 47 in the film adaptation of the video game Hitman, but eventually pulled back and served as executive producer on the film instead.

Diesel reprised his role of Groot once again in the crossover films Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) which combined the superhero teams of Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers.
