It's not personal.

When Tom Ford commented recently that he wouldn't be dressing the new First Lady (and "declined" when he was asked to dress her years ago), the social media machine seized on it as his big anti-Trump statement. But, it turns out he had something way more diplomatic in mind.

"Given this President's beliefs about 'made in America'â€“I think the clothes they wear should be made in America," Ford told ELLE.com on the Golden Globes red carpet. "I think that whoever is the President, or the First Lady, should be wearing clothes at a price point that are accessible to most Americans, and wearing clothes made in America. My clothes are made in Italy, they're very, very expensive. I don't think most women or men in our country can relate to that, and I think the First Lady or the President should represent all people."

Ford insists he isn't being biased against Melania Trump in particular. "If you watch that show where I said it, I said I would not have dressed Hillary had she become President."

In general, women in positions of power are absolutely top of Ford's most-admired list. "I love strong, powerful women," he said. "I've worked with strong, powerful women for the last 30 years of my life. I had one as a mother and as a grandmother and I admire and respect strong, powerful women. Why wouldn't women be strong and powerful?"
