The Big Apple: “To anger a conservative, lie to him: to anger a liberal, tell him the truth”
Entry from November 24, 2013

“To anger a conservative, lie to him: to anger a liberal, tell him the truth”

"To anger a conservative, lie to him: to anger a liberal, tell him the truth” is a quotation that is often credited to Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), but there is no evidence that he ever said it. The quotation has appeared in print since about 2007—well after Roosevelt’s lifetime.



“It’s easy to annoy a liberal, just tell the truth about them”—without the “conservative” half—has been cited in print since at least 1995.

I guess Teddy Roosevelt was right. “If you want to anger a conservative.....tell him a lie........If you want to anger a liberal..tell them the truth.

Teddy Roosevelt Quote on Liberals

Quote:

“To anger a conservative, lie to him. To anger a liberal, tell him the truth.” - Theodore Roosevelt

I was perusing through the internet today and came across this quote. I was unable to source the quote but couldn’t help thinking about its’ merits. If you sit back and think about it, there is a certain native intelligence that just percolates to the surface.
