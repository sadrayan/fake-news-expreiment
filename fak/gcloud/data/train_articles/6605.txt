Gun Law Scorecard
The Lifesaving Momentum of 2018

The gun violence prevention movement experienced unprecedented progress in 2018. After the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, high school activists stepped up and spoke out, urging our leaders to confront this unconscionable public health crisis. Twenty-six states and DC passed 67 new gun safety laws in 2018, a testament to both this new grassroots energy and the decades-long work of gun safety advocates. In November’s midterm elections, voters overwhelmingly rejected gun lobby–backed candidates and elected a new gun safety majority to Congress.

As they do every year, the attorneys at Giffords Law Center graded the states on the relative strength of their gun laws and found an undeniable correlation between strong gun laws and low gun death rates. Year after year, our findings remain the same: gun safety laws save lives. More states should listen to the American people, who are calling for an end to this epidemic, and show the courage to pass the laws and policies proven to prevent gun violence.
