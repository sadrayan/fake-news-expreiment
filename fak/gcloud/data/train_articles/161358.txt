Hawaii volcano: maps and images of the area
After weeks of restlessness, Hawaiiâ€™s Kilauea volcano erupted explosively Thursday morning, hurling boulders hundreds of feet and sending a towering plume of ash five miles into the pre-dawn sky.

For days scientists had warned about such an eruption, ever since the lava lake that once filled the summit crater began draining back into the ground. Their concern was that steam would form from sinking molten rock interacting with the water table, building pressure inside the volcano until it blasted upward. This phenomenon is known as a phreatic eruption.
