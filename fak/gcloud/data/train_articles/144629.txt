Trump executive order lets Air Force recall up to 1,000 retired pilots for active duty
Invoking the National Emergencies Act, President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order that allows the Air Force to voluntarily recall up to 1,000 retired aviators for active duty.

The action could help ease the combat pilot shortage in the force and improve military readiness as the administration steps up its new Afghanistan war strategy to defeat the Taliban and terrorists. The new strategy in the 16-year-old war, unveiled in August by Trump, includes additional U.S. troops going to Afghanistan as well as increased U.S. air support for the Afghan military.

"We anticipate that the Secretary of Defense will delegate the authority to the Secretary of the Air Force to recall up to 1,000 retired pilots for up to three years," said Pentagon spokesman Navy Cmdr. Gary Ross in a statement after the order was announced.

However, on Sunday an Air Force official indicated they had no current plans to act on the authority granted to them by the president's order.

"The Air Force does not currently intend to recall retired pilots to address the pilot shortage," Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Sunday in an email statement. "We appreciate the authorities and flexibility delegated to us."
