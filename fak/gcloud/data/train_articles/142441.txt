Bomb blasts in Kano University
Several explosions and a gun attack occurred this morning in Bayero University, Kano. Current casualty figures stand at fourteen dead.

The explosions were centered at Theatre 2, near the Sports Complex of the old campus where Catholics were holding morning mass according to witnesses. The sound of gunfire was heard simultaneously.

A university official said that the Catholic service was bombed and there were fire exchanges with some of the perpetrators as they fled the scene. A member of the rescue team who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, “we have recovered 14 dead bodies so far and have sent them to the Murtala Muhammed Specialist Hospital.”

Another rescue worker said that many more people were injured, but had been evacuated and taken to hospital for treatment. He further said that the attacks were coordinated for maximum damage as those who survied the initial blast ran into a hail of bullets from unknown gunmen who had positioned themselves around the building.

Abubakar Jibril, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency who spoke with wire service AP, said at that least three explosions struck on and around the campus, and that sporadic gunfire was still mid Sunday morning. Jibril said rescue officials could not reach the site as an apparent attack was still underway.

A police spokesman referred calls for comment to the military. In turn, the military's spokesman Lt. Iweha Ikedichi said soldiers and police had surrounded the university and were searching for the gunmen who carried out the attack.

"There were casualties, but I don't have exact figures," Ikedichi said. "Some are so injured and have been rushed to local hospitals."

When contacted, the university’s spokesman, Malam Zaharadeen said that seven people were confirmed dead and scores injured.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet.
