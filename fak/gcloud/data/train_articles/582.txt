Over the weekend, Angie Stone, India.Arie and Patti Labelle paid tribute to the late 17-year-old as they performed at the 40th annual Signature Gala, held at Washington, D.C.’s Verizon Center during Delta Sigma Theta’s 51st National Convention amid its Centennial season.

On Saturday night, Stone announced to the sold out gala that the verdict came in, saying, "[George] Zimmerman just went free," she told the audience to gasps. She then dedicated her song, "Brotha" to Trayvon Martin.

India.Arie also said in light of the events, she was changing her performance. "This wasn’t supposed to be in the show, but tonight it is," Arie told the crowd before strumming her guitar. She then started her set with, "A Change Gonna Come" off of her first album in dedication to Trayvon. Arie also performed "Video," "Private Party" and "I Am Not My Hair."

Lastly, Patti LaBelle showed a picture of Trayvon during her performance of "You Are My Friend," and the entire stadium erupted into cheers. LaBelle, who closed the evening, also performed her classic hits such as "I Got a New Attitude," "If Only You Knew," "He’s the Right Kinda Lover" and "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."
