Marijuana & Cannabis Investment Firm & Startup Funding
This is a moment of change. As cannabis becomes legal across the country, we’re witnessing a pivotal moment in medical research and treatment — the kind of shift that changes lives for millions. Acreage Holdings has been at the forefront of the revolution, investing in the industry when few others would consider it.

Since the very beginning, we’ve understood that cannabis has the power to heal and change the world and have invested in our beliefs. Our mission is to become the world’s leading cannabis company, bringing safe, affordable cannabis to everyone who needs it. With that in mind, we’re ready to build on the vertically integrated operations (cultivating, processing and dispensing) we’ve established in 14 states (as of Sept. 2018) and be part of a transformative market.
