MillerCoors Timeline
1824/1847 Frederick John Miller, founder of Miller Brewing Company, and Adolph Coors, founder of Coors Brewing Company, are born only a few hundred kilometers—and 23 years—apart. Miller was a renowned German brewer at age 25. Coors began his brewer’s apprenticeship at age 14.

1855 After immigrating to the United States, Frederick Miller settles in Milwaukee. There he leases and later purchases the Plank Road Brewery for $2,300. He brings a unique brewer’s yeast from Germany (its descendant yeast is still used in some of our beers) and goes to work brewing delicious beer.

1873 After stowing away on a ship to cross the Atlantic, Adolph Coors opens The Golden Brewery in Colorado. His partner Jacob Schueler, provides $18,000 for the start-up. Coors, age 26, chips in $2,000 plus his expertise and experience as a brewer.
