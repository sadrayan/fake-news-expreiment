Megyn Kelly Forced To Apologize On-Air For Reading Bogus Wikileaks Document
You might stop and think about reading a purported Wikileaks document on-air distributed by someone who claims it's from documents hacked earlier this summer, particularly when the phrasing is nothing like Hillary Clinton's manner of speech.

"My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders," Kelly read from an email purported to be in the Wikileaks dump dropped today.

"In what appears to be a reference to Bernie Sanders, or it's absolutely clear it's people on the left, calling them 'bucket of losers,'" she continued.

After being cautioned by her guests that the emails were unauthenticated and therefore shouldn't be considered anything to be discussing, she continued to try to hammer on the "bucket of losers" phrase.

At the end of her show, she read this statement.

"Team Clinton strongly denies that she called anyone a bucket of losers. That was apparently a doctored quote and not real. We apologize for that error."

As well you should. Any journalist worth their salt would have at least qualified it before quoting it, but it's just so blatantly fake. "Basket of deplorables" is not the same as "bucket of losers" and the yokel who tried to make it look legit is an idiot.

Here is your reminder that documents purported to be from Wikileaks are not trustworthy, nor are they to be considered legit.

Official Warning: #PodestaEmails are already proving to be riddled with obvious forgeries & #blackpropaganda not even professionally done. https://t.co/UuJZrurHAA â€” Malcolm Nance (@MalcolmNance) October 7, 2016

And if you need more, simply rewind the video to the last 20 seconds where Megyn Kelly apologizes on-air for reading BS crafted by stupid hackers or Putiin's propagandists. Take your pick.
