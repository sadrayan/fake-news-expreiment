Helping families
We will give families more money to help with the high cost of raising their kids.

We will cancel tax breaks and benefits for the wealthy – including the Universal Child Care Benefit – and introduce a new Canada Child Benefit to give Canadian families more money to raise their kids.

With the Canada Child Benefit, nine out of ten Canadian families will receive more than under Stephen Harper’s confusing collection of child benefit programs. For the typical family of four, that means an additional $2,500 in help, tax-free, every year.

Because the Canada Child Benefit is tax-free and tied to income, it also provides greater support to those who need help the most: single-parent families and low-income families. Our plan will lift 315,000 Canadian children out of poverty.

Stephen Harper thinks that government should provide child support payments to millionaires. We will end that unfair giveaway.
