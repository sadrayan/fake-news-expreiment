SIU looking into police shooting after homicide at Peterborough home
Peterborough Police are on the scene at a Middlefield Road home in which 52 year-old woman has been killed and a 25-year-old man has suffered a gunshot injury after interaction with police.

The preliminary investigation shows police officers arrived at the house and encountered a man with a knife. Shots were fired and he was wounded.

The man was transported to Peterborough Regional Health Centre and then St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto where he underwent emergency surgery and is currently in the intensive care unit.

UPDATE: Police Release Identity of Murder Victim

A Special Investigations Unit investigator at the scene confirmed this is also a related homicide after the body of a deceased woman was found at the scene.

Five SIU investigators and two forensic investigators have been assigned to investigate this incident.

Police were called to the home just before midnight based on a report of a 52-year-old woman suffering multiple stab wounds to her back. She died shortly after midnight and the gunshot victim was taken to hospital about five minutes later.

The SIU was called in to investigate the circumstances surrounding the interaction between police and the injured man.

The Peterborough Police Service Criminal Investigations Unit is also conducting a criminal investigation in relation to the same set of circumstances.

Middlefield Road reopened Saturday afternoon.

There is no threat to public safety as a result of this matter, police say.

Due to the fact that the Special Investigations Unit has been called to investigate, no further information will be released at this time, according to Peterborough police.
