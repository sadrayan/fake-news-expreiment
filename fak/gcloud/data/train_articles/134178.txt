Moscow officials say Washington is spending ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars every day’ to ‘propagate the illegitimacy’ of Putin's coming re-election — Meduza
Russian federal officials say the United States is plotting to meddle in the March 18 presidential election. According to Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, Washington regularly tries to intervene in Russian domestic affairs during presidential and parliamentary elections. The Russian government, he says, is monitoring American interference “closely and effectively.”

Russian Senator Andrey Klimov claims that the U.S. plans to depict any election turnout above 45 percent as proof of illegitimacy. Klimov says the United States is spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars a day” on “propagating this idea.”
