Green Death

Found this mantis hanging from the hummingbird feeder this afternoon, chewing on the scalp of the dead hummingbird it was holding. I've had hummingbirds hang themselves in feeders, but the position of the two critters suggests to me that the mantis caught this bird ... darned if I know how! Never thought a mantis could tackle something that big. That's a pretty good trapeze act, too; the bird must be several times the weight of the bug.
