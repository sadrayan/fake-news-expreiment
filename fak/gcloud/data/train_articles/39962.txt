Gibbons For Ohio
Meet Mike Gibbons

Mike Gibbons was born in Cleveland and grew up in Parma, Ohio. His father, Gene Gibbons, was a high school teacher and wrestling coach, and Mike learned the value of hard work at an early age. He played football at St. Ignatius High School and Kenyon College, and went to work early – first with a paper route, then as a landscaper, later on construction crews and the factory floor.

Mike Gibbons earned degrees in political science and economics from Kenyon. He continued to work his way through school, earning a higher degree in management from Case Western and put himself through law school at night, earning his JD from Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. And then he entered the business world. Starting at the bottom rung, he became a partner at age 27 at McDonald & Company in Cleveland and later became President and Chief Executive Officer of Underwood Nehaus & Company at the age of 35. In 1989, he set out on his own and launched his own company. That company became Brown Gibbons Lang & Company, one of the most widely-respected national middle-market investment banks in the country. In an industry dominated by big New York and Chicago firms, BGL used its Ohio roots to help dozens of homegrown Ohio companies expand and add jobs, providing strategic and financial advice and much-needed capital.

But Brown Gibbons Lang & Company was just the beginning. Mike Gibbons has also served as Managing Partner of the Cleveland Crunch professional soccer franchise, Co-Owner of Cheboygan Tap & Tool, and Co-Owner of Northern Lake Properties. In 2015, he co-founded Luna Living, a startup that provides treatment and recovery options for opioid addiction. At every turn, Gibbons was willing to recognize opportunity, take risk, and create jobs.

Mike Gibbons has been honored with numerous awards for his business successes, including Entrepreneur of the Year for northeastern Ohio from Ernst & Young in 2002, along with former partner Scott Lang. ​
