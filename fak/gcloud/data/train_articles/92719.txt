Rick Scott unveils economic plan
GOP front-runner Rick Scott unveiled his jobs plan Wednesday, his first major policy proposal in the race for the governor's mansion. The plan promises 700,000 jobs in seven years. (And it's seven steps, so it's called the 7-7-7 plan.)

“As governor, I’ll be Florida’s Job Creator-in-chief. I’ll be focused on putting Floridians back to work, not securing my next political job, and I’ll be accountable to taxpayers not beholden to special interest,” said Scott. “My 7-7-7 Economic plan will grow the economy, create jobs and increase wages.”

The seven tenets: Accountability Budgeting; Reduce Government Spending; Regulatory Reform; Focus on Job Growth and Retention; World Class Universities; Reduce Property Taxes; Eliminate Florida’s Corporate Income Tax.

Among the ideas: cut state employee workforce by 5 percent (saving $300 million); veto all pork barrel spending; "market-based salaries" for corrections staff; a freeze on all new regulations; reduce property taxes by $1.4 billion, but protect school funding; and eliminate the corporate income tax.
