George C. Nichopoulos, Elvis’s Last Doctor, Dies at 88
Dr. George C. Nichopoulos, Elvis Presley’s personal physician in the decade before his death in 1977, who lost his medical license for overprescribing addictive drugs for years to numerous patients, died on Wednesday in Memphis. He was 88.

Memorial Park Funeral Home in Memphis announced his death in a post on its website.

Dr. Nichopoulos, known as Dr. Nick, was the doctor on call at a medical center in Memphis in 1967 when he was summoned to treat Presley at his home, Graceland. The singer was suffering from saddle sores on his thighs and buttocks caused by too much horseback riding.

Doctor and patient struck up a rapport, and for the next few years, whenever Presley flew in from Hollywood, Dr. Nichopoulos treated him for a variety of complaints, most related to insomnia and rheumatic pain.

After Presley returned to Memphis permanently in 1970, Dr. Nichopoulos became his primary physician and something more. “I was one of his closest friends,” he told the investigative reporter Gerald Posner for a 2009 article in The Daily Beast. “At times I was his father, his best friend, his doctor. Whatever role I needed to play at the time, I did.”
