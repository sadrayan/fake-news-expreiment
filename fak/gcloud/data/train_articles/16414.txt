Emails, Laura Zapata, press secretary, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, May 5-6, 2014

4:37 p.m.

We concluded that 2013 was the least productive year in congressional history not only because Congress passed the fewest number of bills since 1947 (the year bills began to be officially recorded), but also because very few of those bills that became law were substantive. In essence, both the quantity and the quality of the bills passed in Congress led us to conclude that 2013 was the least productive year in recorded Congressional history. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Laura Zapata

Press Secretary

Congressman Joaquin Castro [TX-20]

9:37 p.m.

Below is an excerpt from the transcript of exactly what Rep. Castro said at the Monitor Breakfast. If you listen to the audio from the Breakfast, the Q & A found on the Monitor website is not word for word, which the publication discloses by stating "Here are excerpts from their conversation" .

Rep. Castro, per audio:

“2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping record. Harry Truman in the 1940s campaigned against the “Do-nothing Congress” and that “do nothing congress” passed over 900 bills. Congress last year passed about 67 or so.”

To answer your questions,

-Any idea why Pew says 65 bills passed into law but USA Today says 72? The Monitor quoted Castro as saying 67

The apparent discrepancy between the two publications is 1. the publication dates are different and 2. people count laws enacted a little differently.

The way Rep. Castro got to "67 or so" was by accounting for the 72 bills the President signed into law in 2013 and subtracting the 5 that were simple building re-naming bills. Below is a list of the bills signed into law in 2013. You can find them on govtrack.us. Numbers 10, 38,39, 40, and 41 are the 5 bills that re-named buildings.

-Also, the USA Today chart indicates 395 measures passed into law in 1947, not what Castro said

So that we are clear, Rep. Castro said "in the 1940s campaigned against the “Do-nothing Congress” and that “do nothing congress” passed over 900 bills."

In that quote Rep. Castro is referring to the 80th Congress, which was in session from 1947-1948, and Harry Truman dubbed the 'do nothing Congress' in 1948 when he was running for President. As you can see from the USA Today chart, which was compiled through the House Clerk, the 80th Congress passed 395 laws in 1947 and about 500 or so (the chart doesn't show exact numbers for 1948), which adds up to at least 895 laws passed and that is where Rep. Castro got his 900 number from.

Let me know if there is anything else I can help clarify.

Best,

Laura

To answer your question directly:

"2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping record."

How did he reach this conclusion?

2013 was the year with the least number of total bills passed since the 1947, when the House Clerk began collecting this information. That is how he arrived at the conclusion that "2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping record."

The Congressman called off the number 67, because he subtracted the 5 bills that re-named federal buildings from the total 72 bills signed into law in 2013.
