Uganda has one of the most favourable refugee protection environments in the world; providing for freedom of movement, right to work and also providing land for refugee settlements in line with the Refugee Act of 2006 and the Refugee Regulations of 2010.

Uganda has declared lands as “officially gazetted” for refugees in some of the districts and such lands are protected whether or not refugee reside on it. In areas where land is not gazetted for refugees, the Office of the Prime Minister, Refugee Department (OPM) negotiates with the local communities to acquire land for usage by refugees.

Congolese and South Sudanese refugees receive prima facie status, while other nationalities go through individual status determination.
