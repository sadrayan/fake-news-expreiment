5 p.m.

While I cannot comment on formal complaints pending review and potential investigation by the Attorney Generalâ€™s office, I can tell you that we did not receive 600 written complaints total related to issues from the March 1 Election.

Our agency did receive less than a dozen calls from individuals concerned that votes may have been changed from Trump to Rubio, but not a single individual indicated they had experienced the supposed phenomena themselves or had any direct knowledge of what allegedly occurred. Instead, they were only responding to second-hand reports they heard on the radio or saw online.

Our agency is not the only entity that receives election complaints. Complaints could also be made to county and party election officials. That said, we did not hear any concerns or receive any calls from election officials, party chairs or any campaign representatives on these alleged issues.
