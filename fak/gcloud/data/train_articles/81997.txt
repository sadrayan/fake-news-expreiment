California Democratic Reps. Janice Hahn of San Pedro and Lucille Roybal-Allard of Downey on Monday ripped into the leadership of the California Democratic Party for being willing to launch a negative campaign against Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Rep. Loretta Sanchez.

The party has spent more than $560,000 to support Sanchez’s rival in the Senate race, Democrat state Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris. A top party strategist told the Los Angeles Times that a negative attack against Sanchez, who has represented Orange County in Congress for two decades, has not been ruled out.

“It is outrageous that the California Democratic Party has spent over half a million dollars to defeat Democrat Loretta Sanchez and is planning to spend more in the next few weeks when there are contested races against Republicans across the state,” Hahn and Roybal-Allard said in joint statement released by the Sanchez campaign Monday afternoon.
