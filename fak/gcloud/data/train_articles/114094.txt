Aryan Circle (hand sign)

The Aryan Circle is one of the largest white supremacist prison gangs in the United States. Its primary hand sign consists of holding up the thumb and the middle, ring, and little fingers of one hand, signifying the numbers 1 and 3. Substituting letters for numbers, 1 and 3 stand for A and C, i.e., Aryan Circle. The symbol can also be shown in "reverse," by holding up the little finger and the middle and index fingers, plus the thumb. Aryan Circle members can also show the sign using two hands, raising up one finger on one hand and three fingers on the other. Because Aryan Circle members often refer to their group as "the Diamond" (a reference to their most common tattoo, a diamond-shaped swastika), gang members may also use two hands to make the shape of a diamond.
