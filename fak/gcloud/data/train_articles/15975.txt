This information just confirms what we’ve said all along: that most state employees haven’t seen a pay raise since 2008. If you look at just merit raises and equity raises, in 2009 only 14% of state employees received one. In 2010 it was 9%, in 2011 it was 8%, and in 2012 it was 7%. Even if you assume that no one who got a merit or equity raise in one year received one in any of the other three years (which is impossible since Schedule A employees-i.e. upper management- are required to receive a merit raise every year), then that would still only total 38% of the workforce.

I would argue against counting promotions as raises. A promotion is a change in job title and responsibilities. And any increase in pay is reflective of that. But even if you were to include them in the count of raises it’s still only 30% in 2009, 23% in 2010, 20% in 2011, and 22% in 2012.

Seth:

Hello again.

For the fact check we discussed, I asked the state to check on merit and other pay raises in 2010 through 2012. Results are below.

What does this reveal, by your analysis?

I have asked if it’s possible that each year’s beneficiaries varied sufficiently so that one could conclude that about 60 percent of employees got some kind of raise at least one of the three years. Alternatively, I have asked if it’s accurate to speculate or conclude that about 80 percent of workers got no raise in any of the three years. I have not heard back.

Of course, I would ask that you not circulate this publicly until our fact check is published.

Thanks.

Subject: your pay raise question

There are approximately 110 state agencies covered by the Position Classification Act. Those agencies enter pay raise information in the accounting system in three codes -- merit, promotion, equity adjustment.

Descriptions and statutory cites of those three are attached if you want.

Here are tables for each calendar year you asked for, showing the total number of employees at those agencies, and the number who got different types of raises.

Year Total Employees Merit Promotion Equity 2009 184,754 21,996 29,102 3,443

Year Total Employees Merit Promotion Equity 2010 187,944 13,517 25,489 3,826

Year Total Employees Merit Promotion Equity 2011 186,549 8,860 22,488 5,213

Year Total Employees Merit Promotion Equity 2012 184,141 11,942 25,826 1,242

** Note: there are 10 state agencies not covered by the Position Classification Act. When they enter payroll information in our system, they have one general salary adjustment code that covers aspects such as pay increases or decreases, change in work hours, job classification changes. So they don’t have a separate pay raise code, and those agencies are not in the in the tables above. There are about 3,500 employees in those agencies. So the vast majority of state agency employees are in the tables above.
