Non-powder guns, such as BB and air guns, are not toys—they kill and injure thousands of people per year, including children and teenagers. But these tragedies are highly preventable through laws that treat non-powder guns like the potentially lethal weapons they are. In addition, when it comes to actual non-firing toys, strong product design regulations can help ensure that these are not mistaken for real firearms by law enforcement officers.

Background

Non-powder guns, including BB, air, and pellet guns, are inherently dangerous weapons that can inflict potentially severe or lethal injuries, particularly on children. According to one study, there are an estimated 3.2 million BB or pellet guns sold in the US each year. Because non-powder guns expel projectiles (usually made of metal or hard plastic) through the force of air pressure, CO 2 pressure, or spring action, they are different from firearms, which use gunpowder to generate energy to launch a projectile.

National data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on non-powder gun injuries illustrates the inherent danger of these weapons. Between 2001 and 2011, non-powder guns injured 209,981 people nationwide, including 145,423 children age 19 or younger. In 2011 alone, 16,451 injuries—including 10,288 injuries to children age 19 and younger—resulted from the use of non-powder guns. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, BB guns and pellet rifles cause an average of four deaths per year. However, this four-per-year figure is based only on reports submitted to CPSC and appears to be an extreme underestimate. State-level data suggests that non-powder guns are far more lethal. For example, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported that between 2007 and 2009 in Texas alone, 124 people (including 23 children under the age of 18) were killed in accidents involving BB guns, pellet guns, and other non-powder guns.

Because non-powder guns are designed to discharge projectiles, often at high speeds and with significant force, they should not be confused with imitation firearms or toy guns. The term “imitation firearms” generally refers to non-firing replicas, many of which are so realistic looking that they cannot be immediately distinguished from real firearms. “Toy guns” is a more generic term that usually encompasses a wide range of less detailed non-firing replicas or gun-like toys (including cap pistols and water guns) that are marketed to children. Since imitation and toy guns can be mistaken for actual firearms, federal law requires that certain of these “lookalike” firearms be visually differentiable from real firearms.

Unlike non-firing imitation or toy guns, non-powder guns can actually injure or kill people when fired. But like imitation or toy guns, non-powder guns can be dangerous for the additional reason that they may be mistaken for firearms by law enforcement or others. According to a New York Times investigation, “In recent years, dozens of police officers in Texas, California, Maryland, Florida, and elsewhere have shot children and adults armed with what they believed were handguns but that were determined later to be BB guns or other types of air pistols.”

Summary of Federal Law

Although there are no federal laws regulating their transfer, possession, or use, non-powder guns are, unlike firearms, regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Hence, non-powder guns are subject to generalized statutory limitations involving “substantial product hazard[s]” and articles that create “a substantial risk of injury to children.” The CPSC has not adopted specific mandatory regulations in this area, although the BB gun industry has adopted voluntary standards regarding non-powder guns.

Federal law prevents states from prohibiting the sale of traditional BB or pellet guns, but explicitly allows states to prohibit the sale of these weapons to minors. Courts have interpreted these provisions to allow states to impose other regulations on the sale of traditional BB or pellet guns so long as the regulations fall short of prohibitions on sale.

Additionally, federal law regulates the design of “lookalike firearms,” which include “toy guns, water guns, replica nonguns, and air-soft guns firing nonmetallic projectiles.” Every lookalike firearm must: (1) have a permanently affixed blaze orange plug inserted in the firearm’s barrel, (2) have a similar marking on the exterior of the barrel, (3) be constructed entirely of transparent or translucent materials, or (4) be covered in certain bright colors. This federal law supersedes any state or local law which provide for markings or identification that are inconsistent with these requirements.

Description of State Laws Regulating Non-powder Guns

Although additional regulations exist, non-powder gun regulations can generally be broken down into the following categories:

Defining All Non-powder Guns as Firearms : New Jersey and Rhode Island take this approach, which generally ensures that all non-powder guns are kept out of the hands of children (absent direct adult supervision) and that felons and other individuals prohibited from possessing firearms are similarly barred from possessing non-powder guns.

Treating Certain Non-powder Guns as Firearms : Illinois and Michigan define high-power and/or large caliber non-powder guns as firearms. Illinois excludes from the definition of firearms non-powder guns of .18 caliber or less and non-powder guns with a muzzle velocity of less than 700 feet per second. Michigan excludes the following non-powder guns from the definition of firearms: smooth bore rifles or handguns designed and manufactured exclusively for propelling BBs, not exceeding .177 caliber by gas or air.

Defining Non-powder Guns as Dangerous Weapons : Connecticut, Delaware, and North Dakota list some or all non-powder guns as dangerous weapons. However, dangerous weapons laws tend to be much less comprehensive than laws regulating firearms. In Connecticut, it is unlawful to carry a dangerous weapon, although various exceptions exist for BB guns. It is also unlawful to transport a dangerous weapon in a vehicle without a permit. Delaware prohibits possession of dangerous weapons, which are defined to include certain large caliber BB or air guns. North Dakota applies enhanced penalties for the improper use or possession of dangerous weapons.

Regulating Non-powder Guns with Respect to Minors: Most states that regulate non-powder guns do so by prohibiting transfers to children or by prohibiting or limiting where the guns can be possessed or used, although the restrictions are often inapplicable with parental consent or adult supervision. Depending on the state, the term “child” is defined as being anywhere from under 18 years of age to under 12 years of age. A number of states also criminalize the use or possession of non-powder guns on or near school property, or provide that such use or possession shall be grounds for expulsion.

Selected Local Law

New York City

New York City prohibits the sale or possession of any air pistol or air rifle (defined as any instrument in which the propelling force is air or a spring) without an appropriate license. Persons who are licensed by the city to sell air pistols and rifles may do so only if they deliver the weapons to a location outside the city or the transferee has an air pistol or rifle license. However, the use of air pistols and rifles in connection with “an amusement licensed by the department of consumer affairs” or at a shooting range is permitted. Air pistol or rifle dealers must keep records detailing the name and address of each purchaser and the place of delivery for each sale.
