Brief on the informal Settlements
A large population of Nairobi’s residents live in informal set- tlements , that is about 60% in sub-standard living conditions, where congestion has proved to be a challenge for NCWSC to provide access to water and sewerage services to the resi- dents.

This is mainly due to the unplanned nature of the set- tlements coupled by land tenure issues. In 2008 the Company formed a department solely responsible of improving access to water and sanitation services in the informal settlements of Nairobi. The 2002 Water Act brought about reforms in the Water Sector that were aimed at facilitating access to clean water and sewerage services to all Kenyans. The reforms saw the creation of regional Water Boards which were tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the operations of water and sewerage/sanitation utilities in their respective areas of jurisdiction, besides major asset development.

NCWSC through the informal settlements department have initiated several projects in partnership with various NGOs and other development partners to cushion these vulnerable groups to access clean water and sanitation

In pursuit of achieving the MDGs of access to clean water and sanitation by the year 2015 and in ensuring the realization of the constitu- tional requirement to ‘the right to water’ we have recently constructed 24 water kiosks and extended 18km water pipeline in Mathare valley in partnership with WSTF and Pamoja Trust to serve a population of 200,000.

There are other interventions in other informal settlements like Kibera- kambi muru in partnership with WSUP construct- ed sanitation Blocks and 2.5km sewer line. Through the social connection policy we are implementing the Kayole Soweto water project and with Global Partnership on Output Based Aid (OBA) funds channeled through K-Rep bank to cater for the connections fees .The world bank has given a grant of $3,000,000 under the water and sanitation improvement program (Wassip) to improve water services

This involves construction of 18.5 km of water pipeline exten- sion to serve the residents of this low income settlement. After completion 2200 plots with over ten households will be connected with clean water and a total of 85000 populations served.
