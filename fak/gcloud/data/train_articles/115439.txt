Burrard Street Journal Disclaimer

Hi there, welcome to the Burrard Street Journal’s disclaimer page.

If you clicked here then you are probably doubting the legitimacy of one of our articles. Well friend, those are some good instincts, as the Burrard Street Journal is a source of parody, satire, and humor and is for entertainment purposes only.

All Burrard Street Journal and Burrard Street Football articles are satirical and entirely fabricated.

Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental, except for all references to sports personalities and/or celebrities, in which case they are based on real people, but still based almost entirely in fiction.

Please feel free to copy and paste this disclaimer into you facebook comment to “prove this site’s bullshit”.
