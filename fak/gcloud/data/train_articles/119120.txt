Hurricane Harvey: Woodlands Church, Houston's First Baptist Church Open Doors to Those Affected by Flooding
As Hurricane Harvey continues its path of destruction across Houston, Texas, some of the city's biggest megachurches are opening their doors to those displaced by rising floodwaters.



In a statement posted on the official Woodlands Church Facebook page, Senior Pastor Kerry Shook announced the church has become a "staging area for boat rescue teams that are being sent all over our area to rescue flood victims who are trapped in their homes."



"Today we were also able to feed over 200 first responders as they continue to serve others. We are also distributing 1,000 meals from Chick-fil-a to first responders and emergency medical personnel who are performing rescues," she wrote.



"After the rescue phase is complete we will need everyone to volunteer for the recovery and restoration phases. We are working with county, state, and federal authorities to be ready as a staging area for teams from all over Texas. We are also in contact with hundreds of churches all over the country that are preparing teams to come here to assist Woodlands Church in our relief efforts."



Shook asked Woodlands members to pray for those affected by the disaster, volunteer "so we can quickly mobilize our teams when needed to help with recovery", and donate to flood relief at http://wc.org/hurricane.
