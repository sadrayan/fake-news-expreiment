Lawmaker proposes bill to ban mixing human, animal embryos
Glowing embryos may soon come to an end if a bill passes, banning the mixing of human and animal embryos.

Georgia lawmakers could soon debate a bill that would prevent researchers from mixing human embryos with jellyfish and other animals.

Channel 2's Lori Geary was the only reporter to catch up with the bill's sponsor to ask him why the legislation is needed.

“It's not a subject people sit around the dinner table talking about,” Rep. Tom Kirby said.

Kirby, a Republican from Loganville, filed a bill that would ban the mixing of humans and animals in embryos.

Kirby says some of this research is already being done in the U.S. He says he wants to make sure it doesn't come to Georgia.

Geary asked Kirby what the purpose would be of mixing a human embryo with a jellyfish.

“To make them glow in the dark is the only thing I know of,” he said.

We found videos on YouTube of mice and other animals mixed with jellyfish that glow in the dark, including rabbits, monkeys and cats.

“The people who support life are all behind it, but it's not being brought on anybody's behalf. This is my bill,” Kirby said.

Kirby said unlike previous embryo bills introduced in the past, this one has nothing to do with invitro fertilization or medical research.

We caught up with democratic state senator Vincent Fort and asked him his thoughts.

“I didn’t know that was a problem. I’m really kind of taken back,” Fort said.

Fort says it will not be a top priority on his agenda.

“It invokes a chuckle, but at the same time, it's a waste of precious time, when we could be dealing with issues like transportation, education and jobs,” he said.

Geary asked Kirby if this type of research is happening in Georgia.

“ I've had people tell me it is but I have not verified that for sure,” Kirby said. “It's time we either get in front of it or we're going to be chasing our tails.”
