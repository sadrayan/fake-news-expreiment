Russian diplomat warns UN of planned chemical attack provocation in Idlib
UN, October 29. /TASS/. Russia’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Vladimir Safronkov informed the UN about a new planned provocation involving chemical weapons in Syria’s Idlib during a session of the UN Security Council.

"More reports are appearing about suspicious movements of the Al-Nusra Front (outlawed in Russia - TASS) and the White Helmets with poisonous substances," he said during Monday’s session on the humanitarian situation in Syria.

Russian diplomats have repeatedly made warnings about planned provocations with the alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians plotted by the White Helmets in order to blame the Syrian government for said attacks and justify Western airstrikes on Syria.

Agreements on Idlib

Russian-Turkish agreements on de-escalation in Idlib were a temporary measure and in no way meant that anti-terrorism efforts in Syria should be stopped, he added.
