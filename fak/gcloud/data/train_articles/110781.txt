Current and emerging therapies in premature ejaculation: Where we are coming from, where we are going
Premature ejaculation is the most common form of sexual dysfunction among men. The pathophysiology of premature ejaculation appears to be multifactorial, implicating the need for multimodal therapeutic regimens to successfully treat premature ejaculation. Multiple treatment regimens have been shown to be effective in extending the time between penetration and ejaculation. These treatment modalities include everything from behavioral modifications and medications to diet alterations and major surgery. The goal of the present article was to review the commonly used treatment regimens used in the treatment of premature ejaculation, as well as to introduce and discuss the newest treatment routines under study for the treatment of premature ejaculation.

For the purposes of the present review, we focused on an IELT of <1 min that causes distress in the individual. We did not delineate between primary and acquired causes, as primary is much more prevalent and many studies do not readily distinguish between the two. With this definition in mind, our treatment goal was to extend the time between penetration and ejaculation. Subjective sexual satisfaction scores were taken into consideration, but were not the primary outcome focus. Many therapies have been found to be superior to placebo in RCTs, and are commonly used in practice today. Many treatments can boast an improvement of 75–90%.[ 4 ] However, even with the best therapies, this measurement does not reflect a cure rate; rather, it shows an improvement in IELT that could be as low as a single second. This fact leaves the all-important question: is there a true solution to PE? If so, what is it?

This debate over the definition of PE makes the assessment and diagnosis difficult for providers, further obscuring the prevalence of the pathology and delaying treatment.[ 1-3 ] For this reason, it is difficult to determine a true estimate of the prevalence of PE in the population. Many patients suffering from PE experience increased distress, anxiety and depression, as well as overall dissatisfaction with sexual intercourse.[ 1, 3 ] Clarifying the diagnostic criteria for PE might allow undiagnosed patients to receive treatment that could improve their quality of life.[ 1-3 ]

There are several competing ideas about the correct way to diagnose PE. A psychological approach, which was initially used in DSM-IV, diagnoses the pathology based on subjective feelings rather than utilizing specific cut-off points for ejaculation time.[ 2, 3 ] Using this definition, PE was defined as ejaculation with both minimal stimulation and before the patient desires. This use of vague language had the potential to overdiagnose men who do not suffer from PE, and to underdiagnose men who do.[ 2, 3 ] Recently, this was changed in the DSM-V to include a cut-off time of ejaculation within 1 min of vaginal penetration that causes significant distress.[ 3 ] In contrast to the psychological theory, a definition created by Waldinger et al. proposed that PE should be defined solely based on the time between beginning intercourse and ejaculation, known as the IELT.[ 2 ] The World Health Organization's ICD-10 definition of PE includes both an inability to control ejaculation, as well as a cut-off of ejaculation within 15 s of beginning intercourse.[ 3 ]

The studies on the prevalence of PE place this pathology as the most common sexual dysfunction among men.[ 1 ] Various studies have found that between 20% and 30% of men experience PE; however, this condition is commonly underreported because of embarrassment of both the patient and the physician, as well as lack of awareness.[ 1 ] At first glance, the diagnosis of PE would seem straightforward; however, the diagnostic criteria have been hotly debated.[ 2, 3 ]

Current therapies

Behavioral techniques Two of the most common behavioral therapies used in the treatment of PE are the “start–stop” technique and the “squeeze” technique. Developed by Semans in 1956, the “start–stop” technique involves stimulating the penis until one feels the urge to ejaculate, then removing the stimulation until the urge to ejaculate subsides.[5] By repeating this maneuver multiple times before allowing oneself to ejaculate, the “start–stop” technique allows the patient to improve control over the ejaculatory response by learning to identify the physical and emotional parameters involved in arousal.[6] Although once considered the gold standard for the treatment of PE, the “start–stop” technique has been under scrutiny, as recent studies disagree on the effectiveness of this behavioral-based treatment.[7-9] The “squeeze” technique, established by Masters and Johnson in 1970, involves squeezing the glans of the penis until the urge to ejaculate subsides.[10] Similar to the “start–stop” technique, the “squeeze” technique was originally reported to have a 97.8% success rate; however, this has not been replicated in more recent studies.[11]

SSRIs Although the pathophysiology of PE is relatively unknown, one hypothesis behind the etiology of PE is the dysfunction of 5-HT receptors.[12] Elevated concentrations of 5-HT are present at many receptors that have been found to be involved with ejaculatory control, and activation of the central 5-HT-mediated system has an overall inhibitory effect on ejaculation.[13] Specifically, activation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors has been shown to have inhibitory effects on the ejaculation pathway, delaying ejaculation, whereas activation of 5-HT1A receptors has been found to precipitate ejaculation.[13] The role of the 5-HT1A in mediating ejaculation is shown by the fact that fluvoxamine, an SSRI that has a high specificity for the 5-HT1A receptor, does not show a significant increase in IELT.[13, 14] Furthermore, Waldinger et al. proposed that the pathophysiology of PE could possibly be a result of hypofunction of the 5-HT2C receptor and/or hyperfunction of the 5-HT1A receptor.[14, 15] This hypofunction of the 5-HT2C receptor, as well as low levels of 5-HT transmission in general, is thought to be associated with a low threshold for sexual arousal and ejaculation. SSRIs can activate 5-HT2C receptors and raise this threshold, subsequently increasing the IELT.[15] It is believed that SSRIs induce delayed ejaculation by inhibiting presynaptic and somatodendritic serotonin transporters, thereby increasing total central 5-HT neurotransmission and activation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors.[16] An alternate theory is that by increasing the amount of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, SSRIs desensitize 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, causing an overall inhibitory effect on the ejaculation pathway.[16] The effect of SSRIs on PE has been seen as early as a few days after starting the medication; however, most patients notice a significant increase in ejaculatory time 1–2 weeks after beginning the medication, strengthening the thought that SSRIs treat PE through receptor desensitization.[17] Furthermore, because 5-HT receptor desensitization can cause the body to upregulate the production of 5-HT receptors, the efficacy of SSRIs might decrease after 6–12 months of consistent use.[17] SSRIs used in the off-label treatment of PE include fluoxetine, paroxetine, citolapram, fluvoxamine and sertraline.[12] Currently, no SSRIs are approved by the FDA for the treatment of PE. One SSRI, dapoxetine hydrochloride, has been approved for the treatment of PE in some European and Asian countries.[18] Adverse effects, such as reduced libido, mild headache, nausea, sweating and dizziness, have been associated with the use of SSRIs.[19]

SNRIs SNRIs are a class of drugs commonly used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and chronic pain syndromes.[20, 21] SNRIs, by increasing serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, might have a role in the management of PE given the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of PE could stem from the abnormal neuromodulation of central and peripheral serotonin receptors.[13] Athanasios et al. showed that duloxetine, when compared with a placebo, increases IELT in patients suffering from PE.[22] Furthermore, duloxetine was shown to increase sexual desire and partner satisfaction when used in patients with PE.[22] Because personal distress and perceived control over ejaculation are thought to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of PE, duloxetine might also help patients with PE through regulation of mood and emotions.[23-25] One study carried out by Ozcan et al. showed that duloxetine improved IELT, as well as personal distress related to control over ejaculation, in men with PE.[26]

TCAs Because primary PE is thought to be a result of dysfunctional 5-HT receptors, TCAs are another class of drugs that have been studied in the treatment of this condition. The first published study showing the effectiveness of TCAs in the treatment of PE was carried out by Eaton in 1973. In that study, Eaton reported that there was “an almost 100% positive reaction” when using clomipramine in the treatment of PE.[27] Like SSRIs and SNRIs, TCAs exert their effects by acting as serotonin and norepinephrine transport inhibitors, increasing the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, and delaying ejaculation through activity at 5-HT receptors.[15, 28] There have been multiple studies showing that TCAs, particularly clomipramine daily, have a positive effect on sexual satisfaction when used to treat PE.[29-31] In fact, one study showed that daily clomipramine had a greater effect on IELT than fluoxetine or sertraline.[32] Compared with other TCAs, clomipramine has been shown to have a particularly strong affinity for serotonin transporters, possibly explaining why it has a stronger effect on PE than other TCAs.[28] The effect of clomipramine might also be enhanced by its ability to inhibit contraction of the vas deferens, which plays a role in ejaculation.[13] One drawback of using TCAs is the side-effect profile, which includes, fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, hypotension, flushing and dizziness.[32]

Local anesthetics One of the physiological factors believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of PE is a hypersensitive response to penile stimulation.[33] The ejaculatory response consists of an afferent neuronal input, which is carried through the pudendal nerves and is triggered by penile stimulation, and an efferent neuronal output carried by the sympathetic nerves of the T10–T12 paraspinal sympathetic ganglia to the male reproductive organs to trigger ejaculation.[34] Multiple studies have shown that men with PE have a lower penile vibratory threshold, higher bulbocavernosus-evoked potentials and larger dorsal nerve somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes.[33, 35-37] These findings suggest that by masking the sensory input from the glans through local anesthetics applied directly to the penis, men who suffer with PE could increase their IELT.[38] Local anesthetics are membrane-stabilizing drugs that inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby decreasing synaptic transmission and neuronal hypersensitivity, thus increasing the threshold for ejaculation.[39] Topical anesthetics used in the treatment of PE include topical lidocaine, benzocaine, prilocaine and SS Cream. One of the most studied local anesthetic mixtures used in the treatment of PE is the mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine. Lidocaine and prilocaine are two solids that when mixed together form a liquid mixture without the use of a solvent.[40] This cream, which contains 2.5% of both lidocaine and prilocaine and has been named EMLA or eutectic mixture of local anesthetic, has been shown in multiple studies to increase patients' IELT and satisfaction of sexual performance if applied to the penis before intercourse.[41-43] Tempe, another anesthetic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine, is one of the newest products being developed for the treatment of PE. Unlike most mixtures of lidocaine and prilocaine, which are creams, Tempe is an aerosol formulation that is dissolved in a non-chlorofluorocarbon propellant, which is unique in the fact that it does not penetrate fully keratinized skin.[44] This allows Tempe to concentrate its desensitizing effect on the glans penis, decreasing the potential for unwanted side-effects.[45] The newest local anesthetic used in the treatment of PE is Promescent. Promescent is a lidocaine-only topical spray that can be applied to the penis before intercourse to desensitize the glans and therefore theoretically increase IELT.[46] Currently, no clinical trials have reported a statistically significant increase in IELT with the use of Promescent. Promescent is unique in the fact that it does not contain prilocaine, which when applied topically can cause the unusual side-effect of methemoglobinemia.[47] Promescent, unlike Tempe, was allowed by the FDA for treatment of PE, and is available prescription-free in North America.[48]

Tramadol Tramadol is a potent centrally acting opioid-based analgesic used in the treatment of acute and chronic pain.[49] Tramadol exerts its analgesic effects by binding to centrally located mu opioid pain receptors, and by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine.[50] Interestingly, tramadol has also been shown to act as a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist.[51] It is thought that tramadol's effectiveness in the treatment of PE is due to the neuromodulation of serotonin and norepinephrine receptors.[51, 52] Tramadol has shown promising results in multiple studies examining its use in the medical management of patients with PE.[53-58] Khan et al. showed a significant increase in IELT in patients that were treated with tramadol.[53] A comprehensive meta-analysis carried out by Wu et al. showed an increase in IELT of 3 min when comparing tramadol with a placebo.[54] Unlike other treatments for PE, tramadol does have a potential for both abuse and dependence; however, these episodes are rare, especially in patients that use tramadol intermittently.[55]

Alpha-blockers The prostate and the seminal vesicles play a vital role in the physiology of ejaculation, and the smooth muscle of both of these organs contains alpha-1 receptors.[59, 60] Considered the gold standard for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, alpha-1 blockers have been reported to cause ejaculatory dysfunction.[61] Although this ejaculatory dysfunction was originally thought to be caused by retrograde ejaculation, recent studies have shown that it is caused by contraction failure of the seminal vesicles, resulting in emission reduction.[61, 62] Given these data, researchers began studying the effects of alpha-1 blockers on the treatment of PE. Multiple studies have shown the effectiveness of alpha-1 blockers in minimizing PE.[63, 64] The most common alpha-1 blockers used in the treatment of PE include tamsulosin, silodosin, terazosin and alfuzosin, with all showing a statistically significant increase in IELT.[65] At therapeutic doses, side-effects of alpha-blockers are rare, but include anorgasmia, dry mouth, nasal congestion, drowsiness and orthostatic hypotension.[66]
