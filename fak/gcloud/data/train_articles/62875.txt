New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner to Host Next Meeting of Bipartisan Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity
The bipartisan Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity will hold its next meeting on Tuesday, September 12, 2017, at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire.

“I am grateful to Secretary Bill Gardner for hosting the Commission in his home state of New Hampshire,” said the Commission’s Vice Chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. “Secretary Gardner’s experience as the nation’s longest-serving chief state elections official and New Hampshire’s pivotal role in the presidential selection process make New Hampshire a perfect location for the Commission to continue its work.”

“I am excited to host my fellow commissioners here in New Hampshire,” said Secretary Gardner. “New Hampshire is proud of its key elections role as the First-In-The-Nation Presidential Primary, and I am likewise proud to host the Commission in its first meeting outside of Washington, D.C. I look forward to a productive meeting here in the Granite State.”

Vice Chair Kobach will chair the meeting as the Vice President will not be in attendance. More information regarding the meeting will be released soon on the Commission’s webpage, which is available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/07/13/presidential-advisory-commission-election-integrity.
