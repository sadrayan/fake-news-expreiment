West Bank Settlements Are Illegal, Carter Says
Former President Jimmy Carter said today that Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank were illegal and an obstacle to Middle East peace.

Mr. Carter, who arrived in Amman Sunday from Israel, said at a news conference before leaving for Saudi Arabia that the settlements were ''a direct violation of international law and the most serious adverse development in the past two years.''

''Settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace,'' he said. In his stay in Amman, the official Jordanian press agency said, Mr. Carter had talks with King Hussein on international issues, including the Middle East and the Palestinian question.

Mr. Carter said he hoped ''King Hussein and the Palestinians on the West Bank would enter into negotiations with Israel.'' He described the peace plan adopted by Arab nations at a conference in Fez, Morocco, last September as incompatible with a Reagan Administration initiative that was started almost simultaneously. The Fez plan, which tacitly recognizes Israel, calls for an independent Palestinian state, but this is rejected by the Reagan plan, which proposes self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in association with Jordan.
