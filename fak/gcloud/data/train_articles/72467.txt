National Right to Life
H.R. 45, introduced by Congresswoman Michele Bachmann (R-Mn.), would repeal Public Law 111-148, the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” (PPACA), enacted in March 2010 -- more widely known as "Obamacare." National Right to Life Committee strongly supports repeal of the PPACA for these reasons: As enacted, the PPACA contains multiple provisions authorizing federal subsidies for abortion, and additional provisions on which future abortion-expanding regulatory mandates may be based. The abortion-subsidizing and abortion-expanding provisions of the law are thoroughly documented in materials posted on the NRLC website here and here . In addition, the PPACA contains multiple provisions that will, if fully implemented, result in government-imposed rationing of lifesaving medical care. Detailed information on the components that will result in rationing is available here . The House of Representatives passed H.R. 45 by a vote of 229 to 195. The repeal bill was supported by 227 Republicans and two Democrats. The repeal was opposed by 195 Democrats; no Republican voted against repeal. House roll call No. 154, May 16, 2013.
