CHILDREN AT RISK
For the past 12 years, CHILDREN AT RISK has released its annual school rankings to provide the public with information about how schools are performing and how to improve education. The school rankings are calculated using the following measures:

Student Achievement Index – Student performance on STAAR Reading and Math tests

– Student performance on STAAR Reading and Math tests Campus Performance Index – A school’s overall campus performance is compared to other campuses statewide with similar levels of poverty. This adjustment is made to eliminate bias toward campuses with low percentages of economically disadvantaged students.

– A school’s overall campus performance is compared to other campuses statewide with similar levels of poverty. This adjustment is made to eliminate bias toward campuses with low percentages of economically disadvantaged students. Growth Index – Student-level improvement over time on standardized test scores in Reading, English, and Math.

– Student-level improvement over time on standardized test scores in Reading, English, and Math. College Readiness Index – High school graduation rates, SAT/ACT participation rate and scores, and AP/IB participation rate and scores.

The Gold Ribbon sub-lists highlight high-performing, high poverty schools that are traditional neighborhood campuses; magnet schools and charter schools are not included in the Gold Ribbon sub-lists. High poverty schools are identified as campuses that are more than 75% economically disadvantaged. Those campuses that receive an A or a B in the CHILDREN AT RISK rankings are considered high performing despite high levels of poverty.
