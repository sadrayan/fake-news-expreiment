[An ice cream social at the First Methodist Church in Texas City around 1909]
Three young ladies, dressed in white shirtfronts, lockets and long white skirts are sitting on chairs in a room eating ice cream. A young man, dressed in a dark suit jacket and plaid pants, eats ice cream from a large ladle. The ice cream tin and an extra plate sit on a wooden chair in front of the young ladies. The room holds other wooden chairs and a podium, behind the people. A map of the United States and a framed certificate are on the back wall. The room appears to be either a church or a court room. On the reverse of the photograph is written "Rev. Germany eating cream. Misses Whitney, Christine Davison and some other young lady. Note: Rev. Germany pastor of 1st Methodist Episcopal Church 1906 - 1909."
