Westchester County is on a calendar year budget. It is the only county in New York State with a AAA rating from two of the three rating services. The Westchester County Budget Office serves as staff to the County Executive and the County Board of Legislators on budget issues. The department prepares the annual operating budgets and capital budgets for the county and its four water districts, 11 sewer districts and one refuse disposal district, as well as for Westchester Community College.

County taxes actually account for between 15â€“18 percent of a total property tax bill. The remainder of taxes are levied by school districts and local governments. Westchester also shares its sales tax revenue with most local governments and school districts.

Taxes are apportioned based on assessment data and trends in local communities.

The New York State Budget is available at the official site of the New York State Division of the Budget.
