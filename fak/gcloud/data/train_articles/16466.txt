See the attached extract from the general appropriations act for the source numbers.

If you limit the analysis to the general revenue fund, the percentage of the state budget that goes to Article III (public and higher ed, including the Teacher Retirement System) is about 52.37%, calculated as about $55.9 billion appropriated in Article III and about $106.7 billion appropriated in all articles. There are minor amounts appropriated to TEA in Article IX for some contingencies, and there may be higher ed related appropriations in other articles, but they are likely to be small.

If you look at all funds (second page), the story is a little different. The percentage appropriated to Article III is about 37.1%, calculated as about $80.4 billion divided by about $216.8 billion.

I would say the statement about the percentage of GR appropriated to “education” is accurate. It may not be the whole story, but as stated, it is correct.
