Below are assumption notes for this effort:

Unconstrained Capacity Analysis of I-35 and Loop 1- 2035

All or None (AON) run was modeled using current CAMPO model, using existing lanes capacity and highway links. The freeway segments were chosen for logical breaks to understand the capacity deficit based on 2035 travel demand in the adopted CAMPO long range transportation plan. The AON analysis was performed by CAMPO modeling staff on March 2, 2012 using current CAMPO travel demand model and data sets for current and horizon year (2035) travel demand on existing freeways. Current/existing lanes on both facilities are from the adopted highway network in the CAMPO 2035 Plan.

As I noted on the phone Friday, the two people here at Capital Metro that worked on this ‘thought experiment’ with CAMPO staff are both no longer at the agency so recollecting the exact details is difficult at best.

Thanks. What specific traffic counts went into this? I ask because we’ve reported lately that traffic is on the decline on I-35.

The traffic counts are not counts per se, but projections from the CAMPO 2035 model runs, based again on the ‘all or nothing’ approach of unconstrained demand. So while vehicle miles traveled per capita in the region (and nationally) are down, that would not be reflected in this analysis because at the time it was run the CAMPO model inputs were based on a 2005 “base year” and so would not have been updated to reflect lower driving rates from that time to present.
