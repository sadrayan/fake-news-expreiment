Creationists want equal airtime on 'Cosmos'
Creationists are demanding that they receive the opportunity for equal airtime on the science television show Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.

The show tells the graphic story of the Big Bang as the beginning of the universe and the evolution of the Earth, and has infuriated creationist groups. Despite the fact that there is substantial scientific evidence to prove the Big Bang, evolution, and climate change, creationists believe the show not mentioning the idea of creationism is a dreadful oversight. To that end, creationists are now demanding equal airtime to share their ideas about the formation of the universe.

"I was struck in the first episode where [Tyson] talked about science and how, you know, all ideas are discussed, you know, everything is up for discussion -- it's all on the table -- and I thought to myself, 'No, consideration of special creation is definitely not open for discussion, it would seem." said Danny Faulkner of Answers in Genesis.

The show's host, Neil deGrasse Tyson, has flat-out denied the requests and has made it abundantly clear that the show will contain scientifically-proven fact. He said while he approves of the media's ethos to provide opposing views so they may remain balanced, that has no place in science.

"You don't talk about the spherical earth with NASA and then say let's give equal time to the flat-earthers," said Tyson.

Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey airs on FOX and will have 13 episodes this season.
