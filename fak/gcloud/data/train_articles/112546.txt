After the dramatic spike and then drop in gasoline prices in 2008 to about $1.60 per gallon for Regular, prices generally increased through 2009 and the Spring of 2010 up to a national average of around $2.90 per gallon for Regular in early May, and then decreased to and hovered around $2.75 per gallon to September.

EIA analysis of the petroleum market points to the price of crude oil as the main contributor to the general increase in retail gasoline prices since the start of 2009. Gasoline production and inventory levels relative to demand also influenced prices.
