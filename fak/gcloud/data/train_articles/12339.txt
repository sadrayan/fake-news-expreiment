Assemblyman Travis Allen Calls Out Jerry Brown’s Malfeasance with Oroville Dam Failure
“The Oroville Dam failure is yet another example of Jerry Brown’s malfeasance as Governor. The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville. Now trillions of gallons of water are being lost and people are evacuating their homes. What does it take for the California Democrats to actually fix anything?

“For the last 3 years, Jerry Brown has been more interested in telling Californians how to kill their lawns and calling for “shower cops” than actually addressing our insufficient water system. Jerry Brown should have taken a page out of his father's playbook and expanded the state water project for the benefit of all Californians instead of squandering hard earned taxpayer dollars on boondoggles like high speed rail.

“Instead of historic rainfall capture and storage with our recent storms, California citizens are once again left high and dry with the Democrats’ failed promises and inexcusable records of inaction. My heart goes out to all the good Californians forced out of their homes for this avoidable tragedy. Californians deserve better.”
