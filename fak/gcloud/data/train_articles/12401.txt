PUBLIC CORRUPTION TEAM

When he ran for office, Attorney General Hawley promised to take on public corruption in Missouri. And he has. AG Hawley formed the Officeâ€™s first Public Corruption Team to investigate and prosecute corruption in the state.

Led by Deputy Attorney General Darrell Moore, the Public Corruption Team has already taken on public officials who have abused their office, including bringing the first quo warranto action -- to strip a public official of his office -- in over twenty years. The Team continues to actively investigate and prosecute official abuses of power and other corruption to keep Missouri government honest and clean.

If you have concerns about the propriety of conduct by a public official in your community, please submit a complaint to our office.
