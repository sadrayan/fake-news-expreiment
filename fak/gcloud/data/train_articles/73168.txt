A NEW AD IN THE RACE FOR SUPREME COURT RAISES QUESTIONS

ABOUT THE INDPENDENCE OF JUSTICE REBECCA BRADLEY...

-- SUSAN --

-- SUSAN --

BUT ARE ALL THE CONNECTIONS THE AD DRAWS LEGIT?

POLITICAL REPORTER JESSICA ARP TELLS US IN TONIGHT'S

REALITY CHECK.

REPEATING SOME CLAIMS MADE BEFORE, AND SOME NEW ONES...

JUDGE JOANNE KLOPPENBURG CONTINUES TO ARGUE JUSTICE

REBECCA BRADLEY IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH STATE REPUBLICANS.

1 SOTW1 45

:00 is rebecca bradley independent enough to serve

on the wisconsin supreme court? :04 scott walker appointed

bradley three times to three judgeships in three years

:08

2 VO/MINI-DISCW2 55

WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS CLAIM BEFORE...

AND IT'S TRUE.

GOVERNOR WALKER APPOINTED BRADLEY TO A MILWAUKEE CIRCUIT

COURT JUDGESHIP...

AN APPEALS COURT POSITION, AND THEN HER CURRENT SEAT

ON THE STATE SUPREME COURT...

WHICH BRADLEY IS RUNNING TO KEEP.

2 SOTW3 44

:08 the republican party is helping pay for bradley's

campaign :10

3 VO/MINI-DISCW4 55

THIS IS TRUE.

A LOOK AT BRADLEY'S CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS SHOW

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF WISCONSIN GIVING BRADLEY MORE

THAN EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR HER CAMPAIGN...

ALONG WITH MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND IN DONATIONS FROM

COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY GROUPS.

3 VO/MINI-DISCW5 55

WHAT DO KLOPPENBURG'S FINANCE REPORTS LOOK LIKE?

SHE'S HASN'T GOTTEN ANY DONATIONS FROM THE DEMOCRATIC

PARTY...

BUT SHE DID TAKE 18 THOUSAND DOLLARS IN JANUARY FROM

THE MADISON TEACHERS UNION.

AND A SMALL DONATION FROM A LOCAL ELECTRIAL WORKERS

UNION.

2 SOTW6 44

:10 and she recently skipped court to attend an event

paid for by walker's lobbyist friends :16

3 VO/MINI-DISCW7 55

THIS NEEDS CLARIFICATION.

BRADLEY DIDN'T SKIP COURT COMPLETELY.

SHE LEFT ORAL ARGUMENTS EARLY TO ATTEND AND SPEAK

AT AN EVENT FOR WISCONSIN MANUFACTURERS AND COMMERCE.

THE STATE'S LARGEST BUSINESS ORGANIZATION THAT HAS

SUPPORTED WALKER IN THE PAST.

AND WHOM THE GOVERNOR SPOKE TO EARLIER IN THE DAY.

BRADLEY TOLD REPORTERS SHE HAD ASKED QUESTIONS PRIOR

TO LEAVING AND NEEDED NO MORE INFORMATION.

I'M JESSICA ARP WITH THIS NEWS THREE REALITY CHECK.

WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER REALITY CHECK TOMORROW NIGHT AT

FIVE ON A NEW AD RUNNING AGAINST JUDGE KLOPPENBURG.
