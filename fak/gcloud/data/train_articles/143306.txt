Hand Colored Postcard of Execution of Mexican Murderers, Prescott, Arizona, 1904

Item #018178



This color litho post card produced by Brisley Drug Company from Prescott, Arizona has the caption: "Adios Amigos". Measures approximately 3 1/2" x 5 1/2". Goddard Station was a popular stagecoach stop between Phoenix and Prescott and on February 1, 1903 two heavy-set Mexicans came into the little ranch-cafe asked to be fed but immediately drew their guns and murdered Charles E. Goddard, the proprietor and his clerk Frank Cox in front of his wife Rosa and Milton Turnbull, a friend. The story of how they fled to Mexico and how they were captured (without the niceties of extradition) is one of the most fascinating in Arizona History. They were brought to trail in June 1903 and unlike James Parker the legendary murdered and bad man who had appeals lasting for years, they were tried and on July 31 and hung. Their final words before being hung were "Adios!" Those who have studied the hanging have concluded their apparently were sufficient witnesses but the short path from trial to execution would not have been the case had the victims been white. The local journal Arizona Miner wrote: "When the guards compelled them to take a bath last night, they showed more signs of real suffering than at any previous time since they had been in jail." A very nice copy in heavy protective envelope.
