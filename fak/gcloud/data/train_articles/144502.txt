Russia’s defence ministry has denied responded to the claims saying the reports of a Russian military presence inside Ukraine “bear no relation to reality”.

However, Nato has released the Digital Global satellite images (pictured, below), and said the photographs show a “blatant attempt” by Russia to “change the momentum of the fighting” in Ukraine in favour of separatist rebels. You can see the images below.

“Over the past two weeks we have noted a significant escalation in both the level and sophistication of Russia’s military interference in Ukraine,” said Brigadier General Tak of Nato’s Comprehensive Crisis and Operations Management Centre.

“The satellite images released today provide additional evidence that Russian combat soldiers, equipped with sophisticated heavy weaponry, are operating inside Ukraine’s sovereign territory.

“We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons, including air defence systems, artillery, tanks, and armoured personnel carriers being transferred to separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.

“The presence of these weapons along with substantial numbers of Russian combat troops inside Ukraine make the situation increasingly grave.”

He added: “Russia is reinforcing and resupplying separatist forces in a blatant attempt to change the momentum of the fighting, which is currently favouring the Ukrainian military.

“Russia’s ultimate aim is to alleviate pressure on separatist fighters in order to prolong this conflict indefinitely, which would result in further tragedy for the people of eastern Ukraine.”

Ukraine’s president Petro Poroshenko said: “Russian forces have entered Ukraine.” He summoned his national security council as the strategic south-eastern town of Novoazovsk appeared firmly under the control of separatists.

Earlier this year Nato released satellite images of Russian trops at Ukraine’s border.
