Trump wants his huge military parade on Fourth of July
President Trump on Tuesday revived his plan for a parade or “gathering” in the nation’s capital July 4, saying “it could become a tradition” — although the city already stages its own annual parade, concert and fireworks display on that holiday.

The president told reporters during a White House Cabinet meeting that he was considering the Lincoln Memorial.

“We’re thinking about doing on the Fourth of July or thereabouts a parade, a ‘Salute to America’ parade. It’ll be a, really a gathering as opposed to a parade, I guess you’d have to say. Perhaps at the Lincoln Memorial, we’re looking at sites,” he said. “But we’re thinking about doing something which would become perhaps become a tradition . . . on July Fourth or July Fourth weekend.”

Trump has longed for a military-style parade ever since he attended the annual Bastille Day parade in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron in 2017.

He has previously suggested a massive military parade, possibly on Veterans Day.

But the idea was scrapped in August after Defense Department officials said it could cost up to $92 million.

Washington’s annual July Fourth celebration includes fireworks at the National Mall, a free concert and the National Independence Day Parade down Constitution ­Avenue.
