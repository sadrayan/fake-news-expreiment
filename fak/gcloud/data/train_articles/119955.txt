Missing Children/Missing Endangered Adults

The Indiana General Assembly established the Indiana Clearinghouse for Information on Missing Children and Missing Endangered Adults in 2009. The Clearinghouse is intended to serve as the state central repository for all information on missing children and missing endangered adults from Indiana or believed to be in Indiana. The program is designed to collect, store, and disseminate information on missing children and missing and endangered adults. The Clearinghouse provides liaison among citizens, private organizations, and law enforcement agencies regarding missing children information.
