Legislator introduced resolution: don't make Erie County a sanctuary community
BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) - An Erie County legislator wants to make sure Erie County doesn't become a sanctuary community. These are areas that protect and shelter illegal immigrants.

Republican Ted Morton says those communities are dangerous to public safety, a reason why he wants local law enforcement to work with the federal government. He says that way, the federal government gets to decide what should happen to illegal immigrants.

"Too many tragedies across the country where law-abiding citizens are attacked violently or murdered by someone who's here illegally because they've been given sanctuary, and I find that to be wrong," said Legislator Morton.

But legislator Patrick Burke says this is not a solution, or a problem to begin with.

"Of course we should enforce our laws, and we should also try and consider families lives and the people we're ripping apart, but his resolution is filled with misinformation," said Legislator Burke.

Legislator Morton says the resolution will go to a committee next week.
