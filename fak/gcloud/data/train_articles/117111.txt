DNA testing leads to arrest for needles found on Darien school property
Police have arrested a Darien woman in connection with medical needles found on the Holmes School playground by the elementary school’s students and staff over several days in May after her DNA was allegedly found on the needles.

Anne Curtis, 32, of 32 Hoyt Street Darien, was arrested by the Darien Police Department on Friday, Aug. 8. Curtis turned herself in to Darien Police after learning that they held a warrant for her arrest. The arrest was the result of an investigation by the Darien Police regarding the hypodermic needles at Holmes School.

The six needles recovered from the school grounds tested positive for cocaine residue, according to Darien Police.

Three needles and syringes were tested by the State of Connecticut Forensic Lab for DNA analysis, and all three syringes contained Curtis’ DNA. Curtis lives next to the school.

Curtis was charged with three counts of risk of injury to a minor, a Class B felony, and was held on a $10,000 bond. Curtis was taken to Stamford Superior Court for arraignment today.

Curtis was also arrested in May for cocaine and drug paraphernalia possession after police reported finding the contraband in her home. At the time, Sgt. Jeremiah Marron said the paraphernalia allegedly located at Curtis’s home was identical to the needles found on Holmes School property.

A needle was also found on Tokeneke School property in May, but police said it had its cap on and was not similar to the Holmes School needles.
