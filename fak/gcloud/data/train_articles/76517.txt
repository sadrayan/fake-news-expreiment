2012 SmartWay Shipper Awardees In 2012 EPA recognized its SmartWay partners for the first time using the program's "second generation" suite of freight assessment and carbon tracking tools. During 2010 and 2011, EPA SmartWay and its partners upgraded all of the program's assessment and tracking tools with an improved system to quantify and benchmark the efficiency of moving goods. These tools are now being used by all SmartWay partners, and the 2012 awards program represented the first year that partners were recognized based on the their performance, as assessed using SmartWay's "second generation" tools.
