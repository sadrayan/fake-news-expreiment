What Did Sen. Richard Blumenthal Really Say About His Military Record and Vietnam?
An examination Monday of articles in The Courant and the state's larger dailies revealed at least four stories — two each in the New Haven Register and the Connecticut Post — over the past decade in which Blumenthal was described as having actually served in Vietnam. One, from the Post in May 2008, quotes him as saying "when we returned from Vietnam, I remember the taunts, the verbal and even physical abuse we encountered," but the other passages make the statement without attribution. Those same papers and others more frequently reported his service record accurately.
