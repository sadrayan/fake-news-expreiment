N.J. judge begins hearing testimony on whether Gov. Christie was allowed to cut school aid
State Superior Court Judge Peter Doyne began hearing testimony today about whether Gov. Chris Christie was within his constitutional rights last year when he cut aid to local schools by about $1 billion.

Doyne was appointed by the State Supreme Court to help determine whether the cuts violated the state's obligation to fully fund a formula for distributing money to districts.

The Christie administration says the cuts, though painful, were needed to balance the budget.

The Education Law Center, a group that advocates for students, challenged the cuts.

This morning, Jon Martin, Deputy Attorney General for the State, questioned Robert Copeland, Superintendent of the Piscataway School District, who testified to staff cuts and program eliminations made after the district lost nearly $5 million in state aid.

Testimony will continue in the Abbott v. Burke school funding case before Judge Peter Doyne.
