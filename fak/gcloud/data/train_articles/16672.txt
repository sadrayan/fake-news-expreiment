Kendall:

Hello again; thanks for the phone interview. As mentioned, we spotted your comment quoted here that “Bob Hall never successfully passed a bill before.”

Toward starting a fact-check, we searched legislative records next for indications of measures passed into law that were authored, co-authored, sponsored or co-sponsored by Hall, who has been in the Senate since 2015. One search (shown in the attached image) appears to indicate that Hall in the 2017 session authored SB 102 into law. Other searches suggest Hall in the 2015 and 2017 sessions (including the special session in 2017) co-authored, sponsored and co-sponsored multiple measures, House and Senate, that passed into law -- plus a proposal that was vetoed.

Can you specify how you reached your “never” conclusion?

Anything more to consider as we evaluate your claim?

We hope to review this fully by midday Wednesday. I’d be grateful to hear back by phone or email. We rely on attributable on-the-record information for all our stories.

Thanks,

g.

Thank you so much for reaching out.

In that statement's full context, I believe I was discussing with the crowd that Senator Hall has not been an effective legislator when his district has needed him--specifically pointing to his failure to assist Texas A&M-Commerce as they worked to construct a new nursing facility. When his district has needed him, Hall has never been able to pass a bill on his own, but instead requires the assistance of his colleagues to drag his bills across the finish line. You can pull data on any of his Republican senate colleagues at random and find bills they authored on their own that they were able to successfully pass into law to directly benefit their districts. With the exception of Sen. Burton who was only able to pass one bill on her own, all of Hall's other Republican colleagues were able to pass 5 or more bills as the sole, primary author. Even SB102 to which you are referring was co-authored by Democratic Sen. Garcia. Sen. Hall is toxic, and most mainstream members of the house hesitate or refuse to strap their names on any bill Hall authors on his own due to his extremist ideology and his poor legislative track record. His inefficacy has hurt our district and I firmly believe that Senate District 2 would be better served by a moderate senator who will work across the aisle to actually deliver results for our community. SD 2 deserves a senator who will focus on our schools, infrastructure, hospitals, ethics reform, and property taxes, not a zealot who has told the Texas Tribune that the biggest issue facing Texas is death pulses from outer space (see here: https://www.texastribune.org/2016/04/29/beneath-texas-capitol-dome-warnings-apocalypse/), even going so far as to tell crowds at district events that "nothing else matters" (video available if needed).

I would also add that Sen. Hall has been so ineffective in the legislature that he was named to the 2017 Furniture List by Texas Monthly (See attached).

I hope that this assists in clarifying my statement. If your research contradicts our finding that Hall has failed to pass a single bill on his own standing, please let me know so that we can correct ourselves. It is absolutely never our intention to mislead voters--I firmly believe that a well-informed electorate will lead to our success in November. If you need any further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out anytime.

Got it.

We remain interested in how you determined that Hall has not passed legislation into law. So far, it looks to us from legislative records like he advanced one authored proposal into law in the 2017 session and co-sponsored or co-authored other proposals that made it into law in 2015 and 2017. If that’s not right, let us know?

Thanks,

Again, I was specifically referring to Sen. Hall's inability to pass legislation benefiting his district as a primary author (in short stump speeches, it can be difficult to specifically outline the intricacies of legislative processes). Senator Hall has failed to pass a single bill on which he was the primary author-- each of these bills have abruptly died, or in one case (SB102) required the authorship of another senator to successfully pass. When our district is in need of a legislator who can author and pass legislation on our behalf, Sen. Hall has illustrated that he is unable to accomplish this task. I am of the opinion that a legislator should not have to depend on her/his colleagues to accomplish this basic function of the job. I do not believe that it is the intention of voters to send legislators to Austin simply to gather dust and hobknob with special interest groups, but instead to work on real solutions to real issues specific to our district.

Attached to this email, you will find the searches in the Texas Legislature Online - Bill Search supporting our claim.

I hope that this provides the clarification that you were looking for. If you have any further questions or points of clarification, please do not hesitate to let me know.
