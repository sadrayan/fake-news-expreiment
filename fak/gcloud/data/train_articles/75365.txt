David released the following statement on passage of federal health care legislation:

"Today's action by Congress is a slap in the face to the clear majority of Texans, and Americans, who demand real health care reform resulting from an open and transparent process and that truly fixes a broken system. Instead, this federal plan costs Texas taxpayers $2.4 billion per year and could force the state to redirect spending away from priority items such as education, public safety and road construction, just to cover the unfunded, unaffordable mandates in this bill. I will continue to fight for affordable, accessible health care that does not increase costs or taxes on hard working Texas families and truly improves the quality of care."
