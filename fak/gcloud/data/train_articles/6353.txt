Hillary Clinton’s Saskatoon speech touches on terrorism, healthcare
SASKATOON – Touching on terrorism and what Canada and the United States can do to combat it, Hillary Clinton spoke to a full house in Saskatoon. Over 2,000 people came out to hear the former U.S secretary of state at TCU Place Wednesday evening.

Clinton said there has to be a multi-prong approach to dealing with terrorism and military action is necessary in some settings.

Clinton also touched on health care, saying she admires Saskatchewan for what leaders like Tommy Douglas accomplished when it comes to medicare.

She spoke about President Barack Obama’s signature health care law and said the U.S. is in a learning period that has had its shortfalls and glitches. Clinton said they must keep moving forward to get to affordable, universal health-care coverage like Canada has.

She also spoke about woman’s rights and climate change but refused to weigh-in on the Keystone XL pipeline. Clinton said there is a regulatory process in place and she has made it repeatedly clear she won’t express an opinion.
