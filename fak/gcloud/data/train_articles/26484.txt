Governor Walker Announces $7.68 million in Preliminary Broadband Expansion Grants to Connect 46 Rural Communities
MADISON – Governor Scott Walker today announced the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSC) has awarded the largest round of Broadband Expansion Grants in state history with $7.68 million in total preliminary awards leveraged to $19,468,725 in private matching funds. 46 new grants have been awarded to extend high-speed internet access to as many as 1,600 business locations and 18,000 residential locations . The awards announced today are preliminary and will be finalized upon the issuance of the Commission’s written decision and the expiration of a 10-day appeal process. In addition, Governor Walker announced the opening of application process for next round of grants.

“Broadband has endless potential to help Wisconsin communities,” said Governor Walker. “Years ago, electricity revolutionized farming for my grandparents. Today broadband is revolutionizing education, health care, and business, and improving the quality of life for Wisconsin’s rural residents. With this historic round of Broadband Expansion Grants, we are another step closer to connecting every Wisconsin community.”

In this budget, Governor Walker increased total broadband investments by $35 million and created a permanent Broadband Expansion Grant program. Prior to today’s awards, the PSC has awarded 55 Broadband Expansion Grants totaling $5,452,000 since Governor Walker took office.

Among the projects approved today are three projects that will test the new TV White Space technology proposed by Packerland Broadband and Microsoft Corporation, and two additional projects that will create improved internet service for work at home in Buffalo and Walworth Counties.

Other projects include the build out of broadband services in some of the most rural areas of the state in an effort to provide a communication infrastructure for Wisconsin’s rural families, businesses, and tourism industry.
