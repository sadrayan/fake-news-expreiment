The 2008 Bombing Of Gori
As war broke out between Russia and Georgia on August 7, 2008, over the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the Georgian city of Gori was at the heart of the fighting. Russian bombers targeted the city before ground forces moved in and occupied Gori on August 11. RFE/RL Georgian Service correspondent Koba Liklikadze captured these images of Gori in the midst of the conflict.
