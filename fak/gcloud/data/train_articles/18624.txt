Water Management District Budgets
Effective and efficient water management is essential to the public, the environment and Florida’s economic health and welfare. The core mission of Florida’s five water management districts is water supply, water quality, flood protection and floodplain management, and natural systems management. Over the past several years, DEP has worked collaboratively with the water management districts to review, revise and realign their operations, practices and budgets.

To ensure the fiscal accountability of the water management districts, section 373.536(5)(a), Florida Statutes, authorizes the Executive Office of the Governor to approve or disapprove water management district budgets in whole or in part and directs the districts to submit a tentative proposed budget by August 1 in a standard format prescribed by the Executive Office of the Governor. The statute also requires the submittal of a tentative budget by July 15 each year for consideration by the District's Governing Board. The district also prepares a preliminary budget each year, which is submitted by January 15, for legislative review to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairs of each legisliative committee or subcommittee having substantive or fiscal jurisdiction over water management districts, in accordance with section 373.535, Florida Statutes.
