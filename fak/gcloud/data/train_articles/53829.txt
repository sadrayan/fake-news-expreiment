Senator Rubio Comments On Today’s Vote
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) issued the following statement regarding today’s vote on the Senate Democrats’ Paycheck Fairness Act, as well as their refusal to consider the Rewarding Achievement and Incentivizing Successful Employees (RAISE) Act Rubio introduced earlier this year:“Once again, Senate Democrats have wasted the American people’s time by holding yet another show vote that proves any sense of urgency they have is about scoring political points instead of solving the problems that threaten America’s future. If Senate Democrats want to address ‘paycheck fairness’, they can start by supporting the RAISE Act which would help workers earn more money by allowing employers to give them merit-based pay raises and bonuses without first having to clear it by union bosses. Instead, Senate Democrats refuse to even consider the idea and insist on denying hard workers the potential to earn more money for a job well done. Sadly, for them, government and union bosses should have more power than job creators when it comes to giving raises and bonuses to people that earn them.”
