Justice Dept. to Work With 12 Cities to Fight Violent Crime
BETHESDA, Md. — The Justice Department will form partnerships with a dozen cities across the country to help them fight gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday.

Under the program — the Trump administration’s latest move in prioritizing a reduction in violent crime — advisers and consultants will help local law enforcement officials develop strategies to combat violent crime. The cities will not receive funding as part of the initiative, a Justice Department spokesman said.

“We will make America and every American neighborhood safe again,” Mr. Sessions said, announcing the partnerships at the start of a summit meeting of state, local and federal officials in suburban Washington organized by his task force on crime reduction and public safety.

“This program will help communities suffering from serious violent crime problems to build up their capacity to fight back,” Mr. Sessions said, denouncing a recent rise in violent crime in the United States while praising law enforcement officers for their role in reducing it before that.
