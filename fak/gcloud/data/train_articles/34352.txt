New Partnership to Build on Live Well San Diego Announced
The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency announced today it is joining a new partnership with the Clinton Foundation and The San Diego Foundation to improve the health and well-being of children in San Diego County.

The goal of the partnership is to build upon the success of San Diego County’s Live Well San Diego initiative and develop a strategy for preventing children from entering the juvenile justice or foster care systems.

“Live Well San Diego is about cross-sector collaboration and building on the diverse perspectives from our communities to achieve a shared goal or a healthier, safer and more thriving region,” said Nick Macchione, Health and Human Services Agency director. “We are excited about this new partnership that is aimed at strengthening families and addressing critical issues impacting our children today.”

The multi-year partnership will look at disparities in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, get feedback from community leaders and residents, and find solutions to improve the health and well-being of children and families from San Diego County.
