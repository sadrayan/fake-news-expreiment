Hi Everyone, Pete here! Seems to be an upsurge in people attempting DIY this weekend but using the same group of products…Duct Tape, rope, tie backs, electrical tape. Odd. Anyway, here’s a bit of advice.

- Duct Tape – has a very strong adhesive, be careful it doesn’t come into contact with hair and be aware of any allergic reaction on contact with skin.

- Cable Ties – remember that once these are tightened, they will not come undone and will need to be cut. Please use suitable safety scissors to cut these.

- Rope – we have rope in different colours and sizes and I would recommend using a pair of Rigger gloves to avoid any rope burns.

- Electrical Tape – a great product to use around the ends of your rope to stop it from fraying

Stay safe this weekend folks and try and keep the mess to a minimum by using the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment. Hard Hat, Safety Glasses & Dust Mask. A tidy work area is a safe one.

Thanks, Pete
