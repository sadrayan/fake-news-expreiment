Former President Barack Obama will raise money for the Democratic National Committee at a Los Angeles fundraiser later this month, as he continues to edge into the midterm elections.

Billed as a gala dinner, the June 28 event will be Obama’s first for the DNC this year. Tickets start at $2,700 for general admission, rising to $100,000 for premium seating, a photo reception, membership to the DNC’s National Finance Committee and other benefits, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO.

Obama, who raised money for the DNC last year, has made several endorsements to date in the midterm elections — including Sen. Dianne Feinstein in next Tuesday's California primary. He is expected to intensify his political activities as the general election draws nearer.

The former president remains popular among Democrats in heavily Democratic California, a longstanding fundraising base for the party. Before raising money for the DNC this month, Obama was scheduled to attend a Beverly Hills fundraiser in May for Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).
