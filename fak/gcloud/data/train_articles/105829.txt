I ENDORSE BERNIE SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT! – Nancy Pelosi
Press Release: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Endorses Senator Bernie Sanders: “Clearly the most qualified candidate with a vision for our future”

WASHINGTON, DC- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders today for Democratic Nominee for Presidential of the United States of America.

The following is a transcript of her official endorsement:

“I am going on record to officially endorse Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Election for President. During his inspiring campaign rise over the last several months, Senator Sanders has proven that he has the vision and conviction to lead America. Furthermore, his showing in Iowa yesterday proved that he can capture the hearts, minds, and votes of the American people.

“He is one of the most effective and responsive leaders I have ever worked with. His passion, his plan, and his vision is what sets him apart from any other candidate running for this office. I am proud to say that Senator Sanders will have my vote.”

“I look forward to seeing where Senator Sanders will lead this country. I cannot remember the last time that a fellow politician inspired me this deeply and passionately.”

Pelosi has previously endorsed only two candidates, and never a Presidential candidate. She has endorsed Governor Jerry Brown in 1976 and House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt in 2004. This unprecedented endorsement is another positive turn in a campaign full of firsts for Senator Sanders.
