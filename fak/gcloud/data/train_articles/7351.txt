Lt. Col. Shaffer: Potential Obama Wiretapping Is 'Soviet-Level Wrongdoing'
Ret. U.S. Army Intelligence Officer Tony Shaffer said potential wiretapping by a sitting U.S. president is "Soviet-level wrongdoing."

Lt. Col. Shaffer was a guest Saturday morning on "Fox & Friends Weekend" sharing his thoughts on President Donald Trump's early morning tweets accusing the Obama administration of wiretapping Trump Tower prior to the 2016 election.

Obama, through his spokesman Kevin Lewis, denied such allegations.

Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017

Shaffer said it is "very likely" Obama authorized the wiretapping.

"Simply because you don't like someone doesn't give you the right as the sitting president to do something like this. ... This was about trying to gain an advantage for his side, this case [Hillary] Clinton," he said.

Shaffer also said Trump must have sufficient evidence since he went public with the accusations on Twitter.
