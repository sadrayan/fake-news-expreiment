Stupid is as stupid does. And an idiot woman realized how stupid she really is after she slapped a police horse.

The horse immediately kicked her. She fell flat on her face and then ran away holding her nose. That’s instant karma! What kind of a heartless jerk hurts a horse?

You can see the immediate street justice in the video below.

This happened at Queen’s University in Ontario. Three people were arrested for smacking a police horse that day. They face up to five years in jail if they are found guilty. That should make anyone think twice before trying this!
