WHO: Bananas From India Are Being Injected With The HIV Virus Prior To U.S. Shipment -
BREAKING – The World Health Organization (WHO) has just released a major recall of bananas shipped to the United States from India, the largest banana supplier in the world. According to WHO it is estimated there have been more than 2 million infected bananas that have entered into this country in the month of March.

International media has reported that countries such as Mexico, Canada, the United States, Argentina and Brazil are at the highest risk for the HIV banana contamination. “If you have purchased bananas in the month of March throw them away,” said Sarah Reinhardt, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization. “The chances of your banana being contaminated with the HIV virus are extremely high. It’s just not worth the chance.”

Major retailers have pulled all of their bananas off the shelves. However, some have not saying that they feel the risk is “minimal” compared to the financial loss they will suffer by throwing away so-called “contaminated” bananas. Reinhardt says you should use extreme caution when going to the grocery stores that are still selling bananas through the months of March and April. “Just because they are on the shelves does not mean they are safe,” Said Reinhard. “In my opinion, they should be ashamed of themselves putting money before the lives of American citizens.”
