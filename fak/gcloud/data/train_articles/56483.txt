Fatal opioid overdoses by state
All states in the nation are grappling with an opioid epidemic. Using data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention comparing overdose deaths in 2017 to 2018, states and the District of Columbia are ranked by largest positive change between the two years. The area with the largest decrease in opioid deaths ranked No. 1, while the state with the highest increase in opioid deaths ranked No. 50.

Because fatal drug overdoses are often underestimated, the CDC also factored for predicted cases. Metrics include percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific or drug classes reported, according to the CDC.
