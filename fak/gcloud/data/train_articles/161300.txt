The Pentagon says it hasn't heard from Trump on new border deployments, despite his tweet
The Pentagon said Monday that it has not received any order to send more troops to the U.S.-Mexico border following a tweet by President Trump declaring an approaching migrant caravan a national emergency.

As of Monday morning, there was no change in the border deployment of 2,100 National Guard troops, which have been assisting the Department of Homeland Security since April, said Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.

A statement released by the Pentagon last week saying “the Department of Defense has not been tasked to provide additional support” still stands, Davis said.

The Guard troops are not directly involved in law enforcement activities and are under the direction of state governors. The president deployed the force this spring after proclaiming illegal immigration a national crisis.

Trump issued a series of tweets Monday morning warning that a caravan of Central American migrants estimated to be 5,000-7,000 people marching north through southern Mexico has been infiltrated and is a national security threat.

“Sadly, it looks like Mexico’s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy [sic]. Must change laws!” the president tweeted.

The U.S. will also cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because they have not stopped the group from heading north, Trump tweeted.
