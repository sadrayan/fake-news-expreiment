Forget "eat more chicken"; it's going to be eat more beef at Emory University next year. Chick-fil-A is being left out of the university's redesigned food court.

"A chicken sandwich isn't very popular," says Michael Sacks, co-chair of the Food Advisory Committee at Emory, "so we want to do a burger place."

Chick-fil-A has been heavily criticized for taken an open stance against same-sex marriage. As a result, Emory University has faced pressure from student groups to distance itself from Chick-fil-A

"It's kind of unfortunate that people very easily jump to the conclusion that Chick-fil-A's political views were the reason we got rid of them," Sacks tells News/Talk WSB, "but that was not our intention at all."

Pizza Hut will also be removed as the school redesigns Cox Hall. The goal, Sacks says, is to appeal to all students.
