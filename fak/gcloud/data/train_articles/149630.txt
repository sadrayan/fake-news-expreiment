United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary
Dianne Feinstein

of California

As California's senior Senator, Dianne Feinstein has built a reputation as an independent voice, working with both Democrats and Republicans to find commonsense solutions to the problems facing California and the nation.



Since her election to the Senate in 1992, Senator Feinstein has worked in a bipartisan way to build a significant record of legislative accomplishments, helping strengthen the nation's security at home and abroad, combat crime and violence, battle cancer and protect natural resources in California and across the country.



In 2009, Senator Feinstein assumed chairmanship of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, where she oversaw the nation’s 16 intelligence agencies. She was the first female Senator to hold that position. As chairman, Feinstein oversaw the passage of six intelligence authorization bills following a five-year drought. The committee also approved a key bipartisan report on the Benghazi attacks and released key information about the CIA's detention and interrogation program following a six-year review. Today, Senator Feinstein serves as vice chairman of the committee, during which time the committee passed the first significant congressional legislation to address security flaws in our nation's cybersecurity.



Senator Feinstein is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee where she is ranking member on the Subcommittee on Energy and Water. She is also a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which she chaired during the 110th Congress. In that capacity, Senator Feinstein was the first woman to chair the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and presided over the inauguration of President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009.



In addition to her official committee assignments, Senator Feinstein is co-chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, co-chairman of the Senate Cancer Coalition and co-chairman of the Senate Women’s Caucus on Burma. She is also a member of the Anti-Meth Caucus, the Congressional Dairy Caucus and the Congressional Former Mayors Caucus. She has served as a member of the Aspen Strategy Group since 1997.
