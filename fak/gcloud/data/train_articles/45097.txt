Cuomo under fire $4.9 million gift from NYC subway to Adirondack ski hills
Governor Andrew Cuomo faces questions and criticism following reports that his administration transferred nearly $5 million from New York City's struggling subway system to subsidize ski areas here in the North Country.

The payment was first reported in the New York Daily News.

The MTA operates New York City's famous subway system, which faces a backlog of infrastructure and upkeep problems so severe that some have described it as on the verge of collapse. But in March of last year, the state agency sent a check for $4.9 million to the Olympic Regional Development Authority which operates ski areas at Whiteface and Gore Mountains as well as the Belleayre resort in the Catskills.

The fund transfer followed a disastrous season for ORDA when warm weather kept tourists off the slopes, meaning deep deficits for the authority. State Senator Michael Gianaris a Democrat from Queens told the new York Daily News that the fund transfer was "odd."

The MTA is "having enough trouble funding its own needs," he said. "I don't see why we'd be sending MTA resources to ski slopes."

The struggles of the MTA has become a major political liability for Cuomo. ORDA has long faced questions about the deficits it runs and about the future of state-run winter sport venues in the Adirondacks.
