"Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives," said Trump, prompting the audible Democratic reaction that could be heard loud and clear on television.

Trump did not appear to react to the boos and hisses.

Democrats had mostly remained quiet for the first hour of the speech, limiting their reactions to sporadic applause.

Family reunification visas do not allow immigrants or U.S. citizens to bring in distant relatives, only to sponsor parents, unmarried children and siblings. In certain cases, sibling sponsorships can take decades to go from application to migration.

Democrats took to Twitter to criticize the remarks.
