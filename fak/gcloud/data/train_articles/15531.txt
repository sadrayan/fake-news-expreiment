(from PolitiFact Texas)

We are trying to check the validity of a Facebook meme brought to our attention by a reader showing U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee saying: “Hey, all you wrinkly, white-aged has-beens: It’s time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet.”

A web search led us to similar language posted by Stand Up for Truth, a religious public affairs program, in a November 2012 web post critical of the United Nations. We haven’t yet found any indication Rep. Jackson Lee has said this or something close to it.

Your guidance/thoughts for our fact check?

Thanks.

No, we don’t know that sentence or where it came from. I do note, however, from looking around the Internet a little, that the sentence seems to be somewhat wrong in that illustration you sent. It’s really, “Hey, all you wrinkly, white, middle-aged has-beens: It’s time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet.”

If it did originate on the Stand Up For Truth website, I’d note that the site sees it as part of an alleged global conspiracy known as Agenda 21. (Meaning, among other things, that the site subscribes to at least some of the conspiracy theories favored by the militia movement and others.) Agenda 21 is not a conspiracy at all, but the far right believes it is. Here’s a link to a white paper we did on Agenda 21 in case you need to figure it out:

I hope that’s helpful. Best,
