Contraception: Moral case against contraception
Summary of the arguments against contraception Those who say contraception is morally wrong do so for a variety of reasons. Contraception is inherently wrong Contraception is unnatural

Contraception is anti-life

Contraception is a form of abortion

Contraception separates sex from reproduction Contraception brings bad consequences These are consequentialist arguments against contraception. Contraception carries health risks

The "contraceptive culture" is dangerous

Contraception prevents potential human beings being conceived

Contraception prevents people who might benefit humanity from being born

Contraception can be used as a eugenic tool

Contraception is often misused in mass population control programmes in a racist way

Mass population control programmes can be a form of cultural imperialism or a misuse of power

Contraception may lead to depopulation This sounds odd to an age concerned about overpopulation but for substantial parts of the 1800s and 1900s this was a real fear.

Contraception leads to "immoral behaviour" Contraception makes it easier for people to have sex outside marriage

Contraception leads to widespread sexual immorality

Contraception allows people (even married people) to have sex purely for enjoyment Top

Arguments based on life and the natural order Contraception is unnatural Holders of this view argue something like this the natural consequence of having sexual intercourse is conceiving a child

it is wrong to interfere with this

therefore birth-control is intrinsically wrong This argument depends on two other ideas: there is some purpose to the processes of the universe Opponents say this is a religious idea rather than a secular one - most scientists regard the idea that there is a purpose to the universe as nonsense

it is wrong to interfere with the natural order of the universe Opponents say that human beings interfere with the natural order of the universe all the time (for example when doctors cure illnesses) - sometimes the results are good and sometimes bad Therefore birth control is only a wrong interference with the natural order of the universe if it produces a bad result so it's necessary to look at the consequences of contraception to assess whether it is good or bad that is a different argument, which has nothing to do with the natural order of the universe

Contraception is anti-life This argument is based on the premise that life is a good thing. Holders of this view argue that contraception is morally wrong because: life is a fundamental good - it is a good thing

those who use contraception are engaged in an intentionally "anti-life" act because they intend to prevent a new life coming into being

they therefore have a bad intention

it is always morally wrong to do something with a bad intention Contraception is a form of abortion Some birth control techniques can operate by preventing the implantation and development of a fertilised egg. Those opposed to such methods say that this amounts to an abortion, and that if abortion is wrong then those forms of contraception must also be wrong. The forms of contraception included in this objection are: some birth control pills most modern birth control pills can prevent implantation of a fertilised egg, even though this is not the main way they work there is no way for the user to know after any act of intercourse whether the pill prevented implantation (or worked in some other way) therefore using such pills always runs the risk of causing an abortion it is wrong to run the risk of causing an abortion

the "morning-after" pill this is also capable of operating by preventing implantation of a fertilised egg

the IUD this can operate by preventing implantation of a fertilised egg
