U.S. POSTAL SERVICE BLACK HERITAGE STAMP SERIES

Numerous media reports and internet messages have claimed recently that the U.S. Postal Service will soon discontinue its long-standing Black Heritage stamp series. According to Executive Director, Stamp Services Azeezaly S. Jaffer, "Given the popularity and importance of the Black Heritage stamps, there are no plans to discontinue the series. It is unfortunate that such rumors have spread, and we hope that the Postal Service’s commitment to honoring the historical achievements and contributions of African Americans on stamps will dispel any further concerns."

The U.S. Postal Service Black Heritage series began 21 years ago with a stamp honoring American abolitionist, Harriet Tubman. The most recent stamp in the series was released in January and honored American civil rights leader, Malcolm X. Next year’s honoree will be announced in October when all of the year 2000 commemorative stamps are unveiled.
