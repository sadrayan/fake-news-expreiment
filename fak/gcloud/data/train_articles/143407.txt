Raising Trump: Ivana Trump: 9781501177286: Amazon.com: Books
I bought this book because I have a small child and any good advice about raising children is very welcomed. I agree with lots of things she says about raising kids but some things were really weird and confusing. I think it wouldn't hurt her children if she were more present in their lives.

Also, modesty is a thing she should learn more about.

I found it shocking how much she still respects Donald Trump even though he was the reason their marriage fell apart. Not Marla! If it were not Marla it would have been some other woman with no moral values to be with a married man with three young kids. But it were not Marla's job to cherish their marriage, it was Donald's. He promised her for better or for worse...

Ivana even thanked Donald(at the end of the book) before she thanked her own mother who never betrayed her! This makes me think that she is either fake or respects only people with lots of money no matter how much real respect they actually deserve. I would certainly lose respect for my ex if he cheated on me even if he had Trump's money!
