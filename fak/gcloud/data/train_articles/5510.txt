2018 NCGA Candidates
We're asking all candidates for the NC General Assembly if they pledge to support the creation of an independent, nonpartisan redistricting process for congressional and legislative districts in the upcoming 2019 legislative session.

Common Cause NC does not support or oppose candidates. All legislative candidates were surveyed and given the opportunity to respond. We'll continue to add responses as we receive them.
