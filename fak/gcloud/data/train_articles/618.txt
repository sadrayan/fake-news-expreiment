Hello! I am the Applied Sciences Coordinator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Goddard Applied Sciences brings together Goddard's vast earth science resources for societal benefit. The Goddard Applied Sciences website lists recent highlights, upcoming events and resources for applied scientists. Also, the website provides links to the working groups, partnerships and related programs.



My research investigates stratospheric dynamics, chemistry-climate interactions, and dynamical coupling between the ocean, troposphere and stratosphere, using the GEOSCCM numerical chemistry-climate model. Currently, I am investigating the climate and ozone impacts of greenhouse gases using a coupled ocean-atmosphere version of the GEOSCCM.
