Pet-Safe Antifreeze
But there is a new, less hazardous antifreeze option. Find out what kind of antifreeze to buy to help keep your pets safe.

The toxic element in traditional antifreeze is ethylene glycol. The new kind of antifreeze contains not ethylene glycol, but propylene glycol, which is somewhat safer. In fact, propylene glycol is found in pet foods, cosmetics, and over-the-counter preparations.

One brand of this newer type of antifreeze is SIERRA, made by Safe Brands. A 50/50 mixture of SIERRA and water will protect a carâ€™s engine to -26F; greater protection can be obtained by increasing the ratio of antifreeze to water, according to the company.

SIERRA is available nationwide for about a dollar more per gallon than traditional antifreeze. Many of us feel the price is little to pay if it eliminates a serious threat to our pets.

To be on the safest side, however, keep ANY antifreeze well away from your companion animals!
