Does my Perfect Petzzz have an On/Off switch?

Since we strive to make Perfect Petzzz as lifelike as possible, they do not have an on/off switch. If you wish to turn your pet off, simply remove the battery. Your pet will live up to 3 months with 1 “D” alkaline battery.

My Perfect Petzzz puppy or kitten is making a noise. What should I do?

Our Perfect Petzzz puppies and kittens sleep very soundly and do emit a soft, gentle sound. This sound, which varies from pet to pet, it is part of the manufacturing process and does not represent a defect in the product.

How do I bring my Perfect Petzzz puppy or kitten to life?

Once you place the battery in your puppy or kitten your pet will come to life and begin breathing.

I heard a rumor that the fur on my Perfect Petzzz puppy or kitten is real fur. Is this true?

That is absolutely false. Though we did study real animals in the development of Perfect Petzzz puppies and kittens in our quest to make our product a very realistic looking pet, all of the materials are 100% synthetic. The synthetic hair on the Perfect Petzzz puppy or kitten is made from nylon.
