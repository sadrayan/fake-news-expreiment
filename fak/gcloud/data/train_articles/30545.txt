Modeling the Effect of the Individual Mandate on Health Insurance Coverage
This presentation provides a discussion of the theoretical and empirical basis for CBO’s estimates of the effect on health insurance coverage of repealing the individual mandate—which requires most people to have insurance or pay a penalty. CBO highlights and interprets new empirical evidence that may inform the size of that effect. CBO also poses unanswered questions for which the agency would like the discussants’ and health panel members’ insights.
