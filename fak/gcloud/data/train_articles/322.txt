Ted Cruz’s Father, Rafael, Calls Donald Trump’s Lee Harvey Oswald Allegations 'Ludicrous'
Rafael Cruz, Ted Cruz's father, called Donald Trump’s attempt to link him to John F. Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, "ludicrous."

"It's ludicrous, it's ludicrous," Cruz, 77, told ABC News today in an interview. "I was never in New Orleans at that time."

On "Fox and Friends" Tuesday morning, Trump seized on an unsubstantiated National Enquirer story claiming the elder Cruz had ties to Oswald. The tabloid featured a photo of Oswald handing out pro-Fidel Castro pamphlets in New Orleans in 1963 alongside an unidentified man the Enquirer claimed was Rafael Cruz.

"I mean, what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death, before the shooting?" Trump said on Fox. "It's horrible."

In the interview with ABC News, Rafael Cruz lashed out at his son’s GOP rival.

"That's typical of Donald Trump -- just attack and make all kinds of innuendo and attacks with no substance,” Cruz said.

Rafael Cruz, who is an evangelical pastor, also had a message for Trump: "We will beat him and Ted Cruz will be the next President of the United States."

These comments come just hours after his son, Ted, called the GOP front-runner’s allegations “nuts.”

“Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts,” the Texas senator said while campaigning in Evansville, Indiana.
