A 2-year-old tweet from Donald Trump's Twitter account vanished Friday morning, one in which the current Republican presidential candidate commemorated the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks by offering "best wishes to all, even the haters and losers."

"I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th," Trump tweeted on Sept. 11, 2013.

The account's manual retweet of the message (also sent on Sept. 11, 2013) remained live Friday morning.

"The tweet is from several years ago," Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, when reached by POLITICO for explanation.

Trump later tweeted his own tribute of the 14th anniversary.

Let’s all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2015
