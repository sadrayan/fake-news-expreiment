I know it's over.
this whole day has been wild, seeing so many people put my words on tributes to Alan Rickman across the internet.

the thread on ONTD about this was so hysterical earlier that it had me laughing even after I was crying when I found out he died, and I’m glad to hear that I at least cheered up so many other people with this epic saga. but seeing tens of thousands of people sharing and reblogging it today, genuinely crying over it and having been moved by it is just really sad and sweet to me the more that I think about it.

when I wrote that post I was fifteen years old and had no idea that anyone would read it at all, never mind that it would get so big and so widespread that it was out of my control. it was just something that was personal to me to express how much Harry Potter meant to me. I had no idea that those words would end up meaning so much to so many people.

I realized that if my words are going to go the way of those fake Marilyn Monroe quotes then I couldn’t have asked for a greater person for them to be associated with. growing up I’ve always wanted to be a writer and to have my words affect people like Harry Potter affected me. it wasn’t the way I planned but I guess it happened anyway, after all this time. </3 R.I.P. Alan Rickman.
