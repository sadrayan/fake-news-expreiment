TRUMP SUPPORTS CASINO SUSPECT
" But Canadian police are today set to testify that they watched Leung work in illegal gambling dens in Toronto during the early 1980s with Eddie Louie, the brother of New York City's infamous Ghost Shadow gang leader Nicky Louie. And they've provided the commission with a 1985 surveillance photo of Leung posing at the opening of his Toronto travel agency with two notorious guests from New York, Clifford Wong and Herbert Liu. Wong was convicted of racketeering and murder last year in Brooklyn Federal Court as leader of the bloodthirsty Tung On gang. The FBI has identified Liu in congressional hearings as an organized crime leader in Manhattan's Chinatown. Leung was a vice president for foreign marketing at the Taj Mahal from April 1990 through April 1993 and had a separate contract with the casino to fly gamblers in from Toronto. According to evidence filed by the commission's Division of Gaming Enforcement, he flew in 16 Italian organized crime figures from Canada who stole more than $1 million from the casino in a credit scam. The incident was never reported because Trump never filed charges.
