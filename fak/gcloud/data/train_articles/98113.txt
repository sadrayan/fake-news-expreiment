Tell Stephen Harper to protect Canada’s lakes and rivers

Canada has one of the world’s largest supplies of fresh water.

But instead of preserving this resource for future generations, Stephen Harper’s Conservatives have stripped protection from most of Canada’s waterways.

From 2.5 million protected rivers and lakes, down to just 159 now.

We can do better. Add your name if you want to reverse these dangerous cuts to protections that keep our water safe and clean.
