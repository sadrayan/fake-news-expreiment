WHAT TO BRING: We are having a real tea party during lunch, so bring your lunch, a seat, a blanket; bring a cup of tea (or coffee, sshhh we won’t tell), a hat, an umbrella, your sense of fun and patriotism. Most importantly, bring a box of tea bags. We will provide you with Little Liberty Tea Wrappers printed with messages to President Obama that you can sign. We will then collect all of the tea bags and send them on to Washington D.C. Also, if you can bring a pen and maybe a stapler…that would help.
