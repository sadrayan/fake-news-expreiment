A Mysterious Tweet by Astronaut Buzz Aldrin
Well, computations suggest that Earth is in danger of a cosmic collision in our near future.

“Three independent analysis paths lead to the suggestion that Earth will be at least twice threatened with a major meteorite/comet impact between August 2015 until the end of 2017. The government/elite (or military) appears to be involved with the collection of related data.

A one sigma threat boundary can be derived by conventional projections from ice core data that formed about ten thousand years ago. The uncertainties are 1993 +/- 24 years. Thus, this ‘soft value’ expires at the end of 2017. There is also current information derived from extra-terrestrial alien warnings that support the 2017 threat boundary. Additional data indicates that a direct impact threat will be in the 6-9 and 23-26 September time frame for 2015 through 2017. The main stream of Tollmann’s bolides is anticipated to pass by Earth in September or October of 2016. However, an indirect threat from meteors/comets trapped in near Earth orbit will continue for several months thereafter.”

However, the real mathematical projections are based on Ice core data that is about 9938 years old. Thus, there is a degree of uncertainty in these calculations and they certainly are not precise. I will breath a sigh of relief when 2017 closes assuming no celestial impact occurs.
