Aerial View of PRI chimps' living space

There are three zones, each with different functions: the green cage (to the left of the photo), a silver cage (towards the rear of the photo), and an outdoor enclosure (to the right of the photo). Because all these zones are inter-connected, our PRI chimps are free to choose their "habitat" (cage/enclosure) and to be with several group members (or stay alone if they prefer), like chimpanzees in the wild. At over ten meters above the base of the green cage, we have set up four arrays of touch-screen stations so that our PRI chimps can drop by and do the cognitive tests and get tiny food rewards (e.g. an 8mm cube of apple, for each correct answer). Using the automated face recognition system, we can automatically run tasks of different levels/type for particular chimpanzees. We maintain and accumulate record-logs of all chimpanzees' tasks automatically; Thus, we can figure out the calories consumed according to the exact amount that each chimpanzee ate during their cognitive tasks.
