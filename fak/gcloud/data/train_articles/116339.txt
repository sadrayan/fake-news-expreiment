Soros slams Putin for 'heinous crimes against humanity' in Syria
Billionaire investor George Soros has vehemently condemned Russia's bombing campaign in Syria, accusing President Vladimir Putin of aggressively exploiting a power void in the White House ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential elections.



"The world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions. It is happening in Syria. It is being perpetrated by the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, in support of his protégé, (Syrian President) Bashar al-Assad," he said in a new statement on his website posted on Thursday morning.



"When the facts are fully established, Putin's bombing of Aleppo will be viewed as among the modern world's most egregious war crimes."
