About HLC – Healthcare Leadership Council
The Healthcare Leadership Council (HLC), a coalition of chief executives from all disciplines within American healthcare, is the exclusive forum for the nation’s healthcare leaders to jointly develop policies, plans, and programs to achieve their vision of a 21st century system that makes affordable, high-quality care accessible to all Americans.

Members of HLC – hospitals, health plans, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, biotech firms, health product distributors, pharmacies, post-acute care providers and academic health centers – envision a quality-driven system that fosters innovation. HLC members advocate measures to increase the cost-effectiveness of American healthcare by emphasizing wellness and prevention, care coordination, and the use of evidence-based medicine, while utilizing consumer choice and competition to elevate value.

Providing access to health coverage for the uninsured, accelerating the growth of health information technology, and reforming healthcare payment systems to incentivize quality and positive patient outcomes are important HLC priorities, along with improving patient safety, addressing the healthcare workforce shortage, enacting medical liability reforms and developing patient privacy rules that protect confidentiality while enabling the necessary flow of information to healthcare professionals and medical researchers.

HLC shares its vision for quality healthcare with Congress, the administration, the media, the research community, and the public through communications and educational programs. Because of the broad scope of the HLC membership, HLC is well known by congressional members and staff as an integral source for comprehensive information on key health issues. HLC staff briefings and events such as the HLC Innovations Expo are well attended by members of congress and staff alike.

And, in the belief that healthcare is essentially local, HLC builds coalitions at the community level to pursue its goals for America’s patients. Six regionally based directors conduct activities with members of Congress, organize health briefings and forums to educate local media and the public, and form local health advisory committees to advocate for innovative, high-quality, and affordable healthcare.
