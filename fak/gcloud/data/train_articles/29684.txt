Brennan Center for Justice
Michael F. Crowley is a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. Prior to joining the Brennan Center, Mr. Crowley has been a criminal justice consultant and a Senior Justice Policy Analyst at the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), where he has worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations.

During more than 20 years with OMB, Mr. Crowley was involved in key policy and resource decision-making affecting many federal criminal justice and drug control programs, and from 2003 to 2013 was responsible for policy, budget, and legislative oversight of over $3 billion in Department of Justice state and local grants, as well as research and statistics programs.

Beginning in 2012, Mr. Crowley led efforts in concert with the White House Domestic Policy Council to instigate reforms in criminal and juvenile justice practice through development of incentives and new forms of federal grant assistance. Collaborating with colleagues, he also spurred the development of a major Obama administration initiative to improve the climate in our nation’s schools through federal grants to improve positive behavioral supports; reduce suspensions, expulsions, and arrests; and improve interventions for mental health and substance abuse.

Mr. Crowley began his federal career on the economic staff of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, before moving to the U.S. Department of Treasury, and then OMB. He is a graduate of the University of the Pacific and LBJ School for Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.
