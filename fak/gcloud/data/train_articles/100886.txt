Mayor Lovett addresses viral Facebook post
Central Goldfields Shire mayor Geoff Lovett has publicly denounced an anti-Muslim Facebook post attributed to him which has been shared close to 13,000 times in recent months.

Making what he labelled an “unusual address” from the mayoral chair at Tuesday night’s council meeting, councillor Lovett addressed a Facebook post which stated that “the Mayor of Maryborough has refused to remove pork from school cafeteria menus” despite demands from a local muslim community.

“It has nothing to do with me,” Cr Lovett told the council meeting.
