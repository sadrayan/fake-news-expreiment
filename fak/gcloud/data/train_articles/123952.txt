Pamela Almoustine Magee Bradford's answer to Is the image of a tornado sucking up rainbow real? If so, how is this possible?
the above is nothing but a logical-but-not-quite-right theory. The original image is, in fact, Photoshopped! The “Tornado Versus Rainbow” image was created in November of 2012 by Corey Cowan. About the image, he says “Somebody … asked me for permission to use it on a book cover. I told them yes, as long I was given credit. It is a composite of three images—two rainbows and a tornado. The original tornado image is this, which I stretched a bit and masked."
