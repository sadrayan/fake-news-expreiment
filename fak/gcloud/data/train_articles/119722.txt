A man has been charged with a number of offence,s after allegedly kicking a Muslim woman in the stomach which resulted in her losing her unborn twins. David Gallacher, aged 37, of no fixed abode, is to appear in court charged with assault, racially / religiously aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer after a Somali woman who was wearing a headscarf was attacked outside a Co-op in Bletchley, Milton Keynes last August.

The 34-year-old woman, who did not know she was pregnant at the time, was approached by a man who directed racial remarks outside the supermarket while she was with her husband.
