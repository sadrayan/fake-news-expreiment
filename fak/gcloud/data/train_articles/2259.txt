Drop in illegal immigration tied to economy

A decrease in the number of undocumented immigrants residing in this country illegally coincides with the U.S. economic downturn, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

A DHS report estimates that the number of undocumented immigrants in this country in January 2009 at 10.8 million.

It is the second consecutive drop in the estimate since 2007, when DHS estimated the undocumented population at 11.8 million. Last year the estimate was 11.6 million.

The U.S. Census Bureau was the source for the estimates.

According to the report, the decline of 1 million undocumented immigrants since 2007 coincides with the U.S. economic downturn.

Undocumented immigrants from Mexico made up the largest share of the illegal population, at an estimated 6.6 million in 2009.

The largest population of undocumented immigrants resided in California, 2.6 million, followed by Texas, 1.7 million, and Florida, 720,000.
