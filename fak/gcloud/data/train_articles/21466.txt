Why Do We Need PACE?

Carbon

Reveal the diversity of phytoplankton found in our ocean on global scales;

Allow us to understand the role that phytoplankton diversity has on carbon cycling in the ocean; and

Help us predict the routes that carbon will take in todayâ€™s ocean and tomorrow's.

In many ways, the types of phytoplankton in our ocean dictate carbon pathways. Like falling leaves in autumn, larger phytoplankton species can sink from the ocean surface to the sea floor. This process can effectively remove carbon from contact with the atmosphere. Many types of phytoplankton serve as nourishing food sources for zooplankton, tiny animals that float in our ocean. Some of the carbon captured by zooplankton is returned to the atmosphere through respiration. Some carbon is exported to the deeper ocean when zooplankton migrate at night or when they excrete feces. Also, many zooplankton release dissolved carbon in partially eaten food. Marine bacteria, another type of plankton, use this dissolved carbon as an energy source. In doing so, they convert dissolved carbon back into its gaseous form.The examples above show that carbon pathways are many and diverse. Even small changes in the ocean ecosystem can push carbon towards another route. Detecting the diversity of plankton will help us understand how carbon moves between the ocean and atmosphere.Today's satellites reveal the quantity of phytoplankton at the ocean surface. Yet we cannot detect the diversity of species. For the first time, PACE's unprecedented technology will:
