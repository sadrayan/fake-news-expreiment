Comprehensive, quality healthcare services for Florida’s children

Covering kids ages 5 through 18 isn’t just what we’re known for, it’s what we’re passionate about. Our comprehensive, child-centered health and dental insurance has your school-aged child covered during each stage of growth and development.

Head to Toe Coverage. Designed specifically with kids in mind, our health insurance includes doctor visits, dental care, emergency care, hospital stays, immunizations, vision and hearing screenings, and much more.

Low Cost Premiums. Our coverage is available for as little as $15 or $20 a month. Families who do not qualify for subsidized coverage may purchase a competitively priced full-pay plan, making every Florida child ages 5 through 18 eligible.
