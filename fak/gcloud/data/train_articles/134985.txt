QAnon, also known as The Storm and The Great Awakening, is a conspiracy theory, popular meme,[5] and right wing fantasy about a "deep state" conspiracy against President Trump. Following on the heels of similar bullshit such as Pizzagate (which occupies a small spot on the QAnon map below), it advances a fantastic web of deceit that wraps up Trumpism, deep state fearmongering, evil, satanic pedophilia rings controlled by the Democratic Party, investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, the Las Vegas shooting, and New World Order paranoia into a package easily and wholeheartedly promoted by internet cesspools and Alex Jones.[6][3] It originated in a series of incoherent posts on 4chan in 2017 by someone calling themselves Q.[7] The name is likely based on the US government's top secret Q clearance.

Sure it's a fantasy, but Trump gets to be the hero.

The alleged plot [ edit ]

“ ” What is the "storm" the POTUS spoke about? it is the draining of the swamp, a giant global hurricane of veracity. —A somewhat more… lucid… description[8]

QAnon's central premise is that President Trump is secretly working to take down a global ring of elite, cannibalistic, satanic pedophiles.[9] They also believe that the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, is actually an investigation into the so-called "deep state", where a cabal of evil, money-grubbing globalists, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, are responsible for everything from a global pedophile ring to the mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.[3]

What makes the QAnon conspiracy an anomaly is the fact that it presents an alternate world in which the "good guys" are in control of the entire government; according to University of Miami professor Joseph Uscinski, in most other theories the shadowy conspiracy in control is malevolent.[10]

QAnon crazies also see hints in Trump's actions. According to the enlightened, when Trump awkwardly took a drink from a bottle of Fiji Water at a press conference in November 2017, it wasn't because he was thirsty; it was actually a secret signal to those in the know that the Storm of annihilation of deep state pedophiles had begun (or was about to begin). Because as everyone knows, Fiji is a hot spot for child trafficking.[11]

Q believers have a huge amount of baggage on the crazy train in the form of crank magnetism: special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is actually investigating high-level Democrats, the Illuminati, the Rothschild conspiracy, "Operation Mockingbird" (an alleged 20th century CIA infiltration of the media), fascism, the hidden meaning of Francis Ford Coppola films and Christian revivalism.[12] Oh, and J. P. Morgan had the Titanic sunk to take out his millionaire rivals,[13] and "John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his death and joined Trump's secret evil-fighting organization, where he writes 4chan posts under the pseudonym 'Q'."[14]

Postings by QAnon need lots of creative "analysis" — and the chans are happy to help.

A fictional personality (or to the faithful, an "anonymous patriot") central to "The Storm" theory, going by the name of "QAnon" ("Q" symbolizing a supposedly high level super secret government "Q Clearance"), began posting a series of messages on 4chan's /pol/ board in a thread called "CBTS" (Calm Before The Storm) on October 28, 2017.[5] In these, Q claimed that Trump was being protected by the military because the CIA, the FBI, and the Secret Service are all corrupt. Their postings take the form of cryptic questions, where each question is supposedly a hint, a clue, or a riddle containing some awesome revelation that would make treasure hunter Nicolas Cage smack his forehead and yell, "Of Course!" Yet the questions are usually the type of stuff found in grade-Z spy novels, and often contain their own obvious irony, such as this knee-slapper:

“ ” Has POTUS *ever* made a statement that has not become proven as true/fact? —"Q Clearance Patriot"[15]

Q's postings are known among aficionados as "breadcrumbs" because they're thought to be tidbits of information forming a trail that leads to… well, with a bit of imagination, you can make these random words and phrases lead anywhere.[10] And they're vague enough that they could apply to pretty much anything. Many sound like they were written by Deepak Chopra channeling Alex Jones. The phrase "down the rabbit hole" (a reference to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland ) is popular among believers who feel they are lucky participants in a great adventure where nothing is random and everything has meaning, and to "follow the white rabbit" is to be willingly led on a journey of ridiculous speculations regarding Q's postings.[15]

Like Batman, QAnon's identity is supposedly a deep, dark secret, and so the kookosphere swirls with speculation. Some name "NSA whistleblower" Thomas Drake, whose anti-Obama posture has gained him somewhat of a fanbase on the far-right.[16] Others say it's Steve Bannon. Or Trump himself. Or Donald Trump Jr. Or an artificial intelligence.[17]

Adding to the confusion, a number of "Q impostors" and fakes have appeared, as well as copycat Anons such as "MegaAnon" and "WH Anon", prompting the faithful to conclude it's all just part of a "deep state" plot to smear QAnon.[18][19]

In reality, however, the supposed deep cover agent QAnon is most likely a 4chan troll doing it for the shits and giggles. At the very least, Russian troll accounts were pushing the QAnon bullshit to idiots on Twitter before being purged.[20]

The term "The Storm" was apparently inspired by a non sequitur mumbled by Trump to the press during a routine photo-op with senior military leaders in October 2017.[21]

“ ” TRUMP: "You guys know what this represents? … Maybe it's the calm before the storm." TRUMP: "You guys know what this represents? … Maybe it's the calm before the storm." REPORTER: "What storm, Mr. President?" TRUMP: "You'll find out." TRUMP: "You'll find out." —Trump, to puzzled reporters.[22]

Because he was surrounded by high-ranking military officers at the time, believers have interpreted his bizarre remarks to mean he was recruited by military intelligence to lead a "quiet coup" to restore "integrity" to the US government; hence, he will impose martial law and unleash a "storm" of retribution against satanic Clintonites, Democratic evil-doers, Deep State dirtbags, and RINO cucks. And this coup will succeed, according to one believer, since "deep state corruption has a heavy Jewish influence" and "the military has a very low rate of Jewish people".[23]

So, while the shit was supposed to hit the fan in November 2017 with mass demonstrations and the suppression thereof, a military coup, the arrest of hundreds of public officials, and the fact that November came and went without any of these things happening does not appear to have had any effect on the theory's overzealous supporters. On the contrary, it appears it has made it even more popular.[24]

See the main article on this topic: Trump-Russia connection

QAnon sign at a Trump rally.

In March 2019, the Russia investigation officially ended, with Robert Mueller turning in his report to the Attorney General Barr.[25] There were no mentions of aliens, pedophile cults, false-flag attacks, cannibalism, or any of the other bullshit beliefs held by QAnon believers.[citation NOT needed] There's now been enough time to show that the QAnon conspiracy is still alive and well despite having one of its core tenets disproven:[26] Mueller is most certainly not using the Russia investigation as a secret means to destroy Hillary Clinton's supervillain organization. In fact, most QAnon believers hailed the release of the report as just another step taken towards Trump's endgame; the only part of it they seemed to take issue with is the idea that Trump said "I'm fucked", because they can't wrap their heads around the idea that Dear Leader could express weakness and doubt.[27]

Unfortunately, this is just how conspiracy theories work, and this one is no different. QAnon had wide overlap with the conspiracy theory that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg secretly died and had been replaced by a body double, but upon seeing the theory disproven, its believers doubled down anyways.[28] In other words, despite being unfathomably stupid, QAnon is going to live in the dark corners of the internet for a long, long time.

Evidence against is evidence for [ edit ]

See the main article on this topic: Falsifiability

A staple characteristic of conspiracy theories is that they be impossible to disprove. After all, what would be the fun in that? QAnon goes a step further. One of Q's posts explains his various false predictions and claims by saying "disinformation is necessary."[29] Of course it is. This explanation makes QAnon into a so-called "self-sealing" conspiracy; every time it's proven false, that's just the evil cabal making it seem that way! Stephan Lewandowsky, a professor at the University of Bristol who studies conspiracy theories, noted this self-sealing nature by saying:[30]

“ ” Conspiracy theories often serve an ironic function of providing a sense of order in Conspiracy theories often serve an ironic function of providing a sense of order in chaos . People would rather believe that there are evil masterminds out there that pull strings on cataclysmic events than accept the occurrence of random events.

This also helps explain the unfortunate longevity of QAnon. This is despite the fact that there are dozens of failed QAnon predictions, the most famous of which was that July 2018 would be "the month the world discovered the TRUTH."[31]

All aboard the crazy train! [ edit ]

Free the Clinton-Podesta Martian child sex slaves!

“ ” Mueller was hired to investigate Clinton, period. If my theory proves to be correct, this will go down as one of the most brilliant sting operations in history. —Liz Crokin[32]

Train conductors [ edit ]

Pizzagate promoters, such as Liz Crokin and David Seaman, have taken a very active interest in this brand new opportunity to spread batshit insanity, with Crokin claiming that Sean Hannity is privately "on board" with the conspiracy theory. Seaman, being an old Pizzagater, has plenty of experience weaving bullshit from out of thin air. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 2017, Q apparently posted a picture of George Washington crossing the Delaware river, and Seaman claimed that the painting showed Washington in the act of "starting the American Revolutionary War" (it doesn't, the war started in Boston more than a year before), and excitedly concluded, "so in other words, the second revolution is upon us and the deep state is being taken out now."[33]

Then, of course, there's leading birther and InfoWars esteemed crackpot Jerome Corsi, who was hard at work with the stable geniuses of 8chan in an effort to "decipher" Q's crumbs.[34][35] But none can hope to rival professional insanity dispenser Alex Jones, who has enthusiastically endorsed "The Storm" crackpottery,[36] especially the part about a global Clinton-led pedophilia ring, which happens to fit in nicely with his claims that child sex slaves have been kidnapped and shipped to Mars.[37] Or well, he did, until Qanon and the merchandise around it started cutting into his bottom line and sales of nutritional supplements. Now Jones claims that QAnon is a false flag meant to make conservatives look like a bunch of paranoid schizophrenics, as if they needed the help.[38]

Alt-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec has claimed on One America News Network that QAnon was created by two pro-Trump Twitter trolls who were inspired by the novel Q, written by four Italian authors under the pseudonym Luther Blissett. [39] He's claimed that the original two trolls left and the 8chan QAnon posts are now done by people who are in it for the money.[39]

Pundit Curt Schilling has promoted QAnon on his Breitbart podcast.[40]

Michael Salla, ufologist and promoter of the idea that extraterrestrials are involved Earthly politics (exopolitics), has promoted QAnon in at least three web articles.[41][42][43]

Because she didn't look dumb enough already, TV actress Roseanne Barr promoted QAnon on Twitter in 2017 and 2018 to her 0.9 million followers.[44]

Train passengers [ edit ]

A violent ride [ edit ]

Forrest Gordon Clark, suspected arsonist

In March 2018, the Reddit board for QAnon was shut down due to "encouraging or inciting violence and posting personal and confidential information", and its moderators were banned from the site.[55] In June 2018, Mathew P. Wright of Henderson, Nevada was arrested for allegedly blocking the bridge over the Hoover Dam with his home-made armored vehicle and guns; he held out a sign that was linked to QAnon.[56][57] In July 2018, Pennsylvanian Gardner Boyd was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill Trump and was reported to have made several references to QAnon.[58] In August 2018, Forrest Clark was arrested for allegedly igniting a forest fire in Orange County, California; Clark had previously posted about QAnon and other conspiracy theories.[59]

Meanwhile, a charity group in Arizona called Veterans on Patrol is now patrolling the state searching for child sex trafficking operations after having stumbled onto a homeless shelter and coming to the dumbest possible conclusion.[60] Later, in May of 2019, QAnon conspiracists insanely misinterpreted a tweet from James Comey and came to the conclusion that the former FBI director was planning to launch a terrorist attack against a charter school; the school canceled a charity event out of fear that "internet vigilantes" would show up to cause trouble.[61] One of the school's event coordinators later said, "We knew the theory itself was not targeting our event and in fact, it appeared that the QAnon [followers] somehow thought they were keeping us safe. But there was concern that the call-outs to the Anon communities to 'protect the children' could entice these people to show up to our event… there was no win for the festival under these circumstances."[62]

In the Trump administration [ edit ]

Trump and his greatest fans.

Trump occasionally likes to throw his most insane group of supporters a bone. At one of his rallies, he gestured approvingly towards a man with a "Q" shirt, and this happened because someone on Trump's team thought it appropriate to give the conspiracist a front-row VIP pass.[63] Trump also likes to retweet posts from QAnon accounts, which, while not directly related to the conspiracy, easily lead interested followers back to it. Most recently, he retweeted a post about Jeanine Pirro from an account that had "Q" as its goddamn profile picture.[64]

Trump's pastry chef at his Florida retreat is very vocal on Instagram, and revealed that she sought her current job so that she could serve Trump while he takes down the alleged Democratic pedophile conspiracy.[65] Her posts also suggest that she has interacted with the president's security detail on a regular basis and shows that she enjoys baking QAnon-themed pastries for Mar-a-Lago guests.[65]

Going viral [ edit ]

read? These people can

All of the dubious claims of this conspiracy theory have been easily debunked, discredited, and immediately recognized as complete and total fabrications, slander, and lies. Despite this, legions of rabid, far-right-wing extremists and conspiracists have embraced and promoted the theory in an increasingly crowded field of loonies inhabiting the cesspools of social media and YouTube.[34] A detailed analysis of the whole fetid affair is documented in a boringly exhaustive copypasta.[4][66]

In April 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented how the conspiracy theory has strangely become a hit with the sovereign citizen movement, in a stunning example of crank magnetism in action.[67] What makes this strange is that QAnon's base premise is that the government and law ultimately work. However, sovereign citizens and other antigovernment extremists believe that they know the "true" law, which has been betrayed by the normal institutions of government, and that the military and Trump will help them save this mythological "true" law.[67]

QAnon has become an all-encompassing conspiracy theory. For instance, in late May of 2019 police in small town California arrested a crazy lady for building homemade pipe bombs, and QAnon thinks that she was connected to a secret plot by James Comey to blow up a school.[68] This demonstrates that just about anything can be linked to QAnon if one happens to be creative enough.

As a show of just how far this insanity has gone, a QAnon book called QAnon: An Invitation to the Great Awakening was written by a number of anonymous authors and reached number goddamn 2 on Amazon's algorithmically generated “hot new releases” and best-sellers lists.[69][70] Among the book's highlights: claims that Democrats eat children, claims that Hillary Clinton runs a global Satanic cabal, and claims that the government created AIDS and Lyme disease.[71] Needless to say, it's a hot mess.

Greatest crossover event in conspiracy history [ edit ]

THE TITANIC WAS AN INSIDE JOB.

“ ” I don’t like to talk about that stuff [Satanism] because it gives those anti-Q people way too much fuel for the fire. —In Pursuit of Truth, a QAnon "analysis" YouTube channel.[72][73]

There are some truly glorious examples of QAnon stupidity. Whoever "Q" is, they've managed to pull elements from just about every conspiracy theory under the sun. Here are some highlights.

RMS Titanic [ edit ]

QAnon followers think J.P. Morgan sunk the Titanic so he could form the Federal Reserve.[74] Oh yeah, we're starting you off in deep end, folks. The story goes that many wealthy businessmen were on the Titanic, all of whom opposed the Federal Reserve, and J.P. Morgan intentionally built the Titanic without safety measures in order to get them all killed.[75] There's also a version of the story that says the men were opponents of the income tax.[76]

Trump's secret war [ edit ]

Just about every aspect of the Trump-Russia thing with Trump and Russia Mueller investigation has been shoehorned by QAnon believers into their narrative about a secret war being fought between Trump and the "deep state". They think that Trump was recruited by military intelligence to fight the deep state, because apparently we trust the military but not the rest of the government.[41] Key events highlighted by the QAnoners include the raid on Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen (the cabal becomes more aggressive), and Trump's missile strike on Syria (Trump wanted to accommodate the cabal's wishes for some fucking reason).[42]

Deep state puppet masters [ edit ]

QAnon has also gone with the mandatory George Soros conspiracy theories, but his post "exposing" the leaders of the deep state dusted off some oldies but goodies. Specifically, the Rothschilds, whom QAnon followers believe funded the British Empire's victory over Napoleon Bonaparte.[42] This idea makes zero sense in the context of the conspiracy theory itself because the Rothschilds are allegedly a family of German Jews,[77] a sociopolitical class who fucking loved Napoleon for his role in civically emancipating them.[78][79][80] Of course, our expectations concerning QAnon's historical literacy should be pretty low, all things considered, who who's surprised?

Strangest of all, Q also fingers the House of Saud as being backers of the deep state,[42] which doesn't really mesh with the fact that they seem to be among Trump's closest friends on the global stage.[81] Apparently, selling weapons to the deep state against the wishes of Congress is the path to defeating the deep state.[82] Who knew?

Finally, what QAnon sub-conspiracy would be complete without that old classic, Satanism? Q thinks the Rothschilds are the head of a global Satanic cult which includes the Soros family, the Clinton family, and the Sauds.[43] The three main dynasties, Soros, Saud, and Rothschild, form the so-called "Triangle" because why fucking not bring the Illuminati into this bullshit too?[83]

CIA psyops and fake news [ edit ]

Q exposes the deep state puppeteers.

A central feature of Trumpism and QAnon is the concept of fake news. Q has taken it a step further with the concept of "Operation Mockingbird" According to Q, the Central Intelligence Agency (check one off the list) is manipulating the media and has been since the JFK assassination (check).[84] QAnon followers call these CIA operatives "Black Hats", and claim that Black Hats spend their days digging around through classified data with the intent of fabricating fake news stories to pass on to the mainstream media.[85] Apparently, the "Black Hats" are paid with CIA black budget money and foreign accounts; Q specifically mentions the Panama Papers (check) as an example of how this works.[85]

Other assorted insanity [ edit ]

Of course, the globalist cabal doesn't stop with just Soros, the Sauds, and the Clintons! No, it goes much deeper than that.

QAnon map dissection [ edit ]

See the main article on this topic: QAnon map dissection

As the map shows, QAnon functions as a grand unified conspiracy theory because it lumps in just about every imaginable conspiracy theory (together with some historical reference points and almost no context). There are a number of conspiracy theories that are based on bigotry: antisemitism (e.g. concerning George Soros),[92] Anti-Catholicism (e.g., concerning Jesuits), anti-African American (concerning the Obamas), and anti-Masonic, and these are baked into the map. In that sense, QAnon can be used both as a mirror for one's own bigotry and as a powerful crank magnet that can attract all sorts of gunk from this "rabbit hole".

Real world "Q" clearance [ edit ]

In the Department of Energy, this is a real thing. As a DOE clearance, it presumably relates to nuclear secrets of the United States. It obviously makes sense that this publicly known and extremely important clearance level would be primarily used to hide everyone's secret pedophilia.[note 4]
