The divorce decree is attached. See page 3.

Terry Gardner, who represented Wendy Davis during the divorce said the following

“Sen. Davis always maintained joint custody of her teenage daughter during and after her divorce from Mr. Davis. Both parties were appointed parent joint managing conservators by the Court, and shared the responsibilities of parenting their child.”

Rebecca:

I am attaching a document noticed in Tarrant County records by the American-Statesman’s Jonathan Tilove. It identifies Jeffrey Davis as the “custodial” parent and Wendy Davis as the “non-custodial” parent. He noticed a similar document dated Dec. 2, 2005.

Rebecca:

My inquiry (above) stands. But we noticed too that in a 2013 interview, Davis described herself as the noncustodial parent.

The Texas Tribune said in a Sept. 1, 2013, news story that when Jeff Davis filed for divorce, Wendy Davis moved to an apartment. The story continued: “The (family) house, which was in her husband's name, is where Amber and Dru grew up, and that is where they wanted to stay, their mother recalled.

“The divorce decree in 2005 gave Mr. Davis primary custody of Dru, who was then 17, and” Wendy “Davis agreed to pay $1,200 a month in child support, records show,” the Tribune said.

Davis told the Tribune it was the right thing to do. ''My girls wanted to stay in their family home,'' she said, according to its story. ''I did feel like as the noncustodial parent that that was my obligation.''

The terms custodial and noncustodial here are administrative designations. The divorce decree clearly states that Wendy and Jeff Davis be awarded joint managing conservatorship. The divorce decree is the controlling document.
