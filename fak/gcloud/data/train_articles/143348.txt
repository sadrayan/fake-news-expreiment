The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance: Laurie Garrett: 9780140250916: Amazon.com: Books
When I started this book years ago in the dead tree edition (and did not finish, due to its heft), I was stunned and overwhelmed by the stories which Garrett told about epidemiologists out in the field. The diseases were incredibly scary, and so the risks that these scientists exposed themselves to in order to save a small village, a hamlet, potentially a nation or continent... We're talking about people who want to better the world, and are willing to put their lives on the line to do so. I think my reading was before 9-11, when US society refocused its definition of hero onto first responders, SEALS, Ground Zero workers etc. But the heroism of these epidemiologists still needs to be noted: when you're out in the field and catch some incredibly contagious disease, they don't send you an airplane ticket to get home: they send a lunar landing module with airtight locks, put you and your module on a military transport, and get you to some place with sufficient sophistication to get you well and then home. Not only are you at risk of dying... But you have an invaluable skill set and can't be easily replaced.



These kinds of stories are in Garrett's book. But there are also others which will make you slap your head in astonishment. Like the CDC scientist who goes to County Cork to see if the retired nuns might have traces of a virus from the Ivory Coast when they were missionaries in the 1940's. And then CATCHES that virus after kissing the Blarney Stone right after one of the nuns.



The book is astonishing, wonderful, thought provoking. And now that it's on Kindle I can finish it, no longer burdened by its heft. Really looking forward to it.
