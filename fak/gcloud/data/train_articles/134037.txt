Angola bans Islam
Angola has banned the Muslim faith, according to news reports.

eNCA reports that some mosques have been closed down and others will be destroyed.

News reports say the government hopes to curb sectarianism in the country and eradicate religions that contradict the customs of Angolan culture.

Minister of Culture, Rosa Cruz e Silva is reported as saying the law on freedom of religion will be reviewed.

"The government will redouble its efforts to fight relentlessly against religious cults like Islam which are contrary to the customs of Angolan culture."

There are only around 90,000 Muslims in the country of 16-million people, who are predominately Catholic.

The spate of demolitions started in October when Muslims residing in Luanda woke up to a demolished mosque without prior notice or permission
