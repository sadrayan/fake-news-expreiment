[Editor's Note: State-level data on the percentage of adults living in households with firearms (gun prevalence) were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The world's largest telephone survey with more than 200,000 adult respondents annually, the BRFSS is an ongoing data collection programme sponsored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with all 50 states participating. As at January 2014, responses to BRFSS questions on the household prevalence of firearms were only available for 2001, 2002 and 2004. See: Miller, Barber et al, 20131].
