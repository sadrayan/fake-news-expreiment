Measles Parties? Some Parents Want to Infect Kids to Build Immunity
The measles outbreak is continuing to spread in the United States with over 110 cases present in at least 16 states.

Some parents who refuse to get their kids vaccinated have come up with another plan: hosting measles parties.

This morning on "Fox and Friends," Elisabeth Hasselbeck said that parents are bringing their kids who haven't been vaccinated around those who are infected in order to "build up their immunity."

Dr. Philippa Cheetham explained that the idea of measles parties came from chicken pox parties that began in the 1980s. She said that parents at that time wanted "to mix children who had chicken pox, with children who did not have chicken pox to try and increase exposure as a way of building up natural immunity."

"Unfortunately, we are seeing a resurgence of this with measles, because parents are very concerned with the risks of vaccination," Cheetham noted. "Particularly this link with autism, which is being completely discredited. We must emphasize that vaccination is safe and effective."
