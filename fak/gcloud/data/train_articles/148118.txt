Affordable South African Domestic Flights
WELCOME

Mango gives you the choice and flexibility to pay for your Mango flights including taxes and extras using your SAA Voyager miles. If you donâ€™t have enough SAA Voyager miles to cover the cost of your fare, not to worry, you can pay the difference with any of our forms of payment such as: credit card, cash, Nedbank Greenbacks, Edgars account card

A few important rules and regulations:

SAA Voyager members can now redeem SAA Voyager miles with Mango, but are not yet able to earn SAA Voyager miles with Mango.

A minimum of 5,000 SAA Voyager miles is needed to book a Mango flight. In addition, Mango redeems SAA Voyager miles in denominations of 500, your miles will therefore be rounded to the nearest 500 denomination.

As Voyager only works in denominations of 500, you might note some differences between availability and the booking total. To save your miles we recalculate your miles at booking total

No other SAA Voyager benefits, such as additional baggage, upgrades or lounge access are applicable when using SAA Voyager miles to pay for a Mango flight.

Standard SAA Voyager and Mango terms and conditions apply.

Online payments only.
