(b) If overriding royalties and payments out of production or similar interests in excess of 5 percent of gross production constitute a burden to lease operations that will retard, or impair, or cause premature abandonment, the lease application shall be suspended until overriding royalties and payments out of production or similar interests are reduced to not more then 5 percent of the value of the production. If the holders of outstanding overriding royalty or other interests payable out of production, the operator and the lessee are unable to enter into a mutually fair and equitable agreement, any of the parties may apply for a hearing at which all interested parties may be heard and written statements presented.

Upon failure to submit such proof within the time so fixed, the application for renewal shall be denied.
