How federal poverty levels are used to determine eligibility for reduced-cost health coverage

Income between 100% and 400% FPL: If your income is in this range, in all states you qualify for premium tax credits that lower your monthly premium for a Marketplace health insurance plan.

If your income is in this range, in all states you qualify for premium tax credits that lower your monthly premium for a Marketplace health insurance plan. Income below 138% FPL: If your income is below 138% FPL and your state has expanded Medicaid coverage, you qualify for Medicaid based only on your income.

If your income is below 138% FPL and your state has expanded Medicaid coverage, you qualify for Medicaid based only on your income. Income below 100% FPL: If your income falls below 100% FPL, you probably wonâ€™t qualify for savings on a Marketplace health insurance plan or for income-based Medicaid.

"Income" above refers to "modified adjusted gross income" (MAGI). For most people, it's the same or very similar to "adjusted gross income" (AGI). MAGI isn't a number on your tax return.
