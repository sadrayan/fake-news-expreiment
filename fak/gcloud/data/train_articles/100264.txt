Unbelieva-bubble penguin enrichment at RZSS Edinburgh Zoo
RZSS Edinburgh Zoo’s penguin colony had great fun celebrating Penguin Awareness Day on 20 January with their new bubble machine.

The group enjoyed chasing and popping bubbles made by the machine, which they received as a Christmas gift.

Lorna Moffat, penguin keeper at RZSS Edinburgh Zoo said:

“The bubble machine was generously gifted through the Amazon wishlist set up for our animals. Our colony of over 130 birds enjoy lots of different types of enrichment, from their water slide to their floating platforms, but the bubble machine is always a firm favourite so getting a new one is fantastic.

“All three of our penguin species loved playing with the bubbles, especially our youngest rockhopper chick who was taking part for the first time.”

RZSS Edinburgh Zoo is home to the largest outdoor penguin pool in Europe. Penguins have been an integral part of the Zoo since it opened in 1913 and RZSS now play an important part in their conservation around the globe. Project Pinnamin, a collaboration between RZSS, the British Antarctic Survey, RSPB, Tristan Conservation and the Government of South Africa, is spearheading research to help improve the very limited understanding of the northern rockhopper and the factors affecting its population numbers on Tristan da Cunha, in the South Atlantic Ocean. This research will inform conservation measures to help secure the future for this endangered species.
