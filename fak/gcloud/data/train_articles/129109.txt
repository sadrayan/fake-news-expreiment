German Spiegel Magazine Declares George H.W. Bush Dead
Berlin

The German magazine Der Spiegel’s online edition today posted an obituary for George H.W. Bush. It was titled “The Better Bush.” Here is a screenshot of the obituary headline and text:

In fact, George H.W. Bush is still alive.

The premature death notice was scrubbed without an explanation as to why the magazine’s New York correspondent Marc Pitzke got the story completely wrong. Here is the website announcing that Pitzke’s article can no long be found.

Pitzke and Spiegel used the false death notice to explain why Bush senior “was” a better Bush than his son, George W.

Der Spiegel has a peculiar obsession with America and the alleged decline of America. One of its recent cover stories announced, “The American Patient: the downfall of a great nation,” with a picture of a hospitalized Uncle Sam.
