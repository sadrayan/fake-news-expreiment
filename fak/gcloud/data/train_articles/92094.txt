An amendment to the House budget bill that would have cut financing for cancer research by a third was scuttled on Sunday evening.

House leaders lined up to speak against the amendment offered by state Rep. Rob Orr, R-Burleson, and effectively killed it with a vote of 125-16.

Orr’s original amendment would have completely done away with the $300 million in bond financing for the cancer research, part of a $3 billion package authorized by voters. Lance Armstrong, who was a catalyst for the cancer bonds, urged his Twitter followers last week to help stop the Orr amendment.

On Sunday, Orr changed his amendment by limiting the bond issuance to $100 million, saying that these tough budget conditions warranted the change.

“It has never been that this is not a great program,” Orr said.

Appropriations Chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, spoke against the measure and pointed out that the bonds come at no cost to the budget.
