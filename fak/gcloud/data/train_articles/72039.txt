In response to Paula Deen Is Done: Food Network Will Not Renew Her Contract :

In case you were wondering about her party affiliation.

I wasn't! Sheesh...who cares, right?

You can blame Emily Zanotti of Naked DC for unearthing this completely trivial, insignificant (really, who cares y'all!) factoid from US Weekly's Celebrity Political Affiliations:

Paula Deen (Democrat) The Food Network star campaigned for Obama back in 2008, and invited his wife Michelle to cook with her during an episode of Paula's Party. Later, she said she "just loved" being around the First Lady, and praised her platform: encouraging kids and young adults to eat healthy and get plenty of exercise.

Deen reportedly told a the Washington Examiner that Michelle packed away the food when the cameras stopped rolling, which left the White House incensed. Deen even recently told the Washington Examiner, “[Michelle Obama] probably ate more than any other guest I ever had on the show! She kept eating even during commercials. Know what [the Obamas’] favorite foods are? Hot wings.” She paints a picture of Obama that’s a far cry from the first lady who was photographed holding a worm she pulled from a vegetable garden yesterday. According to the Enquirer, Obama now regrets going on Deen’s show. “Michelle’s spitting mad,” a source told the paper. “She thinks Paula is trying to smear her and her family just as the 2012 presidential election race swings into gear.”

Em notes that Deen may have soured on the Obamas or visa versa after having Michelle on her show just over a year ago to talk about their competing cookbooks.Oh, yeah...I kinda remember laughing at that story.
