Elton John’s Wedding
Comment: I'm glad to see that sensible England has passed the Civil Partnership Act and hope the US follows along. My students have been writing papers about civil unions, beginning as anti and ending up as pro. They say, upon research, that the civil rights of gays are being denied by the US not allowing civil union. I concur. I was glad to see someone of Elton John's stature make a public statement to the world on civil unions. I hope the US is listening. Good luck, Elton and David. Be happy. Be blessed. Mrs. B

Comment: Being a Canadian where Same-sex marriage is legal now. It's nice to see Mr.Trump's viewpoint of the matter

Response:

Comment: It's only fair that everyone gets to make their own personal choices and have the same rights as others in doing so. Unfortunately I don't know Elton yet but I do hope his Civil Partnership works out even better than his previous situation and wish them luck. The first day was always going to have the media spotlight on the high profile partnerships and I would guess they knew this so it seems they were wise to keep it as low key as possible. Perhaps these civil partnerships will also help with the overall acceptance of freedom of personal choices and equality since, it has made me think more about why I am challenged to understand and accept that whilst we are all the same, we don't and won't all make the same natural personal choices. But, being straight, what would I know about it anyway, it sure would be a dull place here if we all accepted, understood and agreed on everything. Perhaps now the media will give it a rest about Gay Rights etc. as well, and spend more attention on the rights of the starving and less fortunate etc. Regards Charlie Founder/Chairman http://www.netaid.co.uk

Comment: I'm happy to see that Mr. Trump is respectful and tolerant enough to wish Elton John and his partner well. It would be a refreshing change if most Americans understood Trumps comment, "if two peoplee dig each other, they dig each other."

Response:

Comment: Modesty demands that what happens between two people, especially emotionally, is private and should not be made public. Messrs. John and Furnish should be commended for their modesty regarding their wedding. If Mr. Trump does in fact know the couple personally, he should send them a wedding gift, but not be so immodest as to publicize the gesture.

Comment: It's sad to hear all of you commending this so called marriage. It's more sad to include it in the civil rights.

Comment: Everything is changing here on planet earth quite rapidly - including the cost of most things especially information - and Digital Estate Property - I suggest that the programs offered hear be reduced greatly towards free so that more and more people can take advantage of whatever information here that they can - If this is not done voluntarily either someone will come and offer the information for less money or soon it will be given way for free somewhere else - In addition I believe that we are seeing a great transformation as to the rules of real estate values because of these changes and it might serve us well to carefully weigh the intelligence of being aware of new trends to come in the real estate world - Not one of the students here (apparently in the thousands) has contacts me to discuss the book I had mentioned elsewhere entitled - “New Rules for the New Economy” by Kevin Kelly - I look forward to at least one fellow student here to stepping forward and choosing to look towards the future and the potential changes that will definitely be facing us in a few years to come - It looks very good for the developers - not just individuals purchasing already built real estate - thank you!

Comment: As several people have mentioned, we have legal same sex marriage here in Canada and nothing has collapsed. I'm happy to hear that David and Elton had their union, and that in Britain at least the only controversy seems to be what to call the same-sex spouse of a Knight (traditionally Sir Elton John's spouse would be Lady John, but clearly in this case it does not fit). As for a gift, since they both have established households, you might be better off to send a cash gift in their name to a charity they both support.

Comment: Mr. Trump - If you are what your public image suggests, I present you with this humble challenge - can you return used sandpaper to your local hardware store? If you can pull this off, you're the man. - Rebel Leady Boy

Response:

Comment: I hope Elton had a Prenuptial Agreement as you suggested. I wish both of them well.

Response:

Comment: Dear Donald Trump, Well! I appreciate the fact that they denied the press but all the same...I believe someday they will have course to share testimonies about thier marriage and what it involves. Though alot of people may have sent them toasters but I still think snice you were not invited, I would still suggest that you make your own toaster very very very motivative and business wise. Remember you are the guru. Take it easy on them Trump.

Response:

Comment: I wish them the best. I am so happy to see that Donald cares he suprises me everyday.

Response:

Comment: As you have pointed out, Civil Partnership in the UK works and that is what we should do in the US instead of gay marriage. Note: A toaster may be a little old fashioned. How about a teletubby?

Response:

Comment: Send them a toaster, Mr. Trump! :) Greetings from Ukraine!

Response:

Comment: Celebrating love abd the persoanl committment between two people in all it's forms- all it's diversity and all it's glory is a great thing to celebrate this holiday season. My Mom always told me that the marriages that will last are the ones that start off as marriages between two best friends. Wisdom for the ages, in my opinion. If they are friends, send them something they really will enjoy.
