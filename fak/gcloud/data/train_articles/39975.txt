Emma Stone Wore a Planned Parenthood Pin to the 2017 Academy Awards
It's a big night for Emma Stone: The actress is favored to win the 2017 Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Mia in La La Land , which is up for a whopping (and potentially record-breaking) 14 awards.

Never one to disappoint, Stone dressed for success in a 1920s flapper-inspired Givenchy gown, accentuating her look with a statement red lip and soft waves. If you take a closer look, Stone's Oscars look meant much more than just a lesson in red carpet slayage: Her ensemble carried a quiet political-slash-feminist statement, as well. On her left shoulder, right beneath the strap of her gown, Stone wore a gold Planned Parenthood pin.

It's easy to miss the pin at first glance, as it nearly blended in with her shimmery gown, but once you catch a glimpse of the reproductive-rights organization's logo on the outfit, it becomes nearly impossible to ignore. And Stone wasn't the only celeb to step out on the Oscars red carpet with the pin as an accessory: Dakota Johnson sported the same Planned Parenthood pin on her Gucci clutch for the evening.

The displays of support for Planned Parenthood come at a critical time. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to defund the organization , which provides reproductive healthcare, education, and resources for millions of patients. The Planned Parenthood pins were not the only accessories-turned-political statements seen at the Academy Awards: Ruth Negga, Karlie Kloss, Busy Philipps, and Lin Manuel Miranda all wore blue ribbons in support of the American Civil Liberties Union.
