National Debt Was $19,947,304,555,212.49 Seven Months Ago… Here’s What It Is Today
President Donald Trump and his administration are undoing the government’s rampant spending that occurred under former President Obama’s watch.

According the U.S. Treasury’s direct record , a surprising amount of money has been saved over the course of seven months.

On January 20th, the day Trump was inaugurated, the total debt was $19,947,304,555,212.49.

On July 30th, seven short months later, it’s at $19,844,938,940,351.37.

Overall the debt has decreased by $102,365,614,861.12.

Here’s what the Trump budget plan said, proposed back in April:

“Under this plan, the debt will continue to fall both in nominal dollars and as a share of GDP beyond that point, putting us on a path to repay the debt in full within a few decades,” the budget plan said.

Then, in his State of the Union address, he made this comment to Congress:

“Faster economic growth, coupled with fiscal restraint, will enable us to fully fund our national priorities, balance our budget, and start to pay down our national debt.”

In the end, it certainly looks like he’s keeping his promises regarding fiscal responsibility by the United States government.
