Union of North America (UNA) Amero Pattern Coins.



NOTE:

I have received numerous inquiries as to my personal stand on the North American Union (NAU) issue. My goal with these coins is not to endorse a Union of North America or a common "Amero" currency. I fully support the United States Constitution, and I would not welcome (in any form) a diminishment of its provisions. I expect that these coins will help make more people aware of the issue and the possible ramifications. I leave it up to others to decide if they are in favor of, or against a North American Union. And I encourage citizens to voice their approval or disapproval of government plans that impact them.

A currency union, similar to the European Union "Euro" has been proposed for North America (it is sometimes called the "North American Union", or "NAU"). The name of the new currency is the "Amero". The Wikipedia encyclopedia article has additional details about the "Amero". This has been the source for many conspiracy theories tied in with other proposals such as the "Canamex Corridor".

These private-issue fantasy pattern coins will be struck as an annual series, starting in the latter part of 2007.

Collectors can order them at www.dc-coin.com .

The 2007 designs feature various Seated Liberty obverses and a similar Eagle & Globe reverse. 2008 designs show a Winged Liberty Head obverse and a re-arranged Eagle & Globe reverse. 2009 Issues show a Riding Liberty, with or without wings on the horse.
