Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance
Antibiotics are powerful drugs, but they are not the cure for all that ails you. Antibiotics, also known as antimicrobial drugs, are drugs that fight infections caused by bacteria. They are not effective against viral infections like the common cold, most sore throats, and the flu.

Antibiotic resistance has been called one of the world's most pressing public health problems. The smart use of antibiotics is the key to controlling the spread of resistance.
