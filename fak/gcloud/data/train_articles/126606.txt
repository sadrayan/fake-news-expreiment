FACT CHECK: Snowden Pronounced Dead by His Girlfriend in Russia
On 10 August 2016, the unreliable web site Disclose.tv published an article reporting that former National Security Agency (NSA) employee and whistleblower Edward Snowden was “pronounced dead by his girlfriend” in Russia:

While it was true the disappearing tweet was interpreted by many as an ominous signal, an insurance key, or a dead man’s switch, journalist Glenn Greenwald (who works closely with Snowden to publish leaked material) quickly confirmed that Snowden is alive and well:

Disclose.tv and Get Off the BS are sites known for publishing outlandish fabrications and fake news in order to attract readers. On 15 August 2016 Snowden reappeared on Twitter, putting concerns for his safety to rest:
