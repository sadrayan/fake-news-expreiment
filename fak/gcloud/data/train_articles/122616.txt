Daily News photographers snap up Newswomen awards
Daily News photographers took home two Front Page Awards this year from the Newswomen’s Club of New York.

Julia Xanthos won for best front page photo with her shot “NYPD & Desnudas” — which showed a uniformed cop posing between two of the topless, painted women who strut their stuff for tips in Times Square, while a second officer snapped a picture with a cellphone.

After the photo graced the Daily News front page with the headline “Tit for Brains,” the NYPD ordered cops not to take photos with topless women and the two officers were transferred to other precincts.

Stephanie Keith won the club’s breaking news award for her photo of a Brooklyn protest over the grand jury’s not to make an indictment in the case of Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a banned police chokehold last year on Staten Island.

The photo shows a young white woman at the demonstration near the Barclays Center screaming in an officer’s face, her open mouth inches from the cop’s chin.

The Front Page Awards, which date back to 1938, will be presented in November at a black-tie gala.
