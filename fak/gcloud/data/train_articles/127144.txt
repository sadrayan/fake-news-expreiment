Joe's Crab Shack in Roseville among many in U.S. now closed
Joe’s Crab Shack in Roseville has closed as the Houston-based parent restaurant company works its way through bankruptcy.

Many other locations around the country have also closed, according to the national Consumerist watchdog website.

Until this month, the Roseville dining spot had been operating at the northeast corner of Snelling Avenue and County Road C.

There are no other Joe’s Crab Shack restaurants in Minnesota, with the closest in West Des Moines, Iowa.

Under parent Ignite Restaurant Group, Joe’s and its sister chain, Brick House Tavern, are awaiting new ownership once a leadership shift wins bankruptcy court approval later this week.

Nation’s Restaurant News is reporting that the leading option for new ownership is Landry’s, which won an auction for Ignite’s assets last week. Both are based in Houston.

Landry’s brands include Rainforest Cafe, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., McCormick and Schmick’s and Morton’s.
