Of the 10 hospitals on your list, eight are closed. Central Texas Hospital in Cameron had a change of ownership effective 10/8/13. It is now Little River Healthcare – Cameron Hospital. Cozby-Germany Hospital in Grand Saline had a change of ownership effective 7/1/14. It is now Texas General Hospital – Van Zandt Regional Medical Center LP.

You can find our current roster of hospitals at Directory of General & Special Hospitals - Excel file (XLS, 419KB)

Column E shows the date they were initially licensed, if you want to look at hospitals that have recently opened or changed ownership.

We don’t license clinics and don’t have information on them.

Subject: Fresh inquiry for a fact check due Wednesday

Carrie:

Good evening.

I have been trying to check a claim about 10 rural hospitals closing in the past 24 months, ending up with this list:

? Central Texas Hospital in Cameron, which later reopened as Little River Healthcare (its website says it’s Cameron Hospital).

? Renaissance Hospital in Terrell (February 2013)

? Shelby Regional Medical Center in Center (July 2013)

? Cozby-Germany Hospital in Grand Saline (August 2013)

? Lake Whitney Medical Center in Whitney (April 2014)

? Good Shepherd Medical Center in Linden (April 2014)

? Cleveland Regional in Cleveland (August 2014)

? East Texas Medical Center in Gilmer (December 2014)

? East Texas Medical Center in Mount Vernon (December 2014)

? East Texas Medical Center in Clarksville (December 2014).

I am interested in whether the agency has comparable information and if any rural hospitals or clinics opened in the same period. If so, do you have a count and specifics?

Thanks, again.
