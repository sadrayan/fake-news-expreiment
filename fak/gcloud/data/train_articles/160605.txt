Alicia was first name-checked by the Democratic Party nominee during this week's Presidential debate.

Hillary used the beauty's past links with Donald Trump to label her Presidential rival sexist and racist.

Earlier this week we told how Trump was accused of calling Alicia ‘Miss Piggy’ after she piled on weight after winning the Miss Universe crown.

The Associated Press (AP) then reported she was once ordered to testify in court over some very serious allegations.

Machado’s then boyfriend, Juan Rodriguez Reggeti, was accused of shooting his brother-in-law Francisco Sbert Moukso at his wife’s funeral- who was the accused man’s sister.

It was claimed Reggeti believed Sbert had driven his sister to suicide and he took revenge, the Associated Press said.

Rodriguez was eight months pregnant when she jumped to her death off a fifth-floor balcony.

It’s alleged that witnesses saw the beauty queen drive her boyfriend away from the scene of the crime, and that her boyfriend had snatched his dead sister’s 11-month-old son as well.

When asked about her past yesterday, Machado told a US TV journalist: "“You know, I have my past. Of course, everybody has a past.

"I’m not a saint girl. But that is not the point now.”
