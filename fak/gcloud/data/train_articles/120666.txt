Reduding teenage pregnancy can halve the number of mothers who die while giving birth
01 January 2019

KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo believes more open dialogue about the dangers of unprotected sex and teenage pregnancy could reduce by up to half the number of mothers who die while giving birth, or shortly afterwards.

"Significantly, teenage pregnancy accounts for about 8 -10% of all deliveries in the country, which is about a million deliveries per year. But close to 45% of maternal deaths in the country come from this small 10% (of teenaged mothers), because these young people generally delay coming to our clinics. They hide the pregnancy. And by the time they come to deliver, there are certain complications that cannot be reversed. Therefore, if we were to reduce or eradicate teenage pregnancy, we would significantly improve the maternal health outcomes of the province."

The MEC was speaking at GJ Crookes Hospital in Scottburgh, where he also announced that by 08h00, KwaZulu-Natal had had 36 babies (17 boys and 19 girls) born on New Year’s Day.

Thirty year-old Bongiwe Mlotshwa's daughter was the first New Year's Day baby in the province, arriving exactly on the stroke of midnight, at Eshowe Hospital. At Addington Hospital, 24 year-old Sindisiwe Gumede gave birth to a set of boy twins. The two youngest mothers of New Year's Day babies are aged 16, and gave birth at Ekhombe and Edendale Hospitals. There are also three mothers aged 18 who gave birth at Rietvlei, St Apollinaris, and Emmaus hospitals; and another three aged 19, whose babies were born at Nkandla, St Apollinaris and Edendale hospitals. The oldest mother of the New Year’s Day babies in the province is aged 43, and gave birth at Edendale Hospital.
