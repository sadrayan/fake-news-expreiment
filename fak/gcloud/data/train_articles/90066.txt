Dallas Burtraw is one of the nation’s foremost experts on environmental regulation in the electricity sector. For two decades, he has worked on creating a more efficient and politically rational method for controlling air pollution. He also studies electricity restructuring, competition, and economic deregulation. He is particularly interested in incentive-based approaches for environmental regulation, the most notable of which is a tradable permit system, and recently has studied ways to introduce greater cost-effectiveness into regulation under the Clean Air Act.



Burtraw’s current areas of research include analysis of the distributional and regional consequences of various approaches to national climate policy. He also has conducted analysis and provided technical support in the design of carbon dioxide emissions trading programs in the Northeast states, California, and the European Union. Burtraw and his colleagues recently completed a major project on estimating beneﬁts of the value of natural resources in the Adirondack Park through surveying area residents on their willingness to pay for improvements. Also with colleagues, he studied the cost-effectiveness of various policies for promoting renewable energy.



Burtraw recently served on the National Academy of Sciences Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology and on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Advisory Council on Clean Air Compliance Analysis. He also served on California’s Economic and Allocation Advisory Committee advising the governor’s office and the Air Resources Board on implementation of the state’s climate law.
