JOHANNESBURG - The process of relocating foreign nationals displaced from Chartsworth, Durban by xenophobic violence, has been stalled.

This comes after Hope Farm, in Cato Ridge took in more than one hundred foreigners who were forcibly removed from a camp earlier in the year.

Hope Farm owner Andrew Wartnaby said, "They were supposed to be here for two months, maybe three months, and we were hoping for a solution. And it's now gone on 5 maybe 6 months. People are very frustrated and we, we have basically explored every single avenue there is in terms of a solution.”

The situation took a turn for the worse two months ago, when the group was informed that each family must make individual applications to the United Nations for relocation.

Fifty Five members accepted the terms, but the remaining 85 refused saying they wanted to be moved as a group. Since then, tensions between the two sides have risen.

Wartnaby claims that on Tuesday the opposing group refused any food or water that was provided and the next morning, he had to call police to disperse the group which was protesting outside his home.

Later that day, the electric fence around his property was cut and Wartnaby later discovered that the main tent had been torched.

Lawyers from Access to Justice say the Social Development Department, SAPS and the SA Council of Churches are now attempting to bring about resolution.
