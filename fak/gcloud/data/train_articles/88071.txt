Kenney organizational chart contrasts with Nutter's
The Kenney administration released its organizational chart Wednesday, showing a stark difference from Mayor Michael Nutter's government structure.

Mayor Kenney went for a strong managing director form of government, naming Michael DiBerardinis to oversee 24 offices and departments, including the city's largest departments, such as police, fire, and streets. Nutter's managing director, Rich Negrin, had only eight offices under him and they did not include the major departments.

DiBerardinis, who worked under Nutter as deputy mayor for environmental and community resources, said Kenney's structure was "smart, thoughtful," and provided the "ability to coordinate and work with other elements of government."

Another difference is in the oversight of the chief of staff. Nutter's top deputies all reported to chief of staff Everett Gillison, who also served as deputy mayor for public safety.

In Kenney's structure, chief of staff Jane Slusser has oversight of the executive office staff and the communications and digital directors and their teams.

Kenney also created some offices and titles. Some of the new positions include deputy mayor for intergovernmental affairs, chief diversity and inclusion officer, and chief administrative officer.

In Kenney's administration, 16 people report directly to him, with a combined payroll of $2.6 million.

In comparison, Nutter had 11 people reporting directly to him with an overall payroll expense of $1.9 million. "The organization of our administration mirrors closely the model laid out in the City Charter, and we've seen already that this realignment has led to a more efficient, effective delivery of services to Philadelphians," Kenney said in a statement.
