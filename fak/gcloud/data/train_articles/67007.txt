DNC walks back claim Rubio supports ‘internment’ camps for Muslims
“Marco Rubio, after the Paris attacks, said, you know, it’s not only that we should be considering internment, he actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather, and in fact compared them to the Nazi party,” Wasserman Schultz said on CNN on Wednesday.

“Given the volume of extreme rhetoric coming from the Republican candidates, there’s a lot to keep track of,” DNC communications director Luis Miranda said in a statement to The Hill.

“The Chair was clearly referring to when Mr. Rubio embraced Mr. Trump’s proposal to close Mosques by ‎ arguing that we should go further to diners and cafes where Muslims might gather.”

The other allegations Wasserman Schultz made against Rubio stem from his claim that domestic terrorist operations should be combated “any place where radicals are being inspired.”

“It’s not about closing down mosques,” Rubio said in an interview with Fox News last month. “It’s about closing down any place — whether it’s a café, diner, an Internet site — any place where radicals are being inspired.”

“So whatever facility is being used — it’s not just a mosque — any facility that’s being used to radicalize and inspire attacks against the United States, should be a place that we look at,” he added.

Rubio also made an analogy involving Nazis when he rebuked Democratic primary front-runner Hillary Clinton last month for her reluctance to say America is at war with radical Islam.
