Obscure Legal Doctrine May Erase Guilty Verdict for Ex-Legislator Who Died
In the eyes of federal prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the late Thomas W. Libous, long one of Albanyâ€™s most powerful lawmakers, got away with a lot, in part because time was on his side.

While Mr. Libous was convicted last year of lying to F.B.I. agents and expelled from the State Senate, prosecutors have said that the statute of limitations barred them from charging him with the more serious crimes that were the subject of his lies: crimes like bribery and fraud.

Now, more than a year after his conviction, and some three months after his death from prostate cancer at 63, it might be said that time is again on his side. And it appears likely to help him, in the eyes of the federal authorities, get away with more, including the crime for which he was already convicted, despite his death.
