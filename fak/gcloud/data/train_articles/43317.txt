Stocks close sharply lower as Dow tumbles 600 points in wake of oil-market woes
Stocks closed sharply lower Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 600 points as crude oil prices extended their retreat while a firmer U.S. dollar also sparked worries about the competitiveness of U.S. corporations in an increasingly challenging economic environment.

Trading, however, was relatively active, as gauged by the number of shares changing hands, despite Veterans Day. The only major market to close in commemoration was the bond market.

How did the benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% dropped 602.12 points, or 2.3%, to 25,387.18, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.46% fell 54.79 points, or 2%, to 2,726.22, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.59% declined 206.03 points, or 2.8%, to 7,200.87.

Preliminary trading volume hit 6.7 billion shares, slightly off from the year-to-date average of 6.9 billion shares, according to the Dow Jones Data Group.

What drove the market?

Representatives from Saudi Arabia over the weekend said that the kingdom would cut its oil production, while the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries weighs a more sweeping reduction of output by members of the oil cartel.

West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery US:CLZ8 has fallen for 11 sessions in row, finishing Monday below $60 a barrel for the first time since February.

A shock drop in oil prices has raised questions among investors about the health of the global market and investors will closely watch talk of cuts to crude production that could stabilize moves in the commodity, which entered a bear market, defined as a drop of at least 20% from a recent peak, last week.

Worries about oil’s effect on the market come as investors continued to fret about China and U.S. trade tensions, with President Donald Trump set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later in November at the sidelines of the G-20 summit to discuss resolving their trade disagreements.

A rising dollar is also weighing on markets, as a rise in the greenback can hurt sales of multinational companies, making goods relatively more expensive to customers purchasing abroad.

What were strategists saying?

Michael Schoonover, portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds told MarketWatch that recent market declines suggest the partial deflation of a “passive investing bubble,” in which stock prices have been driven irrationally higher by a growing share of money invested in passive index funds and exchange-traded funds. ”We’ve seen generally low volume of late, which suggests that institutional money isn’t driving the market,” he said.

Because many passive index funds are weighted by market capitalization, massive companies like Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have been responsible for much of the market’s gains in 2018, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that leads to higher and higher valuations for the companies dominating the S&P 500, according to Schoonover. “Now we are seeing the inevitable repricing of stocks that were artificially boosted by flows into passive, low-fee products,” he said.

Craig Callahan, president and founder of Icon Advisors, said oil’s bear market has weighed heavily on the market in general, and energy exploration firms in particular, creating buying opportunities for value investors. “I’m considering adding to my holdings in the energy sector,” Callahan told MarketWatch.

“These firms have hedged the price of oil, and projections for 2019 [earnings-per-share] growth are 25% for the sector,” compared with just 9% for the S&P 500, Callahan said.
