Braxton spent four days in a Los Angeles hospital following the health scare, which People reports was a result of complications from lupus.

During her hospital stay, the singer was rumored to be in serious condition; TMZ reported that her boyfriend, Bryan "Birdman" Williams, rushed to her side. However, Braxton's rep denied the severity of those reports.



"She was in an LA hospital for a few days being treated for her Lupus," Braxton's rep said. "She has been released and starts rehearsals for her upcoming tour this week. She was not in serious condition, though Lupus is a serious disease and must be monitored at all times."

Braxton first revealed in a 2010 interview that she was suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease. The 48-year-old singer was also hospitalized in 2012 following a bout with the disease. In Braxton's 2014 memoir Unbreak My Heart: A Memoir, she wrote at length about her lupus diagnosis, adding that her uncle had died from the disease.

"Some days I can't balance it all. I just have to lay in bed," Braxton said of her lupus struggle in a 2015 interview. "Pretty much when you have lupus you feel like you have the flu every day. But some days you get through it. But for me, if I'm not feeling well, I tend to tell my kids, 'Oh mommy's just going to relax in bed today.' I kind of take it easy."
