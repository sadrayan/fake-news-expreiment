In 2012, Texas workers paid at or below the current Federal minimum wage accounted for 12.7% of the nation’s minimum wage workers (452,000 of the national total of 3,550,000). Another way of stating that is that in Texas, 7.5% of all hourly-paid workers were paid at or below the Federal minimum wage. The 2012 data for minimum wage workers are located at www.bls.gov/ro6/fax/minwage_tx.htm and www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2012.htm. However, the Bureau only publishes ‘share’ data for hourly-paid workers. We do not produce detailed state wage data for non-hourly employed persons which would include salaried, self-employed, and piece rate workers. In 2012, hourly-paid workers accounted for 59.0% of all wage and salary workers nationwide and 57.2% of Texas wage and salary workers; there were 75,276,000 workers paid hourly rates in the U.S. and 6,060,000 in Texas.

To arrive at the statement ‘95% of all the wages in Texas are above minimum wage,’ someone probably divided the 452,000 figure for Texas minimum wage workers by one of the Texas total employment figure (total CPS household employment, 11,809,000; total CPS wage and salary employment, 10,590,000; or total CES establishment employment 10,879,8000). However, again, BLS only produces detailed wage data for hourly-paid workers.

Regarding the labor force and employment numbers, in 2012, using data from the Current Population Survey (the household survey which produces the national unemployment rate), the U.S. labor force stood at 154,975,000 and Texas stood at 12,653,000. This means that Texas accounted for 8.2% of the U.S. labor force. Total CPS employment in the U.S. was 142,469,000 in 2012 and in Texas, it was 11,809,000; Texas accounted for 8.3% of U.S. CPS (household) employment.

Can you point me to the source for the 10,879,800 figure? Is it for 2012?

Thanks.

Go to the State and Area Employment, Hours, and Earnings database at http://data.bls.gov/pdq/querytool.jsp?survey=sm. You want Texas, statewide, total nonfarm, total nonfarm, all employees, not seasonally adjusted. Retrieve. The 2012 annual average will show 10,879.8 (in thousands).
