Email, Catherine Frazier, senior communications adviser, Ted Cruz campaign, Oct. 18, 2018

Cruz has worked on substantial and important bipartisan legislation, from working to combat sexual assault with Kirsten Gillibrand, to reauthorizing NASA with Bill Nelson, to championing civil rights with Doug Jones, to condemning the use of human shields with Joe Donnelly, just to name a few. He's worked with Democrats often to advance common causes to the benefit of Texans an all Americans, and will continue to.
