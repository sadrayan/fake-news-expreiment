DNC Chair Says Unemployment Is Not Increasing Under Obama
DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said this morning on Fox News that unemployment has not been increasing under President Obama:

I guess it depends on your definition of "increasing," but here are the facts. When Obama took office, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployment is now at 8.6 percent. Nearly two million jobs have been lost under Obama.
