Dan McCready For Congress
Message From Dan

When I think of what I love about this country, I think of my platoon. We had folks from all over. But it didn’t matter where we came from, or who our parents were, or what color our skin was. It didn’t even matter whether we were Republicans or Democrats. Because we all wore the same uniform.

I’m a Marine Corps veteran, a small business owner, and a father of four. I was perfectly happy last year to spend time with my kids and continue building my small business, but I feel called now to fight back for North Carolina families that Washington politicians are leaving behind.

Too many politicians show up to Washington with good intentions, but then they forget who sent them there. They only fight for themselves and the special interests. I believe that any person who works hard and plays by the rules should be able to build a better life for their kids. I hope you’ll join this campaign to put country over party and turn our country around.

Yours in this fight,
