Important notice about the future of ShootingTracker.com

Over the past three years both ShootingTracker.com and Gun Violence Archive have had a singular mission of providing unbiased, raw statistics, all with verified sourcing to inform society of the number of Mass Shootings that occur in the United States each year, no matter the cause or intent of the toll of victims. To that end, both ShootingTracker.com and Gun Violence Archive have put considerable effort to insure accurate, timely information.

On December 5, 2015 the principals of ShootingTracker.com and Gun Violence Archive came to an agreement to consolidate our resources at Gun Violence Archive's established website in order to best serve the publicâ€™s right and need to know the extent of gun violence in this country. Going forward, interested parties from academia, journalism, and advocacy groups will be able to go to www.gunviolencearchive.org for both mass shooting information or all other types of gun violence statistics, collected in near real time nationally and providing only verifiable, sourced incident reports.

Gun Violence Archive would like to acknowledge the work that Brock Weller at ShootingTracker.com has done and congratulate him on achieving his goals of raising awareness of gun violence.
