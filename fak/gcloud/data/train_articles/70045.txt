SB 1070 immigration law update: Activists want new law to curb racial profiling
PHOENIX - A judge dismissed the final challenge to Arizona's controversial SB 1070 immigration law. But, opponents aren't backing down.

Activists with Somos Independents say they want new state legislation that requires law enforcement to document the race of everyone they stop, regardless of whether a citation is issued.

On Friday, a U.S. District Court Judge upheld SB 1070's requirement that police can question the immigration status of those suspected of being in the country illegally.

She said opponents did not produce any evidence that Arizona Officers and Deputies enforce SB 1070 differently for Latinos compared to people of other race or ethnicities. But, activists say a database of traffic stops will prove racial profiling is a problem in our state.

"It will expose patterns of law enforcement officers that we are concerned about, that have a history of complaints against them and it should curb racial profiling," says DeeDee Garcia Blase with Somos Independents.

Blase says their organization is working with State Senator Catherine Miranda, who's currently drafting the legislation.
