Summit pushes for action from social conservatives
Hundreds of evangelical Christians and social conservatives gathered at Stephens Auditorium on Saturday to promote their agenda Saturday for the Family Leadership Summit, organized by The Family Leader.

Hundreds of evangelical Christians and social conservatives gathered at Stephens Auditorium on Saturday to promote their agenda Saturday for the Family Leadership Summit, organized by The Family Leader.

The day-long event covered topics from family values and marriage to the economy and foreign policy, and featured several high-profile, big name conservatives, including business magnate and television personality Donald Trump, who headlined the event.

He predicted Hillary Clinton will be the 2016 Democratic nominee for president, and hit on many other topics, including the climate of U.S. business and immigration.

He, like many speakers, opposed amnesty for immigrants, which is what the Democrats in office want, he said. It makes immigrants sway to the Democrats and would be a big blow to the Republican Party.

�They�re just going to be voting Democratic. That�s just the way it is,� said Trump, the final speaker of the summit, which was also sponsored by the National Organization for Marriage, Citizens United and the Alliance for Defending Freedom, all of whom support socially conservative Republican candidates and policies.

�Do what is right, but be very careful because it could be a death wish for the Republican Party,� Trump said.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a born-again Christian, said the way to change Washington and see action is through a grassroots effort.

The freshman senator, who is considered by some to be a possible 2016 presidential candidate, said the political climate in Washington is not working for American citizens.

He, like many others who spoke, blasted the IRS and NSA spying policies, and showed support for the Second Amendment, banning late-term abortions and border security.

He passionately argued against the Affordable Health Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.

�The wheels are coming off this,� he said.

When Congress has the opportunity to �de-fund� the federal health care law, it will be �the most important fight this Congress will face,� he said.

When Cruz said he wants to repeal �every single piece� of the Act, it received one of the loudest cheers of the day.

His father, Rafael, who spoke beforehand, got rousing applause amid his warning against an increasing socialist environment.

The elder Cruz, who emigrated from Cuba during the communist revolution there, saw what Fidel Castro�s policies did to the country years later.

�Recent movements in some states and by the Supreme Court advancing gay rights and allowing same-sex marriage is part of a plot to undermine the traditional family structure and eliminate religion, clearing the way for a socialist state in which government is worshipped as a god,� he said.

�Socialism requires that government becomes your god. That�s why they have to destroy the concept of God. They have to destroy all loyalties except your loyalty to government. That�s what�s behind homosexual marriage.�

Rick Santorum, a former Republican presidential candidate who narrowly won the Iowa Caucus in 2012, said the Republican Party was in need of an overhaul.

He said Republicans have �marginalized� working-class voters, and therefore made them turn to the Democratic Party.

�We need to reject this idea that if we just build the economy, all boats will rise and everybody will be fine,� Santorum said. �I don�t know about you, but most people I know have holes in their boats and when that tide rises sometimes they don�t rise. Sometimes they sink.�

A handful of Iowa politicians also made an appearance.

U.S. Rep. Steve King said it was time for Christians and leaders of faith-based non-profits to defy the IRS when they are asked about their religious beliefs.

He also asserted his belief that the country was founded by the hands of God.

�I believe that our founding fathers were moved around on this continent by God like men on a chess board,� King said.

�Not perhaps all that they did was by divine inspiration, but much of what they did was by divine guidance including the Declaration, the foundation for our Constitution, within which with you see listed many of the pillars of American exceptionalism.�

In the morning, more than 20 people stood outside Stephens Auditorium, holding protest signs against the socially conservative values of the day-long event.

In the evening, the Ames Community Picnic Against Hate was held at Brookside Park. It was organized as a counter to summit and to raise funds for One Iowa, a grassroots organization lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organization that seeks to educate the public on LGBT issues.

It also was one of the many organizations that had a booth at the event.

�There was a lot of dialogue that left me wondering, said Donna Red Wing, director of One Iowa who attended the summit. �There was a lot of talk about inclusion, justice and working hard toward a better America, but I wonder if those who aren�t social conservatives have a place in it, such as LGBT members, Jews, Muslims, liberal Christians.�

Red Wing said she and the organization was there because they wanted to learn about other viewpoints and have a dialogue.
