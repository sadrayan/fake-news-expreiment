Syria Regional Refugee Response
Markets play a central role in the lives of refugees. Markets provide refugees with the goods and services needed for survival in the short-term, and influence their ability to thrive in the long-term. The moment Syrian refugees arrived in Jordan, they entered the market as both consumers and sellers. Markets are also at the core of cash-based interventions. Cash-based assistance seeks to meet non-camp based refugeesâ€™ basic needs by enabling them to access local markets, while at the same time supporting the local economy. A well-functioning and expandable market is an integral part of the success of any cash-based assistance. UNHCR and the Norwegian Refugee Council, in coordination with the Basic Needs and Shelter Working groups, embarked on this Market Assessment to better understand how the Jordanian market functions and how the market has responded in the past five years to the Syrian refugee crisis. The Assessment specifically focused on the retail and shelter sectors. This second Market Assessment comes five years after the initial UNHCR Market Assessment and six years after the first cash assistance was provided to Syrian refugees.4 With the number of Syrian refugees entering Jordan stabilized, it is time to reassess market conditions and the continued appropriateness of cash-based interventions.
