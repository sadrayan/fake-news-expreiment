Target through the years
1902

our founder George Draper Dayton

In 1881, native New Yorker George D. Dayton decides to explore the growing Midwest markets. After several years in banking and real estate, Dayton decides Minneapolis offers the strongest opportunities for growth. He purchases land on Nicollet Avenue and forms the Dayton Dry Goods Companyâ€“today, known as Target Corporation.

Dayton's personal principles shapes the new store, including his belief in the "the higher ground of stewardship." His store soon becomes known for dependable merchandise, fair business practices and a generous spirit of giving. As President, he remains active in the store's management until his death in 1938. His son and grandsons take over leadership and begin to grow the Dayton Company into a nationwide retailer.
