Ohio Food Assistance Program
You may qualify for benefits if your household's gross monthly income is at or under 130 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines. Some households may qualify if they have income over the limit if someone in the household is elderly or disabled. If your household's income is under the limit, or if the limit does not apply, we then review your household expenses to determine your monthly benefit amount. The expenses we review include such things as rent or mortgage costs, gas, electric, water, sewer, phone, medical expenses, and payments for child support and child care. In determining whether you qualify, we will also look at the number of people in your household who purchase and prepare food together. In special situations, resources such as cash, savings and stocks also are considered when determining whether a person is eligible.

In order to qualify, you must have an annual household income (before taxes) that is below the following amounts: Household Size* Maximum Income Level (Per Year) 1 $15,782 2 $21,398 3 $27,014 4 $32,630 5 $38,246 6 $43,862 7 $49,478 8 $55,094
