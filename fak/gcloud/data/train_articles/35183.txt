Pelosi Statement on November Jobs Report

Washington, D.C. — Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued this statement after the Labor Department announced that the economy created 228,000 jobs in November, with little change in wage growth:

“November’s jobs report reveals that hard-working Americans still aren’t getting the bigger paychecks they deserve. Even with full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have still failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families.

“Instead of creating good-paying jobs or raising wages, Republicans are spending December putting the finishing touches on their devastating GOP tax scam, which would raise taxes on tens of millions of middle class families, just to give massive breaks to their billionaire and corporate friends. Under this cruel scheme, Americans will see their health insurance premiums explode, their jobs shipped overseas, and their children and grandchildren crushed by trillions in debt.

“The American people deserve far better than the raw deal that Republicans are forcing on them. That’s why Democrats are offering A Better Deal, with Better Jobs, Better Wages and a Better Future. We will hold Republicans accountable for their disastrous assault on middle class families and will fight the GOP tax scam to hand multi-trillion dollar tax giveaways to their wealthy friends at the expense of hard-working families.”
