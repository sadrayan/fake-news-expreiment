Senate Candidate Jamie Radtke’s Response to Media Inquiries Regarding Reports that Senator Allen will Announce his Candidacy this Week

Proposes Town Halls: “It is important and healthy that the Republican Party has this debate.”

“I am asking Senator Allen to join me in giving Virginia a new kind of Republican primary – rather than the same old politics as usual – with a series of monthly public Town Hall Forums across Virginia from now until the election. In these public Town Hall Forums, we will openly and forthrightly discuss the serious problems facing America.

“For example, during Senator Allen’s six years in office, he voted for budgets adding $3.1 trillion to our national debt – that’s $16,400 for every second Senator Allen was in office. I disagree with his approach, and I believe it is important and healthy that the Republican Party has this debate.”
