Sexual abuse question part of high school math homework
A Pennsylvania school district apologized for a math homework assignment with a question that involved trying to figure out which family member sexually assaulted a young girl.

The inappropriate problem had students solve for “x,” and then presented the following scenario: “Angelou was sexually abused by her mother’s [blank] at age 8, which shaped her career choices and motivation for writing.”

The question’s multiple choice answers included boyfriend, brother and father — each of which were also paired with a potential answer to the math equation.

The question was part of a lesson at Pennridge High School on Maya Angelou's autobiography "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," Doylestown Patch reported.

Following backlash from concerned parents, Pennridge School District Superintendent Dr. Jacqueline Rattigan apologized for the assignment, which she said “contained adult content without proper context.”

“The homework worksheet in question was downloaded from a website that allows teachers around the world to share educational resources,” Rattigan said in a statement obtained by NBC10. “It is not part of our approved curriculum.”

Rattigan added the district has taken steps to ensure nothing similar ever happens again.
