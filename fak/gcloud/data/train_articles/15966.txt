Subject: Urgent request for comment, Texas fact check

Hello on behalf of the PolitiFact Texas fact-checking project.

I write because we are checking U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s recent repeated references to El Paso as the safest city in Texas and the nation. An aide to O’Rourke, John Mezas, has told us O’Rourke based his judgment on news stories recapping the latest CQ Press lists of cities; we found this chart:

We’ve previously written a couple of times about public figures citing CQ Press lists to characterize El Paso – here and here. You’ll see too that Marina Ilishaev of CQ Press urged us to be cautious in using the CQ Press lists.

I write now to get your on-the-record assessment of the accuracy of O’Rourke’s statements. I am hoping to complete our review by midday Monday.

THANKS,

g.
