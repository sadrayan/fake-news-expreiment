Presidential Job Approval Center
Presidential job approval is a simple, yet powerful, measure of the public's view of the U.S. president's job performance at a particular point in time.

The approval ratings reported here are based on periodic multiday Gallup polls for Presidents Harry Truman through George W. Bush; weekly Gallup Daily tracking averages for President Barack Obama; weekly Gallup Daily tracking averages for President Donald Trump in 2017 and 2018; and periodic multiday Gallup polls for Trump starting in 2019.
