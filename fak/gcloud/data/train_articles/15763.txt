Emails, Bryan Black, spokesperson, Todd Staples campaign, Jan. 29, 2014

Todd Staples has known Bob Bullock, Bill Ratliff, Rick Perry and David Dewhurst. David Dewhurst is the only one of the four who has utilized a full-time taxpayer funded security detail. We have personally observed this detail arriving at campaign events and private meetings early to sweep rooms picking up Dewhurst and taking him to and from the Capitol. They were also at the debate on Monday night when Commissioner Staples referenced them.

Below are new articles documenting the security detail. Thank you and have a great day.

Bryan

Would Staples refuse the detail if DPS assigned it?

Todd Staples would absolutely refuse the taxpayer supported security detail, he keeps his protection in his boot.
