Conservative Review - Rubio's Bill Would Have Opened Floodgates to Islamic Refugees
...this bill would have created endless avenues for this president to bring in an unlimited numbers of Islamic immigrants from the most volatile corners of the world.

Section 3401 of the bill also dramatically weakened the precautions against fraudulent asylum petitions by, among other things, eliminating the time constraints on filing those applications.

In totality, this bill would have created endless avenues for this president to bring in an unlimited numbers of Islamic immigrants from the most volatile corners of the world.

Step back and ponder this thought for a moment: had Rubio gotten his away – had Sessions and Cruz and other conservatives followed his lead – Obama would have had an unlimited pipeline at his disposal to bring in the worst security risks among the entire Islamic world. Yet, Rubio touts himself as the paragon of national security because of his alacritous desire to support every Islamic insurgency in the Middle East.

While much of the conservative media is promoting the notion that Rubio has changed his position on immigration, the reality is that to this very day he believes the Gang bill was good legislation. According to the Washington Post, Rubio said late last week that “the bill had the correct security components but was waylaid by voter mistrust." In other words, the bill was near-perfect, it’s just that the plebes weren’t smart enough to understand its virtues. Accordingly, Rubio’s current position is that the Gang of 8 was prudent legislation.

Republicans would never nominate someone who openly promoted Obamacare, abortion, raising taxes, or increasing regulations. How can they possibly nominate someone who is on the wrong side of the most existential threat of our time and who – to this very day – defends a bill that would have saddled America with what we are seeing in Germany and France today?
