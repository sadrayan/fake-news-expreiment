US embassy guard killed in Nepal
Unidentified gunmen have shot dead a Nepali security guard from the United States embassy in the capital, Kathmandu.

The man, Ramesh Manandhar, died following an attack at close range near the compound of the US Agency for International Development, which is about five kilometers from the embassy.

Police said the motive for the killing was not known, but that they have started an investigation. A state of emergency has been in force in the country since last month after Maoist insurgents intensified attacks on police and army posts across the country.
