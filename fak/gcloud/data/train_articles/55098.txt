Steve Harvey Talks Donald Trump & The Importance Of Voting
Voting registration season is upon us. With the November 6th elections right around the corner, the goal to get to the polls can't be urged enough. It doesn't matter what race, creed or religion you are, it's quite obvious that there are injustices taking place within our country.

If for any reason you are "feeling...disenfranchised...feeling like you have been hoodwinked," by the actions of 45 then Steve Harvey wants you to get out there and register to vote. It's not a game. Lives are being affected left and right. Now you can sit and watch all you want, but change isn't going to come unless you get out there and make change happen.

Take a listen as Unc talks about the adversities that are taking place within our country and around the world and why he feels Donald Trump is "one of the most immoral presidents weâ€™ve ever had in [his] lifetime."
