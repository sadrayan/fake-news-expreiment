I am specifically interested in the accuracy of the Houston-specific information presented in Study 1 in the report.

You’re correct, it appears the study authors pulled that $485M figure from our website which refers to the economic impact of conventions. Revenue usually means a single entity profits. Economic impact is the residual effect of these conventions on our local economy—and by the way these are just conventions that we as an entity book.

We do not have a figure for the total economic impact of all conventions on an annual basis. What we do have are figures from the state that show travel spending in the Houston MSA totaled $17.2 billion in 2014 (Dean Runyan and Associates). You can see the graphic I’ve attached for additional details.

Hope this helps clarify.
