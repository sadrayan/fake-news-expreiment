The House has voted 54 times in four years on Obamacare. Here’s the full list.
Sunday marks the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, however you prefer to describe it. (But Nancy Pelosi clearly prefers the former.)

While Democrats are struggling with whether to embrace the law or push for changes, Republicans are reminding voters that since they took control of the House in 2011, they've voted 54 times to undo, revamp or tweak the law. Here's a full list of those votes, as provided by GOP aides. Dates with an asterisk denote a bill that also passed the Senate and was signed by President Obama:

UPDATE/RELATED: While the House has voted 54 times to make changes to the law0, the Obama administration also has instituted a series of delays and other changes to the way the law works in practice. Many of the changes have upset lawmakers, who believe that Congress -- not the administration acting on its own -- should be codifying changes in legislation. Review this timeline of the major changes, as compiled by The Post's senior health-care reporter, Amy Goldstein.
